<connor> - Every time I have a Kit
Kat, it's usually like, </connor>
<connor> it's usually in like, you know,
like two Kit Kats together, </connor>
<garnt> right?
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> And you split it, and you eat it one at- </garnt>
<joey> - No, I literally just grab, and just- </joey>
<joey> (snack crunching) </joey>
<garnt> Do this.
- Don't be, (sighs) </garnt>
<connor> oh God.
(baby crying) </connor>
<connor> (relaxed music) </connor>
<garnt> Hello, and welcome to another
episode of "Trash Taste". </garnt>
<garnt> I am boy, and with me today are boys. </garnt>
<garnt> - Hello, it's me.
(man laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - The usual.
- Yay. </garnt>
<joey> - How are you doing boys?
- I'm doing well, boy. </joey>
<joey> I am tired.
- We're not doing this, </joey>
<joey> are we?
(Gigguk laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Lad. </joey>
<garnt> - I'm doing fine.
- You're doing fine? </garnt>
<joey> - I'm tired as all hell. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, you've just
been building a fuck ton </garnt>
<joey> of furniture, haven't you?
- I've just been </joey>
<joey> building furniture for the past week. </joey>
<garnt> - You've just been going
through the entire Ikea catalog, </garnt>
<joey> and just been building that-
- Yeah, pretty much. </joey>
<garnt> It's like never, it's just like... </garnt>
<garnt> Am I in a respawn point
for Ikea furniture? </garnt>
<connor> Because every time I build one, </connor>
<joey> another one just respawns the next day. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "cool". </joey>
<connor> - What's been the most satisfying build? </connor>
<connor> Wait, what is the most
annoying furniture to build </connor>
<connor> in general?
- Ikea. </connor>
<joey> Anything from Ikea.
- Sometimes it's good, though. </joey>
<connor> Well okay, what's the item
that is always most annoying? </connor>
<connor> I have my own thoughts on this. </connor>
<joey> I've already decided.
- I don't know. </joey>
<joey> Maybe, I mean I've built
desks, shelves, chairs, tables. </joey>
<garnt> - I've built everything. (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - You name it, I've built it. (laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - You name it-
- Well, </connor>
<connor> what was your answer, Connor? </connor>
<garnt> Since you seem to-
- All right, listen. </garnt>
<garnt> Okay, so-
- Shit. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh shit.
- It's okay. </connor>
<connor> It's a little spill. </connor>
<connor> Beds can be annoying, right? </connor>
<connor> Beds can be quite frustrating. </connor>
<connor> If you get the really
cheap beds, beds are shit. </connor>
<connor> They're either like a 2x2 Rubik's Cube, </connor>
<connor> or a 64x64 Gauntlet Cube. </connor>
<joey> - You know what you need
to get, what we got? </joey>
<joey> A Koala bed. </joey>
<joey> - Is it a shout out, Joey? </joey>
<garnt> - Are you being sponsored
by Koala Beds right now? </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no.
- Oh yeah, </garnt>
<connor> because I will say, I did
sleep on Chris's couch- </connor>
<garnt> - Actually, can we get some
tissue please? (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yeah, yeah, can we wipe this off? </garnt>
<joey> - All right.
- Because Chris has like- </joey>
<joey> - A couch.
- A sofa bed, right? </joey>
<joey> - I think, by them. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, and I was like, "Chris's
sofa is nicer than my bed". </joey>
<garnt> (Joey giggles) </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, because I remember
when we just moved here, </garnt>
<joey> I just bought whatever
was the cheapest option </joey>
<joey> on Amazon.
- Biggest mistake. (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - And now I regret it,
because at that time, </joey>
<joey> it's like, whenever you
move into a new place, </joey>
<connor> the most difficult part is just, </connor>
<connor> the amount of upfront money you put down. </connor>
<connor> You look at your bank
account, and you're just like. </connor>
<connor> (sighs) Oh, that's a really low number. </connor>
<garnt> And that's a really big
number I'm giving away, </garnt>
<garnt> all at once, right? </garnt>
<connor> - Like, do I really need a microwave? </connor>
<joey> I'm sure I can just slap
my chicken hot, you know. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, just rub
it across the ground. </joey>
<connor> Friction will warm it up.
- It's whatever. </connor>
<connor> Like, I'll survive. </connor>
<connor> And I'm finally getting
rid of my laundry machine, </connor>
<joey> my washing machine.
- Yeah, we're getting rid </joey>
<joey> of ours as well.
- I got rid of </joey>
<garnt> my cockroach infested one.
- (laughs) Oh yeah, that one. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh, you still have that one? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I still have that one. </joey>
<garnt> - Okay. (laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - He cleaned it up though,
he cleaned it up, right? </connor>
<joey> - I did clean it up. </joey>
<connor> But you know, I mean, I don't
know what's been in there. </connor>
<connor> So it is nice to get rid
of it, get a new one. </connor>
<joey> - Get something nice. </joey>
<joey> You can afford it.
- I'm taking the old one </joey>
<joey> from this studio. (laughs)
- Are you? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah! (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Wait, what?
- Are you actually? (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, because we have to get rid of it. </joey>
<connor> And I was like, "Well I'll take it". </connor>
<connor> Because it's better than the one I have. </connor>
<joey> - Wait, are you actually taking ours? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - This is the first I'm hearing about it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Well, wait, </joey>
<connor> what did you think was
gonna happen with it? </connor>
<connor> - I thought we were just
gonna get rid of it. </connor>
<joey> - I was gonna get rid of it. </joey>
<connor> - No, why would you do that? </connor>
<connor> I'll just take it.
- Well, no. </connor>
<connor> Because if you go to like,
Big Camera or Yodobashi, </connor>
<connor> and if you buy a fridge from there, </connor>
<garnt> they have a free service where
if you have a fridge already, </garnt>
<garnt> they'll get rid of the old one for you. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah but-
- So I was just </joey>
<joey> gonna utilize that. </joey>
<joey> - What? </joey>
<joey> - To get rid of my fridge. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, have you, so why do
you still have your old fridge? </garnt>
<connor> I thought you bought a new one? </connor>
<connor> - No, no, no, no, my washing
machine, washing machine. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, washing machine.
- Oh, washing machine. </connor>
<joey> - Okay, okay, okay, if you
buy a new fridge on Amazon, </joey>
<garnt> there's a service-
- That's what I did. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, they'll take the old one away. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah-
- You can do that </connor>
<garnt> with your fridge as well.
- It's not my fridge. </garnt>
<joey> - Wait, wait-
- How did it take you </joey>
<connor> so god damn long to get some tissues? </connor>
<connor> (men laughing) </connor>
<joey> Why'd it take two of you? (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - (laughing) We literally asked
for this five minutes ago. </joey>
<joey> - I just saw a SWAT team sting operation. </joey>
<joey> - I just watched a SWAT (laughs)- </joey>
<joey> - What a chaotic start-
- I just saw Ashley </joey>
<garnt> come in, doing like the John
Travolta, like, huh? (laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - We have two staff,
and it took both of them </connor>
<connor> five minutes to get some
tissues in the other room. </connor>
<joey> - Wait, wait, wait, hold
on, hold on, can we go back- </joey>
<connor> - We got very confused-
- Can we go back </connor>
<joey> to the whole fridge thing? </joey>
<joey> So wait-
- I got rid of my fridge, </joey>
<joey> by doing that service
where I bought a new one, </joey>
<connor> and I asked them to get rid of it. </connor>
<connor> But-
- Wait. </connor>
<joey> But did you say you were
gonna take our fridge? </joey>
<connor> - No, I'm taking our washing machine. </connor>
<joey> - Oh yeah.
- Oh, washing machine. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, okay so-
- Oh, I thought you </joey>
<joey> were gonna take my fridge from my house- </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing)
- No. (laughs) </joey>
<joey> How would I do that, Joey? </joey>
<joey> - And I'm like, "When did we decide this?" </joey>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Explain to me the logistics. </connor>
<joey> Think Joey! (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - I was like, "Did this
man really just be like, </joey>
<joey> 'So yeah, I'm taking your fridge. </joey>
<joey> I decided, I'm taking your fridge'". </joey>
<connor> - I'm taking a page out
of my ancestors' books, </connor>
<connor> and just taking things
from other people's houses. </connor>
<garnt> - I thought you were taking
the fridge from the studio. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no, no, no, no. </garnt>
<connor> I already have a, you guys
know I have a new fridge! </connor>
<joey> - I know you, that's why
I was so fucking confused- </joey>
<joey> - Why would I get a new fridge? </joey>
<joey> - You have to be specific. </joey>
<connor> - What the fuck? </connor>
<connor> I literally just got this fridge! </connor>
<joey> It's a great fridge, great
color, great everything, </joey>
<connor> ergonomics, fantastic. </connor>
<connor> - Because I, this is the
first time I'm hearing </connor>
<connor> about you getting a new fridge. </connor>
<connor> So that's why-
- Oh no. </connor>
<joey> I'm not getting a new fridge. </joey>
<joey> - Oh my God.
- I already have </joey>
<connor> a new fridge, I'm, so-
- When did you buy the fridge? </connor>
<joey> - Like four months ago! (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Wait-
- You've been to my house! </joey>
<garnt> - The cockroach one?
- You've seen it. </garnt>
<connor> Yeah, but I also, okay remember- </connor>
<garnt> - You just said you, I swear to God, </garnt>
<connor> literally five minutes ago, you just said, </connor>
<garnt> "I still got the cockroach fridge". </garnt>
<connor> - I have the laundry machine. </connor>
<connor> The cockroach laundry machine, I have. </connor>
<joey> - Wait, but you had a
cockroach laundry machine- </joey>
<connor> - Laundry machine?
- What the fuck! </connor>
<garnt> (men laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait- </garnt>
<joey> - The only story we heard-
- Wait, wait, I've only heard </joey>
<joey> about the cockroach fridge machine. </joey>
<garnt> You have a cockroach
laundry machine as well? </garnt>
<connor> - Okay so, when I got my fridge,
it was a two for one deal. </connor>
<connor> You know, so.
- Yeah no, </connor>
<joey> I know about that. </joey>
<connor> - Oh okay, so they both
had cockroaches in them. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Well, no. </connor>
<connor> But they were in the same building. </connor>
<joey> - No, no, no, no, no, you
said your washing machine </joey>
<joey> also had cockroaches in it. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. (laughs)
- There might have been </connor>
<connor> one or two in there, I can't remember. </connor>
<garnt> - Mudon, rewind the clip right now. </garnt>
<connor> - I speak to someone on
Craigslist, I found a fridge </connor>
<joey> and a laundry machine,
what do you call that? </joey>
<joey> - A washing machine?
- Washing machine. (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - I don't fucking know.
- A laundry machine. </joey>
<joey> - It's what it is, right?
(Joey laughing) </joey>
<connor> They both came here in the same truck, </connor>
<connor> they both came from the same place. </connor>
<connor> Frankly, if your fridge had, </connor>
<connor> you know, there was a
good 15, 20 cockroaches </connor>
<connor> in this fridge.
- Right. </connor>
<connor> - I'm not, you know, at that point, </connor>
<garnt> I'm not giving you the
benefit of the doubt </garnt>
<garnt> with any of your other appliances. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, how can you live with
that many, this was vile. </garnt>
<connor> This was actually vile.
- Yeah, I don't understand </connor>
<garnt> some people- </garnt>
<joey> (Garnt stuttering) </joey>
<joey> - How big were the cockroaches? </joey>
<joey> Because I've never seen
cockroaches in Japan. </joey>
<joey> - Cockroaches in Japan-
- Thus far. </joey>
<connor> - There was like one or two
that were pretty big chonkers. </connor>
<connor> But a lot of them were
the little baby ones. </connor>
<connor> But like, the worst part was, </connor>
<joey> and this is very much a gross warning. </joey>
<joey> I've never spoken about this before, </joey>
<joey> but when I ripped off
all the felt and stuff, </joey>
<joey> and there was a hole in the felt, </joey>
<joey> and I put it in a fucking bleach, </joey>
<garnt> I know that doesn't kill them. </garnt>
<garnt> But I just wanted to
bleach the fridge stuff- </garnt>
<garnt> - How did you kill them? </garnt>
<garnt> - Most of them were already dead. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, okay.
- There were so many </garnt>
<connor> dead cockroaches inside of this fridge. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, yikes, it's pretty disgusting. </connor>
<connor> (Joey groans)
And I paid for that! </connor>
<connor> I paid for that!
(Joey sighs) </connor>
<joey> Can't believe that.
- That's what you get, man. </joey>
<joey> For using-
- Craigslist. </joey>
<joey> - Craigslist.
- Never again. </joey>
<joey> You know, it was the one
time where I was like, </joey>
<connor> "I'll give Craigslist a chance". </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<garnt> "I'll give Craigslist a chance". </garnt>
<garnt> I tried it-
- Because have you ever </garnt>
<garnt> dealt with cockroaches in the UK at all? </garnt>
<garnt> Because I remember for most of my life, </garnt>
<garnt> I had just never seen a cockroach. </garnt>
<garnt> Because the UK's pretty
clean, in terms of- </garnt>
<joey> - Imagine the privilege of
living in a sanitary home. </joey>
<joey> (men laugh) </joey>
<connor> Cockroaches, what is that? </connor>
<connor> - I saw a fair amount
when I moved to London. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh really?
- In Wales I didn't see many. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, because I remember </connor>
<garnt> my very first cockroach experience </garnt>
<garnt> was actually not in the UK,
but it was in Thailand, right? </garnt>
<garnt> And I remember, because my
house is not in the city center. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, right on the outskirts. </garnt>
<garnt> And we're near a lot of, not a forest, </garnt>
<garnt> but a lot of grassland, basically. </garnt>
<garnt> So we're like, right out in
the outskirts of the city. </garnt>
<garnt> So we're like, right
next to nature as well. </garnt>
<garnt> So, some of the cockroaches
we'd find are pretty massive. </garnt>
<connor> Right, and at this point,
I was living in Thailand </connor>
<connor> with Sydney, and it was just me and Sydney </connor>
<connor> in the house, right. </connor>
<connor> And so, I was just
sitting in my living room, </connor>
<connor> just chilling out. </connor>
<connor> And I hear this fucking guttural scream, </connor>
<connor> coming from Sydney, right? (laughs) </connor>
<connor> She's like, I had never
heard Sydney scream, </connor>
<connor> like Sydney's already
a loud person as it is. </connor>
<connor> But I, no, no, but I had never heard </connor>
<connor> this kind of scream from Sydney. </connor>
<connor> I was just like, I thought
she had just witnessed </connor>
<connor> a fucking murder or something, right? </connor>
<connor> That's the kind of scream-
- She's reading a dojin, </connor>
<connor> or it's murder. (laughs) </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, so I come rushing over, </joey>
<joey> thinking that something serious,
something bad has happened. </joey>
<garnt> And I just see this
fucking massive cockroach, </garnt>
<garnt> just chilling in our kitchen floor. </garnt>
<joey> - Well yeah, how big are we talking? </joey>
<garnt> - Okay, so it was about that bit. </garnt>
<connor> (Connor shudders)
- Okay, yeah, yeah- </connor>
<garnt> - It was a chonky motherfucker- </garnt>
<garnt> - How much bigger does it need to get </garnt>
<connor> before it starts fucking talking? </connor>
<garnt> - (laughs) That's the point. </garnt>
<joey> - Terraform machine-
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> Because the way the cockroaches get in, </joey>
<joey> because our kitchen is pretty clean, </joey>
<joey> but because we're right on the outskirts, </joey>
<joey> right near the forest an everything. </joey>
<joey> So sometimes they can crawl up the drains, </joey>
<joey> and come out from under the drains- </joey>
<garnt> - Oh no.
- I didn't know this. </garnt>
<garnt> I only found out about this afterwards. </garnt>
<garnt> Because my first thought was, </garnt>
<garnt> "Fuck, I thought our kitchen was clean! </garnt>
<joey> Fucking burn the entire house
down", and everything, right? </joey>
<joey> But this was my first time.
- It's like a stealth mission. </joey>
<connor> It's like Solid Snake.
- Dun, dun, dun, dun. </connor>
<connor> - And like, I don't know
how you guys are with bugs. </connor>
<connor> I'm sure you're fine, Joey,
because you're Australian. </connor>
<garnt> For me, I'm not a massive fan of bugs. </garnt>
<joey> - No, I don't enjoy-
- I mean, I'm not a fan! </joey>
<garnt> - I'm not a fan of
having to deal with them. </garnt>
<garnt> But some people can just
like, fucking grab the bugs, </garnt>
<garnt> or whatever, I'm just like, no. </garnt>
<joey> I'll do like, the cup method,
where you see a spider, </joey>
<joey> you cup it, and you put a piece of- </joey>
<connor> - Paper in it-
- Paper in it, </connor>
<connor> and let it out, I don't enjoy it. </connor>
<joey> I'm not like, scared, but
I don't enjoy doing it. </joey>
<garnt> - It's not a fun process.
- It's not a fun process. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't really, when
there's people who like, </connor>
<connor> fucking grab the spiders, and are like, </connor>
<garnt> "Oh what do you mean you're scared of it?" </garnt>
<garnt> I don't wanna fucking grab the spider. </garnt>
<garnt> Why would I wanna grab the spider? </garnt>
<connor> Even if I don't like, hate this thing, </connor>
<connor> why the fuck would I wanna
have it wriggling around </connor>
<connor> in my hand?
- Exactly. </connor>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<garnt> - Why do you do this?
- That's the Aussie in you. </garnt>
<garnt> - What people do this shit? </garnt>
<joey> It's like, they think they're
motherfucking Bear Grylls, </joey>
<connor> because they manage to catch
a house spider in their hand- </connor>
<connor> - I mean-
- I don't give a fuck! </connor>
<joey> I just don't wanna touch that shit. </joey>
<joey> - Have I told you of the
method that my dad uses </joey>
<garnt> to get rid of cockroaches?
- We'll do that afterwards. </garnt>
<connor> - What, he just fucking
sucks it in his mouth? </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs)
Oh, what do you mean, </connor>
<connor> you don't have a spider in
your mouth, son? (blows) </connor>
<connor> - Well yeah, because me
and Sydney are a couple. </connor>
<garnt> Because she's, I feel like
when you're in a couple, </garnt>
<garnt> the one who's least scared
is the one who deals with- </garnt>
<garnt> - Of course, of course.
- And of course, </garnt>
<garnt> it was me, I wasn't happy about it. </garnt>
<garnt> But I was just like,
"Sydney, you look like </garnt>
<garnt> you just witnessed a murder, whatever. </garnt>
<garnt> Get out of the way, I guess, as the man"- </garnt>
<garnt> - Let the man handle-
- I guess, </garnt>
<garnt> as the man of the house
here, I will take care </garnt>
<joey> of the cockroach.
- I know how to do it. </joey>
<garnt> - (laughs) And I was thinking,
this was going to be easy, </garnt>
<garnt> right, the cockroach was big, you know. </garnt>
<joey> And I didn't know that much
about cockroaches at the time. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, how naive you were.
- Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> Oh how naive I was. </garnt>
<garnt> So I thought, this was gonna be an easy, </garnt>
<garnt> because we had literally,
we had a cockroach spray. </garnt>
<garnt> And I was thinking, all I
need to do is get the spray, </garnt>
<garnt> spray the cockroach, job done, it dies, </garnt>
<garnt> I sweep it out the house. </garnt>
<garnt> Easy, right. </garnt>
<garnt> Now, so I get the spray,
and there are two pieces </garnt>
<garnt> of information that I didn't
know about cockroaches </garnt>
<garnt> before I did this. </garnt>
<garnt> Number one, cockroaches are
very, very hard to kill. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughs) And I knew this. </garnt>
<garnt> But I thought, it's a spray
designed to kill cockroaches. </garnt>
<garnt> Therefore, in my mind, instant death. </garnt>
<garnt> You know, that's how it's
worked my entire life. </garnt>
<garnt> Right, number two, cockroaches can fly. </garnt>
<garnt> I did not know this either. (laughs) </garnt>
<joey> - Is that some species, or all of them? </joey>
<joey> - I think all of them can fly. </joey>
<connor> - I've never seen a cockroach fly. </connor>
<joey> - They have to be pretty
fucking, GTFO mode, </joey>
<garnt> to start flying around.
- So I did not know </garnt>
<joey> they could fly either,
so it was just like, </joey>
<joey> crawling around on the floor. </joey>
<joey> - They're really terraformers. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, it's literally terraformers. </joey>
<joey> - It's like literally, last
resort for those cockroaches. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, so I'm just like,
"Sydney, get out of the way". </joey>
<joey> Let the man of the house handle this. </joey>
<connor> And so, I get the spray
out, get pretty close to it, </connor>
<connor> and I just give it a nice
little love tap with the spray. </connor>
<connor> - Oh no.
- No, no, no. </connor>
<connor> - (laughs) And what happens? </connor>
<garnt> It starts freaking the fuck out, right? </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just like, "Yo, yo, yo,
what the fuck is happening?" </garnt>
<garnt> Right, and then I spray it even more. </garnt>
<connor> And then I just hear the,
(imitates wings buzzing). </connor>
<connor> You know the sound where you
just hear the wings flapping? </connor>
<garnt> And then it starts
flapping, and then it flies, </garnt>
<garnt> and lands on my chest.
(men laugh) </garnt>
<garnt> And then-
- It's like, counterattack. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, (laughs) and then
I'm in fucking flight or, </garnt>
<garnt> fight or flight mode now. </garnt>
<garnt> And then I fucking scream,
as loud as I've screamed </garnt>
<garnt> in my life before, I think.
(Joey giggles) </garnt>
<garnt> (laughs) I'm not ashamed to admit </garnt>
<garnt> how fucking loud I
screamed, five minutes after </garnt>
<connor> I've just told Sydney,
"You're a fucking pussy, </connor>
<connor> let me handle this". (laughing) </connor>
<connor> I brush it off, like I fucking
leg it out of the kitchen. </connor>
<connor> And then I just lock the kitchen, right? </connor>
<connor> And I could hear the
cockroach is just freaking out </connor>
<connor> in the kitchen, all I hear is just like, </connor>
<garnt> (imitating buzzing wings). </garnt>
<joey> - You're like, "Sydney get
out, it's his house now. </joey>
<joey> It's his house, we gotta leave! </joey>
<joey> We gotta get our stuff!" </joey>
<joey> - And Sydney just turns around and goes, </joey>
<garnt> "Did you do it? </garnt>
<garnt> What's going on?" </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm just like, "Just
don't go in that kitchen". </garnt>
<garnt> (men laugh) </garnt>
<garnt> And like, me and Sydney were just like, </garnt>
<connor> in the living room, we could
just hear this cockroach </connor>
<connor> for the entire night, just freaking out. </connor>
<connor> - Oh God.
- And we were just like, </connor>
<joey> "Oh God, are we gonna have to
burn the entire house down?" </joey>
<joey> - It'll get bored eventually. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it'll get bored eventually. </joey>
<connor> - Cockroach spray is the biggest
fucking lie on the planet. </connor>
<connor> Aren't cockroaches the only animals </connor>
<joey> that can survive a nuclear blast? </joey>
<joey> - I don't know-
- Something like that. </joey>
<connor> So it's like, what is in these sprays </connor>
<joey> that is supposedly stronger
than a nuclear blast? (laughs) </joey>
<connor> - That's why I don't stop
until it stops moving. </connor>
<garnt> I'm like "Apex" aim, 100%,
(imitating can spraying) </garnt>
<connor> just following it around the room. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I thought that
would be fine as well. </garnt>
<garnt> Like I said, I didn't know they could fly. </garnt>
<garnt> That was the big, "Oh, they could fly". </garnt>
<garnt> The rules of the game have changed now. </garnt>
<garnt> They can counterattack you now. </garnt>
<connor> - Normally I spray them,
just so they're stunned </connor>
<connor> for a second, so I can fucking smack 'em. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, well I mean, I
don't like doing that, </joey>
<connor> because then it leaves a mark. </connor>
<joey> And also, it's not a guaranteed kill. </joey>
<connor> Unless you're using a fucking heavy boot- </connor>
<joey> - Joey, what's your KDA with cockroaches- </joey>
<connor> - You grab a suit shoe, right? </connor>
<garnt> Because the sole of the suit
shoes are very firm, very flat. </garnt>
<joey> You can just like, fucking- </joey>
<joey> (hand punches table)
clap 'em on the- </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, I mean the way my dad- </joey>
<connor> - This is a weird conversation- </connor>
<connor> - Is even hardcore. </connor>
<connor> - He just fucking eats it. </connor>
<connor> He's Australian, it's free food. </connor>
<joey> - So, in our household, we already know, </joey>
<garnt> cockroach spray is a lie. </garnt>
<garnt> So just don't even use the spray. </garnt>
<garnt> - Cockroach sprays are a lie. </garnt>
<joey> - It never kills the cockroach in one go. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, just smack 'em
with the spray. (laughs) </connor>
<joey> - Or, you do what my dad
does, which is, in Australia, </joey>
<connor> because we also have big fuck
off cockroaches like that. </connor>
<connor> All right, and there was one
that appeared in the kitchen. </connor>
<connor> What, it's always the kitchen. </connor>
<connor> And it appeared in the
kitchen, my mum screams. </connor>
<connor> My dad walks in, he's like, "What is it?" </connor>
<connor> She points to the wall, </connor>
<connor> and there's a big fuck
off cockroach like that. </connor>
<connor> And he's like, "Son." (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Eat it, eat it. </connor>
<connor> - He calls me over, "Yes
father, what is it?" </connor>
<connor> It's like, "Son, bring me two tissues". </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> And I was like, "I beg your pardon?" </connor>
<connor> He's like, "Bring me two tissues". </connor>
<connor> - One-ply, I wanna feel it. </connor>
<garnt> - I'm like, "Just two?" </garnt>
<connor> He's like, "Just two". </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "All right". </connor>
<connor> I bring him two tissues, and he's like, </connor>
<connor> "Place it on my hand". </connor>
<connor> So I place it flat on his
hand, one on top to the other. </connor>
<connor> And he's like, he dead ass
looks at me, and he goes, </connor>
<connor> "Watch this". (laughs) </connor>
<connor> He goes up to the wall,
and I've never seen a man </connor>
<connor> move this fast in my life. </connor>
<connor> It was like, bap! </connor>
<connor> And just grabs him, and it's in his hand! </connor>
<connor> Like, in the blink of an eye. </connor>
<connor> He just fucking, bap! </connor>
<connor> He just grabs it in his hand,
and you can hear this thing, </connor>
<connor> just (imitating buzzing wings)
like, around in his hand. </connor>
<connor> - Did he do the obligatory anime crush? </connor>
<connor> - No, he walks up to my mom, </connor>
<joey> and goes right up to her
ear and goes, crunch! </joey>
<joey> - Oh no.
- Oh no. </joey>
<joey> - And then he looks me in
the eyes, and he's like, </joey>
<joey> "I love that sound". </joey>
<joey> (men laughs) </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "You are the most"-
- Your fucking house is like- </joey>
<joey> - "You are the most Australian
father I could ever have, </joey>
<connor> and I love it".
- It's just like, </connor>
<connor> the weirdest fucking house on earth. </connor>
<joey> - I think I was like, eight
years old when he did that. </joey>
<joey> And I was like, "My dad is
the strongest in the world". </joey>
<joey> (men laugh) </joey>
<joey> That was the moment where
I'm like, "Don't fuck with"- </joey>
<garnt> - Like, that's how to assert dominance </garnt>
<garnt> in your family, right.
- You're introducing </garnt>
<joey> the anime villain.
- Yeah, it's like, </joey>
<joey> if you're in the playground,
you're making fun </joey>
<joey> of each other's dad's, or
you're trying to one up </joey>
<joey> each other's dad's, don't say, </joey>
<connor> "Oh no, my dad's the
president of Nintendo". </connor>
<joey> No, "My dad grabs cockroaches by hand </joey>
<garnt> and crushes them to death". </garnt>
<joey> - My dad could beat up your dad. </joey>
<garnt> Well, my dad fucking-
- Hand grabs cockroaches. </garnt>
<joey> (men laugh) </joey>
<garnt> And they're like, "All right, never mind". </garnt>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<garnt> "Your dad's number one". </garnt>
<garnt> - Fucking like, some
kung fu, where it's just- </garnt>
<joey> - I've never seen, because
I thought, I was like, </joey>
<garnt> "Is this guy really gonna
catch this cockroach by hand?" </garnt>
<garnt> Because we all know how fast cockroach- </garnt>
<connor> - You're literally, you
would literally speed wagon </connor>
<joey> watching, like commentating-
- It was, yeah. </joey>
<connor> It was actually amazing. </connor>
<connor> - I'm amazed by his
sheer agility. (laughs) </connor>
<joey> - But I feel like, my dad
is like, I don't know. </joey>
<joey> When it comes to insects for some reason, </joey>
<garnt> he's weirdly really lucky, I guess. </garnt>
<garnt> Or, I don't know what the right word- </garnt>
<garnt> - Lucky? </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, he told me this story, </garnt>
<garnt> of one time he was out in the back yard, </garnt>
<garnt> and he was with his brother, my uncle. </garnt>
<garnt> And obviously, if you're barbecuing out </garnt>
<connor> in the summer or whatever, in Australia, </connor>
<connor> there's a fuck load of
flies everywhere, right? </connor>
<connor> But you just, you know,
fucking brush 'em off. </connor>
<connor> It's whatever. </connor>
<connor> And my dad, he was I don't
know, teenage or something, </connor>
<connor> and he had a knife in his hand, </connor>
<joey> just a regular steak knife, </joey>
<joey> and he just had it in his hand. </joey>
<joey> And he saw a fly on the table. </joey>
<joey> And he just went-
(hand slams table) </joey>
<joey> And he cut the fly's head cleanly in half. </joey>
<garnt> And he just kind of
stood there and was like- </garnt>
<joey> - Your dad's a psychopath.
- I can't believe </joey>
<garnt> I just did that. (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - That's like some fucking Nen shit, man. </garnt>
<garnt> That's like, what's the
anime move where you can </garnt>
<garnt> completely remove your presence, right? </garnt>
<joey> - His dad just pulled that shit. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> - He appeared right behind
me, and I didn't notice him! </joey>
<joey> (men laugh) </joey>
<garnt> - Because like, I have
never successfully caught </garnt>
<garnt> or swatted a housefly in my life. </garnt>
<joey> - Have you ever successfully
smacked a mosquito </joey>
<joey> in your hand? </joey>
<joey> - Mosquito, yeah.
- Really? </joey>
<joey> - Mosquitoes like, they're
annoying, but it's doable. </joey>
<joey> Fly, it's like they have
observation hacking. </joey>
<joey> They know what's coming five seconds </joey>
<joey> before it comes, you know- </joey>
<garnt> - It's like Goku versus Frieza. </garnt>
<joey> It's just like, teleporting
all over. (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Can't they like, avoid
bullets or something? </joey>
<joey> Because of the way that they like- </joey>
<joey> - Flies?
- Yeah, because when you, </joey>
<joey> when something goes near
them, the air pressure, </joey>
<joey> they use it to get away.
- Oh, really? </joey>
<joey> - To like, dodge. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, it's really interesting.
- I don't know. </joey>
<garnt> I've never-
- I swear I saw </garnt>
<garnt> a YouTube video of someone
shooting a fly with a gun. </garnt>
<garnt> - How can you fucking shoot, </garnt>
<garnt> a fly isn't a massive target anyway. </garnt>
<connor> - Best marksman versus best fly? </connor>
<joey> YouTube series, I don't know.
- Marksman versus fly. </joey>
<garnt> - I guess, I mean-
- Sounds like a scene </garnt>
<garnt> from an anime, right-
- I don't know </garnt>
<garnt> if this is like, a fucking fever dream. </garnt>
<joey> I feel like, did I actually see this? </joey>
<connor> I feel like I've seen this-
- Remember that one episode </connor>
<joey> of "Golgo 13", where he
snipes a fly? (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Right. (laughs)
- I feel like </joey>
<connor> 90% of the YouTube recommended, I'm like, </connor>
<connor> "Did I actually watch that?"
(Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> I feel like I 1/4th remember
a bunch of facts and stories. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "This one time
where this guy did a thing, </connor>
<joey> but I don't really know". </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] (laughs) I don't really know. </joey>
<joey> - He did a thing, and was
impressive, I don't know. </joey>
<joey> - Something about a cube,
like you know, I don't know. </joey>
<connor> - A cube? (laughs)
- Something about a cube, </connor>
<garnt> or something. </garnt>
<garnt> Wait so, wait, what is
the worst furniture? </garnt>
<garnt> Because I was saying beds are terrible. </garnt>
<connor> I know we're going way back-
- Yeah, we're going way back. </connor>
<garnt> You never finished it, but-
- Okay. </garnt>
<connor> Beds are terrible, but
I think coffee tables, </connor>
<connor> somehow, these small things can sometimes </connor>
<connor> be the worst fucking things on earth, </connor>
<connor> because they're like,
"Let's make coffee tables </connor>
<connor> the most secure thing ever in existence". </connor>
<joey> - Out of all the things I've built, </joey>
<joey> so for the past week I've built chairs, </joey>
<joey> I've built coffee tables,
cabinets, all that kind of shit. </joey>
<connor> The worst one by far was the Ikea chairs. </connor>
<connor> And they're like, it's like four pieces. </connor>
<joey> And they just over complicate
the fuck out of it, </joey>
<garnt> for no reason.
- Yeah, actually, </garnt>
<garnt> the worst one I built were
my table and chair set. </garnt>
<garnt> And that's because when I built it, </garnt>
<garnt> followed the exact instructions. </garnt>
<garnt> And you think, you screw it tight, </garnt>
<garnt> it'll just work perfectly, it's a chair. </garnt>
<garnt> Right, and literally every
chair fucking wobbled. </garnt>
<garnt> Right, it was just uneven. </garnt>
<garnt> And I spent an entire day having to </garnt>
<garnt> perfectly unscrew these screws </garnt>
<garnt> so that the chairs will balance. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm just like, "Why can't
you just balance it normally?" </garnt>
<garnt> It's a chair! </garnt>
<garnt> It's literally, it should
just be same length, </garnt>
<garnt> all four chairs, no. </garnt>
<garnt> It wasn't the case. </garnt>
<garnt> That's why it was a
fucking nightmare for me. </garnt>
<joey> - That's just like, a dick
move on the designers though. </joey>
<connor> Right, they were just like,
"I'm a fuck with this guy. </connor>
<joey> The next guy who buys my chair". </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> (Connor gags)
But like, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> I was like, I also agree
with you about the bed. </garnt>
<connor> I didn't wanna build my bed so much, </connor>
<connor> that I just never got a bed! (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Wait, what are you sleeping on? </connor>
<connor> - I sleep on-
- Just a mattress? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, just a mattress.
- What? (laughs) </joey>
<joey> Wait, so you don't have
a bed frame at home? </joey>
<garnt> - No. </garnt>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> I actually, because, I
actually like it, right. </joey>
<joey> - You can get those like, you can (laughs) </joey>
<connor> that's so ghetto! </connor>
<connor> You can get the fucking, the low frames. </connor>
<connor> The ones that are literally on the floor. </connor>
<joey> - Isn't it also really bad for your floor, </joey>
<connor> to just have a mattress on it? </connor>
<connor> - Is it?
- Doesn't it get moldy, </connor>
<garnt> or whatever? </garnt>
<connor> - Dear God-
- Isn't that </connor>
<connor> the whole reason-
- Have you looked </connor>
<joey> underneath your mattress?
- Isn't that the whole reason </joey>
<joey> for a bed frame, is to stop
the floor from molding, </joey>
<joey> or something?
- Can one of you </joey>
<joey> Google this?
- We do have like, </joey>
<joey> a bed frame, but it's
one of those literally, </joey>
<joey> floor bed frames, where it's like- </joey>
<joey> - It's just a plank of wood on the- </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, so it's basically
just a plank of wood </connor>
<garnt> on the floor.
- That's what I was saying. </garnt>
<garnt> You can get the floor bed-
- Yeah, and the reason for it </garnt>
<garnt> was because when we moved in, </garnt>
<connor> we slept on a futon at
Connor's for like a week. </connor>
<connor> And at first, "Sydney was just like, </connor>
<connor> why would we sleep on the floor? </connor>
<connor> Peasants sleep on the floor". </connor>
<connor> And me, being the Asian, </connor>
<connor> every time I go to Thailand,
I'd always sleep on the floor </connor>
<connor> at my Grandma's place, and I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> there's something comforting
about sleeping on the floor. </connor>
<garnt> I don't know what it is, but I sleep, </garnt>
<garnt> I just realized that
whenever we go to onsens, </garnt>
<garnt> or ryokans or whatever, you'd
sleep on the futon floors, </garnt>
<garnt> it's futon mattresses. </garnt>
<garnt> And you just get the best night of sleep </garnt>
<garnt> you have in your life, and I don't know- </garnt>
<joey> - I think it might be because the tatami, </joey>
<joey> or the floor, whatever
it is you're sleeping on, </joey>
<joey> the hard surface, it
flattens your back out. </joey>
<garnt> So I guess that just naturally </garnt>
<garnt> gives you better sleep or something. </garnt>
<joey> But I agree, I get the
best sleep in a futon. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, so we just decided, </garnt>
<garnt> why not just fucking sleep on the floor? </garnt>
<garnt> We just got a mattress-
- But then you miss out </garnt>
<connor> on the, you know when you wake up, </connor>
<connor> and you're like, "Oh fuck". </connor>
<connor> Then you just kind of sit on the bed, </connor>
<connor> with your legs on the floor? </connor>
<connor> And you're just like,
"Fuck, I gotta get up". </connor>
<joey> But you're not fully awake- </joey>
<joey> - Do you love that feeling? (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I kind of like that.
- I hate that feeling. </joey>
<joey> - Because I don't wanna
get out of bed right away. </joey>
<connor> But I wanna kind of get
up, and I wanna put my, </connor>
<connor> you know, I wanna try to get ready, </connor>
<connor> or hype myself up to-
- Oh, for me, </connor>
<joey> there's only two states. </joey>
<joey> There's lying in the bed on my phone, </joey>
<connor> or just out of bed.
- What, you never sit there </connor>
<connor> at the edge of the bed, being like, "Fuck. </connor>
<connor> I've gotta get up"-
- No, I kind of realized </connor>
<garnt> that I wanna spend the
least time in my bed room </garnt>
<joey> as physically possible, right? </joey>
<joey> And I feel like you get
a better night's sleep </joey>
<connor> if your bed room is just for sleeping. </connor>
<connor> Because I remember at my old place, </connor>
<connor> especially when I started YouTube, </connor>
<connor> and we were working literally
with my bed next to me, </connor>
<garnt> I would get the worst
night's sleep, every time- </garnt>
<garnt> - I 100% agree, yeah.
- I could not, </garnt>
<garnt> I could not go in my bed
room, and just go on my bed, </garnt>
<garnt> and just go into sleep mode. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, I've found that once I positioned it </garnt>
<garnt> so I would spend the least
time in my bed as possible, </garnt>
<garnt> I would get much better sleeps. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, my place, two places ago now, </joey>
<joey> was yeah, it was the same. </joey>
<joey> Like, you guys have been there before. </joey>
<garnt> The tiny apartment I had?
- The fucking tiny apartment. </garnt>
<joey> - The tiny apartment-
- With the Anime Man couch, </joey>
<garnt> with all the plushies.
(Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, when I was like, 18,
I probably would have thought </garnt>
<joey> that was a cool ass apartment. </joey>
<joey> - No, when I first moved in,
it was a cool ass apartment- </joey>
<joey> - When you get older, you're like, </joey>
<connor> "Oh, small"-
- But then I very quickly </connor>
<joey> realized that if your where you work </joey>
<connor> is in the same room, or
next to where you sleep, </connor>
<connor> you get the worst sleep, and
you get the worst productive. </connor>
<connor> Like, the worst productivity. </connor>
<connor> You just can't do anything. </connor>
<connor> Because it's just like,
"I could just turn over, </connor>
<joey> and literally walk half a meter, </joey>
<joey> and just sleep if I wanted to". </joey>
<joey> Like, how can you concentrate
in a room like that? </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. (laughs) </joey>
<connor> - I feel like there's
parts where I enjoyed it. </connor>
<connor> I like the fact that I
can just turn my monitor </connor>
<connor> towards my bed and just watch shit. </connor>
<connor> Because sometimes
watching stuff on the TV, </connor>
<connor> it's really a pain in the ass. </connor>
<connor> Because like, you know, on the PC, </connor>
<connor> you can just get the website up, </connor>
<connor> and then you can throw it
on the monitor, it's easy. </connor>
<connor> On a TV, you've gotta fuck
around with Chromecast shit. </connor>
<connor> You gotta figure, "Oh,
which apps work for my TV, </connor>
<connor> which don't", you know. </connor>
<joey> And a PC, it's like-
- I mean, it's not, </joey>
<connor> it's not that much-
- It's like five more minutes </connor>
<connor> worth of work that I don't want. </connor>
<connor> And also, I used to have a
setup that I really liked, </connor>
<garnt> where I had like a, next
to my bed I had a keyboard </garnt>
<garnt> with a track pad on it. </garnt>
<garnt> So I would just fucking,
apply to shit in my bed, </garnt>
<joey> and then change the-
- Pretty sure that's </joey>
<joey> how people get bed ridden. </joey>
<joey> - I think I was like, getting there. </joey>
<joey> I was trial running. </joey>
<garnt> I mean, if I was ever bed ridden, </garnt>
<connor> at least I know the system.
- At least I can work. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I had it all set up, you know. </garnt>
<connor> It was a good system-
- Jesus Christ. </connor>
<connor> - No, but like, I feel like,
especially when I get out </connor>
<connor> of bed, I'm just like, way more awake. </connor>
<joey> The problem isn't-
- Typically, when I'm </joey>
<joey> out of my bed, I'm awake.
- Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> The problem isn't that, the problem is- </joey>
<joey> (men laughing)
Getting out of the bed </joey>
<joey> in the first place.
- Yeah, true, true. </joey>
<garnt> - Like, having my legs
hang off or whatever, </garnt>
<garnt> that's not gonna help me. (laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - Sometimes the foot out
of the bed, free hanging, </connor>
<connor> is a pretty good feeling though. </connor>
<garnt> - I still haven't figured out a way </garnt>
<garnt> to get out of bed when
it's a cold winter's day, </garnt>
<joey> or a cold winter morning-
- Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> That's why like, I'm kind
of glad now, that I moved. </joey>
<garnt> Because it's starting to get warm- </garnt>
<garnt> - Thank God-
- It's a lot easier now </garnt>
<garnt> to just immediately get out of bed. </garnt>
<garnt> Because the inside of your mattress, </garnt>
<garnt> and the outside of your mattress </garnt>
<garnt> is pretty much the same temperature. </garnt>
<garnt> So it's not a fucking struggle,
like it is in the winter. </garnt>
<connor> But yeah, to this day, I've
been trying to figure out, </connor>
<connor> how the fuck do I get
out of bed in winter? </connor>
<connor> How do I remove the 10 Gs
of force that is created </connor>
<connor> in the wintertime, in my bed? </connor>
<garnt> Because yeah, every
time, I always do the... </garnt>
<garnt> The one thing I found out is like, </garnt>
<garnt> okay, one limb at a time. </garnt>
<connor> It's like, stick one
arm out, get that like, </connor>
<connor> to room temperature, all right. </connor>
<connor> And then get the next limb
out, and then it's just like, </connor>
<garnt> a slow process, right,
it's like slow loading. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like, you know, when you're going </garnt>
<garnt> in the swimming pool for the first time. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's a really cold pool. </garnt>
<joey> Is it like, do you jump in straightaway, </joey>
<garnt> or would you go one limb at a time? </garnt>
<joey> - I jump in straightaway.
- Jump in straightaway. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, because that's how I feel, </garnt>
<garnt> whenever I need to get out of bed </garnt>
<garnt> on a cold winter's night. </garnt>
<connor> - You just gotta chug a fuck ton of water </connor>
<connor> when you wake up. </connor>
<connor> That shit wakes you up. </connor>
<connor> You tried that-
- Oh yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Just get a full bottle of water. </connor>
<joey> When you wake up, just down it- </joey>
<joey> - But I can chug a full bottle
of water in bed. (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - There is no way you can lie back down </joey>
<joey> after chugging a full bottle of water. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, I 100%-
- Wait, wait. </joey>
<connor> Why does that work? </connor>
<joey> - This episode is sponsored by ExpressVPN! </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] A few decades ago, </connor>
<connor> private citizens used to
be largely that, private. </connor>
<connor> What changed? The internet. </connor>
<connor> Think about everything you've browsed, </connor>
<connor> searched for, watched, or tweeted. </connor>
<connor> Now imagine all that data
being crawled through, </connor>
<connor> collected, and aggregated by third-parties </connor>
<connor> into a permanent, public record. </connor>
<connor> Your record! </connor>
<connor> Having a private life,
exposed for others to see </connor>
<connor> was once something only
celebrities worried about. </connor>
<connor> But in the era where everyone is online, </connor>
<connor> everyone is a public figure. </connor>
<connor> To keep my data private, when I go online, </connor>
<connor> I turn to ExpressVPN. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Did you know there are hundreds </joey>
<joey> of data brokers out
there whose sole business </joey>
<joey> is to buy and sell your data? </joey>
<joey> The worst part is they
don't have to tell you </joey>
<joey> who they're selling it
to, or get your consent. </joey>
<garnt> - No consent, in 2021? </garnt>
<garnt> One of these data points
is your I.P. address. </garnt>
<garnt> Data harvesters use your
I.P. to uniquely identify you </garnt>
<garnt> and your location, but you know what, </garnt>
<garnt> with ExpressVPN, my
connection gets rerouted </garnt>
<garnt> through an encrypted server,
and my I.P. is masked. </garnt>
<connor> - [Connor] Every time
I turn ExpressVPN on, </connor>
<connor> I'm given a random I.P. address, </connor>
<connor> shared by other ExpressVPN customers. </connor>
<connor> That makes it more
difficult for third-parties </connor>
<connor> to identify me and harvest my data. </connor>
<connor> And the best part is, is how
easy ExpressVPN is to use. </connor>
<connor> No matter what device you're on, </connor>
<connor> phone, laptop, or smart
TV, all you have to do </connor>
<connor> is have one button to get protected. </connor>
<joey> - So if, like me, </joey>
<joey> you believe that your
data is your business, </joey>
<joey> secure yourself with
the number one rated VPN </joey>
<joey> on the market, visit
expressvpn.com/trashtaste </joey>
<joey> and get three extra months for free. </joey>

<connor> - Back to the episode.
- Baby. </connor>
<garnt> - Listen, I don't understand
the rules of hydration, Garnt. </garnt>
<garnt> All I know is that semi
waterboarding your organs </garnt>
<joey> wakes you up. </joey>
<joey> - (laughs) It puts your
(mumbles), it's like, ah! </joey>
<joey> - It does! </joey>
<connor> You know, my organs are sleeping, </connor>
<connor> and it's like, "Oh God, we're drowning! </connor>
<connor> Oh, Jesus", and wakes up. </connor>
<connor> And, you're also hydrated,
so it's a win-win. </connor>
<joey> - No, no, I do that. </joey>
<connor> The first thing I do when I get out, </connor>
<joey> is take a piss, and then
drink a shit load of water. </joey>
<joey> - I drink enough fucking water as it is. </joey>
<connor> - I hate morning pees, man. </connor>
<joey> Morning pees suck. </joey>
<joey> Because it's always really strong, too. </joey>
<joey> Because you're dehydrated.
- It's always froth as fuck. </joey>
<joey> - Mine isn't frothy, but-
(Joey laughs) </joey>
<garnt> Morning pees just suck, I
hate peeing in the morning. </garnt>
<garnt> Because it also- </garnt>
<garnt> - Mine's the complete opposite. </garnt>
<garnt> - Also, it just hurts. </garnt>
<garnt> Does-
- A little bit. </garnt>
<connor> - Because also, no wait, wait. </connor>
<joey> Don't make a face, yeah-
- Because it's thick. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, but-
- What, what? </joey>
<joey> - Because, because you've
been holding it in all night. </joey>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> So, you wake up, and you're like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, I really need to piss". </connor>
<connor> But I'm also like, "I
really wanna stay in bed". </connor>
<connor> And then, the only, most the time, </connor>
<connor> if I don't chug the water,
the thing that gets me up </connor>
<connor> is the uncomfort of needing to piss </connor>
<connor> is stronger than my want
to stay in this bed. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, I think it hurts, because- </joey>
<connor> - It's supply and demand. </connor>
<connor> - It's like doing your first
lift in the gym, right? </connor>
<connor> It always hurts.
(Garnt laughs) </connor>
<joey> Right, the bladder is like,
"I haven't done anything </joey>
<connor> all day"-
- You're stalling </connor>
<connor> like a man who doesn't
go to the gym. (laughing) </connor>
<joey> And it's like the first-
- Yeah, yeah, yeah- </joey>
<joey> - It's like that. </joey>
<joey> No, because your bladder
hasn't been moving all night. </joey>
<joey> And then suddenly, it has to move. </joey>
<joey> So it's like, "All
right, fuck, let's do it. </joey>
<garnt> Ah!" (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know, I always like,
mine are always just like, </garnt>
<joey> comes out easily, but I
think that's just because </joey>
<joey> I drink a fuck ton of
water before I go to bed. </joey>
<joey> - How do you not get up, do you not get up </joey>
<joey> in the middle of the night to pee? </joey>
<joey> - I just find that the time it takes </joey>
<joey> for the water to get in, is
the perfect amount of time </joey>
<joey> for me to sleep-
- (laughs) It's just like, </joey>
<connor> optimized.
- It's just like, </connor>
<garnt> natural, it's just a natural (mumbles). </garnt>
<connor> - I feel like in the past two years, </connor>
<connor> before two years ago, I
never, ever woke up to pee. </connor>
<connor> Ever, and then suddenly
now, it's like genuinely, </connor>
<connor> I have to like, fucking, like precise, </connor>
<connor> like precisely time
when I drink water now, </connor>
<connor> otherwise I'm gonna wake
up, at like 6 A.M. to pee. </connor>
<joey> - I almost, that's the thing,
I almost never drink water </joey>
<connor> before I go to bed, or
never drink anything- </connor>
<garnt> - Is this like an old age thing? </garnt>
<joey> Is this an aging thing?
- What the fuck. </joey>
<joey> You're 24-
(Joey laughs) </joey>
<connor> What are you talking about?
- Am I showing early signs </connor>
<connor> of 40 year old life? </connor>
<joey> Like why is this happening? </joey>
<connor> - Am I right, fellow older gentlemen? </connor>
<connor> - I turned 24. </connor>
<connor> The clock ticked over,
and I was like, "Shit. </connor>
<connor> My body's falling apart. </connor>
<connor> My life is going to shit. </connor>
<connor> Losing my hair, I'm pissing everywhere. </connor>
<connor> My bladder hurts all the time". </connor>
<connor> You know, it's like, what's going on? </connor>
<connor> I can't catch a fucking break. </connor>
<connor> When did my body start doing this? </connor>
<connor> This never happened before. </connor>
<joey> I have this really vivid memory, </joey>
<joey> this is totally on tangent,
about peeing though. </joey>
<joey> Where, for some reason, when
I watched "Wild Wild West" </joey>
<joey> for the first time-
- (laughs) Okay. </joey>
<connor> - At 12 years old, for some reason, </connor>
<connor> I was so, so proud of myself (laughing) </connor>
<connor> as an eight year old kid,
that I'd managed to sit </connor>
<connor> through a whole movie without peeing. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - I mean yeah-
- I would be proud as well. </garnt>
<garnt> I still can't do that.
- When you're a kid, </garnt>
<connor> would you just piss all the time? </connor>
<garnt> - Yes, I mean-
- I still piss all the time. </garnt>
<joey> - So is this like, a curve-
- Me and Connor </joey>
<connor> are like piss machine
2,000, we piss all the time. </connor>
<joey> - Piss machine... </joey>
<joey> Is this a thing that happens in life, </joey>
<joey> that you know, when you're
a kid you have to pee a lot, </joey>
<joey> and then you pee less, and
then when you get to like, </joey>
<joey> mid-20s, it goes back-
- No, I pee just as much now </joey>
<garnt> as I did when I was eight.
- I think you were just </garnt>
<connor> getting onto like, our level now, </connor>
<joey> of like, how much you pee. </joey>
<joey> - I'm not fond of this. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I mean, I drink a lot of water. </joey>
<connor> I mean just, look at that. </connor>
<garnt> - God, look at this. </garnt>
<connor> This is a full glass, believe it or not, </connor>
<garnt> this is a full glass of water
that I just drank. (laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - The amount-
- You could scarcely- </connor>
<garnt> - The amount-
- Before I started </garnt>
<joey> the sentence, it was full. </joey>
<garnt> - The amount of like,
the amount of fucking, </garnt>
<garnt> on or off camera moments on "Trash Taste", </garnt>
<garnt> where I'm just like talking, </garnt>
<garnt> and then my glass is just empty. </garnt>
<garnt> And I have to like, I go through- </garnt>
<joey> - Are you talking about your weird like, </joey>
<garnt> side mouth drinking shit that you do? </garnt>
<joey> - (laughing) I'm not talking about that. </joey>
<joey> - Can I hear an explanation about that? </joey>
<garnt> Why do you do that?
- I have, I did not </garnt>
<connor> even know I did that.
- I get it. </connor>
<garnt> Sometimes, drinking water's boring. </garnt>
<garnt> You gotta spice it up a little. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<joey> No, no, you've done
this, you've done this. </joey>
<joey> When you've just drank
water in a funny way, </joey>
<joey> because you're like, you're bored- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, when I was like, 10.
- Nah, I still do that. </joey>
<connor> I still do that shit. </connor>
<joey> - And then I realized,
oh, I should probably </joey>
<joey> just drink it how everyone else drinks it- </joey>
<garnt> - Thank you very much
for the refill, Meiling. </garnt>
<garnt> Yes, I did need to stay hydrated. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, I don't know-
- Do you know, </garnt>
<connor> sometimes you slurp excessively? </connor>
<garnt> You know, to like, aerate the water? </garnt>
<garnt> And all the flavors come out? (laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - I actually don't do that,
what are you talking about? </connor>
<connor> - I'm kidding-
- Like a fine wine- </connor>
<garnt> - I'm kidding. </garnt>
<garnt> - Swirl it around, like a fine wine- </garnt>
<joey> - I'm kidding. </joey>
<joey> - Do you ever drink water like a dog? </joey>
<joey> Just like-
(men laugh) </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah I did, when I was 10. </garnt>
<connor> - That moment when. </connor>
<garnt> - Well yeah, because
actually, when you're kid, </garnt>
<joey> you're like, "The dog's
doing it, clearly"- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I watched my cat do it. </joey>
<joey> And I was like, "Whoa, I wanna do that". </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, why doesn't the
stupid dog just drink it? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. (laughs) </joey>
<joey> Just pick it up.
(Connor laughs) </joey>
<joey> - And then you try it, and you're like, </joey>
<connor> "This is wildly inefficient. </connor>
<connor> This really feels like
there could have been </connor>
<connor> a better way of the dog"- </connor>
<joey> - No wonder those motherfuckers
have been at this bowl </joey>
<joey> for like five minutes. </joey>
<connor> - Are you telling me over
thousands of years of evolution, </connor>
<joey> the dog couldn't slurp?
(Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> A little bit, it couldn't just figure out- </joey>
<joey> - Just pucker his lips, mm. </joey>
<joey> - These dogs have like,
near fucking echolocation, </joey>
<joey> and you're telling me they
couldn't develop a slurp? </joey>
<garnt> Like... </garnt>
<connor> I could learn that shit with
a YouTube guide in 20 minutes. </connor>
<garnt> Are you kidding me? </garnt>
<garnt> - How to slurp.
- Wikihow. </garnt>
<connor> - Wikihow.
- Oh my God. </connor>
<joey> - I don't know-
- Don't be a dog. </joey>
<connor> - How did we get onto this? </connor>
<connor> I don't know, point is,
stay hydrated, weebs. </connor>
<joey> It's healthy for you. </joey>
<joey> Right? (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - I mean yeah, it is, it is. </joey>
<joey> - I mean yeah, I don't know. </joey>
<joey> I've always just drunk
a fuck ton of water, </joey>
<joey> ever since I was a kid. </joey>
<joey> Which is why I think, while like, </joey>
<joey> one of my biggest habits that I have </joey>
<joey> that's allowed me to stay thin, </joey>
<joey> is that I just don't
really like soda that much. </joey>
<joey> It's just, I'd rather drink... </joey>
<joey> Okay, here's the thing, I hate soda </joey>
<joey> when it's at full fizziness. </joey>
<joey> Right.
- What the fuck </joey>
<joey> are you talking about?
- Okay, okay, okay. </joey>
<joey> We're going off tangent, I only thought- </joey>
<connor> - Please, please, go on-
- Tangent, the episode. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, this is tangent, the episode. </connor>
<connor> I only thought about
this because I saw like, </connor>
<joey> another hot takes Sydney tweet last night. </joey>
<joey> - Oh that one.
- Which was like, </joey>
<joey> I can't remember exactly, but it was like- </joey>
<joey> - "Flat soda is better than fizzy soda". </joey>
<joey> - I turned off my
computer after I saw that. </joey>
<joey> I was like, "You can't be serious". </joey>
<joey> - And I'm like just, "I
don't agree with that". </joey>
<joey> But, I half agree with that. </joey>
<joey> Because I cannot for the life of me </joey>
<garnt> fully enjoy fully fizzy soda. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, for me, peak soda, right, </garnt>
<garnt> I cannot drink-
- Peak soda! </garnt>
<connor> - This happens when
you sleep on the floor. </connor>
<connor> You just start fucking doing weird things- </connor>
<garnt> - Welcome to another gone hot food take. </garnt>
<joey> Okay, peak soda for me,
is soda with ice, right? </joey>
<joey> Because you have to like, </joey>
<joey> you pour it on the ice-
- It gets it down- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! </joey>
<joey> I do like a little bit watered down soda. </joey>
<garnt> Because like, for me, Coke out of a can, </garnt>
<garnt> it's so fizzy, that you just can't, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't understand how-
(Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> It is, it is!
- Is your throat </garnt>
<joey> made out of paper? </joey>
<joey> Like-
- Oh, oh it hurts. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh it hurts!
- It's just fucking </garnt>
<garnt> gassy as fuck, like soda, a drink, </garnt>
<joey> is meant to be refreshing-
- You can't tell me, </joey>
<joey> you can't tell me after you down </joey>
<garnt> a fully fizzy soda,
doesn't have to be Coke. </garnt>
<garnt> Just any soda, because I don't
drink Coke anymore either. </garnt>
<garnt> But after you just open
it, and you hear that, </garnt>
<garnt> (imitates a can of soda
opening) like sound, </garnt>
<connor> you drink it down, and then you do that </connor>
<connor> massive fucking burp.
- The burp is very nice. </connor>
<joey> - Is like, the best fucking
feeling on the planet. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, normally, I'm
always willing to understand </connor>
<joey> your point, Garnt, but honestly, </joey>
<joey> I don't even know where
this is coming from. </joey>
<garnt> This is weird.
- This is coming from- </garnt>
<garnt> - Because I've never
drank soda, and been like, </garnt>
<connor> "Damn, I wish this was
less carbonated". (laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - I think all of them, because to me, </garnt>
<garnt> a drink is meant to be refreshing, right? </garnt>
<garnt> That's why we drink it-
- But the carbonation's- </garnt>
<joey> - It's meant to be refreshing-
- The carbonation </joey>
<joey> is supposed to be refreshing! </joey>
<joey> - The carbonation is not refreshing. </joey>
<joey> - It's pretty refreshing.
- It's not refreshing. </joey>
<joey> - Well like, it's either
sugared-out flat ass soda </joey>
<garnt> is definitely not refreshing. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no, no, I don't like flat soda. </garnt>
<garnt> I do not like flat soda. </garnt>
<garnt> Flat soda is awful, right. </garnt>
<garnt> It's just, when it's like, on ice, </garnt>
<garnt> you get a bit of the fizz out, </garnt>
<joey> and that's the perfect amount
of carbonation in a soda. </joey>
<joey> That's why, if I drink soda,
if I want it to be refreshing, </joey>
<joey> it needs a little bit of ice, </joey>
<connor> just to get a bit of that
carbonation out, perfect amount. </connor>
<joey> - Too long.
(Garnt laughs) </joey>
<garnt> It's what it sounds like. (laughs) </garnt>
<joey> Who taught you this?
- This man wants to hydrate </joey>
<joey> no matter what.
(Garnt laughs) </joey>
<garnt> - It's just, I mean like-
- It's like, </garnt>
<garnt> soda doesn't have water in it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah I mean like, a
fully carbonated soda, </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like I'm losing
hydration by drinking that. </garnt>
<joey> I don't know why.
- All right, to be fair, </joey>
<joey> the only, I don't drink
soda anymore either. </joey>
<joey> I haven't really drank soda
in like, maybe a couple years. </joey>
<connor> I mean, every now and then,
if there's a drink bar </connor>
<connor> or whatever-
- You haven't drank soda </connor>
<connor> in a couple years?
- Sometimes, okay no. </connor>
<garnt> I haven't, dead ass, I haven't
bought a bottle of Coke, </garnt>
<connor> or Sprite-
- Oh, I haven't done that- </connor>
<joey> - In a couple years.
- You know, it's like, </joey>
<connor> when I order at McDonald's, I have to- </connor>
<joey> - No, I always get tea at McDonald's. </joey>
<joey> - I used to get milk, but
then I just felt like a child. </joey>
<connor> - Milk? </connor>
<connor> - Milk, at McDonald's?
- When the milk carton </connor>
<joey> would turn off, I would
get Uber Eats, you know. </joey>
<joey> And like you have to order-
- I didn't even know </joey>
<joey> you could get milk at McDonald's. </joey>
<joey> - You can get milk in it. </joey>
<joey> And the carton would turn up, and the guy, </joey>
<joey> you know, the Uber Eats guy-
- The milk man, right. </joey>
<connor> - He'd look at me like,
"Seriously, seriously? </connor>
<joey> All right, okay". </joey>
<joey> - Oh, here's your little milk. (giggles) </joey>
<joey> - Well, because, I don't
know if this is like </joey>
<joey> a tactical thing, to get
us to drink more Coke. </joey>
<joey> But the just start putting
water in the package deal, </joey>
<joey> and I was really offended by that. </joey>
<joey> Because it's literally from a tap. </joey>
<joey> - So why were you offended? </joey>
<joey> Just go to your tap.
- Well, just sometimes, </joey>
<connor> I wanna get the value of
a meal, like the deal. </connor>
<joey> But I-
- Sometimes I want </joey>
<joey> to support a multi-billion
dollar corporation! </joey>
<connor> - I wanna feel like I got
'em back a little bit. </connor>
<connor> You know, I wanna save
a little bit of money </connor>
<connor> on this rip-off, you know. </connor>
<connor> Because I really like
the McDonald's fries. </connor>
<connor> So I want the fries with the burger. </connor>
<connor> And you have to get a drink, </connor>
<connor> and I don't really know what I want. </connor>
<connor> I don't want milk either, it
just sat there on my fridge. </connor>
<connor> And I would like, I
stabbed it in the carton, </connor>
<connor> squeezed it into my tea. </connor>
<garnt> Really depressingly. </garnt>
<garnt> - You can get milk at McDonald's? </garnt>
<joey> - (laughs) Yes! </joey>
<joey> - Are you lagging, Garnt? </joey>
<garnt> - I was just agreeing, and
then I was like, "Wait. </garnt>
<connor> That doesn't compute in my mind". </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, well it's kids,
kids wanna drink milk. </joey>
<joey> - It's like the golden arches M for milk. </joey>
<garnt> (men laugh) </garnt>
<garnt> - I have never seen milk at McDonald's- </garnt>
<garnt> - Milk. (laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - Because like, I know you can get water- </connor>
<garnt> - It's not on the fucking front of shop, </garnt>
<connor> like "Look, check out
our milk", it's like- </connor>
<garnt> - No, no, no-
- We have milk. </garnt>
<garnt> - I know you can get like, juice boxes. </garnt>
<connor> I know you can get a bottle of water. </connor>
<connor> I've never seen anyone get milk before- </connor>
<connor> - It's because no one fucking-
- Yeah, no one </connor>
<garnt> fucking orders it-
- The expiration date </garnt>
<garnt> on this thing must have
been 10 years past. </garnt>
<joey> I'm pretty sure they fucking dusted it off </joey>
<joey> before they put it in my
fucking Uber Eats order. </joey>
<connor> - Just yogurt at that point.
(Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> Probably what they're
putting into the McFlurries. </connor>
<connor> - I had to fucking carve it out. </connor>
<joey> It was like butter when I got it. </joey>
<connor> It was like fuck it, it was so bad- </connor>
<garnt> - It's why the fucking milkshake machines </garnt>
<garnt> are never working, right. </garnt>
<garnt> Because they just don't have enough milk. </garnt>
<joey> - This motherfucker keeps buying our milk! </joey>
<joey> We need it for the milkshake machine. </joey>
<joey> - That's how I feel whenever I buy </joey>
<connor> my fucking tea from Starbucks. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "I feel like I'm
doing something wrong". </connor>
<joey> - Aw, I didn't even
know you could do that. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, of course you can. (laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, you can buy tea at Starbucks. </connor>
<joey> - Who buys tea at Starbucks? </joey>
<connor> - Well, some of them are okay, actually. </connor>
<connor> But I used to feel like,
now it's a bit more, </connor>
<garnt> I feel like tea's become more mainstream. </garnt>
<garnt> And like-
- Where? </garnt>
<garnt> - It's a fashion statement now- </garnt>
<garnt> - I feel like 10 years ago,
coffee was like, the thing. </garnt>
<garnt> It was like, everyone just, </garnt>
<garnt> this is a weird thing, but in Starbucks, </garnt>
<garnt> it was all about coffee, coffee, coffee. </garnt>
<garnt> Now it's all like, everyone's chilled out. </garnt>
<garnt> You can order a fucking tea,
if you want a fucking tea. </garnt>
<garnt> Is that a weird statement? </garnt>
<joey> I feel like, sometimes I make a point, </joey>
<connor> and I know this is gonna
be a really hard battle </connor>
<connor> to not look weird-
- It's not- </connor>
<garnt> - I just went through
that five minutes ago- </garnt>
<joey> - It's more like, I don't
go to Starbucks enough, </joey>
<joey> to be like, "Oh, there's a
new trend coming in here, </joey>
<joey> ladies and gentlemen, it's tea now". </joey>
<connor> - No, I just remembered that like, </connor>
<connor> I feel like I got mocked
when I ordered tea one time </connor>
<connor> at the Starbucks. </connor>
<joey> - What, by who? </joey>
<connor> - By my classmates. (laughing) </connor>
<joey> - Oh. </joey>
<joey> - When I was like, 15, I ordered a tea. </joey>
<joey> And they were like (scoffs). </joey>
<connor> - At Starbucks.
- Men drink coffee, Connor. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, yeah-
- Men drink coffee- </connor>
<connor> - I feel like, it's more, back then, </connor>
<garnt> why would you go to Starbucks
for anything but a coffee? </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] A coffee, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - I feel like, that's
what it was back then. </connor>
<connor> And now everyone doesn't
really give a fuck, </connor>
<garnt> and you can get what you want. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, I feel in England especially, </garnt>
<garnt> you get a tea, you can get
a tea fucking anywhere. </garnt>
<joey> It's fucking England. </joey>
<garnt> Everyone there drinks tea-
- I think that's what it is. </garnt>
<joey> It's more like, you
could get a tea anywhere. </joey>
<garnt> So why did you get it at Starbucks? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, back, you know, </joey>
<garnt> back when I worked at the BBC Euro- </garnt>
<connor> - There it is-
- Roll credits. </connor>
<garnt> - Roll credits, mark
it off your bingo card- </garnt>
<joey> - Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-
- Bingo! </joey>
<garnt> - No, but yeah, back when
I worked in the office, </garnt>
<garnt> you know, every so
often, with the newbies, </garnt>
<garnt> or the interns, or the graduates, </garnt>
<garnt> they were always on tea duty. </garnt>
<garnt> And I was like that one
person in my entire team </garnt>
<garnt> of like, 20, I'm just like, "Actually, </garnt>
<garnt> can I get a coffee please?" </garnt>
<garnt> Like, literally everyone
around me drank tea! </garnt>
<joey> That's what everyone drinks in England. </joey>
<joey> - And all the interns scoffed at that. </joey>
<joey> Like (scoffs). </joey>
<garnt> - Coffee?
- Coffee? </garnt>
<garnt> - Coffee, what's that? </garnt>
<joey> - We're in England.
- The UK's weird, </joey>
<joey> because like, most British
people don't even drink </joey>
<connor> any other type than English Breakfast tea. </connor>
<connor> Like, I think most people from the UK, </connor>
<connor> if you ask them, "I want a cup of tea", </connor>
<connor> they would not ever even
consider anything else, </connor>
<joey> other than-
- Like they don't specify </joey>
<joey> the type of tea, right-
- Well that's the thing </joey>
<connor> in the UK, if you ask for a cup of tea, </connor>
<garnt> you're getting English Breakfast- </garnt>
<garnt> - Just a, I didn't even know </garnt>
<connor> it was called English Breakfast, right. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, I just knew it was a tea- </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, that's why we have brands, right. </garnt>
<garnt> In the UK, when you say "I want a tea", </garnt>
<joey> you get the same type of tea. </joey>
<joey> - Right, unless you specify, right? </joey>
<joey> - If you sit there in someone's house, </joey>
<connor> and you're like, "Oh, I want a tea". </connor>
<connor> And they're like, "Oh, do you have like, </connor>
<connor> green tea, or some chai",
they'd be like, "What the fuck?" </connor>
<garnt> - No, no, that's-
- This guy. </garnt>
<joey> - Really?
- It's weird- </joey>
<joey> - So if I came into your house in the UK- </joey>
<garnt> - Maybe-
- No, no, </garnt>
<garnt> because if you want a
different kind of tea, </garnt>
<garnt> you have to specify.
- Yeah, right? </garnt>
<connor> - But even then, most houses,
I don't think most houses </connor>
<connor> have other types of tea.
- So if I went </connor>
<joey> into a house and just said, </joey>
<garnt> "Can I have some chamomile tea?" </garnt>
<connor> They'd be like-
- They'd probably be like, </connor>
<connor> "Whoa"-
- Whoa, whoa. </connor>
<connor> Chamomile tea, what the fuck is that? </connor>
<garnt> - [Joey] What the fuck is that? </garnt>
<garnt> - We just have tea.
- I feel like </garnt>
<connor> those types of teas are
almost like luxury teas </connor>
<garnt> in the UK-
- Oh. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, because they always
come in like, fancy packaging. </connor>
<connor> Because like, the British type is like, </connor>
<connor> it comes in like, 500 pack,
because that'll last you </connor>
<connor> one month in the UK. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) Like, if you've
got a family as well... </connor>
<connor> Everyone in your family's drinking tea. </connor>
<connor> So this is like, when
Americans ask me that, </connor>
<connor> what kind of tea are you drinking, Connor? </connor>
<connor> It's like, well, I have a tea, </connor>
<connor> and then I have an afternoon tea. </connor>
<connor> You know, where you try everything. </connor>
<connor> You try the Earl Greys,
you try the other types. </connor>
<connor> But if I'm drinking tea,
I have English Breakfast. </connor>
<connor> - In the morning. </connor>
<garnt> - No, all day-
- All day, all day. </garnt>
<joey> - But it's called English Breakfast. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, but it's, people just drink it </garnt>
<joey> like they drink coffee, it's like a- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, but don't they
call it morning coffee? </joey>
<garnt> - No, no, it's like
Earl Grey, or whatever. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like the type of-
- It's just part </garnt>
<garnt> of British culture. </garnt>
<garnt> You just need to chill out with a cuppa- </garnt>
<connor> - But I realized how strange
it was, when going to America. </connor>
<connor> It's like, that's not at all how it is. </connor>
<connor> - No.
- It's like- </connor>
<garnt> - If you say-
- Americans </garnt>
<garnt> don't drink tea anyway.
- Well, I think they, </garnt>
<joey> (sighs) they kind of do.
- I think they do. </joey>
<garnt> But again, if you order- </garnt>
<joey> - But other countries-
- If you order tea- </joey>
<joey> - Do you know how I know
Americans don't drink tea? </joey>
<joey> - Why?
- Because, have you seen </joey>
<garnt> their fucking kettles?
- That's true, that's true. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like, no culture that drinks tea </garnt>
<garnt> is built around the fucking kettles </garnt>
<garnt> that the Americans use. </garnt>
<connor> - What kind of kettles do Americans use? </connor>
<connor> - Oh, they're just these terrible things. </connor>
<connor> They're these awful
things that can hold like, </connor>
<garnt> maybe 500 mills, not even
enough cups for two people. </garnt>
<garnt> In the UK-
- And you've gotta </garnt>
<connor> put it on the stove, right.
- Oh, those ones. </connor>
<connor> - You put it on the stove, and as a Brit, </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Fucking, the
heat efficiency of this </connor>
<garnt> is giving me clinical depression". </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughs)
"What the fuck is this?" </garnt>
<connor> I'm just like-
- Yeah, you know, </connor>
<connor> when I go to someone's house in the UK, </connor>
<garnt> and they start doing that shit, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, "What are you
doing, what are you doing?" </garnt>
<connor> Come on.
- No, no, no. </connor>
<garnt> I'll tell you the one thing that gave me </garnt>
<garnt> a fucking brain aneurism,
as someone who doesn't even </garnt>
<connor> drink tea, right. </connor>
<garnt> So-
- You don't drink tea? </garnt>
<garnt> You don't drink tea at all? </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm mostly a coffee drinker. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm mostly a coffee drinker.
- Let me tell you about tea. </garnt>
<connor> This thing I don't drink-
- No, no, but anyway- </connor>
<connor> - Tell me about the thing you don't drink- </connor>
<connor> - I don't drink English
Breakfast tea, a lot of times. </connor>
<connor> But I drink green tea-
- He's a fancy motherfucker, </connor>
<garnt> right here-
- Wow, Garnt- </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, I've-
- Think you're better </garnt>
<connor> than us, you think you're
better than the working man? </connor>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - I would say that-
- Because he worked </connor>
<joey> at the BBC.
(men laughs) </joey>
<joey> - I'd say the amount of
tea selection in Asia, </joey>
<connor> just fucking eclipses
whatever we have in England. </connor>
<garnt> - We have that tea.
- You just don't order it. </garnt>
<connor> - You have to go to the
store manager and be like, </connor>
<connor> "Can you unlock the safe?" </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs)
Can you show us </connor>
<connor> the other variations of tea? (chuckles) </connor>
<joey> - The tea you dug up. </joey>
<joey> - You have to like, move all
the other teas in the aisle </joey>
<connor> to the back, so you can grab these things. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's like, you
go to a fucking konbini, </garnt>
<garnt> it's like opening Pandora's boxes of tea. </garnt>
<garnt> You've got an entire fucking selection. </garnt>
<garnt> And in England, like what have you got? </garnt>
<garnt> Like Lipton iced tea? </garnt>
<garnt> That's pretty, I don't even count that </garnt>
<connor> as a fucking tea.
- Well to be fair, </connor>
<connor> in the konbini, in Japan, it is like, </connor>
<connor> "Here's the 59th version of green tea". </connor>
<connor> And it's like, you literally can't make, </connor>
<connor> I don't even actually think
it's chemically possible </connor>
<connor> for there to be 59
variations of green tea. </connor>
<connor> (men laugh) </connor>
<connor> How much molecular division are we doing </connor>
<connor> to these bonds here?
- It's just like </connor>
<joey> leaves they picked from
like the 59th field. </joey>
<connor> - It's absurd, and half of
them taste the fucking same, </connor>
<joey> and it doesn't matter-
- I like this tea, </joey>
<joey> which is like, I don't even
know what the fuck this is. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, you could live
in Japan for five years, </garnt>
<connor> and try a new tea different
day, it's fucking easy. </connor>
<connor> - Well I've tried most of them- </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, you've tried
every Japanese tea, right? </garnt>
<connor> - I can confirm that half of them taste </connor>
<joey> exactly the fucking same, yeah. </joey>
<joey> There was also like, in Japan
they had low fat green teas, </joey>
<joey> or healthy green teas. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, "Green tea is
healthy, what do you mean?" </joey>
<joey> (Joey giggles) </joey>
<joey> What are the-
- Does green tea </joey>
<joey> have calories?
- No, it doesn't- </joey>
<joey> - No, no it doesn't.
- But there's like, </joey>
<joey> healthier versions-
- (laughs) Low calorie </joey>
<joey> green tea, what the fuck is that? </joey>
<joey> - There was like-
- Negative calorie green tea- </joey>
<joey> - It was like, good health green tea. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, "Green tea
is, I actually think, </joey>
<connor> one of the healthiest
teas of all the teas". </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it is. </connor>
<connor> - So what do you mean? </connor>
<garnt> Like, what have they
done to the other teas? </garnt>
<garnt> - Guys, I can do one better. </garnt>
<joey> I've got an idea, zero calorie water- </joey>
<joey> - Shut the fuck up.
(Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> - By drinking it, you lose calories. </joey>
<connor> - But I just, going
back to the whole thing, </connor>
<connor> I just get very amazed, that like, </connor>
<joey> because Americans are always asking </joey>
<joey> people from other countries
like, "What tea do you drink?" </joey>
<joey> They're like, "I drink
Earl Grey, I drink this", </joey>
<joey> it's like, no, no, no, in the
UK, it's not like that at all. </joey>
<connor> Like, that's not how it works. </connor>
<joey> - Are you sure that's not
like, just your household? </joey>
<garnt> - No, no, no, it's all of the UK. </garnt>
<garnt> You go anywhere, you want
a cup of tea, you get it. </garnt>
<connor> Like, no matter where you go-
- Yeah, it's only in the UK </connor>
<garnt> where if you say tea, it
means one type of tea. </garnt>
<joey> And I just always thought, that's tea. </joey>
<joey> That's just tea. </joey>
<garnt> Every other tea it's just
like the branded tea, right. </garnt>
<garnt> - I guess it's the same in Japan as well. </garnt>
<garnt> If you go to someone's household, </garnt>
<garnt> and you ask for ocha, which is tea, </garnt>
<joey> you usually get green
tea unless you specify. </joey>
<garnt> - That's like the default skin in Japan. </garnt>
<connor> - It's also weird, like the
lengths the British will go to, </connor>
<connor> to bring tea with them, or
have a cup of tea available. </connor>
<connor> I remember like, you know, </connor>
<connor> whenever you go camping, or
on an expedition or whatever, </connor>
<connor> I remember there was a
guy, from when we did like, </connor>
<connor> Duke of Edinburgh, who, </connor>
<joey> he drove a car around to keep up with us. </joey>
<joey> But in this thing, there was this whole, </joey>
<joey> massive hot water tank, just for tea. </joey>
<joey> So that we could all have tea. </joey>
<joey> And I didn't think that was weird- </joey>
<joey> - On Duke of Edinburgh? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, so we could
all have a cup of tea </garnt>
<joey> when we were done at the end of the day. </joey>
<joey> Because that's, the British people, </joey>
<joey> that's how you signify the work is down. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, work is done-
- Also, whenever we </joey>
<joey> went paintballing in the
UK, or anything like that, </joey>
<joey> during the break, you get tea.
(Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> It'd be like, you'd be
like fucking warfare, </joey>
<joey> and they'd be like, "Stop, chaps. </joey>
<joey> Time for the tea break".
- Tea break. </joey>
<joey> - And you'd go for a tea break. </joey>
<joey> (laughs) And now that I
think about this out loud- </joey>
<joey> - That's so weird.
- But I'm like, </joey>
<joey> yeah, we go to like, no matter
what you're doing in the UK, </joey>
<garnt> someone is gonna try and
put a cup of tea available. </garnt>
<connor> The stereotype is totally true. </connor>
<connor> - It is totally true. </connor>
<garnt> Like, the best analogy I can think of </garnt>
<garnt> is that to Britons, to Brits, a cup of tea </garnt>
<garnt> is like the equivalent to
a cigarette break, right? </garnt>
<joey> It's just an excuse to put on the kettle, </joey>
<joey> drink a bunch of tea and just
chill out for five minutes. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, we have those in Australia. </garnt>
<joey> We don't have tea breaks, we have smokos. </joey>
<joey> - (laughs) Smokos.
- Yeah, smokos- </joey>
<connor> - Two shots of vodka, and
send you back to work. </connor>
<joey> - Are we allowed a smoko? </joey>
<joey> All right, let's go.
- Getting back to why </joey>
<connor> I know Americans don't drink tea, right- </connor>
<connor> - Kettles are shit.
- Yeah, one, </connor>
<connor> kettles are shit, two, like okay. </connor>
<connor> So, I remember I was staying with Sydney, </connor>
<connor> and she had a little bit of a, </connor>
<garnt> or someone had a sore throat, right. </garnt>
<garnt> So we just needed some warm water. </garnt>
<garnt> Right, and so, how would
you make warm water? </garnt>
<garnt> - Boil it in a kettle-
- Boil it in a kettle, </garnt>
<garnt> and then put, you know,
put the hot water in, </garnt>
<garnt> and then just fill it with cold water. </garnt>
<garnt> So, Sydney takes the mug,
and fills it up with water- </garnt>
<garnt> - I know what you're gonna say. </garnt>
<garnt> - Puts it in the microwave-
- Oh no. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - I knew it was coming.
- Puts it in the microwave, </garnt>
<garnt> and puts on a counter. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm just like, "What
are you doing, Sydney?" </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like I'm getting a brain aneurism, </garnt>
<garnt> just watching this right now-
- That's horrible. </garnt>
<garnt> That's horrible.
- And I was just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "There's no way this is normal". </garnt>
<garnt> There's no way this is fucking normal. </garnt>
<garnt> And so, she says, "No,
it's a normal thing here". </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm just like, "Bet". </garnt>
<garnt> And I tweet, I'm just like, "Americans, </garnt>
<garnt> is this a normal thing to do?" </garnt>
<garnt> And the amount of like, "What's wrong? </garnt>
<garnt> How do you heat up your water?" </garnt>
<garnt> Like, I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "How is this?" </garnt>
<garnt> How have we gone through
thousands of years </garnt>
<garnt> of civilization, to heat
up water in a microwave? </garnt>
<connor> - I'm gonna do my
obligatory insult Americans </connor>
<joey> this podcast.
- Mark that </joey>
<joey> off the bingo-
- Mark off the bingo. </joey>
<joey> (men laugh) </joey>
<joey> - Americans literally think the microwave </joey>
<joey> is the tool from God.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It can just-
- Do everything, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Do everything, fuck. (laughs) </joey>
<joey> "Kitchen Nightmares" has taught me that. </joey>
<joey> I'm kidding, it's totally
reality obviously. </joey>
<joey> I don't know, recently I
abandoned my kettle in Japan. </joey>
<connor> I got rid of it.
- Really? </connor>
<connor> - Because it was, you know,
British kettles are intense. </connor>
<joey> Like-
- (snorts) How so? </joey>
<joey> - You know, when we
boil kettles in the UK, </joey>
<joey> it's done in what, like one minute? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Two minutes max. </joey>
<joey> That's a shit kettle, if
it's any longer than that. </joey>
<joey> You won't get, even the
shittiest of kettles don't take, </joey>
<joey> like, the worst kettles
you find are in hotels. </joey>
<joey> And like, you put the water on, </joey>
<joey> you come back 40 minutes
later, shit's still boiling, </joey>
<joey> making the world's loudest sound somehow. </joey>
<joey> (men imitating bubbling water) </joey>
<joey> It's like, how is this the shittiest. </joey>
<joey> This is a chain, surely
you could have got a deal </joey>
<joey> from the manufacture to
get a not shit kettle- </joey>
<joey> - Half the water's evaporated by the time- </joey>
<joey> - Literally, it's gone
by the time you fucking, </joey>
<joey> what, you've got fucking
200 milliliters of water? </joey>
<joey> It's like, not even fills up the cup. </joey>
<joey> It's absolutely abysmal. </joey>
<joey> It's like wasted half the fucking hotel's </joey>
<joey> electricity as well,
it's fucking dreadful. </joey>
<connor> But, in Japan as well,
they have the same thing, </connor>
<connor> and in America it's the same. </connor>
<connor> The kettles take so God damn long to boil. </connor>
<connor> And they're so shit, I got so tired of it, </connor>
<connor> because I'm streaming, between games. </connor>
<connor> I don't wanna be waiting
for like, five minutes. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly.
- I'm streaming. </connor>
<connor> I can't sit there and wait. </connor>
<connor> So I found, Japan has
these things that I've, </connor>
<connor> again, I've never seen these before. </connor>
<connor> But they're just like,
they have them in konbinis, </connor>
<connor> where it's a boiling water jug. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh, I know the ones- </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, well you can fill the ramen up. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, yes, yes, yes-
- The ones where you like, </connor>
<garnt> can pour it, right?
- It's like a two liter jug, </garnt>
<garnt> or whatever, you fill it up with water, </garnt>
<connor> and then it boils it,
or it doesn't boil it. </connor>
<garnt> You can choose the temperature. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, and it's just always hot. </garnt>
<joey> - It's always hot, and I
think it uses less electricity </joey>
<garnt> than constantly reboiling a kettle. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - And I felt so big brain, because now- </connor>
<joey> - You just have hot water ready- </joey>
<connor> - Literally, I can just go to the thing, </connor>
<connor> put the bag in, boom, hot water. </connor>
<garnt> I'm like, "Shit"-
- Because that's </garnt>
<garnt> what every Asian uses for cup ramen. </garnt>
<connor> That's the cup ramen
machine, and tea machine. </connor>
<connor> - And I'm like, "Shit,
maybe kettles are obsolete". </connor>
<connor> (men laugh) </connor>
<connor> Maybe this is the way. </connor>
<joey> - Goodbye, kettles.
- I was kind of like, </joey>
<connor> "Shit, a kettle has been
the first appliance I buy- </connor>
<garnt> - I'd never thought about it like that. </garnt>
<garnt> Because I've seen that
all the time in Asia. </garnt>
<connor> Because that's just readily available, </connor>
<connor> whenever I come to Thailand, holy shit. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, that's true, that's true. </connor>
<connor> That is more efficient than-
- It's so much more efficient. </connor>
<connor> And you literally have it ready. </connor>
<joey> - But anything's better than
a fucking microwave, okay. </joey>
<garnt> Please don't do that, stop it, get help! </garnt>
<connor> - So, you know, it's called
Sixth Form in the UK, </connor>
<connor> I forgot what it's called in America. </connor>
<garnt> There was a guy, and we like
a microwave and a kettle </garnt>
<garnt> in our dorm room, or chill
room, it was for like, </garnt>
<garnt> your tea is there. </garnt>
<garnt> And this guy was like,
"You want a cup of tea?" </garnt>
<connor> Yeah, I'll have a cup of tea. </connor>
<connor> You won't believe this, man. </connor>
<connor> He puts water in the
cup, puts the tea bag in, </connor>
<connor> and then puts it in the microwave. </connor>
<garnt> - (laughing) Oh my, I'm about to fucking, </garnt>
<connor> I'm about to fucking leave right now. </connor>
<joey> - The entire tea bag?
(Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Like, he pours the water, cold, </joey>
<joey> into the cup with the tea bag, cold- </joey>
<joey> - Oh my God.
- Lets it like, </joey>
<joey> stew, and then puts it in the microwave, </joey>
<joey> and heats it up. </joey>
<joey> And I've never seen anyone else do this. </joey>
<connor> And I'm like, "Who taught you this?" </connor>
<connor> Like, someone had to teach you this. </connor>
<connor> Because no one else would ever do this. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "I bet his
fucking parents are freaks. </connor>
<connor> What else do they do? </connor>
<connor> Do they like, fucking eat their toenails? </connor>
<connor> Like, what else is going
on in this household". </connor>
<connor> Like, you can't trust them
when they do that shit. </connor>
<joey> - It's like the family was like, </joey>
<garnt> "Let's make some tea", and it's cold- </garnt>
<connor> - And then I-
- And then one day </connor>
<connor> they discovered, people drink tea hot. </connor>
<joey> - And then I realized, I'm like, </joey>
<joey> "Shit, this is the most
British thing ever". </joey>
<joey> Because he got shit for it,
for like a year and a half. </joey>
<joey> - I think you could be an American </joey>
<joey> and get shit-
- He literally got bullied </joey>
<joey> for a year and a half
for making tea wrong. </joey>
<connor> Isn't that the most British
thing you've ever heard? </connor>
<joey> - Well deserved, if you ask me- </joey>
<joey> - And honestly, he had it coming. </joey>
<garnt> Jesus Christ.
- Honestly, </garnt>
<joey> like you know that fucking meme, </joey>
<joey> where if aliens ever invaded humanity, </joey>
<garnt> and they have to blend in with the crowd? </garnt>
<garnt> That's the kind of shit
we would look out for, </garnt>
<joey> to be like, "Oh, you're a
fucking imposter, aren't ya"- </joey>
<joey> - I too make tea, human.
(Garnt laughs) </joey>
<connor> (men laughing) </connor>
<connor> It's like the most alien move ever. </connor>
<joey> Cup of tea. </joey>
<garnt> - Honestly, there's nothing more British </garnt>
<garnt> than being like, very
possessive over our tea, </garnt>
<garnt> and being very protective over our tea. </garnt>
<connor> - Did I tell you about
the shittiest cup of tea </connor>
<connor> my brother ever made me? </connor>
<connor> - Okay.
- Go on. </connor>
<connor> - He made two of them,
he made two of them. </connor>
<connor> - Go on. </connor>
<connor> - You know, and this is the problem, </connor>
<connor> when you kind of do it half right, </connor>
<connor> and then fuck up one step,
is that it looks good, </connor>
<connor> it smells good, it looks as it should. </connor>
<joey> So the first time he did it for me, </joey>
<joey> I asked him to make me a cup of tea, </joey>
<joey> and he reluctantly said yes. </joey>
<joey> Can't remember how I convinced him. </joey>
<joey> Because he would never
do anything like that. </joey>
<joey> He's a brother, he never
does anything nice for me. </joey>
<joey> - Must have been in a good mood. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I must have done something right. </joey>
<joey> So he makes me a cup of
tea, and I'm drinking it. </joey>
<connor> And I'm like, "Mm", and I get to the end, </connor>
<connor> and like, (spitting loudly). </connor>
<connor> He fucking ripped the bag open. </connor>
<connor> (men cracking up) </connor>
<connor> He thought, because he'd never
made a cup of tea before. </connor>
<joey> So assumed the bag was like-
- What's all this shit </joey>
<joey> in this bag? (laughs) </joey>
<joey> Rip.
- Because, I think, </joey>
<joey> I think what happened was, </joey>
<joey> is that he'd had instant coffee before. </joey>
<joey> - Right, right-
- And he thought, </joey>
<joey> he thought it looked like instant coffee. </joey>
<garnt> So he thought that you rip the bag open, </garnt>
<garnt> pour in the perfectly
portioned instant tea. </garnt>
<garnt> And then, (laughs) he stirred it. </garnt>
<garnt> And I get to the end of
this, and I'm fucking choking </garnt>
<joey> on these shitty tea leaves! </joey>
<joey> And then I scolded him, I
never let him forget it. </joey>
<joey> And then again, like a year or two later, </joey>
<joey> he makes me another cup of tea, right. </joey>
<joey> - How can you fuck up a
cup of tea more than once? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, right, this is it. </joey>
<garnt> So this was actually at
the paintballing place. </garnt>
<garnt> Because I remember this. </garnt>
<joey> - Doing your tea break-
- Literally fucking freezing, </joey>
<joey> right, we're covered in mud. </joey>
<garnt> I'm just like, "Oh, I just
want a good cup of tea". </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, because my little brother, </garnt>
<connor> some of his friends are my friends. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, "You're on the tea duty". </connor>
<connor> So he goes to make a cup
of tea for me and like, </connor>
<connor> six other people. </connor>
<connor> And I swear, it must have been like, </connor>
<connor> you know, it was like some kind of </connor>
<connor> cult poisoning-esque thing. </connor>
<connor> Because, we'd all drink our tea, </connor>
<connor> and when we get to the bottom,
he fucking left the bag in. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> He put the milk in, right? </connor>
<garnt> So you can't see the bag-
- You can't see the bag. </garnt>
<garnt> - And then, when you get to it, </garnt>
<garnt> and it fucking tea fucking
bag hit me in the face! </garnt>
<joey> - You literally got tea bagged. </joey>
<joey> (men laugh) </joey>
<joey> - I got fucking, the tea bag
hit me in the god damn face! </joey>
<joey> And like, "What the fuck!"
- Ah! </joey>
<joey> - I'm like, "You're British,
you're 15 years of age, </joey>
<connor> you have no excuse, this
should never have happened". </connor>
<connor> Literally, there should have
been things to stop this. </connor>
<connor> Isn't this what school is for? </connor>
<joey> - Of all the different ways
you could have fucked up tea, </joey>
<garnt> he did all of them. </garnt>
<connor> - Pretty he could be </connor>
<connor> exiled from England for doing that. </connor>
<garnt> - Right!
(men laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm pretty sure a lot of British people </garnt>
<garnt> would kick you out of their house </garnt>
<connor> if you made their tea like that. </connor>
<connor> - Probably why Brexit happened, right. </connor>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<connor> They're like, "Fucking
Europeans can't make a good </connor>
<garnt> cup of tea", out.
- Gone. </garnt>
<joey> - This episode is sponsored by Harry's. </joey>
<connor> - Boys, you look like you need a shave. </connor>
<connor> Thank God Harry's is
sponsoring us, am I right? </connor>
<garnt> - [Garnt] With Harry's,
you don't need to choose </garnt>
<garnt> between having a great
shave and a fair price. </garnt>
<garnt> - Damn right.
- Neither should any guy </garnt>
<garnt> in their life, especially Connor. </garnt>
<garnt> And with Father's day
right around the corner, </garnt>
<garnt> there's never been a
better time to try or share </garnt>
<connor> the Harry's experience.
- Thank you dad. </connor>
<connor> Let me tell you about the time
when I used Harry's (laughs). </connor>
<connor> - It's okay, son. </connor>
<connor> - I know we're no
strangers to memeing here, </connor>
<connor> but this is legitimately a good razor, </connor>
<connor> and I use it, and I keep asking them </connor>
<connor> to send me more, personally, </connor>
<connor> because it's actually that good. </connor>
<connor> I highly recommend it,
and it lasts a while. </connor>
<connor> It's really fucking good. </connor>
<connor> Just, no bull shit, no cap.
- No cap. </connor>
<garnt> - Thank you very much, son. </garnt>
<garnt> Other son, tell me about Harry's. </garnt>

<garnt> - Sons, I'd say that's
a pretty special offer. </garnt>
<garnt> - Thank you father, back to the episode. </garnt>
<garnt> - I am curious though, Joey. </garnt>
<garnt> So, what's the one sign you look for, </garnt>
<garnt> to know that you're
talking to a true Aussie? </garnt>
<garnt> Because for us Brits, it
all revolves around tea. </garnt>
<garnt> What's Australia patriotic about? </garnt>
<connor> - (laughs) That's a
good question, because- </connor>
<joey> - How many cockroaches have you eaten? </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> - How many, do you spray? </joey>
<connor> Not a true Aussie. (laughs) </connor>
<joey> I don't know, I'm not very patriotic. </joey>
<joey> So-
- No, no, no. </joey>
<garnt> Because I was like,
England's not very patriotic. </garnt>
<garnt> But when it comes to tea, </garnt>
<joey> yeah, we're fucking
patriotic as fuck over our- </joey>
<connor> - Are we not patriotic? </connor>
<connor> I feel like, I don't
know, I've met a lot of- </connor>
<connor> - I mean, not to say-
- Way too patriotic people. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah I mean, not to say like, </connor>
<connor> I don't love my country or whatever, </connor>
<joey> but like, I don't know, I just, </joey>
<connor> I guess maybe (sighs), God. </connor>
<connor> It's hard with Australia, because I feel </connor>
<connor> it's such a melting pot
of different cultures, </connor>
<connor> that all of my friends in high school </connor>
<connor> had something specific about their family </connor>
<connor> that made it very distinctively Aussie. </connor>
<connor> But I'd say like, I don't know, </connor>
<joey> maybe the type of beer you drink. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> - The type of what?
- I drink real, </joey>
<connor> Australian beer.
- Oh, the type of beer. </connor>
<garnt> - Fosters.
- Yeah, if you say </garnt>
<garnt> Fosters, then you are getting
exiled from Australia. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know, and then I guess like, </garnt>
<garnt> what you order at a pub. </garnt>
<connor> I don't know-
- Yeah, basically. </connor>
<joey> - We don't really have-
- This sounds like </joey>
<connor> the "40 Year Old Virgin" scene, </connor>
<garnt> where he's describing how
it feels to feel a boob. </garnt>
<connor> Where it's just like,
not even remotely real. </connor>
<connor> It's like, Joey'd be like,
"It's the type of beer </connor>
<joey> they order"-
- I don't know. </joey>
<garnt> I'm just throwing guesses out there- </garnt>
<joey> - Feels like a bag of sand! </joey>
<connor> - Right.
- Bag of sand, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I love that fucking scene. </connor>
<garnt> - Fucking brilliant scene. </garnt>
<garnt> - If you get that reference,
that'll make a lot of sense. </garnt>
<joey> If you don't, it'll make no fucking sense. </joey>
<joey> - Go watch the "40 Year Old Virgin". </joey>
<connor> - If you haven't, watch
that film, it's great. </connor>
<joey> - I don't know, like-
- You're like, </joey>
<joey> I feel like you're-
- With Aussies, </joey>
<connor> it's just, you start talking to them, </connor>
<connor> and then you kind of get a sense of it. </connor>
<connor> Right, like you just know, </connor>
<connor> you know how much of
an Aussie an Aussie is </connor>
<joey> with the way that they
interact in conversation, </joey>
<joey> and the way that you get
immediately close to them. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I feel that as well. </garnt>
<garnt> For me, whenever I meet an Aussie, </garnt>
<garnt> I have this thing where
it's like, the CPM. </garnt>
<connor> Like you know-
(Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> Music has beats per minute? </connor>
<connor> So, when you talk to an Aussie, </connor>
<connor> they have cunts per minute-
(Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> Right. </connor>
<joey> Where (laughs)-
- I'm so confused. </joey>
<joey> - I was like, cost per million? </joey>
<joey> What? </joey>
<joey> - No, like the amount of
times they use the C-word </joey>
<joey> in a single sentence. </joey>
<connor> You can fucking count that shit, </connor>
<garnt> (laughs) and put it as
a CPM, I swear to God. </garnt>
<garnt> - That is true, that is true. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't know what your
typing words per minute is. </connor>
<joey> I wanna know what your CPM is. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, what's your CPM? </connor>
<joey> (men laugh) </joey>
<joey> No, that is true. </joey>
<joey> We call our mates C-word,
and we call C-words mates. </joey>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> That's how it works in Australia. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] That's exactly how it works! </connor>
<joey> - If you see a friend
from across the street, </joey>
<joey> and you want to call out to them, </joey>
<joey> you'd be like, "Oy, cunt". </joey>
<joey> But if you bump into someone at a pub, </joey>
<joey> you'd be like, "Oy, mate?" </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> I feel like, if you hear
an Aussie doing that, </joey>
<joey> that's a true Aussie. </joey>
<joey> If they're not afraid to say the C-word. </joey>
<garnt> - Going back to like, the
fucking bugs and spiders, </garnt>
<garnt> as someone who did grow up in Australia, </garnt>
<garnt> some of the shit you've seen,
do they scare you at all? </garnt>
<garnt> Or are you just unfazed by them now? </garnt>
<joey> - I'm only scared if
I know it's poisonous. </joey>
<joey> - Okay.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> So like, there was this insect, </joey>
<joey> so on "Journey Across
Japan", talked about it </joey>
<joey> a couple of episodes ago, </joey>
<joey> but we went into this
area, where there was a lot </joey>
<joey> of creepy crawlies, and Chris was not okay </joey>
<joey> with any of the creepy crawlies. </joey>
<connor> The trooper he is, he's not
okay with any creepy crawlies. </connor>
<garnt> And there was this one
particular insect that I saw, </garnt>
<garnt> which, I mean you'll see
it hopefully in the episode </garnt>
<garnt> when it comes out, but the
only way I can describe it </garnt>
<garnt> is it looks like a centipede
and a cockroach had a baby. </garnt>
<garnt> That's what it looks like. </garnt>
<garnt> It moves around like a cockroach, </garnt>
<garnt> but it's kind of got
the body of a centipede. </garnt>
<garnt> It is like, true nightmare fuel. </garnt>
<garnt> - What the fuck? (laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - I don't even know,
Moona, I don't even know </connor>
<connor> if you wanna like, put
the image on the screen </connor>
<connor> or whatever, but like, yeah it's horrible. </connor>
<connor> So like, I saw that in this little area. </connor>
<connor> Chris obviously freaked the fuck out. </connor>
<connor> And I was freaking out,
because I didn't know, </connor>
<joey> because I think there's
a breed of centipede </joey>
<joey> in Japan that's poisonous. </joey>
<garnt> So I-
- Aren't all centipedes </garnt>
<garnt> poisonous?
- Not all of them. </garnt>
<connor> - Okay.
- No, some of them </connor>
<connor> taste good. </connor>
<joey> (men laugh) </joey>
<joey> - That's what my dad said. </joey>
<joey> (men laugh) </joey>
<garnt> - I'm pretty sure they're edible. </garnt>
<connor> - Are they?
- Yeah, of course. </connor>
<joey> - I'm sure they are-
- Fantastic source of protein. </joey>
<garnt> - I'm pretty sure
cockroaches are edible too, </garnt>
<joey> but I don't wanna eat them. </joey>
<joey> I'll give it to my dad. (laughs) </joey>
<connor> - That's why I love the food
on "Kitchen Nightmares", </connor>
<joey> because it always comes free with them. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> But like, I didn't know
if that was the breed </connor>
<garnt> of poisonous centipede. </garnt>
<garnt> But that's what was freaking me out. </garnt>
<joey> Was like, if this thing is
poisonous, then I'm scared. </joey>
<joey> - Joey's like, "Get out
the fucking Pokedexes"- </joey>
<joey> - No, I legitimately said-
- Does this look like </joey>
<garnt> a poison type?
- I literally, </garnt>
<garnt> on the spot, I looked it up. </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, "Poisonous centipede, Japan". </garnt>
<garnt> And I looked it up, and I referenced it. </garnt>
<joey> And I was like, "Okay, it's not it". </joey>
<connor> - So the filtered version,
with the nice one. </connor>
<connor> You're looking at it like, "Fuck". </connor>
<joey> - Expectations versus reality. </joey>
<connor> - It's got like, a mad
filter on it here dude. </connor>
<connor> Fuck it's-
- Yeah, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> It's like, because you know,
obviously because there's </connor>
<connor> lots of creepy crawlies
and shit in Australia. </connor>
<garnt> But like, the reason why
I'm scared of a lot of them </garnt>
<garnt> is because a lot of them can kill me. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean-
- And I'm not okay with that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Listen, I don't like bugs at all. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm frankly quite terrified of them. </garnt>
<connor> But, I'll deal with them still. </connor>
<connor> I think that's, you know-
- That's admirable. </connor>
<joey> - That's manly.
- Yeah, that's admirable. </joey>
<joey> - Admitting that you're a little bitch, </joey>
<connor> and then dealing with it
anyway, that's real men. </connor>
<joey> - Like, if I know it's not
poisonous, I'll fucking touch it. </joey>
<garnt> - But like, at what point
do you see an insect </garnt>
<connor> or creepy crawly-
- I don't get scared </connor>
<connor> by any singular insect. </connor>
<joey> It's like, the thing
that terrifies me most- </joey>
<joey> - Collections of insects?
- Is like, swarms. </joey>
<garnt> - Well yeah.
- Well, of course. </garnt>
<joey> - But like-
- No one's gonna be like, </joey>
<joey> "Hell yeah".
- But okay, okay- </joey>
<joey> - Like, swarms of anything
terrifies the fuck out of me. </joey>
<joey> Like, there was a video, and it was like, </joey>
<joey> "South Australian farm gets
overrun by a horde of mice". </joey>
<joey> - Of mice?
- I shit you not, dude. </joey>
<joey> It looked like the floor was moving. </joey>
<joey> There were so many mice
running, it was terrifying. </joey>
<joey> And if I'm seeing that,
that's my farm, I'm like, </joey>
<joey> "Well, I'm out of a job,
have it, it's yours". </joey>
<joey> - Guess I'll die.
- It's your farm. </joey>
<garnt> What the fuck am I gonna do? </garnt>
<garnt> - I feel like there are
so many stories I hear </garnt>
<garnt> from just talking to Australians, </garnt>
<garnt> that I'm just like, "How much did God </garnt>
<garnt> just hate Australia, and yet people still </garnt>
<garnt> have found a way to live there?" </garnt>
<joey> - Okay, to be fair, my
place, my parents' place, </joey>
<connor> is like, our backyard is
right next to a national park. </connor>
<connor> So our house is basically just
a house for creepy crawlies. </connor>
<connor> It was like the first destination. </connor>
<connor> Like, we got snakes and
spiders all the fucking time. </connor>
<joey> But after a while, we're just like, </joey>
<joey> I mean, we do live right
in the fucking bush, </joey>
<connor> so whatever-
- I always wondered, </connor>
<connor> is there, was there an old Medieval method </connor>
<joey> of determining what's poisonous or not? </joey>
<joey> Or would they just give it to some poor- </joey>
<joey> - Trial by fire, isn't it? </joey>
<garnt> - Was it really just-
- I've always thought </garnt>
<garnt> about this, like-
- They must have had </garnt>
<connor> just one rich guy who was
like, "Well, random bunch </connor>
<connor> of the people who"-
- Yeah, how do you think </connor>
<joey> people discovered what
mushrooms were poisonous? </joey>
<connor> - Isn't that tragic though? </connor>
<connor> You're just like, "Oh hi, what's your job? </connor>
<connor> Well I'm a poison tester. </connor>
<garnt> I'm three for three at the moment". </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - Do you know-
- Hoping tomorrow </connor>
<connor> will go well.
- But do you know what </connor>
<garnt> blows my mind, how the fuck
did like, people in Japan </garnt>
<connor> figure out which part of the
puffer fish wasn't poisonous? </connor>
<connor> Like-
- Also why- </connor>
<garnt> - How many people had to die
to know the exact methods- </garnt>
<connor> - But why also, did someone
die, they were like, </connor>
<joey> "We're gonna try it again". (laughs) </joey>
<garnt> (men laugh) </garnt>
<connor> - One more time.
- Guys, guys, guys. </connor>
<connor> We're 100 to zero on the
puffer fish right now, </connor>
<garnt> but maybe, maybe this one time. </garnt>
<joey> - There has to be somewhere
on this thing that's edible, </joey>
<connor> right?
- I just feel like, </connor>
<connor> after you find out something is poisonous, </connor>
<connor> I think it's okay to give
up, and not eat it, you know? </connor>
<connor> That's what I thought. </connor>
<joey> Is it-
- It's like, </joey>
<joey> "We gotta make sure, the
last guy might have had like, </joey>
<joey> side effects that he had beforehand"- </joey>
<garnt> - Have you had their puffer fish? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, couple times. </connor>
<garnt> - I've heard it's very underwhelming. </garnt>
<connor> - It's not great.
- Listen, if I'm gonna die, </connor>
<connor> I want it to be nut worthy, right? </connor>
<connor> Like, I want the risk
to be worth the reward. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, of course. </joey>
<joey> - And it just looks like
really shitty sushi. </joey>
<connor> Not sushi, what's-
- What does it even </connor>
<garnt> taste like?
- Nothing. </garnt>
<garnt> - (laughs) That's what I've heard. </garnt>
<connor> - It actually tastes like nothing- </connor>
<joey> - That's what I've heard, like- </joey>
<connor> - It's just grown men wanting to die. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
- No, it's literally </joey>
<joey> just a status symbol. </joey>
<joey> It's to just say that
you've had a puffer fish. </joey>
<garnt> - Because I've seen the videos, </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm just like, "This just looks like </garnt>
<joey> you're eating fucking
cardboard", you know. </joey>
<garnt> It doesn't look like
you're eating anything- </garnt>
<garnt> - Actually, you do know
what it tastes like? </garnt>
<connor> The soy sauce that you dip it in. </connor>
<joey> That's what it tastes like. </joey>
<joey> - I love unagi. Unagi is one
of my favorite Japanese dishes. </joey>
<connor> And I found out on Saturday, </connor>
<connor> if you cook it incorrectly,
it's fucking poisonous. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - No one told me that.
- Is it? </joey>
<joey> - That's why it's so expensive. </joey>
<connor> - It's poisonous as fuck. It can kill you. </connor>
<garnt> - You know, I'll fucking risk it. </garnt>
<garnt> That's one thing I will risk! </garnt>
<connor> Because it fucking slaps.
- And then, </connor>
<connor> I was like, "The element of
danger adds to the taste now". </connor>
<connor> Frankly, but if it's
not very good tasting- </connor>
<joey> - I feel like that's why a lot of people </joey>
<joey> eat puffer fish as well. </joey>
<garnt> It's like, the element of
danger adds to the taste. </garnt>
<garnt> Whatever taste-
- Why does everyone </garnt>
<joey> just wanna die? </joey>
<joey> - (laughs) Do you reckon
there's a guy out there </joey>
<connor> who's just like, "God, kill me. </connor>
<joey> I hope it's this time around". </joey>
<joey> - I'm pretty sure that's whoever like, </joey>
<joey> you know, I get it, right. </joey>
<connor> Because you know when you
see poisonous berries? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- I still really </connor>
<connor> wanna try them, because
they look so delicious. </connor>
<connor> - Do you?
- Yeah, because in the UK </connor>
<connor> there's so many poisonous berries. </connor>
<connor> - Is there?
- That's how nature </connor>
<connor> fucks with you, dude. </connor>
<connor> It's the ones that look the most delicious </connor>
<joey> that'll kill you.
- Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> Because those bright little red things. </joey>
<garnt> You know, you see them everywhere- </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah! (laughs) </garnt>
<joey> - Oh, okay. </joey>
<joey> - That look so fucking
delicious when you're a kid. </joey>
<joey> - They look like mini tomatoes, right? </joey>
<connor> - I just wanna have a,
mm, get a bunch of those </connor>
<connor> and see what happens, you know? </connor>
<joey> - (laughs) Just see what happens. </joey>
<garnt> - See what happens.
- That's probably how, </garnt>
<connor> that's probably how people found out </connor>
<connor> they were poisonous, right? </connor>
<garnt> - Well I get it. </garnt>
<connor> Okay, let's say, you know,
you haven't got much food. </connor>
<connor> You know, you're struggling, all right. </connor>
<connor> You have a wander through the forest, </connor>
<garnt> and you see a bunch of, you see a bush. </garnt>
<joey> Enough food for the family. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughs)
- Enough food </joey>
<joey> to kill the family!
- Nobody told you </joey>
<joey> that they're poisonous, you know. </joey>
<connor> Like also, who got poisoned
by mushrooms, like, </connor>
<connor> "No, no, no, no, it must just
be this type of mushroom". </connor>
<connor> And goes out, and tries another one. </connor>
<connor> That's like, a very bold thing. </connor>
<joey> Like who's doing this? </joey>
<garnt> - Well, someone had to, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Someone did it back in the day- </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm convinced it must have been people </garnt>
<garnt> with too much money being
like, "I will literally </garnt>
<garnt> pay you $1,000"-
- Probably. </garnt>
<connor> - Like, when's the "Mr.
Beast" video coming out? </connor>
<connor> Where he's like, "I pay people
$100,000 to try mushrooms, </connor>
<connor> to find out which one's poisonous. </connor>
<connor> How much shiitake mushroom will kill you?" </connor>
<joey> - Eat mushrooms, last one to
survive wins a million dollars. </joey>
<joey> - Oh no, if you want people to do it, </joey>
<garnt> just make it a fucking
TikTok challenge, yeah? </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like, "So I found this
mushroom in my cupboard". </garnt>
<garnt> (Connor laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - TikTok mushroom challenge, let's go- </garnt>
<joey> - The deathcap challenge.
(men laugh) </joey>
<joey> Today I'm eating a deathcap. </joey>
<connor> Hope I survive. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh my God.
- You know, </garnt>
<garnt> I think I would rather try my luck </garnt>
<garnt> eating a poisonous mushroom, </garnt>
<garnt> and just try my chance at surviving, </garnt>
<connor> as opposed to putting my hand
on my iPhone for four days. </connor>
<connor> You know, for that keep
your hand on the iPhone? </connor>
<joey> - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Oh, that one, that one. </joey>
<connor> - I think I would rather
poison myself than do that </connor>
<connor> for four days, that
sounds fucking horrible. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I know.
- I'm sure the pain </joey>
<joey> would be over with in two days. </joey>
<joey> If you just get to go to the
hospital, get it all sorted. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, get slight arthritis,
and you'll be all right. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, if it's not a bad one. </joey>
<joey> You know, I'm sure there's
mushrooms out there </joey>
<connor> that just make you like, very much vomit. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, probably.
- I'm pretty sure </joey>
<joey> that's what-
- Which one </joey>
<joey> would you rather, Garnt? </joey>
<connor> Would you rather vomit
profusely for like, four hours? </connor>
<garnt> Or would you rather put
your hand on an iPhone </garnt>
<garnt> for four hours and you can't sleep. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, you mean for four days? </garnt>
<joey> - Four days, four days,
yeah not four hours. </joey>
<joey> That's very easy.
(men laugh) </joey>
<joey> - Oh no!
- Oh no. </joey>
<connor> - Four hours.
- Four hours. </connor>
<connor> - Listen, have you ever tried
to stay up past one day? </connor>
<garnt> - Dude like, how long is the
longest you've stayed up? </garnt>
<joey> - Like, a day and a half.
- Me, for me, </joey>
<garnt> it's like 36 hours.
- Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - 36 hours for me-
- And that's where </joey>
<joey> it starts to get like, fucking weird. </joey>
<joey> Like, your brain starts to
want to turn off desperately. </joey>
<garnt> So like, and I feel like by the third day, </garnt>
<garnt> what on earth is going through your head? </garnt>
<garnt> But I couldn't do that. </garnt>
<garnt> And that's why I would just
rather eat the fucking mushroom </garnt>
<connor> that might poison me. </connor>
<connor> Meiling, can you Google that? </connor>
<connor> Is there any mushrooms
that'll just make me </connor>
<connor> throw up a little bit?
- Like a little? </connor>
<connor> - Like not kill me, but like-
(Garnt laughs) </connor>
<joey> (laughs) Is this an option? </joey>
<joey> I just wanna make sure.
- Is this an option? </joey>
<garnt> Is this DLC?
- I'll only start playing </garnt>
<connor> with fair rules here.
- In this line, </connor>
<connor> I mean I wouldn't want
to do either, personally. </connor>
<garnt> But personally, both sounds like hell. </garnt>
<connor> - Listen, someone's come up with it, </connor>
<connor> and they'll be like, "Now
it's the mushroom cleanse". </connor>
<garnt> You know-
- The mushroom cleanse! </garnt>
<garnt> - This mushroom will detox your body. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, because it's making
you fucking lose it all! </garnt>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<garnt> That's what they're doing, man. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my god.
- Muscarine. </garnt>
<connor> - Muscarine.
- Muscarine. </connor>
<connor> - What does it make you do? </connor>
<joey> - [Meilin] For I guess,
after 15, 30 minutes, </joey>
<connor> you'll start getting diarrhea
and decreased blood pressure. </connor>
<connor> - Oh wow-
- That sounds pretty bad. </connor>
<garnt> - That sounds-
- That sounds pretty bad. </garnt>
<connor> - [Meilin] Severe vomiting, but
you recover within 24 hours. </connor>
<garnt> - Okay, that's good then.
- Brilliant. </garnt>
<connor> What was it called again? </connor>
<connor> - [Meilin] Muscaria? </connor>
<connor> - Muscary challenge.
- Muscary challenge. </connor>
<connor> (men laugh) </connor>
<joey> - I'm kidding, I'm kidding. </joey>
<garnt> - We've got 50 reasons we
are joking, this is a joke, </garnt>
<connor> this I not real.
- For legal reasons, </connor>
<garnt> this is a joke.
- We are joking around. </garnt>
<connor> Please don't do that.
- That's only 10% less deadly </connor>
<connor> than the cinnamon challenge,
so really, it's okay. </connor>
<connor> Makes you wonder how
that was ever allowed- </connor>
<joey> - God, remember the
fucking cinnamon challenge? </joey>
<garnt> Did you guys ever do that? </garnt>
<garnt> - No. </garnt>
<connor> I've never done any, the
only challenge I've done </connor>
<connor> is like, the ice bucket challenge. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I did the ice bucket challenge. </connor>
<joey> - That's like-
- That was for a good cause. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, that was for a good cause. </garnt>
<connor> - Also, it's pretty tame-
- Easy. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's like, breathe
oxygen for 20 minute challenge. </garnt>
<connor> It's like, "Well I guess I'll"... </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, you get mild
discomfort for like, a second. </garnt>
<garnt> That was the ice bucket challenge, right? </garnt>
<connor> - I got tagged on it,
I never did it though, </connor>
<connor> because I was feeling quite lazy. </connor>
<connor> And I didn't wanna get a bucket. </connor>
<connor> I didn't wanna get a, where
do you get a bucket big enough </connor>
<connor> when you're like, 15? </connor>
<garnt> - I don't know-
- Borrow from your dad. </garnt>
<garnt> - From, did your house not have one? </garnt>
<connor> - Probably somewhere, I
just didn't wanna find it. </connor>
<garnt> - Just like a mop and bucket, right? </garnt>
<connor> Every house has a-
- Or just get like a- </connor>
<connor> - Like a fucking mop bucket over my head. </connor>
<joey> - Or just get a big pot.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - That's what some of my friends did. </joey>
<connor> - Well I mean, perhaps when I was 15, </connor>
<connor> maybe I should have been... </connor>
<joey> You know, I wasn't too
fond on doing it anyway </joey>
<joey> when I was a kid, so-
(Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> I was like, "Oh, I don't
have a bucket, oh fuck"- </joey>
<joey> - I hate charity, obviously. </joey>
<joey> - Well no, that's the thing though! </joey>
<joey> Shit like this, it's always like, </joey>
<connor> what is me, a 15 year
old kid on my Facebook </connor>
<connor> with 200 friends, what is this gonna help? </connor>
<garnt> - Oh yeah, this was pre YouTube wasn't it. </garnt>
<connor> - This was pre YouTube.
- No, no, no. </connor>
<connor> No it wasn't.
- For Connor. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh, for you, yeah.
- This was like, </garnt>
<garnt> when I was high school, when
this was just coming out. </garnt>
<garnt> And I just thought, really silly Connor. </garnt>
<connor> What are you gonna contribute here, huh? </connor>
<connor> Little bit of an ego boost for that, </connor>
<connor> in taking part in something, huh? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, just do it with your mates. </connor>
<garnt> - What is it Connor? </garnt>
<connor> Come on, what are you fucking helping? </connor>
<garnt> You're not doing this for charity, Connor. </garnt>
<garnt> You're doing this because
your friend tagged you. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly.
- Can't even get </garnt>
<joey> the clout from it.
- What's the point? </joey>
<joey> What's the point? </joey>
<joey> - Why donate to charity, when
you can't get clout for it? </joey>
<connor> - Well no, when I was 15, </connor>
<connor> 15 year olds that donate to charity </connor>
<connor> are like the biggest dick 15 year olds. </connor>
<connor> They're like, "I've got
like, 10 bucks, have it. </connor>
<connor> Have, I don't even, I could
have bought something good </connor>
<connor> with this". (laughs) </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<joey> - What the fuck? </joey>
<connor> - (laughs) Like I feel
like, I'm not gonna lie. </connor>
<joey> When I was 15, I probably didn't
give any money to charity, </joey>
<joey> because I didn't have any-
- Well yeah, obviously. </joey>
<garnt> - Well, most of us didn't have any money- </garnt>
<connor> - When I did, though, </connor>
<connor> it was like, when my mum gave me a pound. </connor>
<joey> And she was like, you
know when it was like, </joey>
<garnt> when you're in school
- Oh, the old clothes day. </garnt>
<garnt> Old clothes day, yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - I'd give a pound, and be
like, "It's on me, it's on me". </connor>
<connor> (men laugh) </connor>
<joey> God.
- This is not from my mom. </joey>
<joey> I swear. </joey>
<garnt> - Guys, guys, don't worry. </garnt>
<garnt> I'll break out the-
- We all got this </garnt>
<joey> from our parents, right?
- Yeah, I got change, guys. </joey>
<joey> - That's just what I hated doing. </joey>
<garnt> Like, I wish there was
some kind of system where, </garnt>
<garnt> why do I gotta be the
messenger for my mom's money? </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey snorts)
Why do I gotta </garnt>
<garnt> bring this shit in?
- What do you mean </garnt>
<garnt> the messenger?
- Like, </garnt>
<garnt> surely, can't you collect
this shit from my parents? </garnt>
<joey> Why do I have to bring
in money from my parents? </joey>
<joey> You know, and-
- It's a pound. </joey>
<joey> You're not carrying a
fucking briefcase of cash. </joey>
<joey> - I'd just spend it, you know. </joey>
<connor> I just (laughs), I never did, actually. </connor>
<joey> - I knew people in my school
who'd just fucking spend it. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, there was plenty of good places. </joey>
<garnt> In my town, there's a thing
called a pound bakery. </garnt>
<garnt> - Mm-hmm.
- Did you ever </garnt>
<garnt> have one of these?
- No. </garnt>
<garnt> Bregs?
- No, no. </garnt>
<garnt> It's even cheaper than Bregs.
- Oh, shit. </garnt>
<connor> - You could get two pasties for a pound. </connor>
<garnt> - What the fuck's a pastie? </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yeah, a pastie is a
very British thing as well. </garnt>
<garnt> I've realized this after moving out. </garnt>
<joey> - You don't know what a pastie is? </joey>
<connor> - Like a pastry? </connor>
<connor> - Well yeah-
- Kind of. </connor>
<garnt> - Pastry, but it's got
like, there's a lot of meat </garnt>
<connor> inside of it-
- Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> It's got some meat, potatoes.
- So, let me tell you </garnt>
<connor> the most popular fillings for pasties- </connor>
<garnt> - Okay, yeah-
- Cheese and onion. </garnt>
<garnt> Which is a bunch of cheese and onion. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like okay, thank you. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like a beef pastie as well, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - There's a kidney and-
- Kidney... </garnt>
<connor> - Kidney and steak?
- Yeah, yeah- </connor>
<joey> - Like a pie? </joey>
<garnt> - Kind of, kind of but-
- Pastry- </garnt>
<garnt> - More pastry-
- I'm not a big fan </garnt>
<connor> of pies, pies are a little
too thick, the crust. </connor>
<connor> They're really popular-
- Like a sausage roll? </connor>
<garnt> - That's always there. </garnt>
<garnt> That's always one of them. </garnt>
<garnt> That's not really a,
that's a sausage roll- </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah yeah.
- And there'd be like, </connor>
<connor> my personal favorite was the
sausage, bean and cheese melt. </connor>
<joey> Which is just sausage, beans and cheese </joey>
<connor> shoved into a pastry-
- And melted, I assume. </connor>
<garnt> - It's like, now that I think about it, </garnt>
<garnt> it's probably the closest thing you'd get, </garnt>
<garnt> not like, in terms of like, </garnt>
<joey> cultural importance as like, an onigiri. </joey>
<joey> Like, a pastie is just
like a British onigiri. </joey>
<garnt> - It's the British (laughs)-
- It is, isn't it! </garnt>
<connor> It is! </connor>
<connor> I just like, realized that
as we were talking about it. </connor>
<connor> - The reason why it
became popular is because, </connor>
<connor> when they'd like, because
obviously coal mining </connor>
<connor> was a massive thing in the UK, </connor>
<connor> is that they needed food
that wouldn't go bad. </connor>
<connor> And they would literally put
these things in their pockets. </connor>
<connor> - Oh-
- And they would just eat them </connor>
<connor> in the mines.
- Right, right, right. </connor>
<connor> - And for some reason, we
decided that that was just great. </connor>
<connor> We should just-
- Now it's your onigiri, now. </connor>
<garnt> - (laughing) Yeah, it's
the British onigiri. </garnt>
<garnt> Fuck jelly donuts! </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, you take two pastries, </garnt>
<connor> which pastries are pretty
fucking filling things, </connor>
<connor> for one pound, and I was like,
"Holy shit, this is insane". </connor>
<connor> - That's pretty good.
- Yeah, two- </connor>
<garnt> - And they taste good, right?
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> They're really good shit.
- Oh shit. </garnt>
<garnt> - How were your school
dinners back in the day? </garnt>
<garnt> - Fucking dreadful. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughs)
I'd rather eat the mushroom </garnt>
<joey> that Meilin pulled up.
(men laugh) </joey>
<joey> It was absolutely terrible. </joey>
<joey> The only thing that was
good was like, toast, </joey>
<joey> for some reason, tastes
really good at school. </joey>
<connor> And always, toast, did you ever have this, </connor>
<connor> the toast taste different? </connor>
<connor> Like, wildly different wherever you go? </connor>
<joey> - I mean like, it's the type
of bread they use, right? </joey>
<connor> - It's like, it's not even like, </connor>
<connor> I feel like, toast doesn't
even taste remotely the same- </connor>
<joey> - Because toast here
tastes completely different </joey>
<joey> to anywhere else.
- Yeah, but as well, </joey>
<connor> when you make toast at home, </connor>
<joey> it has a completely different taste, </joey>
<joey> to when you get toast at a restaurant. </joey>
<connor> Like, it's wildly different, I think. </connor>
<connor> It doesn't even taste like toast- </connor>
<garnt> - Like, back in the day,
like fucking school dinners </garnt>
<garnt> were kind of like prison
food, almost, right? </garnt>
<connor> You'd go in the fucking cafeteria, </connor>
<joey> there was always these, you know, </joey>
<garnt> the lunch ladies, they'd
always look depressed as fuck. </garnt>
<garnt> And you'd come in with your tray, </garnt>
<joey> and now that I think about it, </joey>
<joey> you kind of just felt like
you were in prison. (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - We didn't even have that. </joey>
<joey> We just had a cafeteria, </joey>
<garnt> like we called it a tuck shop. </garnt>
<garnt> - A tuck shop, right.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> You guys have tuck shops, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - No.
- What's that? </garnt>
<garnt> - What the fuck is a tuck shop? </garnt>
<garnt> - Now that's a very Australian
thing, I just realized. </garnt>
<garnt> So it's like, a tuck shop
in Australian schools, </garnt>
<connor> is basically this booth. </connor>
<connor> You can go and just buy food items. </connor>
<connor> - Right.
- It's not even </connor>
<connor> a cafeteria, it's not even a room. </connor>
<connor> - It's a stall?
- It's like a stall. </connor>
<connor> Basically, because our schools didn't... </connor>
<connor> A lot of schools in Australia, I think, </connor>
<connor> don't really have full-on cafeterias, </connor>
<joey> because none of them are like, </joey>
<joey> big enough to have full-on cafeterias. </joey>
<joey> So like, the only experience of cafeterias </joey>
<joey> I ever had as a kid, was
watching the "Simpsons". </joey>
<connor> - (laughs) Okay.
- Like that was the closest </connor>
<connor> I ever got to a school cafeteria. </connor>
<connor> Because like-
- Australian schools- </connor>
<joey> - There are no schools, I
didn't know a single school </joey>
<joey> in my area, or in Australia
at all, that had that. </joey>
<connor> Like, school lunch in the cafeteria- </connor>
<connor> - This sub guy just
fucking drops off some shit </connor>
<joey> in his truck.
(Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> Here you fucking go, kids.
- Yeah, go for it kids. </joey>
<connor> - How about some fucking sausages? </connor>
<joey> Here you go.
- Yeah, you literally </joey>
<joey> just go to like, a stall kind of thing. </joey>
<joey> And there'd be like, a canteen lady there, </joey>
<joey> or the cafeteria lady. </joey>
<connor> It's just like, you just buy stuff. </connor>
<connor> - I just like, smooth talk them. </connor>
<joey> Or I used to always be
really, really fucking nice </joey>
<joey> to the cafeteria ladies, so
they'd give me extra food. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, yeah, and
whenever my friends' mom </joey>
<joey> was the cafeteria lady, I'd be like, </joey>
<joey> "Hey, come on, come on. </joey>
<connor> Let me in, let me in. </connor>
<joey> Give me some of the back stock there". </joey>
<connor> - I would, no joke, I would literally be, </connor>
<connor> I'd be like, "That food was
amazing, that was fantastic". </connor>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> (men laugh) </joey>
<connor> - Seriously?
- Yeah! </connor>
<connor> Because-
- Compliments to the chef. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, because I would literally, </joey>
<connor> I would always go back, I'd be like, </connor>
<connor> "Thank you so much, that was
great, that was fantastic". </connor>
<connor> (men laugh) </connor>
<connor> Because, right-
- Did the give you </connor>
<joey> anything for it?
- Oh yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> After a while of doing this, </joey>
<connor> they would like, make
specialized things for me. </connor>
<connor> - Wow.
- Because I would always, </connor>
<joey> my mates gave me so much shit for it. </joey>
<joey> Because they're like, "Why are you fucking </joey>
<joey> sucking up to them", I'm like, </joey>
<joey> "Well look at my fucking meal. </joey>
<joey> I'm eating like a king
today. Enjoy your slop." </joey>
<joey> They custom made the shit-
- Custom made! </joey>
<garnt> - It's off this fucking line, bro. </garnt>
<connor> - They're like, "Yo, Connor's rolling in. </connor>
<garnt> Bring out the good shit".
- Bring out the good shit. </garnt>
<garnt> Bring out the-
- Bring out the three </garnt>
<connor> course meal.
- They're about to serve me, </connor>
<connor> and the other one's like,
"No, stop, it's Connor". </connor>
<joey> - Do you know who this man is? </joey>
<joey> (men laugh) </joey>
<joey> - It's distinction! </joey>
<joey> They're like, so they used to make like, </joey>
<connor> so this is again, a really
fucking British thing. </connor>
<garnt> Jacket potatoes, you ever heard of this? </garnt>
<garnt> - Jacket potatoes?
- Yeah, I know </garnt>
<garnt> jacket potatoes.
- Literally just like- </garnt>
<garnt> - It's a potato. </garnt>
<connor> - It's a potato-
- With butter. </connor>
<connor> - You stab it a bunch, maybe
you cut it open a little. </connor>
<connor> You put butter in it. </connor>
<connor> Baked potato.
- Oh, baked potato. </connor>
<connor> All right.
- You wrap it up. </connor>
<connor> It's called jacket potato in the UK. </connor>
<connor> - It's just potato with butter. </connor>
<connor> - And they would just give
it to you, like just there. </connor>
<garnt> And I was like, come on,
I'm better than this. </garnt>
<garnt> And I was like, "I know
you've got some chuter </garnt>
<garnt> in the back, there, I know
you've got some beans and cheese. </garnt>
<garnt> Can you put that shit all over it?" </garnt>
<connor> So they would make like, normally
you'd get a jacket potato, </connor>
<connor> but, because I was very nice to them, </connor>
<connor> they would put like, tuna in there. </connor>
<connor> Which I fucking love,
beans and cheese as well. </connor>
<connor> And I would rock up like, "Yeah, boys. </connor>
<connor> I'm eating like a king today". </connor>
<joey> It was very good.
- You literally just like, </joey>
<joey> James Bond that shit. </joey>
<joey> You come up being like, "Connor?" </joey>
<connor> - No, the reason why I did
it is because I realized </connor>
<joey> that one of the other kids,
who was way older than me </joey>
<joey> got a bunch of really, it
looked like he always had, </joey>
<connor> like everyone else's
tray was peasant tray, </connor>
<connor> and this guy always had
a stacked fucking tay. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, "What is this guy doing?" </connor>
<connor> Because like, they don't
give you extra if you ask. </connor>
<connor> They just laugh at you. </connor>
<connor> So I was like, "Oh fuck, what's he doing?" </connor>
<connor> I watched him, and he was just
like, smooth talking them. </connor>
<connor> Just saying like, thank you a bunch. </connor>
<garnt> (Joey laughs)
I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> who knows, all we had to
do was just say thank you </garnt>
<connor> and be nice, and say a few words to them. </connor>
<garnt> And they'd give you more.
- Wow. </garnt>
<garnt> - What was the best part
of the school dinner </garnt>
<garnt> you remember? </garnt>
<connor> - I feel like I know
what you're gonna say. </connor>
<garnt> - Because what reminds me of this- </garnt>
<connor> - Are you gonna say like,
turkey Twizzlers or some shit? </connor>
<garnt> - No, no, no, no. </garnt>
<garnt> What reminded me of this
was because we went to... </garnt>
<garnt> There's a local bar near us, and it's, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't even know how to
describe what the theme </garnt>
<connor> of this bar is, right. </connor>
<connor> There's this bar that we go to that has </connor>
<connor> just, the most random assortment of foods </connor>
<connor> you could think of.
- It's all good though. </connor>
<connor> - It's all good, it's all great. </connor>
<connor> And so we order this, I can't
remember what we ordered. </connor>
<garnt> But we ordered some dish. </garnt>
<garnt> And what comes out is the
fucking smiley potato chips. </garnt>
<joey> (men laugh) </joey>
<joey> - I love those things! </joey>
<garnt> - So good! </garnt>
<joey> - They taste so god damn good. </joey>
<garnt> - And I can't remember
what dish we ordered. </garnt>
<garnt> But I remember we came, it came out. </garnt>
<connor> And like, the three of
us just reverted back </connor>
<connor> to being like, seven years old. </connor>
<connor> Being like, "Oh!"
- Oh! </connor>
<connor> - Sweet potato chips! </connor>
<connor> This is what it looks
like, if you didn't have it </connor>
<garnt> wherever you grew up. </garnt>
<garnt> It's basically just the Funimation logo. </garnt>
<garnt> (men laugh) </garnt>
<connor> - The Funimation logo with eyes. </connor>
<connor> - It's weird, because it has
a taste that is so unique. </connor>
<connor> - Because it's not fries-
- God damn good. </connor>
<connor> - It's not fries, it's not potatoes. </connor>
<connor> It's just got such a unique taste. </connor>
<garnt> And I'm sure anyone who
didn't grow up with it </garnt>
<garnt> would think it tastes like shit. </garnt>
<connor> - I could be a billionaire,
and I'll be like, </connor>
<connor> "Charles, heat up the
smiley faces, won't you?" </connor>
<connor> (laughs) Bring in the smiley faces. </connor>
<joey> - Ever since I saw those
at that restaurant, </joey>
<connor> I've been trying to find them. </connor>
<connor> - Dude, they're so good! </connor>
<connor> - Like, I can't find them anywhere. </connor>
<joey> Because they don't sell
them in supermarkets- </joey>
<joey> - We've gotta ask, what's your source? </joey>
<joey> - I'm like, "Wait" (laughs)- </joey>
<joey> - Who's your-
- Where'd you source these? </joey>
<garnt> - Because I, it's so bizarre. </garnt>
<garnt> Because the restaurant,
I wouldn't call it posh. </garnt>
<connor> But it's like-
- The decor is extremely nice. </connor>
<garnt> Very, I'd say-
- Very homely, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, it's very nice. </connor>
<connor> It's not-
- Bouquets everywhere. </connor>
<connor> There are fresh bouquets.
- So I just laughed, right? </connor>
<connor> Because they bring out this dish. </connor>
<connor> And they were just probably like, </connor>
<garnt> "This is imported potato
from Britain, enjoy lads". </garnt>
<joey> And I'm just thinking here, </joey>
<joey> "This is just school dinner
chips right here, man". </joey>
<garnt> - This is 10 cents apiece. </garnt>
<joey> (men laugh) </joey>
<joey> This is like currency
in elementary school. </joey>
<garnt> (men laugh) </garnt>
<garnt> - Well yeah, those were
the one things I remember. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, that was universal. </garnt>
<garnt> In every school dinner
we had it in the UK. </garnt>
<garnt> Every kid remembers the smiley chips- </garnt>
<joey> - Dead ass in primary
school, it was like currency. </joey>
<joey> Like, you would trade other
food items with people </joey>
<joey> for smiley-
- Yeah, I don't know. </joey>
<garnt> I think it's phased out now. </garnt>
<garnt> Because school dinners, from
what I've heard in the UK, </garnt>
<joey> are a lot more healthy
than they used to be. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, really?
- And that's because, </joey>
<joey> do you know Jamie Oliver?
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, so I think back-
- Man is on a crusade. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Oh really? </joey>
<joey> - For like, healthy school dinners. </joey>
<joey> And apparently it worked. </joey>
<joey> I'm jealous, because I've seen
some of the school dinners </joey>
<garnt> that kids get nowadays, and
man, they be eating good. </garnt>
<garnt> They be eating, they're
getting like a fucking </garnt>
<garnt> three course meal with roast
chicken and all that shit- </garnt>
<garnt> - What the fuck?
- I'm just like. (laughs) </garnt>
<joey> - See, the fanciest thing
I had in my cafeteria was, </joey>
<connor> it was a chicken tender roll. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah-
- Which is literally </joey>
<joey> a bun with two chicken tenders in it. </joey>
<connor> $4 (laughs).
- Does anyone remember </connor>
<connor> bringing your own lunch? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I always did.
- Packed lunch. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, that's what I
used to do for a while. </connor>
<connor> I can't remember why,
because I had school lunches. </connor>
<connor> And I had packed lunch for sometime. </connor>
<joey> I don't remember why I didn't, </joey>
<joey> but I remember, I used to trade. </joey>
<joey> Did you ever trade stuff
with the other kids? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Because your mum </joey>
<joey> put stuff in your box, and you're like, </joey>
<joey> "Well, it's not that I don't like this, </joey>
<connor> but that guy likes this
thing, and I wanna trade". </connor>
<connor> - I always did-
- I remember I used </connor>
<connor> to trade Kit Kat for cheese strings. </connor>
<connor> Because I like cheese string-
- Oh, cheese string! </connor>
<garnt> I remember cheese string-
- That's the one </garnt>
<joey> that you like, yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Because I'm not being funny. </joey>
<joey> Obviously, I love Kit Kats. </joey>
<joey> But frankly, eating a
cheese string as a kid </joey>
<joey> is probably one of the
most enjoyable things. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, of course.
- You know, still to this day, </joey>
<joey> I still really enjoy the process
of eating a cheese string. </joey>
<joey> I think it's very satisfying. </joey>
<joey> And I traded, always I traded my Kit Kat </joey>
<connor> for this kid's cheese string. </connor>
<joey> - (snorts) Why didn't
you just ask your mom </joey>
<connor> to get cheese strings?
- Well because I think, </connor>
<connor> actually... </connor>
<connor> This is gonna be big brain. </connor>
<connor> I think actually, that the cheese string's </connor>
<joey> actually more expensive.
- Oh really? </joey>
<joey> - Than the Kit Kats, and
the packs of Kit Kats </joey>
<joey> were pretty cheap-
- That makes sense, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Because they were like the
branded cheese strings as well. </joey>
<joey> - Oh-
- They were like, </joey>
<joey> the cheese strings.
- Right, right, right. </joey>
<joey> - When I told my mom, I felt like, </joey>
<joey> I never saw her like, weirdly
upset about something. </joey>
<connor> I was like, "Mum, why
are you upset about me </connor>
<connor> trading cheese strings?" She was like, </connor>
<connor> "You could have told me,
why didn't you tell me?" </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "I didn't
think it was a big deal! </connor>
<joey> I'm out here hustling, mom, it's fine. </joey>
<connor> I got, it's fine, don't worry about it"- </connor>
<connor> - She's like, "You think we
can't afford cheese strings </connor>
<connor> in this house?"
- Wait, you told me </connor>
<joey> you don't like cheese string, I'm like, </joey>
<joey> "I like the hustle, it's fun, okay! </joey>
<joey> I like trading, I like it"-
- I'm a businessman, mom. </joey>
<joey> - (laughs) Mom, I read "Art of the Deal". </joey>
<joey> Come on, let me be. </joey>
<garnt> I liked it, it was fun scouting out </garnt>
<garnt> what everyone else had, and you'd be like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Trade? </garnt>
<garnt> Trade offer?"
- Trade offer. </garnt>
<joey> - Literally. (laughs) </joey>
<joey> I would go up to the kids
and be like, "Trade offer"- </joey>
<joey> - I receive cheese string. </joey>
<joey> - I receive-
- You receive Kit Kat. </joey>
<joey> - I would, I don't know, as a kid, </joey>
<joey> for some reason, I didn't have any qualms </joey>
<joey> about going up to a kid and
being like, "I like that. </joey>
<joey> We should trade, what do you think?" </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, of course. </joey>
<connor> I feel the only time you can do that, </connor>
<joey> and it's not weird, is when you're a kid. </joey>
<connor> - And then sometimes kid would be like, </connor>
<connor> I feel like they didn't,
they wanted the trade, </connor>
<connor> but they were skeptical as
to why I wanted to trade. </connor>
<connor> What's wrong with it? </connor>
<connor> What did you do to the Kit Kat? </connor>
<connor> Right?
- Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - I just want it, like, mm. </garnt>
<garnt> "I don't know, Conner, you've
got a reputation for hustling. </garnt>
<connor> I don't know about that".
(Garnt laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - I'll tell you, the kid
I was always jealous of </garnt>
<garnt> were the kids that had
the Dairylea Lunchables. </garnt>
<connor> Because that looked so fun! </connor>
<garnt> Because, Dairylea Lunchables. </garnt>
<joey> It's basically like
Build-A-Bear, but for lunch. </joey>
<joey> - You've had a Lunchable. </joey>
<joey> - I've had a Lunchable. </joey>
<joey> But, it's-
- It's the pack </joey>
<joey> that comes with like, the
biscuit, the cheese, and the ham. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh yes, yes, yes-
- You put up </garnt>
<connor> your own like, little sandwich. </connor>
<connor> - Yep, yep.
- I don't know why. </connor>
<connor> As a kid, that just seemed so fun. </connor>
<connor> - And it is.
- But it was like, </connor>
<connor> expensive as fuck for a kid. </connor>
<garnt> Those kids were eating good.
- That thing had like, </garnt>
<garnt> negative nutrition I think. </garnt>
<garnt> Pretty sure it actively
took it out of your body. </garnt>
<garnt> (men laugh) </garnt>
<joey> Also, you know Lunchables, </joey>
<joey> I don't know if its the same brand. </joey>
<joey> It was Dairylea, though. </joey>
<garnt> They do like, the dairy
dunkers, did you like those? </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, what were they again?
- Oh was that like, </garnt>
<joey> the chocolate sauce ones? </joey>
<garnt> - They did have chocolate sauce. </garnt>
<garnt> But it was like-
- Oh, the cheese sauce one. </garnt>
<connor> - There was cheese sauce ones,
which I really fucking love. </connor>
<connor> - Right.
- They were, yeah. </connor>
<connor> I think originally, they were chocolate. </connor>
<connor> Where it was like a biscuit,
bread kind of thing- </connor>
<joey> - It was like a biscuit, like
half a biscuit breadsticks, </joey>
<joey> and then the other half's like, chocolate. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah-
- We had those. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, we had those. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, and then they
had a cheese version. </joey>
<joey> And then, they had this one- </joey>
<joey> - I've never heard of the cheese version. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, it was pretty popular in the UK. </connor>
<connor> - Really?
- I loved, </connor>
<connor> fucking loved those things as a kid. </connor>
<connor> I fucking put those away. </connor>
<joey> And then, I was eating
them up until like, age 21. </joey>
<joey> Because they had a version where like, </joey>
<joey> it was like some herb stick or something, </joey>
<connor> and I really fucking loved it. </connor>
<connor> Like legit eating it until 21. </connor>
<connor> And they changed the
recipe, and I was like, </connor>
<connor> "You've lost a longtime"-
(men laugh) </connor>
<connor> It actually tasted like shit. </connor>
<garnt> I'm like, "I don't know what happened". </garnt>
<garnt> - Wow.
- I wanted to email HQ </garnt>
<joey> being like, "How fucking dead"- </joey>
<joey> - Did you change the flavor? </joey>
<joey> Did you change the recipe?
- Tell me changed the flavor. </joey>
<joey> Tell me my taste buds haven't changed. </joey>
<connor> This tasted like shit. </connor>
<connor> I'm not crazy. </connor>
<garnt> - You guys ever had a food
product later in life, </garnt>
<garnt> that you just like,
couldn't believe that you'd </garnt>
<connor> waited this long in life before you'd had </connor>
<connor> this one food product? </connor>
<connor> Because I'll tell you what-
- I was gonna say, </connor>
<connor> you must have a very specific-
- Yeah, you must have- </connor>
<connor> - I mean, I mean, </connor>
<connor> because thinking about it-
- Do you have this </connor>
<joey> super specific situation?
- Did you have this </joey>
<connor> super specific situation? </connor>
<connor> - Because...
- (laughs) Because, </connor>
<connor> well I'll tell you mine, actually. </connor>
<connor> Because I didn't try
Nutella for the first time, </connor>
<connor> until I was 24.
- How did you avoid Nutella </connor>
<joey> for so long?
- Okay, because- </joey>
<connor> - Nutella's like, everywhere. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, because I was a kid, </connor>
<connor> I wasn't allowed Nutella, right- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, my parents wouldn't
let it in the house. </connor>
<garnt> - Really?
- Because it's basically </garnt>
<garnt> just fucking chocolate, right. </garnt>
<joey> It's just basically chocolate. </joey>
<joey> - It's actually worse
for you than chocolate. </joey>
<joey> - Is it? (laughs)
- Yeah, there's more sugar- </joey>
<joey> - That's understandable, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So I just went my entire
life without trying Nutella. </joey>
<joey> I don't know how, but how
has Nutella been branded </joey>
<joey> as just this thing you
can spread on toast, </joey>
<joey> and people eat for breakfast? </joey>
<garnt> Right, and that feels
like a cheat code to me. </garnt>
<garnt> You know, because I remember
trying it for the first time, </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm just like, "This
is the most amazing snack </garnt>
<garnt> I've ever tried in my life". </garnt>
<garnt> And it's just like, the fucking
gates of Babylon opened. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just like, "Oh my God, I
have discovered God", right? </garnt>
<connor> (men laugh) </connor>
<connor> - It literally goes on like, everything. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah I know! </joey>
<joey> - You open the jar, it just
starts to glow, like (gasps). </joey>
<connor> - My favorite thing, (sighs) </connor>
<connor> I can't remember which,
again, I forget this all. </connor>
<connor> But there's little a video
where they were like, </connor>
<garnt> it was about this whole,
the deception of Nutella </garnt>
<garnt> being a breakfast product. </garnt>
<garnt> And there was this part in
it, where they go onto parents </garnt>
<garnt> who are feeding their kids
Nutella, and they're like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Do you know how much
sugar is in Nutella?" </garnt>
<connor> They're like, "No". </connor>
<connor> And they tell them, they're
like, "There's a lot of sugar. </connor>
<connor> Like a lot", they're like,
"Oh my God, I had no idea". </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> And they look like, so dumbfounded. </connor>
<connor> Like, "What are you serious?" </connor>
<garnt> The chocolate spread? </garnt>
<garnt> The pure, 100% chocolate
flavor that I'm spreading </garnt>
<garnt> on a piece of bread
twice is bad for my son? </garnt>
<garnt> You're kidding me. </garnt>
<garnt> It's just like-
- Surprised Pikachu face. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's literally, and they're, "Oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> I've been feeding my kid
chocolate this whole time!" </garnt>
<joey> It's like, "What did you think it was?" </joey>
<joey> No one thought it wasn't chocolate! </joey>
<joey> We all know that Nutella is chocolate. </joey>
<joey> Just because it's kind of liquidy, </joey>
<connor> like very viscous, you
think it just gets a pass? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, why is it that
Nutella gets a pass, </joey>
<connor> and yet Cocoa Puffs is
like, no, no, no, no, no! </connor>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<garnt> - Because branding, Joey.
Branding is powerful. (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - How did they get away
with this for so long? </garnt>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<garnt> Nutella fucking slaps, but I
knew as soon as I tasted it, </garnt>
<garnt> it's fucking unhealthy as shit. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Oh yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - But it tastes amazing. </garnt>
<garnt> - Literally anyone who
knows what sugar tastes like </garnt>
<garnt> would be like, "I think
this is pretty bad". </garnt>
<connor> - It's pretty bad, yeah.
- It's pretty bad for you, </connor>
<connor> I think, actually, you know? (laughs) </connor>
<joey> My parents would only let
me have it on holidays. </joey>
<joey> - Oh really?
- That's how taboo it was. </joey>
<connor> It was like, "This is for
special occasions only". </connor>
<joey> - No, I think my parents
let me have Nutella </joey>
<connor> like pretty much every
morning if I wanted it. </connor>
<connor> But then I very quickly was
like, "This is too much". </connor>
<garnt> Like this is too much sugar. </garnt>
<joey> Even for my eight year old body, </joey>
<joey> I know this is too much
sugar in the morning. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> now I just think, "Kids,
you're not allowed </garnt>
<garnt> to have ice cream for breakfast, </garnt>
<garnt> but Nutella, that's okay". </garnt>
<joey> And I'm just like, to me, they're
on the same fucking level. </joey>
<connor> - You should put Nutella on ice cream. </connor>
<connor> - That sounds amazing.
- That shit slaps. </connor>
<connor> - Nutella flavored gelato-
- Nutella on some like, </connor>
<joey> fucking vanilla ice cream. (clicks tongue) </joey>
<garnt> That shit slaps.
- I mean that's, </garnt>
<garnt> it's just a dessert, right?
- It is. </garnt>
<joey> It's just chocolate!
(Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> It's literally just chocolate. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] It's just a bit
of naughty chocolate, right? </joey>
<joey> - It's ridiculous. </joey>
<joey> You know what's another
thing I fucking grew out of, </joey>
<joey> I think I just like grew out of all </joey>
<joey> viscous breakfast spreads.
- Viscous breakfast spreads? </joey>
<connor> - Ah yes, what's your favorite
viscous breakfast spread? </connor>
<joey> (men laugh) </joey>
<connor> - Like, Nutella-
- Viscous breakfast, </connor>
<joey> who on earth, no one has
ever described it like that. </joey>
<connor> - It the only way I could describe it. </connor>
<connor> - You literally, you could
have said breakfast spread. </connor>
<connor> You didn't have to put
whole viscous in there- </connor>
<joey> - No, no, no-
- Viscous- </joey>
<joey> - I'm pretty sure that's the first time </joey>
<garnt> in the history of man
that those three words </garnt>
<garnt> have been put in the
same sentence together. </garnt>
<connor> - This is like-
- No, no, that's- </connor>
<connor> - Alien, to the best of your knowledge, </connor>
<connor> describe what this spread is.
- I too love </connor>
<joey> this viscous breakfast spread, human. </joey>
<joey> - What is wrong-
(men laugh) </joey>
<joey> - No, no, no, no. </joey>
<joey> Okay, okay. </joey>
<joey> I specifically used the word viscous, </joey>
<joey> because like, jam-
- I could feel someone </joey>
<joey> doing the fucking lawnmower
(imitates a lawnmower revving), </joey>
<joey> in his fucking head, trying
to form that sentence. </joey>
<joey> - No because, </joey>
<connor> because okay, I used the word viscous, </connor>
<connor> because jam, for instance-
- How are you gonna </connor>
<garnt> talk about peanut butter and jelly, right- </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no, no, that too. </garnt>
<garnt> But like, jam for instance, right, </garnt>
<garnt> that's not viscous. </garnt>
<garnt> You know what I mean?
- Depends. </garnt>
<garnt> You can make it viscous-
- It doesn't stick </garnt>
<joey> to the roof of your mouth
like Nutella does, right? </joey>
<joey> - I love a good fucking jam. </joey>
<joey> - But the thing is, is like, </joey>
<joey> not only did I grow out of Nutella, </joey>
<joey> but also peanut butter. </joey>
<joey> I used to fucking love peanut butter. </joey>
<connor> - I don't know a single person in the UK </connor>
<connor> who ate peanut butter as a child. </connor>
<garnt> - Right, but like-
- No, no. </garnt>
<connor> I didn't eat peanut butt either. </connor>
<joey> - Really?
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Because I ate it as a
child, but then after a while </joey>
<joey> it was like, I don't know,
I don't think I like this. </joey>
<joey> Just, the fact that
every time I take a bite, </joey>
<joey> and it just feels like I just
swallowed a mouthful of glue </joey>
<joey> is just like, honestly, it's viscous. </joey>
<joey> The viscous! </joey>
<joey> It's the viscosity of peanut
butter that I don't like. </joey>
<connor> - I think nine out of 10 people I know, </connor>
<connor> who have peanut butter is
just for catching mice. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> That's why I had it.
- Really? </connor>
<joey> - I only bought it because
apparently mice fucking love it. </joey>
<joey> - Well yeah, I don't blame 'em. </joey>
<connor> - I mean, I'm licking the floor. </connor>
<connor> So I mean-
(Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> - They call me. </connor>
<garnt> - I gotta. </garnt>
<connor> God damn I got my-
- I'm just ready </connor>
<connor> for the Drake meme, like, </connor>
<connor> peanut butter and jelly sandwich? </connor>
<connor> I sleep. </connor>
<connor> Like, viscous breakfast spread? </connor>
<connor> Real shit. (laughs) </connor>
<joey> But yeah, I remember, because
I hadn't tried peanut, </joey>
<garnt> that was another food
item that I didn't try </garnt>
<garnt> until later in life, was peanut butter- </garnt>
<connor> - I've never had just
peanut butter on a sandwich </connor>
<garnt> or something.
- Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> And I remember trying
it for the first time, </garnt>
<garnt> and I was very underwhelmed by it. </garnt>
<garnt> It was like the most
five out of 10 food item </garnt>
<garnt> I've ever tasted in my life. </garnt>
<garnt> - What about its viscosity, though? </garnt>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<garnt> Doesn't that shit just
like, stick to your mouth? </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, which kind of
spreads did you have? </garnt>
<joey> Did you have like, the chunky spread, </joey>
<joey> or did you have like, the smooth spread? </joey>
<joey> - I mean, I went either or. </joey>
<joey> - I've never had a
spread of peanut butter. </joey>
<connor> - You've never had a
spread of peanut butter? </connor>
<connor> - I've only had Reese's cupcakes. </connor>
<connor> Which, yeah-
- I also hate the viscosity </connor>
<connor> of those.
- Well, I remember </connor>
<connor> the first time I-
- Do you just wanna </connor>
<connor> say viscosity?
- I love that word. </connor>
<joey> - I very much had a, like
the kombucha tea meme, </joey>
<joey> when I first tried the Reese's cupcakes. </joey>
<joey> And I was like, I had
it, and I was like, "Oh. </joey>
<joey> Oh! Oh?"
- I think the one thing </joey>
<joey> I don't look about Reece's cups is that, </joey>
<joey> again, the peanut butter
overpowers everything. </joey>
<joey> And it's like a certain-
- Is that the point? </joey>
<connor> I don't know if that's the point. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know if that's the point- </connor>
<joey> - There's like, something
about the peanut butter that I, </joey>
<joey> I think I just don't like peanut butter. </joey>
<connor> - Foreigners trying to
figure out American food. </connor>
<joey> Like, "What is going on here?" </joey>
<joey> - I think, I just
realized, like right now. </joey>
<joey> I just think I don't like
peanut butter. (laughing) </joey>
<connor> - Is it, okay Americans,
is it normal to feel like, </connor>
<connor> violently uncomfortable after eating </connor>
<connor> more than two of those cups? </connor>
<connor> Is that normal?
(Garnt chuckles) </connor>
<connor> Meiling, is that normal? </connor>
<connor> Does your stomach feel
really uncomfortable? </connor>
<joey> - How many Reece's cups can you eat? </joey>
<joey> - You can eat like a bunch? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, right-
- You start to feel </joey>
<connor> like real uncomfortable, right? </connor>
<garnt> There was no, they came
in a nice pack of three. </garnt>
<connor> So I assumed I eat all three. </connor>
<connor> Oh you don't, fuck. </connor>
<connor> That is the biggest lie
America's ever told. </connor>
<connor> - That's a lie-
- You share. </connor>
<connor> - You share.
- Share bags, my ass. </connor>
<joey> Why would they, why would they- </joey>
<connor> - I mean, it-
- My hand fit </connor>
<joey> so perfectly in it then?
- That's like saying, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, you can break off a Kit Kat, </joey>
<connor> and share it with another person". </connor>
<joey> No one fucking does that shit.
(Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> Just open it, and just eat it. </joey>
<joey> - Especially now, I don't want someone </joey>
<connor> with their fucking sweaty
hands snapping a Kit Kat. </connor>
<connor> The whole palm reaching over
the whole Kit Kat to snap it. </connor>
<connor> Because that's-
(Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> what you have to do. </connor>
<connor> I don't trust a person who
tries to do it like that. </connor>
<connor> That's weird, you want a clean- </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, you want that, right? </joey>
<connor> - But I also don't want
your whole palm touching it. </connor>
<joey> That's a little too much palm. </joey>
<joey> So frankly, we'll just buy
our own Kit Kats, you know. </joey>
<joey> - Just eat the fucking Kit Kat. </joey>
<joey> - Or honestly, in the
packet, rip it in the packet. </joey>
<garnt> Because you can do that-
- Oh yeah, you can. </garnt>
<garnt> - Big brain.
- That's too big brain. </garnt>
<garnt> - But sometimes you forget. </garnt>
<joey> You've opened it up, and you're like, </joey>
<joey> "Fuck I can't wrap it back up". </joey>
<joey> - Grab the packaging, just wir. (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - You gotta do like, have
you seen the Kit Kat adverts? </joey>
<joey> Where you're like the foil wrapping, </joey>
<joey> and then you just like,
split it in the middle? </joey>
<connor> - What, with like a knife?
- No, no, no. </connor>
<connor> With your finger, you like,
it just splits perfectly. </connor>
<connor> Does this-
- Is your fingernail </connor>
<connor> long enough for that?
- No, it is! </connor>
<joey> Okay, so-
- Have you done it? </joey>
<garnt> - No. (laughs)
- I've never done that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Did that advert stop
getting played or something? </garnt>
<joey> - I've never split-
- I've never seen that. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh my God, I gotta
fucking show you after the- </garnt>
<joey> - I've never split a Kit Kat. </joey>
<joey> - You've never, what? (laughs) </joey>
<joey> Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait- </joey>
<joey> - You have-
- No, I have not. </joey>
<garnt> - How do you eat Kit Kats? </garnt>
<joey> - Just fucking take it out
of the package and eat it. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, I have done that. </joey>
<connor> But I don't believe you
that you've never split- </connor>
<joey> - No. </joey>
<joey> Because the Kit Kats I always used to get </joey>
<joey> were like, the mini packets of Kit Kats. </joey>
<garnt> So it was like, it would be in a bag- </garnt>
<garnt> - You tell me you've never had a thought- </garnt>
<connor> - You've never had a single Kit Kat- </connor>
<joey> - You've never had a four bar Kit Kat? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, and I just eat it.
- No. </joey>
<joey> You fuck off. No you didn't. </joey>
<joey> - Joey (laughs)-
- I think, </joey>
<joey> you must be lying-
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, </joey>
<connor> shut the fuck up, do you
just fucking bite that shit </connor>
<joey> without splitting it?
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - No. </joey>
<joey> - No Joey, no!
- No- </joey>
<joey> - I am true evil.
- No. </joey>
<connor> - I don't believe that you've
never cracked a Kit Kat apart. </connor>
<joey> - I don't do it on the
fucking regs, though. </joey>
<connor> - When are you eating Kit Kat? </connor>
<connor> Who the fuck's eating Kit Kat often? </connor>
<joey> - No, but like every
time I have a Kit Kat, </joey>
<connor> it's usually in like, you know, </connor>
<garnt> two Kit Kats together, right? </garnt>
<garnt> The max is like, four in a row. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, and you split it-
- No. </garnt>
<joey> - Eat it one at-
- I literally just grab, </joey>
<garnt> and just, do this.
- Don't! </garnt>
<garnt> No Joey, no.
(Joey laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - Because like, the crumbs
get everywhere and shit. </connor>
<joey> - No, I just eat it in one go. </joey>
<connor> - No, it's such a mess. </connor>
<connor> Like, crumbs go everywhere,
the wafer falls. </connor>
<connor> The structural integrity has
been compromised, frankly. </connor>
<joey> - It doesn't matter,
because two seconds later, </joey>
<joey> it's all going in your mouth. </joey>
<garnt> - Pretty sure society would crumble </garnt>
<garnt> if everyone did that, Joey. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughs)
Jesus Christ. </garnt>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> - This is why we ran out of toilet paper </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> People like this. </connor>
<connor> - Gotta wipe up the Kit Kat crumbs- </connor>
<connor> - Is this an Australian
thing that I just don't- </connor>
<joey> - No, I know this is just a me thing. </joey>
<joey> - Well, has no one ever
shamed you about this </joey>
<garnt> in your life, but there's no
way you went through school </garnt>
<garnt> eating Kit Kats like
that, and not got bullied- </garnt>
<joey> - I never ate Kit Kats in school. </joey>
<joey> Kit Kats were a me thing, in my room. </joey>
<connor> - What's wrong with you, Joey? </connor>
<joey> - It's a fucking chocolate bar. </joey>
<joey> Who cares? </joey>
<joey> Does it say on the packaging,
"Must crack one at a time </joey>
<joey> in order to eat successfully"? </joey>
<joey> No, it doesn't.
- Well, it's like </joey>
<connor> only drinking beer via like, shot gunning. </connor>
<connor> (men laugh) </connor>
<connor> It's like, yeah okay,
it's a one off, I get it. </connor>
<connor> But that shouldn't be
your primary go-to method </connor>
<connor> of drinking a beer out of a can, you know? </connor>
<garnt> Like, stabbing a hole in the bottom </garnt>
<garnt> and fucking drinking it. </garnt>
<garnt> That shouldn't be your go-to method. </garnt>
<garnt> You know what I mean? </garnt>
<joey> It's like that, it's like-
- It's nothing like that. </joey>
<joey> What are you on?
- It is like that. </joey>
<joey> - It is like that.
- Oh my God. </joey>
<connor> - You're literally
making it harder to eat. </connor>
<joey> - I'm not, I'm making it easy, </joey>
<joey> because I'm saving my fucking palms </joey>
<joey> from getting all chocolatey by doing this. </joey>
<joey> - (sighs) Oh, God.
- I just like, </joey>
<joey> open it up halfway, and then
grab it by the packaging, </joey>
<joey> and then just fucking do this- </joey>
<garnt> - There's a reason there are
crevices in the Kit Kat, Joey. </garnt>
<garnt> There are reasons for it! </garnt>
<garnt> It's literally designed into
the fucking food product! </garnt>
<garnt> It's designed to be eaten
a certain way, Joey! </garnt>
<joey> - Look, sometimes I wanna break the rules. </joey>
<joey> All right? (laughing) </joey>
<connor> Fuck society. </connor>
<connor> - Do you ever just like,
wake up and remember </connor>
<connor> that Toblerone took out like 50% </connor>
<joey> of the fucking chocolate?
(Garnt giggles) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I just can't believe
they did that still. </joey>
<garnt> I still cannot-
- Do you know Toblerone? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - You've seen the modern ones? </garnt>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<connor> - You know how the gaps used to be very, </connor>
<connor> I would argue, perfect. </connor>
<connor> You know, when the one went to up, </connor>
<joey> the next-
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> And you could easily just do that right? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, it's not like that.
- Yeah, like with Kit Kats, </joey>
<garnt> Joey.
- No, no. </garnt>
<joey> Toblerone-
(men laugh) </joey>
<joey> Listen, Toblerones are fucking massive. </joey>
<joey> They're like this big. </joey>
<joey> I'm no gonna fucking (gagging). </joey>
<joey> (men laugh) </joey>
<joey> - I have done that, I have done that. </joey>
<garnt> I bought too many at the airport. </garnt>
<garnt> I had to start, and you know, </garnt>
<joey> just getting a little wild and... </joey>
<garnt> - Just fucking deep throating- </garnt>
<joey> - Deep throat a Toblerone. </joey>
<garnt> (men laugh) </garnt>
<garnt> - Have you not seen what they look like- </garnt>
<connor> - (laughs) Toblerone
deep throat challenge. </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God, Mister Beast,
"Who can deep throat </connor>
<connor> the most Toblerones for $10,000"? </connor>
<garnt> - But yeah, so because,
I was out of the UK </garnt>
<garnt> by this point, right? </garnt>
<joey> But, so Toblerone, you know
what a Toblerone look likes, </joey>
<joey> looks like, it looks like this, Chads. </joey>
<joey> Not Chad, fucking-
- Chads! (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Fuck, man. </joey>
<joey> I've been watching too much Twitch. </joey>
<joey> But so, I think one year they just decided </joey>
<garnt> to make less Toblerones. </garnt>
<garnt> Or, they made the gaps-
- So this is the </garnt>
<garnt> original Toblerone.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> That's what I'm used to.
- Right, right. </connor>
<connor> And your gonna fucking cry.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] This is it now. </connor>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah, so that can't be real. </garnt>
<joey> - That's real.
- That cannot be real. </joey>
<garnt> - That's real, that's real!
- Yeah, that is real. </garnt>
<connor> That is real.
- Are you shitting me? </connor>
<connor> - No, that's what it is. </connor>
<joey> - Why are the Toblerones
social distancing? </joey>
<joey> - I don't know.
(men laugh) </joey>
<connor> - It's like, "We're too close". </connor>
<joey> - I just-
- Give me some room. </joey>
<connor> - Sometimes I just wake up at night, </connor>
<connor> and I just remember they did that. </connor>
<connor> - Oh no.
- They got away with it. </connor>
<connor> And they still are expensive- </connor>
<connor> - Did they get away with it? </connor>
<garnt> I don't know. </garnt>
<joey> I'm pretty sure like, they-
- I haven't heard </joey>
<joey> of recent memory, of people
buying Toblerone. (laughs) </joey>
<connor> - I'd like to think that
even like, you know, </connor>
<connor> that this plummeted their stock. </connor>
<connor> But I don't think it did. </connor>
<garnt> - Pretty sure people
rioted because of this. </garnt>
<joey> That's like the impression I got- </joey>
<joey> - I mean, if I'd known
about it back in the day, </joey>
<joey> I would've rioted. </joey>
<joey> - Because I remember, it was like, </joey>
<joey> it was just when I moved out of the UK, </joey>
<connor> because I can't remember
if I was living here. </connor>
<connor> When did they do this? </connor>
<connor> Was this when you were living in the UK? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it was when I was living in the- </connor>
<connor> - So I must have just moved
to Thailand or something. </connor>
<connor> And I remember moving to Thailand, </connor>
<garnt> one day I wake up, and
my entire fucking feed </garnt>
<garnt> is just people complaining
about the Toblerones- </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughs)
- It's just, </garnt>
<connor> it's like they didn't even try and hide </connor>
<connor> how much chocolate they were taking away. </connor>
<connor> Like just fill it with some shit. </connor>
<connor> Make it less tasty. </connor>
<connor> Like don't ruin the, </connor>
<connor> because one of the best
things about a Toblerone </connor>
<connor> is that you get so God
damn much chocolate- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- You get a fuck ton. </connor>
<joey> Like arguably, one piece
of Toblerone is too much. </joey>
<joey> - That shit lost you. </joey>
<joey> - I think actually, eating a
single piece of the triangle </joey>
<joey> is actually uncomfortable. </joey>
<joey> It's almost too much-
- It is too much chocolate- </joey>
<connor> - That's always the best part,
because it's good shit too. </connor>
<connor> It tastes great.
- It's the perfect amount </connor>
<joey> where you're like, "I don't
even wanna go for another one. </joey>
<joey> I'll save it for the next day". </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I also learned as well, </connor>
<connor> because I used to always snap it away. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Did you do that </garnt>
<garnt> as well?
- Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> I did that.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - But then, the way that I actually do it, </garnt>
<connor> is to push it inward, and it snaps easy. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, like that?
- Yeah, you snap it in, </connor>
<connor> and it just breaks off. </connor>
<connor> But now you'll never get to experience it- </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, no. (laughs)
- The design </joey>
<connor> is fundamentally changed, so-
- Wait. </connor>
<joey> How are you supposed to
snap the new ones now? </joey>
<connor> - I don't know. </connor>
<joey> It's fucking-
- With a fucking knife? </joey>
<joey> - Smack it against the
concrete or something? </joey>
<joey> I don't know. </joey>
<connor> - (imitates a cutting serrated
blade) Cut it with a knife. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, you don't need to snap it. </connor>
<connor> It will probably just like... </connor>
<garnt> It's so long that it'll
probably just break under the- </garnt>
<joey> (Joey giggles)
- Yeah, honestly. </joey>
<garnt> Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh my God, why do they do this to, </joey>
<joey> why are they masking my boy like that? </joey>
<connor> - I couldn't believe they did it. </connor>
<connor> I'm still like, I wake up in a cold sweat- </connor>
<joey> - How have I like, just
found out about this? </joey>
<connor> - I'll tell you what-
- I don't know </connor>
<joey> if it's the UK only or not-
- I'll tell you </joey>
<joey> what I think is an underrated
snack, chocolate snack. </joey>
<connor> Terry's Chocolate Orange. </connor>
<joey> I fucking love Terry's Chocolate Orange- </joey>
<garnt> - Oh-
- Do you have </garnt>
<garnt> Terry's Chocolate Orange? </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't, but I've heard of it. </garnt>
<joey> - They have it in America.
- They have it in America? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, they have it in America. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, so it's basically
just a chocolate orange. </joey>
<garnt> But the fucking best part of it </garnt>
<connor> is that it's literally an
orange that you have to like, </connor>
<connor> smack, and you eat a little chunk- </connor>
<connor> - It's the shape of an
average sized orange. </connor>
<connor> - And I don't know what it is- </connor>
<connor> - Solid chocolate.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> It's just a ball of solid chocolate, </connor>
<connor> that you eat like an orange, right? </connor>
<connor> And I don't know what it is. </connor>
<connor> Like, they have the Terry's
Chocolate Orange bars, </connor>
<connor> and I don't know what it is
about playing the minigame </connor>
<garnt> of like, fucking smacking the chocolate </garnt>
<garnt> and peeling it yourself, it
just tastes so much better, </garnt>
<connor> and so much more satisfying-
- It's because you're </connor>
<connor> working for it. (laughs) </connor>
<joey> - I love just smacking it
against my concrete wall </joey>
<joey> in my home, just fucking (grunts). </joey>
<joey> (men laugh) </joey>
<connor> Who wants a piece?
(Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> Who wants a piece of
Terry's Chocolate Orange? </connor>
<connor> And it's always really cheap as well. </connor>
<connor> They always go on offer for like, a pound. </connor>
<connor> So you've got like, way too much chocolate </connor>
<connor> for really cheap, somehow. </connor>
<connor> It was yeah-
- Wait, </connor>
<joey> does it have like,
actual orange in it, or? </joey>
<joey> - No, it's like orange flavor-
- It's like a </joey>
<joey> orange chocolate flavor.
- Right, right, right. </joey>
<joey> - Really nice, though. </joey>
<connor> Really like it, I don't
really like orange flavor. </connor>
<joey> - Because I think-
- It's very- </joey>
<joey> - Because I think my aunt, </joey>
<connor> I think the only reason why I
know about chocolate orange, </connor>
<joey> because like, my aunt used to
hand make chocolate orange, </joey>
<joey> but actually get slices of orange, </joey>
<joey> and like, coat it in
chocolate, and then like... </joey>
<garnt> - Actually I've just figured out </garnt>
<garnt> what fucking Australians
get patriotic about. </garnt>
<joey> - What?
- For some reason, </joey>
<joey> Tim Tams.
- Hell yeah! </joey>
<connor> - Tim Tams.
- Hell yeah! </connor>
<connor> - Mid as fuck, Australians.
- Fuck you. </connor>
<connor> (men laugh) </connor>
<joey> - I think of the bourbon
biscuits (indistinct), you know? </joey>
<connor> - I don't know, I like-
- Every Australian I've met </connor>
<garnt> has actually like, picked up Tim Tams. </garnt>
<joey> So like, extreme levels, right? </joey>
<connor> - It's the only like, good snack we have. </connor>
<connor> (men laugh)
- Debatable, debatable. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, it just goes to show the quality </connor>
<connor> of the rest of our snacks, right? </connor>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> I don't know, man, like it's good. </joey>
<joey> Don't get me wrong. </joey>
<joey> But like, Tim Tams or a bar of Toblerone? </joey>
<joey> I'll take the Toblerone.
- Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - To be honest, like there
are better snacks out there. </garnt>
<garnt> But Tim Tams is just so
readily available in Australia. </garnt>
<joey> Like, anywhere you go,
that it's just like, </joey>
<joey> it's comfort food, basically.
- Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> I mean, I feel like, I remember I tried it </garnt>
<connor> for the first time,
and I feel like we have </connor>
<connor> some very similar-
- Yeah, we have </connor>
<joey> very similar products in the UK. </joey>
<garnt> - Isn't Penguins kind of similar as well? </garnt>
<garnt> - Little bit, yeah.
- Penguins are great, though. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, Penguins are great.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> What else do we have in the UK? </joey>
<joey> Oh, Jaffa Cakes. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, Jaffa Cakes, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - What do you think about Jaffa Cakes? </connor>
<connor> - Pretty shit. </connor>
<connor> - Oh okay, good, good, good-
- What are Jaffa Cakes, again? </connor>
<joey> That sounds familiar.
- Sponge cake with- </joey>
<joey> - Orange?
- Orange jam- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, we have
those in Australia too, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's pretty gross. </joey>
<joey> - They're all right. </joey>
<joey> - They have horrible shelf life. </joey>
<connor> Those things go bad really fast. </connor>
<connor> - Really?
- Yeah. </connor>
<joey> And like, you know-
- The only time </joey>
<joey> I ever ate them was at my
Grandma's place, though. </joey>
<connor> - The packet is big
enough where you kind of </connor>
<connor> have to do it in one sitting. </connor>
<joey> Because if you open the
bag, they go bad in one day. </joey>
<joey> So, if you buy them for yourself, </joey>
<connor> you gotta commit to-
- It's definitely like, </connor>
<joey> a home party snack, right?
- Yeah, you gotta- </joey>
<garnt> - It's, whenever you go to any gathering, </garnt>
<garnt> or any kind of camping trip or something, </garnt>
<garnt> everyone always brings
out the Jaffa Cakes. </garnt>
<garnt> And I never understood why. </garnt>
<garnt> Because it's the middest snack in England </garnt>
<garnt> in my opinion, and for some reason </garnt>
<garnt> people think think I want
a piece of that. (laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - What do you mean-
- I like the taste of it. </connor>
<connor> I think it's nice, but after I have two, </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "You know what, I'm
good for the next five years". </connor>
<joey> I don't want anymore.
(Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> I'm fine.
(Garnt laughs) </joey>
<connor> Like, I enjoy it though. </connor>
<connor> I mean-
- That's how I feel </connor>
<connor> about Kinder Eggs. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh, I fucking love Kinder Eggs. </garnt>
<garnt> - Kinder Eggs are great.
- But I have like, two, </garnt>
<joey> and I'm like, "This is so much sugar". </joey>
<connor> I'm about-
- Kinder Bueno bars </connor>
<garnt> are amazing. </garnt>
<garnt> - Kinder what? </garnt>
<garnt> - Kinder Bueno, oh. </garnt>
<garnt> Those are fucking great. </garnt>
<joey> Those are great.
- Oh dude, </joey>
<joey> just bars full of the
Kinder, they're bueno. </joey>
<joey> - Oh God. </joey>
<joey> (men laugh) </joey>
<joey> - It's just Kinder. </joey>
<joey> It's really fucking good.
- Oh like, Kinder Eggs </joey>
<garnt> in a bar-
- They're hazelnut as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, the hazelnut ones are amazing. </garnt>
<connor> - I'll bring you some when I go home. </connor>
<garnt> - Do you have Aero in Australia? </garnt>
<joey> - No-
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> We do.
- We do? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, the really
like, fluffy chocolate, </joey>
<connor> not fluffy, but the really
like, bubbly chocolate- </connor>
<joey> - Bubbly chocolate.
- Yeah, yeah yeah. </joey>
<joey> We have those, yeah. </joey>
<joey> They're pretty good.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> I don't know, I really, really
fucking like Aero, right? </joey>
<joey> But then I've just realized they're like, </joey>
<garnt> selling me air. (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> Because-
- It's the equivalent </garnt>
<connor> of like, a pack of chips,
and 60% of it is air- </connor>
<joey> - But I just like how-
- Some people want like, </joey>
<connor> the light flavor-
- Yeah, I do like </connor>
<connor> the light flavor, right? </connor>
<connor> But it costs the same amount </connor>
<garnt> as every other chocolate bar. (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - Would you like some chocolate air? </garnt>
<joey> (men laugh) </joey>
<joey> - You know, sometimes, </joey>
<joey> when you buy the expensive chocolate, </joey>
<joey> like Lindt, or Lindor, or
whatever the fuck they are- </joey>
<joey> - Lind. </joey>
<garnt> - Lind, whatever it is, I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> - The Swiss chocolate? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- You know, </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes you eat one, and you're like, </garnt>
<connor> "Ah, it's good, it's good. </connor>
<connor> But do I really want like, 10?" </connor>
<connor> Like, it's not a chocolate you eat 10 of. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, that's what I've noticed
about expensive chocolate. </garnt>
<garnt> Is like, you eat one, and
you feel like you've just </garnt>
<garnt> ate 10 chocolate bars in
this one fucking chocolate- </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, and then you're like, "Great. </garnt>
<connor> I paid 50 bucks for these 10
chocolates, like this is..." </connor>
<connor> (men laugh) </connor>
<joey> - Time to give them away, I guess. </joey>
<connor> - It's like, "Fuck, what do I do now? </connor>
<connor> I don't really wanna eat these anymore". </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - That's why I like chocolates. </connor>
<connor> That you could eat so much of it. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs)
It's like, </connor>
<connor> it's so good. </connor>
<connor> Like, you never get bored of it. </connor>
<connor> Like Dairymilk, I never
get bored of that shit- </connor>
<joey> - I just can't even really eat
a lot of chocolate anymore. </joey>
<connor> - No, no me neither.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But Big Macs? </connor>
<connor> Yeah, hell yeah I can. </connor>
<connor> - Oh dude, I can smash
a Big Mac back everyday </connor>
<joey> if I want to.
- McFlurry? </joey>
<connor> Fuck yeah.
- Yeah, I don't know. </connor>
<joey> Ice cream is, I think my
love has grown for ice cream. </joey>
<joey> - Really?
- As I get older. </joey>
<joey> But my love for chocolate has gone down. </joey>
<joey> I don't know why.
- I think my- </joey>
<connor> - Ice cream is pretty MVP, though. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I think my love for
chocolate and ice cream's </connor>
<connor> just kind of gone down recently. </connor>
<connor> I don't know, my love for sweet things </connor>
<joey> has definitely gone down.
- Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - You're already sweet enough, Joey. </connor>
<joey> - Aw.
- It's not gonna (laughs). </joey>
<joey> - I definitely do like my
savory and saltier stuff better. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, because for me, </garnt>
<garnt> I think a lot of people say
you have a second stomach </garnt>
<garnt> for dessert, I don't have a
second stomach for dessert- </garnt>
<garnt> - That's bull shit. (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm just like, if I
have space in my stomach </garnt>
<garnt> for more food, then I'm
gonna eat more food. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, right?
- Right? </joey>
<joey> - Right, I mean if there
is a tiramisu available, </joey>
<connor> I will always make room for a tiramisu- </connor>
<joey> - Okay, to be fair, if
a tiramisu comes out, </joey>
<connor> I'm smashing that shit back. </connor>
<connor> - I love tiramisu-
- Yeah that's, </connor>
<connor> it has to be my favorite cake. </connor>
<joey> What's your favorite cake? </joey>
<connor> - I don't know.
- This is like </connor>
<connor> asking an alien, name
your favorite celebrity. </connor>
<garnt> - (laughs) I guess-
- The human on the TV </garnt>
<garnt> is my favorite-
- I guess, </garnt>
<garnt> if not like, the default chocolate cake, </garnt>
<garnt> then probably red velvet. </garnt>
<joey> I fucking love red velvet-
- Red velvet is good cake- </joey>
<joey> - Red velvet is probably
the only other cake </joey>
<garnt> that I like to eat, other than chocolate. </garnt>
<garnt> - Red velvet is very good. </garnt>
<joey> - I can't eat a chocolate cake anymore. </joey>
<joey> It's just way too heavy now. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, it depends. </garnt>
<connor> Like, I never eat a chocolate cake- </connor>
<connor> - Getting old, boys-
- I could never eat </connor>
<connor> a chocolate cake after a meal. </connor>
<connor> I just, sometimes I just
get a random craving </connor>
<connor> for a chocolate cake.
- Right. </connor>
<connor> - Like for me, I don't really
eat as much chocolate anymore, </connor>
<connor> but sometimes I just get this
random craving for sweets. </connor>
<connor> And you know when you fucking, </connor>
<connor> you know when you're
hungry, and you feel like </connor>
<connor> you could eat everything, right? </connor>
<connor> And so, when I get this chocolate craving, </connor>
<connor> I buy like fucking, </connor>
<connor> (laughs) I fucking like,
buy 10 different types </connor>
<garnt> of chocolate bars, chocolate
ice cream, chocolate cake, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just like, "I'm fucking craving this. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm hungry enough to eat everything". </garnt>
<garnt> I have one bite of the chocolate cake, </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm just like, "Okay, I'm done now. </garnt>
<garnt> Fuck, I've made a massive mistake". </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughs)
Because I just have </garnt>
<garnt> a table full of chocolate in front of me </garnt>
<garnt> that I know I don't wanna eat anymore. </garnt>
<garnt> - God.
- But, </garnt>
<garnt> yeah I'm not really,
I'm not a dessert guy. </garnt>
<garnt> Are you a dessert guy? </garnt>
<connor> - I mean, I prefer the main. </connor>
<connor> But sometimes, some places have like, </connor>
<connor> really good desserts,
and it makes you be like, </connor>
<joey> "Okay, hold up"-
- Could you get the, </joey>
<connor> have you ever been-
- Dessert's got a point. </connor>
<joey> - Have you ever been
to like, cake buffets? </joey>
<garnt> - Is that, wait what, it's a thing? </garnt>
<garnt> - What is that?
- Oh, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - Where, where is this?
- In Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> They're fucking everywhere, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - What, where?
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> There's one really good
one I went to in Harajuku, </connor>
<joey> where it's like, (laughs) </joey>
<joey> it's literally like a
sushi train of cakes, </joey>
<joey> of like, tiny little cakes. </joey>
<garnt> - How many can you have before
you start becoming sick? </garnt>
<joey> - I had like four, and then I was done. </joey>
<connor> But like, some of my female friends </connor>
<connor> can have like, you know
10, 15 of these cakes- </connor>
<connor> - Jesus Christ.
- It's like, man. </connor>
<joey> You guys are built different.
- Real food? </joey>
<connor> Nah, sweet shit please.
- Sweet shit. </connor>
<connor> Yeah but-
- I like cupcakes. </connor>
<connor> Cupcakes are nice. </connor>
<joey> Something about a muffin
or a cupcake that I- </joey>
<joey> - I don't think I've had a cupcake </joey>
<joey> in like, five years (laughs). </joey>
<joey> - Just a muffin, I just like muffins. </joey>
<connor> Most of them are pretty easy. </connor>
<joey> - Muffins.
- Pretty good size. </joey>
<joey> - What is it about muffins
that are very British? </joey>
<joey> - I think it's very American, I'd say. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I think it's more American- </garnt>
<joey> - When I think a muffin, I think British. </joey>
<connor> - Maybe the English muffin, </connor>
<connor> is what you're thinking of.
- Oh, could be, could be. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, because I feel like,
definitely with dessert, </garnt>
<garnt> dessert culture is way stronger in Asia </garnt>
<connor> than I feel when I was living in England. </connor>
<connor> Because I didn't, until
I moved to Thailand, </connor>
<connor> or until I went to Thailand,
I didn't know the concept </connor>
<connor> of just like, a dessert bar. </connor>
<connor> Where it's just a restaurant
that just specifically </connor>
<connor> serves desserts, that's
just not a thing in England- </connor>
<garnt> - There's some.
- Like what? </garnt>
<garnt> - What was it, like Casper's
or whatever it's called? </garnt>
<garnt> - What the fuck is Casper's-
- The ghost? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
(men laugh) </garnt>
<garnt> A big chain I saw everywhere. </garnt>
<connor> It was like a dessert thing. </connor>
<connor> But it was like, really tacky. </connor>
<garnt> I didn't really like the look of it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah like, the only kind
of, dessert oriented places </garnt>
<garnt> that I find in England now are just, </garnt>
<joey> they are marketed as Asian
dessert places, right? </joey>
<joey> And that only started
cropping up more recent, </joey>
<garnt> in the more recent times. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I guess I'm not a
fan of how fucking bright </connor>
<connor> and loud dessert places are. </connor>
<connor> I feel like I'm, do you know what I mean? </connor>
<joey> - Almost exclusively white as fuck- </joey>
<connor> - They're always like,
really pastel colors, </connor>
<connor> or really bright colors,
and I just feel like, </connor>
<joey> "Fuck I'm in"-
- You go blind </joey>
<joey> when you walk into one, right? </joey>
<joey> - I'm like, I wanna just get a dessert, </joey>
<joey> not be visually attacked-
(Joey laughs) </joey>
<garnt> By all these fucking colors.
(Garnt laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> Do you know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> And I feel like I'm in the wrong place </garnt>
<garnt> when I go into there, because I feel like </garnt>
<garnt> I'm too British for this, I'm too sad. </garnt>
<joey> I can't be in here-
- I just hate the fact </joey>
<connor> that like-
- It's horrible. </connor>
<joey> I can't stand it-
- All of the walls </joey>
<joey> are just white as fuck, and
they blast the light on. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, "Oh God, it's 2 P.M., </joey>
<joey> why are the lights on in here?" </joey>
<connor> Jesus Christ-
- When you use light mode. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. (laughs) </connor>
<connor> It's like, oh! </connor>
<joey> (men laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Just depends on the place, yeah? </joey>
<connor> When you get different types of lighting </connor>
<connor> and walls, whatever
the fuck, I don't know. </connor>
<joey> - Do you ever, are you one
of those people who like, </joey>
<joey> care about the mood of a restaurant? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah-
- The lighting, </connor>
<joey> and stuff like that?
- Definitely helps, </joey>
<connor> with, get a feel for what
the owner wanted, right? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I didn't start to care about it </garnt>
<garnt> until kind of, </garnt>
<garnt> I would say like, my mid twenties. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, they gotta build the atmosphere </connor>
<joey> before you even sit down, right? </joey>
<joey> Like they gotta get you
understanding the vibe, </joey>
<garnt> what the food-
- Yeah because, </garnt>
<garnt> before when I was a fucking
uni student or something, </garnt>
<garnt> it's not just restaurants. </garnt>
<garnt> I didn't care about the bar
vibe, you know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> Like, to me, does it serve food? </garnt>
<garnt> Is it cheap, can I eat it?
- Yeah, true. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's all I cared about, right? </garnt>
<garnt> But like, as I grew older,
I'm just like, "Damn"- </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Life's too short
to waste on shit places- </garnt>
<garnt> - Like, the vibe in the
place can really effect </garnt>
<garnt> if I'm enjoying my meal
or drink as much as usual. </garnt>
<garnt> And I don't know if something switched </garnt>
<garnt> into my brain or something. (laughs) </garnt>
<joey> - But there's a part of me that's like, </joey>
<joey> I feel if a restaurant
has a really nice mood, </joey>
<connor> or a mood that is fitting
and is comforting, </connor>
<connor> then it almost sometimes
blinds you to the fact </connor>
<garnt> that the food might not be
as good as you think it is. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh no, I mean there's
plenty of times where </garnt>
<joey> it sets up high expectations,
and the food comes out </joey>
<joey> and it's-
- It's like, E. </joey>
<connor> - It's so disappointing, right. </connor>
<connor> Because especially in Japan, right, </connor>
<connor> because I feel like especially in Japan, </connor>
<connor> every place has a unique vibe. </connor>
<connor> Every restaurant you go to looks amazing. </connor>
<connor> It has a unique selling point. </connor>
<joey> But that isn't always, </joey>
<joey> this isn't always, that doesn't
always equate to good food. </joey>
<joey> Or it just doesn't always
equate to amazing food. </joey>
<joey> - Weirdly enough, it's like
kind of the opposite in Japan. </joey>
<garnt> Where like, the shittier
the place looks usually, </garnt>
<garnt> the better the food is. </garnt>
<garnt> Especially when it comes to ramen- </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I was gonna say ramen- </connor>
<joey> - Like family-owned restaurants
and stuff like that- </joey>
<joey> - If the sign is falling apart, </joey>
<connor> then the ramen place is
probably pretty good. </connor>
<joey> (men laugh) </joey>
<joey> - Because why are you gonna give a fuck </joey>
<joey> about how it looks,
just eat the damn food. </joey>
<garnt> - Or like, because that's how
I feel about Thai food, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Because I very rarely eat
in a Thai restaurant here. </garnt>
<garnt> And that's because, for me, growing up, </garnt>
<garnt> or not growing up, but
whenever I go to Thailand, </garnt>
<garnt> some of the best food would
be street food, right. </garnt>
<garnt> So that to me, was the best kind of, </garnt>
<garnt> comfort food that I would find. </garnt>
<garnt> And to me I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> it's only when I'm like, really,
really missing Thai food, </garnt>
<garnt> and really craving it,
that I actually go out </garnt>
<garnt> and go to a restaurant. </garnt>
<garnt> But most of the times, I cook
it myself, because it's... </garnt>
<garnt> To me, it's like comfort food. </garnt>
<garnt> There's something comforting about it. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's like, the same with Japan, </garnt>
<garnt> where you go to a ramen shop, </garnt>
<garnt> if it looks like a high
class, prestigious ramen shop, </garnt>
<garnt> probably doesn't taste as good </garnt>
<garnt> as the run-down, family
made ramens, right? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, and (sighs). </garnt>
<joey> Yeah, I guess.
- Wrap it up there. </joey>
<garnt> - I guess we'll just wrap it up there. </garnt>
<joey> - Jump right into the ending. </joey>
<joey> - Jump right into these patrons. </joey>
<joey> - Oh my God, wonderful patrons. </joey>
<connor> - Look at all of them.
- Goodness gracious. </connor>
<garnt> - I bet they eat their Kit Kats correctly. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I bet they do.
(Joey laughs) </garnt>
<joey> I bet they don't use viscous spread- </joey>
<joey> - I'm gonna get so much shit for that. </joey>
<connor> - Spreadable breakfast, viscous saliva. </connor>
<connor> - I think you're talking about
viscous breakfast spreads, </connor>
<joey> all right. (laughs)
- Jesus Christ. </joey>
<joey> - Hashtag viscous breakfast spread- </joey>
<joey> - (laughs) Viscous breakfast-
- It's like a tongue twister. </joey>
