<joey> What's up ladies and
gentlemen, boys and girls. </joey>
<joey> And welcome to the first episode
of the Trash Taste Podcast. </joey>
<garnt> - How are you? </garnt>

<garnt> - The official first episode,
we've finally made it. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm your host for today Joey </garnt>

<garnt> - So yeah, is finally happening. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's finally happening. </garnt>
<garnt> Oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> You do not know how long
we've been planning this </garnt>
<garnt> and how long we've
wanted this to have this. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like how long has it been? </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, we've been conceptualize </garnt>
<garnt> in this podcast for like what? </garnt>
<joey> Over a year.
- Yeah </joey>
<garnt> Yeah, t's been year, a year,
at least possibly years. </garnt>
<connor> - Cause I mean, when we
decided we were gonna move </connor>
<connor> to Japan, I think the first thing </connor>
<connor> in our mind was we've
been gonna make a podcast. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - But I think even before that, </garnt>
<garnt> the idea of just us
finally getting into a room </garnt>
<joey> and just, you know, not
doing a one of collabo doing </joey>
<garnt> like a continual collabo
has been, you know </garnt>
<joey> in our minds for ages. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah I wanna say several years at least. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - At least almost as known
as like along is half known, </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<joey> You don't do really cool a podcast. </joey>
<connor> - I'm just left out here. </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> I was tacked on at the end, no. </garnt>
<connor> - Let's talk about that, </connor>
<garnt> like how we first met each other </garnt>
<garnt> because I think that's a good
introduction to this podcast </garnt>
<joey> and how we've grown. </joey>
<joey> - Yes because you never know
there might be someone watching </joey>
<garnt> who doesn't know like who is that guy? </garnt>
<garnt> Who is that guy? </garnt>
<joey> Who's this guy? </joey>
<connor> - Exactly, right. </connor>
<connor> - Hi, I'm Connor, hi. </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> And another channel. </garnt>
<connor> - Hopefully surprised </connor>
<joey> if there is someone watching first episode </joey>
<joey> who doesn't know like who's three of us? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah exactly. </joey>
<connor> - Maybe. </connor>
<connor> - Or maybe they've seen us. </connor>
<joey> - You see if you did </joey>
<joey> then can you please
tell us in the comments </joey>
<joey> well how you found this video.
(Garnt laughs) </joey>
<connor> - Because we're just so famous
(Garnt laughs) </connor>
<joey> then you've not this </joey>
<connor> for not knowing who we are there. </connor>
<joey> - I swear. </joey>
<connor> So, yeah let's actually, you know what, </connor>
<connor> before we talk about that, </connor>
<connor> we should probably talk
about what this podcast is. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah.
- That's true. </connor>
<garnt> - We just like rushing into things </garnt>
<connor> 'cause there's so, we're so like excited. </connor>
<connor> - I'm finally (mumbles) </connor>
<garnt> - Who's so excited to get
this thing off the ground? </garnt>
<garnt> So basically Trash Taste as
the name implies is a podcast </garnt>
<garnt> where we us three and maybe sometimes </garnt>
<garnt> even a guest you never
know, comes onto the show </garnt>
<joey> and we basically talk
about our Trash Taste. </joey>
<joey> Whether it comes to Anime,
Manga, and Otaku culture </joey>
<joey> in general, or you never know, </joey>
<joey> we might talk about
whatever the fuck we want. </joey>
<garnt> Who knows? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, 'cause if, if you didn't know, </garnt>
<garnt> we are all like Anime YouTubers. </garnt>
<garnt> - So
- No why? </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Bro </garnt>
<garnt> - This guy called the Anime Man. </garnt>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I really felt myself
for that one definitely. </connor>
<garnt> - This guy called CDAWG VA which </garnt>
<garnt> - My God </garnt>
<joey> - Garnt that too.
- What is VAsten for? </joey>
<connor> - Virginia is all the comments
(laughing) </connor>
<joey> - He's from Virginia. </joey>
<garnt> - It's okay, 'cause the amount of years </garnt>
<garnt> that I still get comments, </garnt>
<garnt> which is like, they call me Gigg UK </garnt>
<connor> and not Gigguk. </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - How do you do that? </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> - I mean listen, people
might call you Gigg UK </joey>
<garnt> but I still know you as
the animation (mumbles) </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> But AC in the thumbnails,
in the old thumbnails. </garnt>
<garnt> That's how I knew I was
watching an Anime Zone. </garnt>
<joey> - Actually I'm not curious. </joey>
<joey> How long have you been watching my videos? </joey>
<garnt> Because this ties into
how we first met as well. </garnt>
<joey> - I've known you I mean,
I obviously, as I said, </joey>
<garnt> I've known you since the Anime Zone. </garnt>
<connor> - That's like...
- Which is like a long time. </connor>
<connor> But I think I, like, I watched
you probably not knowing </connor>
<connor> that you will like this
like YouTube personality. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah same. </connor>
<connor> - Because like, I was
in like a weird state. </connor>
<connor> I don't think I discovered
YouTubers until maybe about 2011. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Maybe because they'd been around </connor>
<garnt> for a long time since then.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - And obviously you've
been around since then. </connor>
<connor> But I never like went onto YouTube being </connor>
<connor> like I'm gonna go check
out my favorite YouTube. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<garnt> I kind of just use YouTube
up until around 2011. </garnt>
<connor> I think I just use YouTube
as to like either watch music </connor>
<connor> or listen to music videos or just to like, </connor>
<connor> Oh this is an interesting looking video. </connor>
<garnt> And I think a couple of your videos will </garnt>
<garnt> like the interesting looking ones. </garnt>
<garnt> I think I remember actually
the first video I ever watched </garnt>
<garnt> from you surprisingly was not EvAbridged. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh share okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - I watched EvAbridged
when I like the idea </garnt>
<connor> of an came around.
- And an bridged series. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah and I was like, oh a bridging. </connor>
<connor> That sounds fun, but tedious as fun. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> But no, I think the first
video I watched from you was, </connor>
<garnt> Oh God, I probably wanna say it's </garnt>
<garnt> the Summer Wars Review you did? </garnt>
<garnt> Oh my God. </garnt>
<joey> - Like the one you did like 2000 </joey>
<garnt> - What's going (mumbles)
what's the fuck man? </garnt>
<garnt> - I never even saw your EvAbridged. </garnt>
<garnt> I just, cause I didn't watch Davis. </garnt>
<garnt> There was a lot of watched your bri... </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know what is sounds. </garnt>
<garnt> like, I wanna watch that </garnt>
<garnt> So I think I watched some of your stuff. </garnt>
<connor> I just knew you always the British one. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - The British. </connor>
<connor> That's my brand name. </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause there was like,
it was like Tristin </garnt>
<connor> and then you in my mind. </connor>
<garnt> I think that was it to a lot of people </garnt>
<garnt> when I was, when I got into it like 2013, </garnt>
<connor> I start watching YouTube a
lot, especially anime stuff. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, but so how long have
you been doing YouTube for? </garnt>
<garnt> - I've been doing it since 2007. </garnt>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - He's like an actual OG. </joey>
<joey> - I'll have to like Trace
Back, but I'm thinking I'm </joey>
<joey> like the fifth ever Anime YouTuber </joey>
<joey> of all the time might be
like four, four fifth. </joey>
<joey> But I've been there since the beginning. </joey>
<joey> I can recite the entire
history of Anime YouTube. </joey>
<joey> - Which we're definitely
gonna do with like a future </joey>
<joey> - Not for this episode,
'cause there's a lot to say, </joey>
<joey> but for now I remember the first, </joey>
<connor> I can't remember the exact first
video I saw from you, Joey. </connor>
<connor> But I remember your videos
just getting recommended </connor>
<connor> to be constantly. </connor>
<connor> And I'm just like my first thought was </connor>
<connor> how was no one taking the
handle, the anime (mumbles) </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> I've been on usual for
so many fucking years </garnt>
<garnt> and just now someone
it's called the Anime. </garnt>
<garnt> There's no fun. </garnt>
<garnt> - No but the thing is,
someone did take the hand land </garnt>
<garnt> because that's why like on
like even my YouTube URL </garnt>
<connor> and like my Twitter and everything, </connor>
<connor> it's the Anime Man but it's I it's a one. </connor>
<connor> Because somebody over a
Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, </connor>
<garnt> like YouTube someone took the Anime Man. </garnt>
<garnt> He was like this guy who
never uploaded any videos. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> And he's been around since like 2007. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah it's always just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "men you are such a son of a bitch." </garnt>
<garnt> So I was like, well, what am I gonna do? </garnt>
<garnt> All right fuck (mumbles) to one. </garnt>
<garnt> Somehow that caught on and
I don't know how the fuck </garnt>
<garnt> but yeah. </garnt>
<joey> I mean I've regret that name. </joey>
<joey> Let's be honest. </joey>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, it works for as you ever. </garnt>
<garnt> Because the reason I was
called the Anime Zone, </garnt>
<garnt> is because, </garnt>
<garnt> - You're an Anime. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah because back </garnt>
<garnt> - He will sing the song. </garnt>
<garnt> - But that back in the day </garnt>
<garnt> when you could just type an Anime </garnt>
<joey> and it was just all my videos. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, man, I've won this game </joey>
<joey> I've playing the game correctly. </joey>
<joey> - And then I came along,
I was like, hold my beat. </joey>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Exactly. </garnt>
<joey> - You're in the zone, I'm the man. </joey>
<garnt> - But I remember the
first time I have was, </garnt>
<joey> I mean I don't think I ever
saw one of your videos. </joey>
<connor> The first time I heard about
you Conner was actually </connor>
<connor> when you "auditioned" for
one of my Abridged series. </connor>
<connor> - So really? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah is yes so I
haven't told this story </connor>
<connor> to Joey yet. </connor>
<connor> So I did a casting call for one of the </connor>
<garnt> in minutes videos, right. </garnt>
<garnt> And I told people to send
in their some of the videos </garnt>
<connor> - I'm trying to remember what this was now </connor>
<garnt> because I remember. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's going all the way back. </garnt>
<garnt> And so I asked people to
send in their demo reel </garnt>
<connor> and most people send in their demo reel </connor>
<connor> and this guy, this fuck doesn't
even send in a demo reel. </connor>
<connor> He just sends in a YouTube video </connor>
<connor> of him doing League of
Legends character impressions </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - So why you should also
never do that yourself. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah don't, don't do that. </garnt>
<connor> - When someone asked for
demos, send a demo reel, </connor>
<connor> you don't know I think at the time, </connor>
<connor> I didn't have a character demo. </connor>
<connor> - Do I still don't have
a character demo reel </connor>
<garnt> because I never needed it. </garnt>
<garnt> Okay, his things were a
lot of character demos </garnt>
<garnt> on Twitter, you'll hear them. </garnt>
<garnt> They've really, really bad. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And the thing is when
you're making it yourself, </garnt>
<garnt> you don't have anyone to say like, </garnt>
<connor> "hey you displease kind of sucks." </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> So like every time I've
made a professional demo, </connor>
<connor> I've had like a director
who's at hand shows </connor>
<connor> in every scene and told me what to do. </connor>
<garnt> And then it sounds good </garnt>
<garnt> because someone who can
hear your voice and be like, </garnt>
<garnt> how do this and that. </garnt>
<garnt> Back then, I didn't know that. </garnt>
<garnt> And this is before I started doing </garnt>
<garnt> a lot of professional stuff and that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's a great way to introduce someone. </garnt>
<connor> This is why, </connor>
<connor> this is also another thing
you shouldn't send a demo </connor>
<connor> to someone if it's garbage </connor>
<connor> 'cause you guy, like this
guy still remembers that shit </connor>
<garnt> - I even remember because
he was the only person </garnt>
<garnt> who didn't send a demo reel </garnt>
<garnt> but just sent a YouTube video
of him doing impressions. </garnt>
<garnt> Never send like if there is, </garnt>
<garnt> like a checklist of things
not to send for a demo, </garnt>
<garnt> do not send character impression. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's such a big, that's
such a big dick move. </garnt>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> It's like, I don't even
need cast demo reels. </garnt>
<garnt> My impressions are good enough. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm sorry about that.- </garnt>
<connor> - So, I mean, would you remember
which characters you did? </connor>
<joey> - I think so. </joey>
<connor> I think there were like, </connor>
<garnt> I was just to bunch them manly
guys from League Legends. </garnt>
<garnt> It's just anyone with a low voice. </garnt>
<garnt> (mumbling) </garnt>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> I did long still (mumbles) </connor>
<connor> - It's like, its been awesome
seeing you how far you've come </connor>
<garnt> from sending in a character
impression reel to be like. </garnt>
<connor> - That was like, I
thought it must have been </connor>
<connor> just like a year or two
after I started as well. </connor>
<connor> When I still like, you think
that you figure stuff out </connor>
<joey> after a year but like you
realize when you look back </joey>
<joey> like you're still, you
just didn't know share </joey>
<joey> - Because what year did you start? </joey>
<joey> - YouTube? </joey>
<garnt> YouTube I started 2015,
- 2015. </garnt>
<garnt> - 2015, I started voice acting </garnt>
<garnt> really in like 2013, like 2014. </garnt>
<joey> So that gave me a big like advantage. </joey>
<joey> I went into it with like
a great mind microphone. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Which a lot of, </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause that voice acting. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, and I mean, funny
enough how I met you </joey>
<garnt> actually have the email sent to me. </garnt>
<garnt> - Weuh, weuh, weuh you have an email? </garnt>
<connor> - I have the email. </connor>
<joey> - Before we started recording this one, </joey>
<connor> we're going to talk about </connor>
<joey> like how we all met one another. </joey>
<joey> This guy was like, </joey>
<joey> I don't think Joey remembers
the first time we met. </joey>
<joey> I think I do though. </joey>
<connor> - Okay, (mumbles) read the email that I. </connor>
<joey> Okay this is what I had. </joey>
<joey> - Why you you sent it to me, right? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah so this was about like, </garnt>
<connor> how I must've been like four
months into me doing YouTube. </connor>
<garnt> And I think I had like maybe 30, 40K subs. </garnt>
<connor> Yeah, I think Joey, I think
he had like 900K at this time? </connor>
<garnt> - Probably.
- He was something like, </garnt>
<garnt> you had a lot. </garnt>
<garnt> And like way more than I had. </garnt>
<garnt> And so I sent you an
email saying (mumbles) </garnt>
<garnt> like formal. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> Hello there, my name is
Connor or CDawgVA on YouTube. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> Why this is making any
sense grammatically? </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> (mumbles) I wish is commas. </garnt>
<garnt> "Hello there. </garnt>
<garnt> My name is Connor or CDawgVA
on YouTube channel here", </garnt>
<garnt> and then. </garnt>
<garnt> - Channel here
- Channel here </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, here's where it starts
to get real crunch again. </garnt>
<connor> "I've been working on a Levi
versus Sebastian Rap Battle." </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God! </connor>
<connor> (laughing loudly) </connor>
<joey> - Okay wait, I'll finish
it then I'll explain it. </joey>
<joey> "And it is about 90% complete. </joey>
<joey> I noticed you recently did a Rap Battle </joey>
<joey> and it was well done." </joey>
<joey> Wow, I couldn't have
kissed your ass more here. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> "It's more of an insulting
each other a character rap. </garnt>
<garnt> I have the voice of Sebastian
Michaelis, English Dub </garnt>
<garnt> down to a tee." </garnt>
<garnt> Wow, it's really </garnt>
<garnt> - Wow, wow. </garnt>
<garnt> - "And I was wondering
if you'd like to be Levi </garnt>
<garnt> If you wish to talk to me more about it </garnt>
<connor> and the logistics feel free
to contact me on Skype." </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Really Jesus. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> - I wanted the sound professional was fun </joey>

<joey> And then Joey replied saying. </joey>
<joey> "Hi there! </joey>
<joey> Sure, sounds like fun." </joey>
<joey> Smiley face. </joey>
<joey> "I added you on Skype

<joey> I remember the first thing
Joey sent me was like, </joey>
<joey> "your voice is cool is fun." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah and I was like, I
still think that it is. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, so that's how like </joey>
<joey> and to this day I
thought that was so cool. </joey>
<joey> You actually replied
'cause I'm not gonna lie. </joey>
<connor> I'm kind of mean when
I see a video normally </connor>
<connor> when it's like collabo,
it's normally like. </connor>
<connor> - Its normally like. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Normally like I don't

<connor> but I wanna a collabo. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - And it's a good, you don't
know what you wanna do yet. </connor>
<connor> You're pitching the
(mumbles) what the fuck? </connor>
<connor> So that's how I met you. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah I fucking remember that too, </connor>
<connor> because yeah, the the rap
battle I did was so bad. </connor>
<connor> Don't watch it. </connor>
<connor> ♪ I could've spend more time ♪ </connor>
<connor> ♪ pwning royals at chess ♪ </connor>
<connor> ♪ but looks like I gotta prove to you ♪ </connor>
<connor> ♪ that I'm the best. ♪ </connor>
<connor> ♪ You wanna fight, little emo? ♪ </connor>
<connor> ♪ Well, be my guest! ♪ </connor>
<connor> ♪ I fought till the end ♪ </connor>
<connor> ♪ until I got a knife in my chest. ♪ </connor>
<connor> - It was pretty bad. </connor>
<connor> - It was pretty fucking
battle at the time, </connor>
<garnt> it was the first time I
ever used the green screen. </garnt>
<garnt> It might be (cheering) </garnt>
<garnt> even like because I was
in like my tiny bedroom </garnt>
<garnt> in Australia. </garnt>
<garnt> There was no place to like
prop up the green screen. </garnt>
<garnt> So what I had to do, it's so ghetto. </garnt>
<garnt> What I had to do was I had
to get the green screen </garnt>
<garnt> and literally like tape it to the ceiling </garnt>
<garnt> and I've done exactly the same thing. </garnt>
<garnt> Just like let it down and
just stand in front of it. </garnt>
<garnt> And like, I had no lights. </garnt>
<garnt> You could see my shadow fucking flickering </garnt>
<garnt> in and out the whole video. </garnt>
<garnt> I obviously couldn't rap at the time. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm a little bit better now, </garnt>
<garnt> but yeah it was, what was it? </garnt>
<connor> It was a light no it was L from Death Note </connor>
<connor> versus Lelouch from Code Geass. </connor>
<connor> - I remember.
- And I played Lelouche </connor>
<garnt> and another friend of mine played L. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I think that video has
like half a million views. </garnt>
<joey> I don't know how?
- Yeah </joey>
<garnt> - I mean this is back when it was </garnt>
<joey> like Epic Rap Battles of History. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah we basically
wanted to do an history </garnt>
<connor> but with no cost plays </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - It's a just. </connor>
<connor> - Rapping in front of a green screen. </connor>
<connor> (laughing loudly) </connor>
<connor> - Checks out that's like 2015 YouTube. </connor>
<connor> - But basically like that
kind of somehow popped off </connor>
<connor> for my channel and then yeah. </connor>
<connor> And then you. </connor>
<joey> - 'Cause I actually was writing that </joey>
<connor> with Gray Fox at the time. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Amazing guy. </connor>
<connor> And I thought like we had like a burger. </connor>
<connor> We had like so many like
Grey Fox had made the tracks </connor>
<connor> for many beats and they were like amazing. </connor>
<garnt> - Man sending emails. </garnt>
<connor> That's such a boom away
to slide into something. </connor>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - Not to mention, we
added each other on Skype. </garnt>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> The back, the good old days of Skype. </joey>
<connor> - And then I think like your
Skype account got hacked </connor>
<connor> or something like a sort. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah it got hacked twice </joey>
<connor> - That I know how I met
you, but it was weird </connor>
<garnt> 'cause I think Sydney. </garnt>
<garnt> I saw Sydney was following me. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah Sydsnap my fiance. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah and I think I followed her back </garnt>
<garnt> so I knew of Sydney and then Sydney DM me. </garnt>
<garnt> She'll say that she
didn't Sydney DM first. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> And she was like, you're going to MCM </garnt>
<garnt> which is a convention in London </garnt>
<garnt> And I was like yeah okay. </garnt>
<garnt> And then Sydney was like,
"come, come to this meetup, </garnt>
<garnt> you can meet me in Garnt." </garnt>
<garnt> I didn't get to meet
Garnt he was too busy. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing loudly) </garnt>
<garnt> So I turned up like an idiot like, </garnt>
<connor> I'm like sea dog and stuff. </connor>
<connor> (mumbles) </connor>
<connor> (laughs loudly) </connor>
<connor> At the time I had like 200 K subscribers. </connor>
<connor> So it was like a substantial
amount for that time period. </connor>
<garnt> - He was funny because you had a audience </garnt>
<garnt> that was vastly different from
every other Anime YouTuber. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean still like that to this. </garnt>
<joey> - [Both] Yeah, yeah.
- That's true. </joey>
<connor> It's gone like a lot less so at the time </connor>
<connor> and around 2000, the peak of it at 2014, </connor>
<connor> I had a 93% female audience. </connor>
<joey> - Which is unheard of. </joey>
<garnt> - I think his nickname when
first met him was the 93%. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing loudly) </garnt>
<garnt> We would just like how's the 90% doing? </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing loudly) </garnt>
<connor> - Okay I got bullied for it. </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - I really wanna start
calling you (mumbles) </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - It's like 55, 60% now. </connor>
<joey> It's leveled up. </joey>
<connor> - It's like you are going to enjoy. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> Who's crazy though. </connor>
<connor> And that's like a whole
YouTube is in Anime. </connor>
<connor> All dudes there was like one
or two girls but just all dude. </connor>
<connor> So every time I turned up to
like an Anime YouTuber meetup, </connor>
<connor> everyone's like, "fuck
who the is this guy?" </connor>
<connor> How's he got 200K, how
does, how did he get that? </connor>
<connor> How would no one of us know who he is? </connor>
<joey> - Why this guy from Virginia? </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> What the fuck. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, so I mean that time had gone. </connor>
<connor> And then we went from there. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah can I tell the story about </garnt>
<connor> how the first time we met? </connor>
<garnt> - Sure?
- Yeah, 'cause. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know where you're
gonna start this case. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay so the first time we met in person, </garnt>
<joey> so it was like a 2000 and is it 17 </joey>
<joey> - [Both] or 16 or 17? </joey>
<joey> - I think so, I knew Joey. </joey>
<garnt> I didn't know that he knew who I was. </garnt>
<joey> - Right, and vice versa. </joey>
<joey> I knew Garnt, but I
didn't know if he knew me. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, so this was back when I had, like, </garnt>
<garnt> if you didn't know, </garnt>
<garnt> I took a hiatus on YouTube </garnt>
<garnt> for like two years because
like got a real time, </garnt>
<garnt> a real job and everything like that. </garnt>
<garnt> And in that time I had gone from being </garnt>
<garnt> like one of the most
popular Anime YouTubers </garnt>
<garnt> to just, you know someone
who had taken a hiatus. </garnt>
<garnt> And in that time Joey had like exploded </garnt>
<garnt> like you've reached numbers
that's back in my time, </garnt>
<garnt> I didn't know was even fucking possible. </garnt>
<garnt> Like you were like close to a million, </garnt>
<garnt> you were like be like
(mumbles) at the time. </garnt>
<garnt> So the first time, </garnt>
<garnt> so the first time I saw Joey, </garnt>
<garnt> we were like in Little Tokyo or something? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah I remember
exactly where it was too. </joey>
<connor> It was that part in like the
back half of Little Tokyo. </connor>
<connor> Wrack it's like underneath a building </connor>
<garnt> and you go into where there, </garnt>
<garnt> it's like a figuring shop there in. </garnt>
<garnt> And you were walking with Jeff, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah that's what a Jeff. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I think Jeff said hello to Misty </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause they were both tall motherfucking </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> So he was just like standing
next to two fucking skyscrapers </garnt>
<garnt> while we're just hanging out. </garnt>
<garnt> And I remember looking at
you and you looked at me </garnt>
<garnt> and we didn't say shit to each other. </garnt>
<garnt> And I thought this, I
thought this motherfucking </garnt>
<garnt> must hate me. </garnt>
<garnt> This, motherfucker hates me. </garnt>
<joey> - And at the same time I like gone, </joey>
<joey> like looked at each other in the eyes </joey>
<joey> and in my head I was like, </joey>
<garnt> this guy definitely hates me. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing loudly) </garnt>
<joey> This guy hates my guts. </joey>
<garnt> - So I'm just like man, Joey
is such an arrogant piece </garnt>
<garnt> of shit man. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> Like I can't believe this guy. </garnt>
<joey> - I remember we shook hands. </joey>
<joey> We were like, "hi I'm Joey, nice to me." </joey>
<garnt> And you're like, "hi, I'm
Garnt, nice to meet you." </garnt>
<garnt> And that was it. </garnt>
<garnt> - And that was it, that's was the same. </garnt>
<joey> - It was so awkward. </joey>
<joey> - Had never heard this story </joey>
<connor> - Well because the only people
who were there was Misty, </connor>
<connor> Jeff and Arche. </connor>
<garnt> Just thinking, us too. </garnt>
<garnt> So it was like very small. </garnt>
<garnt> And then what? </garnt>
<joey> Like, fast-forward like what? </joey>
<garnt> Who he is? </garnt>
<garnt> - I think it was just, </garnt>
<garnt> I think it was next year, </garnt>
<garnt> it might've been even less than that. </garnt>
<garnt> When I came to a trip,
went onto a trip to Japan </garnt>
<joey> or something and then. </joey>
<joey> - You randomly DMed me </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah I was like, </joey>
<joey> for some reason he follows me. </joey>
<connor> So maybe he doesn't hate me. </connor>
<connor> - May be he is cool. </connor>
<garnt> - May be he is cool. </garnt>
<garnt> So yeah, we we DMed each other </garnt>
<garnt> and then we met in Japan </garnt>
<garnt> and then we just like instantly just </garnt>
<garnt> like fucking great friends, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah and from that point. </garnt>
<garnt> We went to in his no
we met up in our Cobre. </garnt>
<garnt> - And we like hang out a little bit </garnt>
<garnt> and then we went to in Izakaya in Ueno </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Till like two in the morning </garnt>
<connor> or something like something
ridiculous like that. </connor>
<joey> We missed the last train. </joey>
<connor> - And then we were like. </connor>
<connor> - It sounds like a bromance. </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - No.
- We missed the last train. </garnt>
<garnt> We had so much fun together. </garnt>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause we had the moment when we just, </garnt>
<garnt> were singing in there Izakaya </garnt>
<garnt> and I was like, I thought you hated me. </garnt>
<joey> - And I was like, how
don't you hate on me. </joey>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> So we don't hate each other. </garnt>
<connor> - And then after that we
had like a Karaoke Night </connor>
<joey> where we... </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. I think it was
like a few days later. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah and I think that's when the seeds </joey>
<joey> of the podcast was so in my think. </joey>
<joey> because we were up to,
we missed the last train </joey>
<joey> and we were just with Karaoke
with each other and Sydney. </joey>
<joey> And there was like two other people. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And then everyone else had fallen asleep </joey>
<garnt> but it was just us two and one other guy. </garnt>
<garnt> It was it like? </garnt>
<garnt> It was like 5:00 AM. </garnt>
<joey> - I remember who the other guy was? </joey>
<garnt> I don't remember either. </garnt>
<joey> - Four guy. </joey>
<garnt> - It wasn't like a
friend of Garnt or mine. </garnt>
<garnt> It was just a dude. </garnt>
<garnt> - He didn't know who we were. </garnt>
<joey> Like, he didn't know that we were </joey>
<joey> like Anime YouTubers or anything. </joey>
<garnt> So we were up at 5:00 AM, drunk shits. </garnt>
<garnt> And then me and Joey just
start hosting this panel </garnt>
<garnt> for this one guy all right. </garnt>
<garnt> - We each had like a
Karaoke microphone each </garnt>
<garnt> like echo you. </garnt>
<joey> And we were just like,
welcome to the panel. </joey>
<joey> And there's this one dude across the table </joey>
<joey> be like (cheers). </joey>
<garnt> - 'Cause yeah, he didn't know who we were </garnt>
<garnt> but we still would just hosted
this Anime panel for him. </garnt>
<joey> I don't know if... </joey>
<joey> I didn't even know him,
if he watched anime or not </joey>
<joey> but I'm like Joey, what's your opinion </joey>
<joey> on Bucky Mourner Gutter,
who is the best skill? </joey>
<joey> - That's when all for like an hour </joey>
<joey> - Yeah and this went on for like an hour </joey>
<joey> then after that, we were like, </joey>
<joey> we need to host a panel together. </joey>
<joey> And we managed to do that last year at AX </joey>
<joey> - Which was awesome. </joey>
<joey> - That was amazing.
- Yes. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah like two, three years in the making </joey>
<joey> and in between that, we were like, </joey>
<joey> surely we gonna make a
podcast all the time then. </joey>
<joey> - And here we are after fucking what? </joey>
<garnt> Three or four years. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - From like first conception. </garnt>
<garnt> And like, even like planning
this whole podcast out </garnt>
<joey> as well like took a very, very long time. </joey>
<connor> - Because this is
actually a studio for it. </connor>
<joey> - Yes so we had to
like, get our own studio </joey>
<garnt> as you can see, we're still working on it, </garnt>
<garnt> still working on it,
but give us some time, </garnt>
<joey> stick around for that. </joey>
<garnt> - It's like getting a studio in Japan </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> - In Tokyo my God don't
even get me started </garnt>
<garnt> on how hard that was like. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm sure we can talk about
in future our experiences </connor>
<garnt> with just renting stuff in Japan, my God. </garnt>
<garnt> But yeah now you know, what's
funny when you guys are </garnt>
<garnt> like you said, he like just clicked </garnt>
<garnt> like that after you guys
start talking it's so like, </garnt>
<joey> I think that happens easily </joey>
<joey> when you're both like around
the same, like sub thing. </joey>
<joey> Cause there's no question </joey>
<joey> if you're trying to leach off each other. </joey>
<joey> - Right.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause I remember like
when I first started </joey>
<joey> and when I was trying like, </joey>
<garnt> when we were like first like hanging out, </garnt>
<garnt> I always felt like, man they wonder if I'm </garnt>
<garnt> just like a leach or something. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause like I had like 150, 200 </garnt>
<garnt> and they had like million plus right. </garnt>
<garnt> So you just get this thing in your head. </garnt>
<garnt> You're like, man, am I like leaching? </garnt>
<joey> Do they think that? </joey>
<joey> But then like when you get, </joey>
<connor> like I think now I don't give a shit </connor>
<joey> because like I. </joey>
<connor> - I mean like concerning you and I, </connor>
<connor> when we popped off very naturally </connor>
<connor> because spoiler we never ended up doing </connor>
<connor> that fucking Rap Battle. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And that just like disappeared </connor>
<connor> because I think the first time
I like publicly did something </connor>
<connor> with you was on your stream. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah you did. </connor>
<connor> - And we played BROFORCE together </connor>
<connor> for like three hours. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it's still up on, on YouTube. </connor>
<joey> - Really? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah and then I think we just, </connor>
<joey> I played a lot of games
on your stream with you. </joey>
<joey> And then I think we just hang out at AX </joey>
<joey> and you just went and then obviously. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause we tie like Metal Slug (mumbles) </joey>
<connor> - Metal Slugs is like my favorite games. </connor>
<garnt> And then I think we
just did British things </garnt>
<garnt> and met up and got, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> (mumbling) </connor>
<connor> I feel like it's so easy to
befriend other British people </connor>
<connor> 'cause it's just like, we
just get it I don't know. </connor>
<garnt> - Not, like going off to what you said </garnt>
<connor> about feeling like your
leaching from someone. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's weird right because you can, </connor>
<connor> as someone who's been in the position of, </connor>
<garnt> you know, not being a smaller YouTuber </garnt>
<garnt> and in a larger YouTuber, </garnt>
<garnt> it's you can kind of get a sense just </garnt>
<garnt> from meeting a plus in this house. </garnt>
<garnt> Actually if you meet
them in real life, right? </garnt>
<connor> Online it's so fucking difficult </connor>
<connor> to gauge what a character </connor>
<connor> what someone's character is actually like. </connor>
<garnt> And you know, if they're
trying to, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> leach off you get clout or whatever, </garnt>
<garnt> but especially at a event like AX. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<joey> - Where the real person comes out. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, you can definitely
get a better judge </garnt>
<garnt> of character at a convention
or meeting someone </garnt>
<garnt> in real life, like a big event, like AX. </garnt>
<connor> - I think there's also a lot with that. </connor>
<connor> Is that when you're at AX, </connor>
<connor> I think some people think, okay </connor>
<connor> I've only got five minutes with this guy </connor>
<garnt> and I've got to like befriend him. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - So they, I think they, like
sometimes they go overboard </garnt>
<connor> with like trying to impress
you where it's like, </connor>
<connor> what the fuck is this guy? </connor>
<connor> - I mean, one thing I've noticed </connor>
<connor> with when it comes to like, </connor>
<garnt> 'cause I've been to so many conventions </garnt>
<garnt> where like people have come up to me </garnt>
<garnt> just for that like five
minutes that they have time </garnt>
<connor> with somebody that's an like just, </connor>
<connor> I don't wanna say kiss us </connor>
<garnt> but you know, when
someone's trying to kiss us </garnt>
<garnt> or like, but like the thing is that like, </garnt>
<garnt> at least earlier on when I
would meet people like that </garnt>
<garnt> and they're trying to be nice </garnt>
<garnt> to me during those five minutes. </garnt>
<garnt> I didn't know if they were
Just trying to kiss my ass </garnt>
<garnt> or if they would genuinely nice people. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - But the one way I
found it is if they can, </garnt>
<garnt> I guess like maybe try and
maintain that friendship </garnt>
<garnt> with you and try and stay contact with you </garnt>
<garnt> after that event. </garnt>
<joey> Then I think there like
genuinely nice people. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, because I don't
wanna make it sound </garnt>
<connor> like we're all fucking assholes. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> Talking with, hearing about how you </garnt>
<garnt> just messaged Conner back
from just that one email, </garnt>
<garnt> I also remember the point when
I would just try to like talk </garnt>
<garnt> to everyone and collaborate with everyone. </garnt>
<garnt> But then you get to a
point when you see that 90% </garnt>
<garnt> of these emails, 90%
of these people talking </garnt>
<garnt> to you don't actually mean what
they mean or they're looking </garnt>
<garnt> for something and you get a sense. </garnt>
<garnt> You get a sense for that as time goes by. </garnt>
<connor> So it's. </connor>
<connor> - I feel like you can just
glance at an email now </connor>
<connor> and you know what they're up to. </connor>
<joey> What I'm trying to get. </joey>
<joey> - Usually if it starts
with I'm 13 years old, </joey>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<joey> then that's something (mumbles) to delete. </joey>
<joey> - Actually here's a question for you. </joey>
<joey> What's the way I know
you've got some stories </joey>
<joey> of this Conner. </joey>
<joey> - I don't. </joey>
<joey> - What are some of like
the weirdest fun emails, </joey>
<joey> you've ever received? </joey>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like, I get them every week. </garnt>
<garnt> I like to say every week, but it's like, </garnt>
<garnt> I've gotten some where it's just like, </garnt>
<connor> I genuinely think like I'm
actually scared to open it. </connor>
<connor> Even though there's like
no attachments, no links </connor>
<garnt> or anything, but even a subject title. </garnt>
<garnt> It's literally just, I open
it and it says, "you're cool." </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> Opening an email like
that at like midnight is </garnt>
<garnt> like the scariest ever, </garnt>
<joey> because I'm just like did
my computer just get act. </joey>
<joey> I don't know if this is like an elaborate </joey>
<joey> like chores or if it's
just like a 10-year old </joey>
<joey> who's learning to use email
for the first time like. </joey>
<garnt> I'm like thanks but who are you? </garnt>
<garnt> - When they just send a link, that's cool. </garnt>
<joey> It's sounds like (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - No that's all it looks like </joey>
<joey> - Men I don't know, I've
got so many stories, </joey>
<garnt> I guess of emails because
I guess it's my fault </garnt>
<garnt> because I kind of encouraged
that a little bit. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I've made multiple videos
where I've got content </garnt>
<garnt> from my email sometimes it's good </garnt>
<garnt> but then also I think now
since I've joined an agency, </garnt>
<garnt> I feel bad for the agency </garnt>
<garnt> where they sometimes
see the shit I get said. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> Luckily I normally like delete the ones </garnt>
<connor> that I know are like
they're just trolling. </connor>
<connor> The full by agency can see it. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I don't want some
Japanese worker opening my email </connor>
<connor> and it being like, "hey, I
think you're dummy thick." </connor>
<connor> And I'm 13 by the way. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> You get stuff where they'll say like, </garnt>
<garnt> they wanna date you
and they'll put the 13. </garnt>
<garnt> And like, it's just like, </garnt>
<connor> this is Chris Hansen is
Chris Hansen emailing me. </connor>
<connor> I think I've spoken about
this in a video once. </connor>
<garnt> But there was someone who emailed me </garnt>
<garnt> and I still remember this. </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause like I had an
interview, I replied to it </garnt>
<garnt> and it was this interaction
where they sent me a script </garnt>
<garnt> of phone sex that we'll gonna have. </garnt>
<garnt> - What? </garnt>
<garnt> - So it looked like it was like, </garnt>
<garnt> - What? </garnt>
<garnt> - I actually still have the script. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm not gonna read it out </garnt>
<garnt> because there's more to the story. </garnt>
<garnt> There's the reason why
I decided not make it </garnt>
<connor> into a video. </connor>
<connor> But it was like a script and (laughs) </connor>
<connor> first it was one script was me and her </connor>
<garnt> and there was also a music setlist </garnt>
<garnt> that she'd chosen. </garnt>
<garnt> So that was when the music was playing. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - You in the end by Lincoln Park </connor>
<joey> - It was like pour some sugar on me, </joey>
<garnt> you know like the cheesiest song. </garnt>
<garnt> And so I thought in my head, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause back then I read
all of them in depth </garnt>
<garnt> and I thought wow, this is the video idea. </garnt>
<garnt> If I can like, keep this going. </garnt>
<connor> - And there's also another
script where is me having gay sex </connor>
<connor> with Sebastian Michael's. </connor>
<connor> - Of course
- Of course. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, that would be expected. </garnt>
<connor> - It's funny that's like
not the weirdest story. </connor>
<connor> - I'm surprised you didn't make a video. </connor>
<connor> - Wow, okay this why and I feel bad. </connor>
<connor> I hope this person isn't watching. </connor>
<garnt> So I interacted with them
a bit and they were like </garnt>
<garnt> obviously I knew they were
gonna be strange right. </garnt>
<connor> Because you sent an email like that. </connor>
<connor> And I started interacting
with them more and more. </connor>
<connor> And then they started sending
me way too much information </connor>
<garnt> about themselves. </garnt>
<garnt> There's also another guy </garnt>
<garnt> who sent me his birth
certificate by the way. </garnt>
<garnt> That's all (mumbles) </garnt>
<garnt> - Don't do that. </garnt>
<garnt> Don't do that.
- That's dangerous. </garnt>
<garnt> - I didn't ask for his opening email, </garnt>
<garnt> was his my birth certificate,
driving license, address. </garnt>
<garnt> And I was like, what? </garnt>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> I also mentioned this. </connor>
<connor> I don't know which video I said, </connor>
<garnt> I mentioned all this, but yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> So I replied to this
person, I kept replying </garnt>
<garnt> with them 'cause they kept
replying with really funny stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> And I was like, Oh my God, </garnt>
<garnt> I can get an amazing video out of this. </garnt>
<garnt> And then, with the one thing they said </garnt>
<garnt> which made me think, okay </garnt>
<garnt> now I just have to like completely
scrapple this is the day </garnt>
<garnt> and they said like, "oh
here are my hobbies, </garnt>
<connor> hobbies, blah, blah, blah </connor>
<connor> by the way, I'm in the Special
Olympics Team for the USA." </connor>
<connor> And I was like, "oh my God, what? </connor>
<garnt> No, no, no, no, like why you
shouldn't be sending this? </garnt>
<connor> And then I explained to
them, you know, I was like </connor>
<joey> hey, maybe you shouldn't
send this email to me. </joey>
<garnt> And you know, I don't think
this is appropriate way. </garnt>
<joey> And I'm very sorry for like messing </joey>
<joey> with your time and stuff. </joey>
<garnt> And I just, it was a whole
thing where I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> oh my God, I'm in a asshole. </garnt>
<garnt> And Jesus Christ like. </garnt>
<connor> But yeah there's so
many emails I've gotten </connor>
<garnt> I mean, I made a whole video where, I went </garnt>
<garnt> on a date with someone in it was a date. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah.
- From an email. </joey>
<connor> - That was scary watching that video. </connor>
<connor> - You were like Connor's gotta get cancer. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - This kid's gonna get stabbed. </connor>
<garnt> - I remember you pitching
that video idea to me </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> Conner I don't know if
that's the best idea, </garnt>
<connor> but I mean it turned out a good video. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah I pitched it like 10 of our friends </connor>
<garnt> and everyone's like, "wow, wow, wow </garnt>
<connor> Conner, Conner no, don't
do that, don't do that." </connor>
<joey> - Whenever I ask my friend
was like genuinely worried </joey>
<connor> for you is like, I really don't think. </connor>
<connor> I think Connor's going to die. </connor>
<joey> - I think if you watch the video, </joey>
<joey> they felt more concerned for the girl </joey>
<connor> because we turned up with light, </connor>
<garnt> me, Evan Budan and another guy. </garnt>
<garnt> I just won't go. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah I just said one go alone right. </garnt>
<garnt> So, like you know, but it
also awesome in the end, </garnt>
<garnt> it was all awesome. </garnt>
<garnt> - She really nice about the video. </garnt>
<garnt> She actually liked the video. </garnt>
<connor> So that was good. </connor>
<connor> - She just walked into a casting couch. </connor>
<connor> I guess like I don't get so about that. </connor>
<garnt> Exactly, I can't talk </garnt>
<garnt> I actually don't get
that many weird emails </garnt>
<garnt> or weird fan mails. </garnt>
<connor> I don't know, I guess, it's
'cause I mostly talk about anime </connor>
<connor> and it's less about my
own personality, I guess. </connor>
<connor> I don't know, I guess like
one weird email I got recently </connor>
<connor> which wasn't even an emailed to me, right. </connor>
<connor> So someone used my email
and pretended to be me </connor>
<connor> and emailed STUDIO WIT. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> Okay, I got the email here actually. </connor>
<connor> They emailed STUDIO WIT
pretending to be me. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause they use my email
and I got a notification </connor>
<connor> from the official studio
with like, you know, </connor>
<garnt> like the automatic notification that says, </garnt>
<connor> "hey you've submitted this email to us." </connor>
<connor> Okay so the email reads. </connor>
<garnt> "Hello, I am anime reviewer Gigguk, </garnt>
<garnt> (Conner laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> I will make a request of you. </garnt>
<garnt> Many people once Eren and
Mikasa to have a relationship. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> Eren X Mikasa. </garnt>
<connor> I think if this happens, </connor>
<garnt> many people will enjoy the anime more." </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - And this has to be a troll. </connor>
<connor> - "I would be pleased with
the development of events </connor>
<garnt> in this direction that it was. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> I hope you will evaluates my proposal. </garnt>
<connor> I wish you good day."
- Man. </connor>
<connor> - "I wish you good day." </connor>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - This sounds like the
email I sent contactly </connor>
<joey> for more so we can
figure out the logistics. </joey>
<joey> - We can figure the
logistics of Eren X Mikasa. </joey>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my God! </garnt>
<joey> - You know, let's just
completely bypass this SAR </joey>
<connor> might just go straight to I, feel like. </connor>
<connor> - They have that the final say. </connor>
<joey> - We're doing this. </joey>
<garnt> - I like how they just emailed STUDIO WIT </garnt>
<garnt> who has no creative control </garnt>
<garnt> over how Attack on Titan
is gonna end anyway. </garnt>
<joey> - I really want, I really wish that </joey>
<joey> like STUDIO WIT took that email seriously </joey>
<joey> and like actually hooked up. </joey>
<joey> Like you say, "I'm a being late." </joey>
<joey> So this popular animated review was </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - You know Gigguk of right? </connor>
<joey> - "You know Gigg of right, Gigg UK?" </joey>
<joey> If she wants Eren and Mikasa together?. </joey>
<garnt> Do you think that's possible? </garnt>
<garnt> - Can you make this a thing? </garnt>
<joey> - Can you please make this a thing. </joey>
<joey> - Hey, season four, Attack on Titan. </joey>
<garnt> I'm ready, I'm ready. </garnt>
<joey> - Hey, you never know like
none of us have caught up </joey>
<garnt> on the manga, right?
- Yeah </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no, it might, it might happen. </garnt>
<connor> - I feel like, it's a crime to. </connor>
<connor> - And if it does happen, we
can thank a certain email. </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - Eren X Mikasa is a thing I know. </garnt>
<joey> I know, who calls this. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - Jesus Christ. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think, I mean </garnt>
<garnt> To break out this. </garnt>
<joey> This is been a long time coming. </joey>
<garnt> Welcome to Trash Taste Podcast. </garnt>
<joey> - If you want to know
drinking is going to be </joey>
<garnt> of quite frequent occurrence on this show. </garnt>
<garnt> So get used to it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, so that was </garnt>
<garnt> I didn't imagine our intro
is gonna be that long though. </garnt>
<connor> In my head I was like. </connor>
<connor> (cheering) </connor>
<connor> - Finally. </connor>
<connor> I think , would you guys all say </connor>
<joey> that an Attack on Titan season four </joey>
<joey> as your most anticipated. </joey>
<joey> - Absolutely.
- Absolutely. </joey>
<connor> So how do you even match
that hype of this point? </connor>
<garnt> - Wait it's takes? </garnt>
<garnt> - It's it was meant to
be airing this fall. </garnt>
<joey> I think </joey>
<joey> - No this Summer I believe </joey>
<joey> - No it was definitely, it was fall. </joey>
<joey> - Really?
- Yeah </joey>
<connor> - You've (mumbles) </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> - So I should have gone up
against the guy emails to deal </joey>
<joey> with. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Personal contact that way. </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - But yeah, I think it's, I'm pretty sure </garnt>
<garnt> it's Eren it was scheduled to a next fall. </garnt>
<garnt> And I've heard from,
because I made a video </garnt>
<garnt> about the first three seasons of (mumbles) </garnt>
<garnt> and I've heard from pretty much everyone </garnt>
<garnt> who's read the manga
that season four is going </garnt>
<garnt> to be the best season. </garnt>
<joey> - No, I have also heard. </joey>
<connor> - I mean even if it was just mediocre, </connor>
<connor> I feel like it would still
like, just think it's amazing. </connor>
<garnt> 'Cause I did journey to
get there has been sure </garnt>
<garnt> and this last part was, oh my God. </garnt>
<connor> - Every (mumbles) was as hey </connor>
<connor> - My God. </connor>
<garnt> Like, it's so rare that
you get to see a series </garnt>
<garnt> just improve over time every season. </garnt>
<garnt> Because I remember </garnt>
<garnt> when Attack on Titan season
one was airing right? </garnt>
<garnt> And I was, it was great. </garnt>
<garnt> It was great. </garnt>
<garnt> But I felt like it was very forgettable </garnt>
<garnt> in the sense of, </garnt>
<garnt> well, I remember when season two ads, </garnt>
<garnt> I didn't remember anything
that happened in season one. </garnt>
<connor> - You don't I remember
specifically in your video </connor>
<connor> of the like seasonal review, you said, </connor>
<connor> remember the Attack on Titan </connor>
<connor> and then you just play cricket noises. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> And I remember being like well, </connor>
<connor> I'm watching Attack on Titan season two. </connor>
<joey> It's good and I think. </joey>
<joey> - No I do agree like season two, </joey>
<connor> because season one when I watched it, </connor>
<connor> I was like, okay this. </connor>
<connor> (mumbling) </connor>
<connor> And then season two came around </connor>
<connor> and actually dropped it. </connor>
<connor> - No one cared drinks. </connor>
<connor> - Because I think what it was, was that </connor>
<garnt> because season one was, you
know, all about like the action </garnt>
<garnt> and just like building the world </garnt>
<garnt> and then season two was a lot of politics </garnt>
<garnt> and a lot of talking. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yes season two just took the pace </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause season one was like
a fucking roller coaster. </garnt>
<garnt> You were going up and
down every few episodes. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, you didn't know
what was gonna happen. </garnt>
<garnt> But to me it felt a bit empty </garnt>
<garnt> and season two felt much slower paced. </garnt>
<garnt> There was more of like a slow burn </garnt>
<garnt> when they focus more on the characters. </garnt>
<garnt> But I actually got really
drawn into the world </garnt>
<garnt> way more into season two. </garnt>
<garnt> But by the time season two ended, </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, okay I'm now way more invested </garnt>
<connor> but nothing really big has happened. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause it was 12 episodes. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah it was just 12 episodes. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think everyone was like, </garnt>
<connor> what the fuck we've waited four years </connor>
<connor> or something for 12 episodes. </connor>
<connor> - Because they rushed it out. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> But you expected it. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, definitely I think in season three </garnt>
<garnt> when that scene with Levi came out, </garnt>
<connor> as I think when it just exploded </connor>
<connor> because everyone saw that GIF on Twitter, </connor>
<garnt> it was like I got a fucking catch up </garnt>
<garnt> like saying like just
thinking about that scene, </garnt>
<connor> like gives me goosebumps. </connor>
<connor> It's so good. </connor>
<connor> - It's so good </connor>
<connor> - Because I remember season three, </connor>
<connor> part one I enjoyed so fucking much. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I didn't realize I could care </connor>
<connor> about the politics that
much in the Attack on Titan </connor>
<connor> 'cause I remember by the
time season three started, </connor>
<connor> I was enjoying Attack on Titan </connor>
<connor> for completely different
reasons than season one. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<garnt> I can say the same thing
about every season. </garnt>
<garnt> So I've heard season four is going </garnt>
<garnt> to be completely different, </garnt>
<garnt> completely different to
what's previously been. </garnt>
<joey> - 'Cause I mean like, I
don't remember when it was, </joey>
<garnt> but me and Aki went to the
Attack on Titan exhibit </garnt>
<garnt> that they did in Roppongi. </garnt>
<garnt> And basically it was really tough </garnt>
<garnt> because what they did was essentially, </garnt>
<garnt> they really catered to the Manga Reader, </garnt>
<garnt> unfortunately and I am
not the Manga Reader. </garnt>
<garnt> So in like the late of
rooms of this exhibit, </garnt>
<garnt> they basically like on all the walls, </garnt>
<garnt> they would have like the
original Ganga of the Manga right </garnt>
<connor> in these frames, which is fucking cool. </connor>
<connor> But then as he got
further down the exhibit, </connor>
<garnt> they would start showing stuff </garnt>
<garnt> that hadn't been adapted yet. </garnt>
<garnt> So I was like, all right </garnt>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> Cover my eyes. </connor>
<connor> But obviously there was just some stuff </connor>
<connor> that I couldn't really avoid seeing. </connor>
<connor> And the tiny little bit that
I did say out of context, </connor>
<connor> I was like, </connor>
<connor> - What the fuck? </connor>
<garnt> - Wow, there is no fucking
way that's happening. </garnt>
<garnt> And then to top it off,
there was this room. </garnt>
<garnt> This was like a really
experimental move on them, </garnt>
<garnt> their part but there was this room </garnt>
<garnt> that you had to go into </garnt>
<garnt> and it was completely pitch-black room. </garnt>
<garnt> And there's just audio
playing on the speakers </garnt>
<garnt> in this pitch-black room. </garnt>
<garnt> And what that audio is, </garnt>
<connor> it's audio of what he say I'm
envisions the final chapter </connor>
<connor> of the Attack on Titan time to be. </connor>
<connor> - That's so this you should handled. </connor>
<connor> - There's no visuals, there's no visuals. </connor>
<connor> It's just audio. </connor>
<garnt> And it's what he envisions. </garnt>
<connor> It will sound like adapted. </connor>
<garnt> The only thing we've heard was a lot of </garnt>
<garnt> like background noises
and like ambient noises </garnt>
<joey> and Mikasa yelling Eren
from a long way away. </joey>
<garnt> - Okay, that could mean anything (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - Was could mean anything, I mean like, </garnt>
<joey> I'm obviously not doing the audio justice, </joey>
<joey> but sound it epic. </joey>
<connor> - Can we get a one-to-one
reenact (mumbles) </connor>
<connor> - It was just like </connor>
<garnt> (cheering) </garnt>
<garnt> That's all the well. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt meows) </garnt>
<connor> - Just were screaming in there. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, but I mean, </garnt>
<joey> I'm obviously not doing the audit just as </joey>
<joey> but it sounded like when
I just like close my eyes </joey>
<joey> and heard that I was like, </joey>
<joey> wow I've never been more
excited for anime in my life. </joey>
<garnt> - It's good to know that the anime </garnt>
<garnt> and the Manga will end
with Mikasa screaming Eren </garnt>
<connor> and she has that. </connor>
<connor> - Technically a spoiler. </connor>
<garnt> - She has done for the
entire fucking series. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - I mean with the track
record the Attack on Titan </connor>
<connor> has right now. </connor>
<connor> I mean it's, every episode you could argue </connor>
<connor> has been really good, right? </connor>
<connor> I mean this story has just been, </connor>
<connor> there's no faults in
the story so far, right. </connor>
<garnt> It holding up pretty well. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I say it had been
building on his story. </garnt>
<connor> - Right really well </connor>
<garnt> - Really, really well. </garnt>
<connor> - Like what if this, if
they nail this ending, </connor>
<garnt> what like category is this end-of-life? </garnt>
<garnt> - Master piece. </garnt>
<garnt> - What would you put it
as like in like anime </garnt>
<garnt> in the same category then if
it killed this last season? </garnt>
<garnt> - My fucking God! </garnt>
<garnt> - Like 'cause couldn't
even be in its own thing </garnt>
<connor> where like no anime is like as good? </connor>
<joey> - I would say
- It's hot. </joey>
<garnt> - That's not to say, that's
a big statement right there. </garnt>
<garnt> - But I mean, I'm just
trying to think how many, </garnt>
<connor> how many anime series have there been </connor>
<connor> where it's stretched out for, </connor>
<connor> I mean
- Over 50 episodes </connor>
<connor> - Over 50 episodes, like
let's say four or five seasons </connor>
<joey> and has like killed at this hard. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah I would say it
be similar to something </garnt>
<connor> like Fullmetal Alchemist, Hunter Hunter. </connor>
<connor> Although I'd say it's, I haven't
seen Fullmetal Alchemist. </connor>
<garnt> I get that's. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey screaming) </garnt>
<garnt> My fan base, my fan base knows this. </garnt>
<garnt> This is a big fucking Meme </garnt>
<garnt> but Fullmetal Alchemist is that one anime </garnt>
<connor> that I haven't seen. </connor>
<connor> We all have that one anime. </connor>
<connor> - I guess when I think about you know, </connor>
<connor> Hunter Hunter for it's, </connor>
<connor> I mean, it hasn't ended though, </connor>
<connor> which is probably the one </connor>
<joey> where you couldn't argue
it's in the same class </joey>
<connor> but I guess from a Locus
Brotherhood, maybe you could. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, because you never
know like Hunter Hunter </joey>
<garnt> might, I'm hoping God, but you never know </garnt>
<garnt> but Hunter Hunter, might
end up like Yu Yu Hakusho. </garnt>
<joey> - I think that's the problem </joey>
<connor> that I think everyone's kind of beginning </connor>
<connor> to accept that slowly </connor>
<connor> because the world is just especially now </connor>
<garnt> with the dark continent stuff, </garnt>
<garnt> which, you know it's a lot
of stuff in Hunter Hunter </garnt>
<garnt> but it's looking like it's
even more ambitious than before </garnt>
<connor> and he's not releasing
chapters at a very slow, right. </connor>
<garnt> - It's gonna take a whole
lifetime to catch up </garnt>
<garnt> but going back to Attack on Titan, </garnt>
<garnt> I think I called it like, </garnt>
<connor> if it's even if it was of the quality </connor>
<connor> of season three part two
ended in that quality, </connor>
<connor> it would be a modern classic. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, for sure? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, if it's even better than that, </connor>
<connor> I have no fucking clue </connor>
<connor> but that makes me so excited. </connor>
<connor> - So we might be getting the... </connor>
<garnt> - The fact that there's
a possibility of that. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah.
- It's just nuts. </connor>
<joey> - I think the last time I
was possibly that excited </joey>
<joey> for like a followup was
One-Punch Man season two. </joey>
<joey> - We all know how that. </joey>
<joey> - I'm like it wasn't okay I
rewatched a few clips recently </joey>
<garnt> of One-Punch Man season two. </garnt>
<garnt> I know like it wasn't that bad. </garnt>
<garnt> I think it's just, </garnt>
<connor> we set our expectations
disgusting we have. </connor>
<garnt> - It wasn't bad. </garnt>
<garnt> It was painfully mediocre. </garnt>
<connor> - It's like Seven Deadly Sins season one. </connor>
<connor> And then it like. </connor>
<connor> So what I'm hoping, what I'm hoping is </connor>
<connor> the next season, assuming
we get another one </connor>
<connor> of One-Punch Man is it
doesn't go to sleep. </connor>
<connor> (laughing loudly) </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God. </connor>
<garnt> That shit is still
like, I haven't seen any </garnt>
<garnt> of Seven Deadly Sins. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know anything about it. </garnt>
<garnt> Never had the manga and
never watched the anime, </garnt>
<garnt> but not gonna lie, </garnt>
<garnt> there's a part of me when I
saw footage of season three. </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, I kind of wanna watch this now </garnt>
<joey> Just to see it devolve
into this current state. </joey>
<garnt> - Like I remember because the
fight that they fucked up, </garnt>
<connor> was one of the most collective sites. </connor>
<connor> - In the manga, right the survival. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah he was one of the most hyped fights </connor>
<connor> And then they fought it up
so much that fan animation </connor>
<garnt> of that fight that was released before, </garnt>
<garnt> looked better than the official fights. </garnt>
<joey> - Because when I found out about </joey>
<joey> that scene is someone put it up on Twitter </joey>
<joey> and had to preface it by saying, </joey>
<joey> no this is not a fun animation. </joey>
<connor> This is the official episode. </connor>
<connor> Because everybody in that tweet was like, </connor>
<connor> is this fun made? </connor>
<connor> This has to be fun made </connor>
<connor> This is like some guy
who like just learn how </connor>
<joey> to use flash like a week ago. </joey>
<garnt> - Just, you know what
sticks out in my mind </garnt>
<connor> that kick, the kick. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> When that give first came
out and I saw the kick </connor>
<garnt> which you probably see
him on screen right now. </garnt>
<garnt> I lost it. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh my God, I laughed so hard. </joey>
<connor> - I don't think I'd ever,
like, I've watched all </connor>
<connor> of Seven Deadly Sins up until that point. </connor>
<garnt> And like, I wasn't like a huge fun, </garnt>
<garnt> but we bought every time
a new season was announced </garnt>
<garnt> to be of UVA's I'd watched them. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'd never so quickly
lost interest in a series </garnt>
<connor> just from seeing that one screenshot. </connor>
<connor> Melitis like getting the bed. </connor>
<connor> I was like, what did they do to him? </connor>
<connor> What did they do to him? </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> We've never seen anything like
is that happen anime before </connor>
<connor> like where a season is like </connor>
<connor> so drastically like
changed studios and lost. </connor>
<joey> - I'm sure like if you take. </joey>
<garnt> - I know there have been, </garnt>
<garnt> and I know I'm going to kill myself </garnt>
<garnt> for not remembering like what this is </garnt>
<garnt> but there's been so many times that's. </garnt>
<garnt> - That drastic though.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - It has been a few months </connor>
<connor> - May be because the difference
was is when it happened back </connor>
<connor> then is that there wasn't Twitter. </connor>
<joey> And when it happens now or
you know, when it happens now. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah exactly, </joey>
<connor> there was just like a
bunch of light we'll talk, </connor>
<joey> gathering, being linked, (mumbles) </joey>
<garnt> - Like the only thing I
can think of right now, </garnt>
<garnt> is like off the top of my head is Bizarre. </garnt>
<garnt> Which I mean, it's changed studio </garnt>
<garnt> but it was technically a continuation. </garnt>
<connor> - Okay, what's worse than Bizarre </connor>
<joey> The second adaptation of Bizarre </joey>
<joey> or the Seven Deadly Sins the new seasons. </joey>
<joey> - Bizarre.
- Really. </joey>
<connor> - It might say Bizarre, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Okay. </connor>
<connor> - Because I mean, like, you know, </connor>
<connor> I'm seeing that from like
a hardcore Bizarre fan. </connor>
<connor> - I haven't heard the Mangas so. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah so if he goes,
if you've read the manga </garnt>
<connor> and I'm sure everybody </connor>
<garnt> who's read the Manga can agree with this </garnt>
<connor> but I have never wanted
to like cry from sadness. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> I'm like, how could they
do my boy guards like that? </connor>
<garnt> And I'm like, yeah, this is. </garnt>
<garnt> Because the Bizarre
adaptation was just a failure </garnt>
<connor> on pretty much
- Every level </connor>
<connor> - Every level from like the animation </connor>
<connor> which everyone likes to point out. </connor>
<garnt> But like the composition,
the sound design. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, if you've heard, </garnt>
<garnt> if you heard that like </garnt>
<connor> (body parts breaking) </connor>
<connor> Like sound, it's just,
what how did you get this? </connor>
<garnt> Who did you hire to do the sound artists? </garnt>
<joey> - Fucking came up with that sound </joey>
<garnt> - Like, how did you see
this big fucking iron sword? </garnt>
<connor> And just like, </connor>
<connor> - Let's pull it out the Cal Bell. </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - Just do Jojo </connor>
<garnt> Make everything a gunshot. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean gun would been
even better honestly. </joey>
<joey> - Can I talk about Jojo sound design? </joey>
<connor> I love Jojo sound design so much </connor>
<connor> because sound design is something </connor>
<connor> that people don't normally talk about. </connor>
<connor> And you don't, you don't really, </connor>
<garnt> you don't really hear people </garnt>
<connor> - It's like voice (mumbles) right. </connor>
<garnt> When it's done well, you don't notice. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, so with Jojo sound design, </garnt>
<garnt> it's one of the few shows where </garnt>
<connor> if you hear like a sound, </connor>
<connor> - You know is from Jojo. </connor>
<connor> - You know the exact stance </connor>
<connor> and you know, like sometimes
it's the exact episode </connor>
<connor> and the exact fights </connor>
<connor> because they're that recognized when </connor>
<connor> that they're like not generic at all. </connor>
<connor> And I fucking love Jojo sound design </connor>
<connor> because the reason why I
think the anime is as good </connor>
<connor> as it is, one of the reasons is </connor>
<connor> that the sound design is so good. </connor>
<connor> Like, have you guys seen the </connor>
<connor> I assume you guys have seen the Jojo OPs </connor>
<connor> where they add the sound effects. </connor>
<garnt> - And it's so much better, isn't it? </garnt>
<garnt> - So cool. </garnt>
<connor> I don't know why they didn't do that </connor>
<connor> for the Eren versions. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, it's not really
what you see in an OPs. </garnt>
<joey> - It is pretty unconventional </joey>
<joey> - But I mean, there's so many sounds </joey>
<joey> that you could say, like </joey>
<connor> I call it, like, when
you hear that gunshot </connor>
<connor> for the punch, you know
what the Jojo punch. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> And it makes it sound so meaty. </connor>
<joey> It's great. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, I love that
- That's the punching sound </joey>
<garnt> is like every time, you know like there's </garnt>
<connor> like a mood or like or
an oral or on like, the, </connor>
<connor> it is almost like gun like, isn't it </connor>
<connor> - I'm pretty sure it's like gunshot here. </connor>
<joey> It's a gunshot. </joey>
<joey> And then obviously
there's a Waldo timestamp. </joey>
<connor> (light strikes) </connor>
<connor> Which I feel like has almost
become the universal sound </connor>
<connor> of stopping time. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> And then there's also the you know, I mean </garnt>
<garnt> if you talk about music alone, my God, </garnt>
<garnt> of the new season absolutely killed it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my God, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like, I think super, </garnt>
<garnt> a part of Giorno said this
in his review of Golden Wind </garnt>
<garnt> and I feel the same way. </garnt>
<garnt> Like this is Golden Wind
was the first adaptation </garnt>
<connor> of a Jojo where I think
the anime is better </connor>
<connor> because you lose so much </connor>
<connor> when you take away that sound right </connor>
<garnt> and especially the music. </garnt>
<connor> When you hear that Giorno's Theme come on. </connor>
<garnt> - Giorno's Theme is one of the few tracks </garnt>
<joey> in anime that has been means to death. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah it is Al megalomania. </joey>
<garnt> - And I have not gotten bored of it all </garnt>
<joey> - Every like every version of heard </joey>
<garnt> of Giorno's Theme have the equally, </garnt>
<garnt> just be like yes. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> It's so like a piano
version, middle version, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't care. </garnt>
<garnt> It's always been so good. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah go on so on. </joey>
<garnt> - When we can go back to the gym, </garnt>
<garnt> some of the best music to put </garnt>
<garnt> when you're working out is Jojo's. </garnt>
<garnt> It works so well. </garnt>
<garnt> And I know it should work well, </garnt>
<garnt> but man when that piano hits, </garnt>
<garnt> you're doing an extra rep, </garnt>
<garnt> no matter how tired you are, </garnt>
<garnt> you're doing that extra rep. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah it's so good. </joey>
<connor> - It's almost too hype sometimes </connor>
<joey> you are like a shit I got
to keep doing this rapper. </joey>
<garnt> I'm dying right now. </garnt>
<connor> I don't know where my boy, Jojo down. </connor>
<joey> - Speaking of anime adaptations though, </joey>
<garnt> there is one topic I would like to cover </garnt>
<garnt> because it is quite timely. </garnt>
<garnt> But just yesterday I
actually recording over </garnt>
<garnt> as of us recording this episode, </garnt>
<joey> I found or I I guess AKI found </joey>
<joey> that somebody is adapting,
Killing Stalking. </joey>
<joey> - You mean it's not an official </joey>
<connor> - This needs the biggest
quote marks ever adapting </connor>
<joey> - "Adapting" Killing Stalking "Anime." </joey>
<garnt> - You there is no an
official animate adaptation </garnt>
<connor> like everyone on Twitter thinks it is. </connor>
<joey> - Okay. </joey>
<connor> - It was like pop most
the original Twitter post </connor>
<connor> that blew this up </connor>
<connor> said an official adaptation. </connor>
<connor> And then in the reply to that tweet, </connor>
<garnt> they doubled down saying it. </garnt>
<garnt> "Yeah, it was all official." </garnt>
<garnt> But the thing that caught
my eye is the picture </garnt>
<garnt> that everyone was re-tweeting right. </garnt>
<garnt> Three pictures of this tweet. </garnt>
<garnt> One of them, it was like chAosOPUS STUDIO. </garnt>
<connor> The fuck it's a chAosOPUS STUDIO </connor>
<joey> - Yeah so like, 'cause AKI
found that on a timeline </joey>
<joey> and was like Holy shit they're making us </joey>
<connor> Killing Stalking anime adaptation. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, really let me see. </connor>
<connor> And I saw the pictures
on like the first two </connor>
<connor> and it was like coming soon, 2020. </connor>
<connor> I was like, oh shit okay. </connor>
<joey> And then I looked at the last one </joey>
<joey> and it was like chAosOPUS STUDIO? </joey>
<connor> I'm like,
- Yeah, yeah right. </connor>
<connor> - Who? (laughing) </connor>
<connor> What is the Studio? </connor>
<connor> I legitimately had to look
it up on Wikipedia being like </connor>
<connor> maybe it's just one of them. </connor>
<garnt> 'Cause you know, recently there've been </garnt>
<garnt> so many fucking Japanese
anime studio guys come out </garnt>
<garnt> with like ridiculous names. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, probably it's just one of those. </garnt>
<garnt> - Exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - I looked it up and I'm like, </garnt>
<joey> Nope, it's literally just one dude. </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> It's a one dude. </joey>
<connor> - I feel bad for whoever's making this </connor>
<connor> 'cause like my God they wanna hype, </connor>
<connor> they just got thrusted on them. </connor>
<connor> And everyone's assuming
this is like legit. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, how did the hype just happen? </garnt>
<joey> Did they just </joey>
<joey> - There is literally just the tweet. </joey>
<garnt> - Just the tweet. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, the original Twitter I think </garnt>
<garnt> has all of us recording, </garnt>
<garnt> I think it has like 40,000
likes and like 20,000 retweets </garnt>
<garnt> or something that.
- Wow. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because Killing Stalking
fans are flawless. </garnt>
<joey> They are ruthlessly dedicated. </joey>
<connor> - And then I saw, the thing
was this one in the lower </connor>
<connor> in the replies to that
people weren't questioning </connor>
<connor> whether like it was legit. </connor>
<joey> People were just questioning. </joey>
<joey> Should it get an adaptation? </joey>
<connor> And that was the main argument. </connor>
<joey> I think that's why it was
getting so many reasons. </joey>
<connor> - Should you guys think he
should get an adaptation? </connor>
<connor> I mean, let me change the question. </connor>
<joey> Have you guys read it? </joey>
<connor> - I've read the first like story. </connor>
<joey> What is it like it came out
and like stories, right? </joey>
<joey> - It's like seasons. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah I watched, I read the first season </connor>
<connor> and I quite liked it
and you know, it's a lot </connor>
<connor> but I feel like from
what I've heard as well </connor>
<connor> that handles it quite
well towards the end. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah I did a video on it. </joey>
<garnt> I actually looked back
on when I did my video </garnt>
<garnt> of it was four years ago. </garnt>
<garnt> - Holy shit. </garnt>
<joey> Was it that long ago?
- Yeah </joey>
<joey> - I remember you released
that like yesterday </joey>
<garnt> - I thought was like maybe
like a year or two ago </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah
- Was four years ago. </garnt>
<garnt> And that's because I only
reviewed the first season </garnt>
<connor> because I think the series ended </connor>
<connor> like I think it was like last year. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah </connor>
<connor> - But it was like a huge gap right. </connor>
<connor> So I've only really seen or read </connor>
<connor> like the first half of it. </connor>
<connor> And it was, you know,
it was marketed as like, </connor>
<connor> it's a really hard call,
like gruesome yellowish. </connor>
<connor> So you know, all these
fan girls getting on it. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, okay, </connor>
<connor> I mean, I don't know if
I'm gonna enjoy it as much </connor>
<garnt> because I'm not exactly
the target demographic </garnt>
<garnt> but I'll give it a go. </garnt>
<garnt> And it was like a genuinely good story. </garnt>
<garnt> Like yeah it had yellow elements in it, </garnt>
<garnt> but you know, I'm an
adult, I can handle that. </garnt>
<connor> So other than, if you take
away the yellow elements, </connor>
<connor> it's just a really, really
good horror mystery. </connor>
<connor> But when I sold that they
were gonna make a quote </connor>
<connor> "anime adaptation for it." </connor>
<garnt> I was like, I don't know </garnt>
<garnt> because immediately what I
thought of is all of these </garnt>
<garnt> other like over-sexualized series getting </garnt>
<garnt> anime adaptations recently </garnt>
<garnt> - Cause as someone who hasn't read, </garnt>
<garnt> it seems like it's a very sexual story </garnt>
<connor> that would have to be heavily sensitive. </connor>
<garnt> - It is hardcore </garnt>
<connor> - Is one of, I think it
will say it has such a </connor>
<connor> like it's divided a lot of community. </connor>
<garnt> 'Cause I think a lot of
people really sexualize it </garnt>
<garnt> when it's just a really fucked up dynamic </garnt>
<garnt> and a lot of, I mean a
lot of really deep shit of </garnt>
<garnt> like possessiveness and all that. </garnt>
<joey> But if you've thinking about reading it, </joey>
<joey> it's a lot like it's </joey>
<joey> - Going into with caution definitely. </joey>
<connor> - Definitely be over the age of 18. </connor>
<joey> - We have to legally say that. </joey>
<connor> (laughing loudly) </connor>
<connor> - I think you should read it </connor>
<connor> but then also like I can
totally recommend you not </connor>
<connor> to read it like it's your
life would be totally fine </connor>
<connor> if you don't read it. </connor>
<garnt> - May be I'll watch the anime instead </garnt>
<garnt> in my opinion they're. </garnt>
<garnt> - Talking about the anime, </garnt>
<connor> like I said, I feel bad for this person. </connor>
<garnt> 'Cause a lot of people are
putting a lot of hype on it. </garnt>
<connor> But also what I saw, it's a one man job </connor>
<garnt> like this guy's doing everything. </garnt>
<garnt> And I don't know if it's a guy or a girl </garnt>
<garnt> but they seem to be in charge of, </garnt>
<garnt> they seem to be 3D modelers. </garnt>
<garnt> I think that's what that trade is. </garnt>
<garnt> And I saw the voice acting Casting Call </garnt>
<garnt> and as someone who's, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> done a lot of voice acting Casting Calls, </garnt>
<garnt> I've made my own, I've worked with a lot </garnt>
<garnt> of professional ones
like it is not normal. </garnt>
<garnt> I had to say, </garnt>
<connor> I don't wanna be mean to them </connor>
<connor> 'cause I don't think that
like that experience. </connor>
<connor> And I think other voice actors
are helping them with it. </connor>
<connor> But first of all, normally you don't name </connor>
<connor> who's gotten what role publicly. </connor>
<garnt> Right so on the Casting Call Document </garnt>
<garnt> which I think we've maybe
show on screen for a second. </garnt>
<garnt> It says like one person who has the role </garnt>
<garnt> and it's showing publicly, </garnt>
<garnt> that's not normally the case. </garnt>
<garnt> Normally it's just here with the lines, </garnt>
<garnt> auditioned for it. </garnt>
<garnt> And the way it's laid out is really old. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's just over, I mean, over Twitter, </garnt>
<connor> isn't that weird </connor>
<connor> but there's no mention of pay or anything. </connor>
<connor> Like I guess, I mean,
it is a fan made project </connor>
<connor> but normally, still you
say if it's paid or not. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - You normally say how, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> how many lines they're gonna be. </garnt>
<garnt> It just, I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> It looks like it belongs
on like Casting Call Club </garnt>
<garnt> which is an amateur voice hunting website. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Which makes me uneasy because </garnt>
<garnt> if it is gonna be a USB
microphone kind of deal, </garnt>
<connor> it's not can sound good </connor>
<connor> 'cause there was no, </connor>
<connor> here's the minimum the requirements </connor>
<connor> for you to sanitary
room, there was nothing. </connor>
<connor> It was just, if you wanna audition. </connor>
<connor> And I saw the replies to this thread </connor>
<connor> and it was like all </connor>
<connor> 13-year old sounding girls auditioning. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> - Yeah but that's because
the main like readership all </joey>
<garnt> of Killing Stalking our 13 year old girls, </garnt>
<garnt> even though it shouldn't be </garnt>
<connor> from purely based on context, </connor>
<joey> it should not be. </joey>
<connor> - It's just worrying with
these kinds of things as well </connor>
<connor> 'cause normally like when
I've done plus 18 projects, </connor>
<connor> I normally ask for proof of ID </connor>
<connor> when they if I cast someone </connor>
<connor> like they need to show me their ID </connor>
<connor> and this should definitely
be one of those situations </connor>
<connor> where I like those
precautions should be taken </connor>
<connor> even if it's fan made right. </connor>
<connor> Like, yeah, not good look for you </connor>
<connor> if you're getting 13-old girls to voice </connor>
<connor> in your thing about like, </connor>
<connor> you know some pretty fun shit. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean it's still very early days, </garnt>
<connor> I mean from what it sounds like, </connor>
<connor> it's sounds like a situation where someone </connor>
<connor> just </connor>
<connor> - way too much press. </connor>
<connor> - Got way too much press, way too quickly </connor>
<garnt> because I have no doubt </garnt>
<garnt> that they probably have
no fucking experience. </garnt>
<joey> - Because I saw it on the Twitter actually </joey>
<garnt> just this morning. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah they tweeted out
being like, oh my God </garnt>
<garnt> after someone retweeted my thing, </garnt>
<garnt> I've gained like 10,000 Twitter
followers in like overnight. </garnt>
<garnt> And like, you know, this
person obviously like came </garnt>
<connor> from like pretty much
close to zero followers. </connor>
<garnt> So for them that's a lot.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's a lot of like
pressure just immediately built </garnt>
<garnt> up on them because you're going after such </garnt>
<joey> like, I don't want to say iconic </joey>
<joey> but like a very, like very,
very dedicated series. </joey>
<garnt> - I think it's not just that as well. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause I think what
really built up the hype </garnt>
<connor> as well as we're in like
this environment now </connor>
<connor> where Webtoons animated. </connor>
<connor> - They could be. </connor>
<connor> - Are being major so you wouldn't be, </connor>
<connor> it wouldn't have been surprising </connor>
<connor> to say Killing Stalking
is getting an anime </connor>
<garnt> as opposed to like last
year even two years ago </garnt>
<garnt> where, you know we didn't
have any precedents for that </garnt>
<garnt> but now we've Tower of God airing </garnt>
<garnt> and a God of High School </garnt>
<garnt> and Noblesse all getting anime. </garnt>
<connor> It's like maybe we're in a new era </connor>
<connor> where people are expecting
that their favorite Webtoons </connor>
<connor> or their favorite webcomics </connor>
<connor> for whatever country could
get anime adaptations. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah sure, sure. </joey>
<connor> - I mean to be fired, I
wouldn't be against the idea </connor>
<joey> of actually getting an
official adaptation. </joey>
<joey> - Or Killing Stalking? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah I think it could
be definitely make waves. </joey>
<joey> - I mean it would make
sense considering that </joey>
<joey> recently there's been
like a big trend of like, </joey>
<joey> as I said earlier, like
over-sexualized series </joey>
<joey> like we've got a Shu Matson airing getting </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah my fucking God, </garnt>
<garnt> how they gonna handle it? </garnt>
<joey> - How are they gonna handle that? </joey>
<garnt> Because there is legitimately a sex scene </garnt>
<connor> every three pages. </connor>
<connor> Like I'm not even kidding. </connor>
<connor> - So I don't know anything
about this monograph. </connor>
<joey> So wait, what is it called? </joey>
<joey> - It's called Shu Matson Harold. </joey>
<garnt> - Or Wild Hentai </garnt>
<joey> - And basically the overall
plum oversimplifying this </joey>
<joey> but basically. </joey>
<joey> - It's a handclap flawed. </joey>
<joey> - Humanity has gone to shit, </joey>
<connor> where there was a disease
that is killing all males. </connor>
<connor> It's already affecting males. </connor>
<connor> So basically now </connor>
<connor> - You can tell </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - It's a hentai plot. </connor>
<connor> It's a hentai plot. </connor>
<connor> So basically males now are becoming </connor>
<connor> like a commodity they're
basically being treated </connor>
<connor> like males that have like
survived this disease. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Basically like treated
as like national defenses. </joey>
<connor> - Let me just wait, first
of all the difference </connor>
<connor> between this hentai, right? </connor>
<connor> Is that if it was a hentai,
it'd be an ugly bastard. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's like a handsome young guy. </connor>
<garnt> - It's like several handsome young guys. </garnt>
<joey> - Okay that's how it happened. </joey>
<joey> It's an ugly bastard. </joey>
<connor> It's a hentai (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> - But like the dynamic it could see, </connor>
<connor> this is where a difference from a hentai </connor>
<connor> though is that our main
character has like this girl </connor>
<connor> that he's been thinking
about his whole life. </connor>
<connor> And basically like, doesn't
wanna just go around </connor>
<connor> and like just scrap their
sex everyone in order </connor>
<connor> to save him he'd rather
keep his like purity </connor>
<connor> for the goal that he
needs to be thinking of. </connor>
<connor> - So it's about waiting
for the right person. </connor>
<garnt> - It's basically blue balls, the manga. </garnt>
<garnt> Because everyone else all five other guys </garnt>
<garnt> having a fucking great time. </garnt>
<garnt> They're fucking different
chicks every day. </garnt>
<joey> - They're pretty much, </joey>
<joey> they're pretty much like
what hentai of protagonist </joey>
<joey> should be </joey>
<connor> - I'm not being sold on this, </connor>
<connor> but saying that I wasn't sold
to Interspecies Reviewers </connor>
<garnt> until I watched it. </garnt>
<connor> This is pretty funny. </connor>
<connor> - It's not gonna be as good. </connor>
<joey> - Oh no. </joey>
<joey> - Interspecies Reviewers
is like a really weird case </joey>
<joey> because it was something
that was definitely, </joey>
<joey> definitely itchy in the manga,
in the manga in the anime. </joey>
<joey> They just made it porn. </joey>
<joey> But I still like, I still, I don't know </joey>
<joey> Interspecies Reviewers to me is that line </joey>
<garnt> between hentai and (mumbles) </garnt>
<garnt> because you don't watch
Interspecies Reviewers </garnt>
<garnt> to jack off right. </garnt>
<garnt> But it's undeniable </garnt>
<garnt> that there is just a
straight up sex scene in it. </garnt>
<connor> - Which is really interesting though </connor>
<connor> because the one sex scene
that everyone was raving </connor>
<garnt> on about in the anime, I
think it was episode four, </garnt>
<garnt> - Three
- Three </garnt>
<garnt> Episode three was never in the Manga. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, it wasn't. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was implied all sex
scenes of the series is implied </garnt>
<joey> in the Manga. </joey>
<joey> But in the anime that
was just like fucking </joey>
<joey> let's just show it, like. </joey>
<garnt> - Put things into perspective. </garnt>
<joey> You didn't even see nipple in the Manga. </joey>
<joey> That was like, </joey>
<garnt> - That's a lie. </garnt>
<garnt> - You did it. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, you didn't see nipple. </connor>
<connor> I know I own all the volumes. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - You seen this man's Twitter. </connor>
<joey> He knows a nipple when he sees. </joey>
<connor> - I all know the volumes </connor>
<joey> And I've enjoyed every single one. </joey>
<connor> - Can we talk about your Twitter in a bit? </connor>
<connor> Can we please talk legit? </connor>
<connor> Because it would make me play </connor>
<joey> - By the way follow me on
Twitter guys that the anime </joey>
<joey> with a wrong clip. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> - Can you please explain your Twitter? </connor>
<connor> - What's meanings explain my Twitter. </connor>
<joey> - First of all, whenever
I go on Twitter, right? </joey>
<connor> I don't follow Hentai artists on Twitter </connor>
<connor> because I don't need to </connor>
<connor> because this man's got me COVID </connor>
<connor> because I actually know on Twitter. </connor>
<connor> When you, like a picture,
there's a good chance </connor>
<garnt> for some reason, especially
Joey's specifically </garnt>
<garnt> it comes on my Twitter and I must get </garnt>
<garnt> at least every time I open
Twitter, six or seven, like </garnt>
<garnt> either like follow on sex
things or like very, very loose. </garnt>
<garnt> It's always Joey. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, I'm like I don't follow porn </garnt>
<connor> like Joey Bissinger and it's like </connor>
<connor> how does she get to this point? </connor>
<joey> - Okay here's what I
don't understand, right? </joey>
<joey> Like how many people do
you follow on Twitter? </joey>
<connor> Like on average </connor>
<joey> - I think I have 600 something. </joey>
<joey> - Okay 600
- Above them I mean </joey>
<garnt> - Okay, right you both
follow about over 500 people. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And like this isn't just YouTube </garnt>
<connor> like I've had this from
like mutual friends of mine. </connor>
<connor> - Everyone says, it's you. </connor>
<connor> - How is it that my likes end
up on everybody's timeline? </connor>
<joey> Like, am I only like Twitter preferred? </joey>
<garnt> - I have no fucking clue, but it is, </garnt>
<garnt> I would say 70 to 80%
of the time I see Ludes </garnt>
<joey> on my timeline, it is you. </joey>
<joey> It is trade-off </joey>
<joey> - First of all, you're welcome. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> - Okay 'cause this thing
used to be the case. </joey>
<joey> And like, I swear, you were
way more timid about it. </joey>
<garnt> How did, 'cause I'm scared of doing that. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know 'cause I
mean, I shouldn't really, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause there basically
half naked into my videos, </garnt>
<garnt> but I don't know I was getting, </garnt>
<garnt> I was just worried about
like, she just having porn </garnt>
<connor> on my thing, but now I guess
I can get away with it. </connor>
<garnt> How did you go from not sharing porn </garnt>
<connor> to basically just </connor>
<garnt> - To being the Hentai. </garnt>
<garnt> - I've always shared it, that's the thing. </garnt>
<garnt> - Have you? </garnt>
<connor> I swear you didn't. </connor>
<connor> - I mean maybe not only. </connor>
<connor> - No, no, no </connor>
<joey> - This one now you're seeking. </joey>
<garnt> - I think it was just Twitter
changing the like button </garnt>
<joey> to be basically the retweet </joey>
<joey> - That's a pretty much. </joey>
<garnt> That's exactly what it is. </garnt>
<garnt> Because for the entirety
that I've been on Twitter </garnt>
<garnt> I've liked hentai
because I followed hentai </garnt>
<connor> like people like hentai out side </connor>
<connor> like Titan I've discovered, </connor>
<garnt> but I've never retweeted it </garnt>
<garnt> because of this exact reason. </garnt>
<connor> I don't want other people's timelines </connor>
<connor> to be filled with hentai. </connor>
<connor> But Twitter was just like,
hey, let's just like, </connor>
<joey> make the like button, like
a better retweet button. </joey>
<garnt> - I gonna ask how much
of your feed is Just had? </garnt>
<garnt> - That's why I asked, I
asked to see his phone. </garnt>
<connor> - Do you wanna see it now? </connor>
<connor> It wasn't that bad when I first saw it,. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, the thing is I don't follow </joey>
<connor> that many hentai artists. </connor>
<connor> I know that's hard to believe, </connor>
<connor> but I genuinely don't, </connor>
<connor> the thing is I follow a hentai artists </connor>
<garnt> that love retweeting other hentai artists. </garnt>
<garnt> And that's where I find all the people. </garnt>
<connor> Okay, here. </connor>
<connor> - Scroll, scroll through it. </connor>
<garnt> - You want scroll down my Twitter. </garnt>
<garnt> - Let's see. </garnt>
<garnt> - Let's see how many come up? </garnt>
<garnt> - There one, one and three. </garnt>
<garnt> - Can you also like
everyone that opinions. </garnt>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - You go to his likes from when this is </connor>
<joey> - Go to my likes, go to my likes. </joey>
<connor> - Hope that's another one? </connor>
<connor> - That's two in a row. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, wait that's a Jimmy Neutron there. </joey>
<connor> That's my mentor. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Oh my phone. </connor>
<connor> Okay, let me, while they're
looking through the Twitter, </connor>
<connor> let me defend myself real quick, okay. </connor>
<joey> The reason why I like it's
because at the end of the day, </joey>
<joey> these are just drawings, right? </joey>
<joey> There's a difference between
liking like actual human porn </joey>
<joey> versus just a picture. </joey>
<garnt> - This man is about to go the hentai. </garnt>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - I am genuinely one of those people </joey>
<joey> who looks at hentai as odd. </joey>
<garnt> - I totally agree with you. </garnt>
<connor> (Conner laughs) </connor>
<joey> Shut up, fuck. </joey>
<joey> - I'm sorry. </joey>
<connor> - I'm talking on behalf </connor>
<joey> of every hentai lover
watching this episode, </joey>
<joey> including you </joey>
<connor> - I love hentai. </connor>
<connor> I just I don't know if I
look at it and be unlike, </connor>
<connor> just crack open a beer and just enjoy. </connor>
<garnt> - The boy, no, no, no. </garnt>
<garnt> I've gotten to that point, right? </garnt>
<connor> I've gotten to the point
of you seeing fucking room, </connor>
<connor> you see my fucking office, </connor>
<connor> which is just like full
of like anime thighs </connor>
<connor> and stuff like that. </connor>
<connor> Because it's gotten to the point </connor>
<connor> where sometimes you just see this </connor>
<joey> like drawing of a girl
or a thigh or something. </joey>
<joey> And I just don't even get horny anymore. </joey>
<joey> I'm just like, I'm fucking impressed </joey>
<joey> at how good they make. </joey>
<connor> - That was me when I saw them (mumbles) </connor>
<connor> in Seven Deadly Sins.(Garnt laughs) </connor>
<joey> - Because they're genuinely
like some hentai artists </joey>
<connor> that I've seen. </connor>
<joey> And I know of where I'm just like, </joey>
<garnt> if you made an all ages manga, </garnt>
<garnt> you would sell like crazy. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh no and people have. </garnt>
<garnt> - And people have like
look at like (mumbles) </garnt>
<connor> who made fucking easy
on Nathan Novato song. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah I love that. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - I know, you know put up a picture of it. </garnt>
<connor> But okay everyone has seen
this chick before, all right. </connor>
<connor> Nano she was originally </connor>
<connor> like a hardcore lowly hentai artist. </connor>
<connor> And he made a really
fucking six for all ages, </connor>
<garnt> comedy Manga which is hilarious. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And like and even if
they don't make all, </garnt>
<garnt> they just stuff, look
at artists like Nambata </garnt>
<connor> who is like genuinely an amazing artist. </connor>
<connor> And that's what I will
like, because you know, </connor>
<connor> we've gotten to this point
where hentai has just become </connor>
<joey> like ha ha anime, boobs,
hilarious and horny on me. </joey>
<garnt> Like it's all just
become like a joke thing. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't want that anymore. </garnt>
<joey> - I don't want that. </joey>
<joey> - I'm sick of those jokes. </joey>
<connor> - I want to save this
topic because I want. </connor>
<connor> I want this to be a whole episode. </connor>
<connor> - I'm ready. </connor>
<garnt> I want to dedicate a whole episode. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm ready. </garnt>
<garnt> I have too many things to say </garnt>
<connor> about hentai artists that I can't fit all </connor>
<joey> like five minutes. </joey>
<connor> - Smashed like on this episode, </connor>
<garnt> if you want hentai episode </garnt>
<joey> because we're gonna do it either way. </joey>
<connor> - We're gonna do it any way. </connor>
<connor> - To give this guy is
like three sips of beer </connor>
<joey> and they start talking about hentai. </joey>
<joey> - I shouldn't had a strong </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> This is strong. </connor>
<connor> - I just, I don't know
like when I watch hentai, </connor>
<connor> it's like it's for a service, you know? </connor>
<connor> I guess I do it to do, </connor>
<connor> I do the deed, right? </connor>
<connor> Like I don't sit there and
like swallow my wine glass </connor>
<connor> and things. </connor>
<joey> - Am I weird? </joey>
<connor> Am I okay? </connor>
<connor> I wanna know. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah this is probably the answer to </connor>
<connor> - Am I weird to be like sometimes I kinda </connor>
<connor> just wanna watch Hentai just doing this. </connor>
<connor> - Yes that's totally. </connor>
<joey> - (laughs) That's fucking weird. </joey>
<connor> Come on he's probably going
through that phase right now. </connor>
<garnt> - No, no I don't, hentai to
me hasn't got to that point. </garnt>
<joey> The Doujinshi and manga. </joey>
<joey> Has definitely go into that </joey>
<joey> - Let's see if this (mumbles). </joey>
<connor> - There is no part of me
in a porn while I like, </connor>
<connor> I watch a porn and I don't </connor>
<connor> immediately skip two minutes then. </connor>
<garnt> - You are the degenerates
here, motherfucking. </garnt>
<joey> - I bought a lot Doujinshi
from my artists I like, </joey>
<garnt> I don't think I've actually read </garnt>
<garnt> like physical copies of and
like hijacked off to it. </garnt>
<garnt> I know that's TMI I'm sorry, </garnt>
<connor> - I will recommend you some share. </connor>
<connor> - Okay.
- I do. </connor>
<connor> - I'll come on and see in Twitter likes </connor>
<connor> and in like four episodes. </connor>
<connor> I'll come back on and be like
totally agree with everything. </connor>
<connor> Everything these guys say. </connor>
<joey> I don't know I just. </joey>
<joey> - Also like, you'll like
progression from like, </joey>
<joey> what the fuck to like, you know what? </joey>
<joey> I love this artist. </joey>
<garnt> - Because it's, if you've
read enough Doujinshi </garnt>
<garnt> and you've, if you've
read enough like H manga, </garnt>
<connor> there are so many the Doujinshi </connor>
<connor> that just have really, really good plots. </connor>
<connor> - I agree. </connor>
<garnt> - It's this.
- (mumbles) sphere </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah I do agree. </garnt>
<garnt> I must say. </garnt>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - It's gotten to this
point where sometimes you </garnt>
<garnt> just want the series to
be adapted into hentai </garnt>
<garnt> I just so you can see an animated </garnt>
<garnt> and sometimes you read the series </garnt>
<garnt> that just do something new with porn </garnt>
<garnt> or hentai that you just
have never seen before. </garnt>
<garnt> And you're like, wow, this
is like awakening something </garnt>
<garnt> in me right now. </garnt>
<garnt> This is amazing. </garnt>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - Seriously. </garnt>
<connor> - I've never heard someone describe, </connor>
<garnt> I've watched hentai and
awakened something in him. </garnt>
<garnt> - How Levi you know. </garnt>
<connor> - There was some Doujinshi (mumbles) </connor>
<connor> like at first I was like,
okay, I dig this art. </connor>
<connor> And then I see like the ECI scenes </connor>
<connor> and I'm like, okay, I'm digging this. </connor>
<connor> Like, you know me, I have
like a quarter child. </connor>
<connor> But then as the story continues, </connor>
<garnt> I'm like, you know what? </garnt>
<garnt> Fuck the HTC. </garnt>
<connor> - (mumbles) of the
podcast to the wrong boys. </connor>
<garnt> - That question to you a
question to all of you watching. </garnt>
<garnt> Why do you think thigh highs are sexy? </garnt>
<garnt> And if the answer isn't anime
and anime awakened your love </garnt>
<garnt> for fire highs, you're fucking. </garnt>
<connor> - No I did I mean, </connor>
<joey> - Because let's be real Japanese
girls don't have thighs. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, that's true. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, so like, if you just think, </garnt>
<connor> if you fire thighs is
like entry level right </connor>
<connor> in the world of the Doujinshi and H manga </connor>
<garnt> that's like some normie shit man. </garnt>
<joey> (laughing loudly) </joey>
<joey> They've gotten to that
point with enormous fuck. </joey>
<connor> - Maybe in future, we
can return to this topic </connor>
<connor> when I've you know done my research. </connor>
<joey> - Will come back. </joey>
<joey> We're gonna come back to it,
don't worry, don't worry. </joey>
<joey> - So we're getting ahead
of ourselves right now. </joey>
<joey> Okay like this, </joey>
<joey> - That's an understatement. </joey>
<joey> - This was meant to be
an introductory episode </joey>
<garnt> when we introduced whatever,
well we're gonna be doing. </garnt>
<joey> - If don't like these topics, I'm sorry. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> - Always be hentai by the way. </connor>
<connor> Can I just preface that? </connor>
<connor> I just, but I think, I mean, </connor>
<connor> the main reason we started this as well, </connor>
<connor> because we always hang out together. </connor>
<connor> Like it's not one of those things </connor>
<connor> like some YouTube is hangout. </connor>
<garnt> They make videos. </garnt>
<connor> It seems like they're friendships great, </connor>
<connor> we all actually hang out
together all the fucking time. </connor>
<connor> And we always talk for like two hours </connor>
<joey> - What we're looking at it's essentially </joey>
<joey> what we do on a daily. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah like, we easily have conversations </connor>
<connor> where we just talk for like three hours </connor>
<connor> about manga an anime. </connor>
<joey> - Not even about manga anime </joey>
<connor> I remember the last time
we were at your house </connor>
<connor> and we talked about like, </connor>
<connor> what was the best book you joined? </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) Do you remember that. </garnt>
<connor> We like legitimately like hardcore arguing </connor>
<garnt> about like easy in-and-out
overrated or not for like </garnt>
<connor> - It's not by the way.
- It is. </connor>
<joey> - Okay we're not gonna get into that. </joey>
<garnt> But I suppose, I guess that's, </garnt>
<garnt> we're gonna be talking about like anything </garnt>
<garnt> and it's gonna evolve over the time. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean the core of this anime and manga </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, I have a lot of
things about anime and manga </garnt>
<garnt> that I wanna talk about,
but I also want to talk </garnt>
<garnt> about the culture, the community, hentai, </garnt>
<connor> more hentai I guess. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah and I mean,
- I'm for this. </garnt>
<garnt> - Also like just general </garnt>
<connor> 'cause we're YouTubers is we
wanna talk about sometimes </connor>
<connor> if there's YouTube drama that we feel </connor>
<connor> like we can probably add
something to it like of course. </connor>
<joey> - You know, sometimes if there's just </joey>
<connor> like standard banter of just like, </connor>
<joey> whatever the fuck then, will talk. </joey>
<garnt> - And if any of our
mutuals are ever in Japan, </garnt>
<joey> like if you wanna talk anime
manga with us hit us up. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, absolutely. </garnt>
<joey> And not even just our
mutuals, like if you're just </joey>
<joey> if you don't wanna like come onto the show </joey>
<joey> and like talk, first of all
you gotta come on to the show, </joey>
<joey> physically sit right here next to me </joey>
<joey> and talk about it. </joey>
<joey> - Because we wanna ideally this </joey>
<joey> will be a full person podcast. </joey>
<connor> And hopefully, I mean
I'd be really interested </connor>
<joey> in to bring YouTube is on who, </joey>
<joey> don't really get to talk about anime. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah
- Absolutely. </joey>
<connor> - And I just hear that side. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah I mean if there were </connor>
<connor> any YouTube is watching
this video or you know, </connor>
<connor> the Twitter or whatever, </connor>
<connor> then I guess let us know </connor>
<garnt> if you'd like to come onto the podcast. </garnt>
<joey> 'Cause we will happily welcome come on. </joey>
<garnt> - Because it's surprising
I've met so many YouTubers </garnt>
<joey> who have nothing to do
with anime or anything. </joey>
<joey> - Who watch anime.
- Who watch anime </joey>
<garnt> and just really wanna talk
about anime to somewhere. </garnt>
<garnt> And I think it's pretty awesome </garnt>
<garnt> because I remember anime was nowhere </garnt>
<connor> near this popular before. </connor>
<connor> And I remember the feeling
of being the only anime fan </connor>
<connor> and have having nothing. </connor>
<connor> I have no one to talk about. </connor>
<connor> - I mean I think that's why
I started my YouTube channel. </connor>
<garnt> But that was like my
reasoning is that I had no one </garnt>
<joey> to talk to this about. </joey>
<joey> - Let's just say like kids
today, have it fucking easy. </joey>
<connor> If you're an anime fan like
today, you know, High School, </connor>
<joey> you have it so much
easier than any of busted. </joey>
<connor> - My God, I wish I'm so jealous </connor>
<joey> because I wish I could have just talked </joey>
<garnt> to my fucking friends
about Narrow Toe or Bleach </garnt>
<garnt> or One Piece or something. </garnt>
<garnt> - I had to convince my
friends to get into anime </garnt>
<joey> in order for them in order
to find someone about anime. </joey>
<connor> - See, this is like another thing that I, </connor>
<connor> when I talked to Americans, </connor>
<connor> they don't have this problem, </connor>
<connor> at least in my age group. </connor>
<connor> (mumbles) </connor>
<connor> It's like we had Americans
had a good but British people </connor>
<connor> and I think probably Australian people are </connor>
<connor> more closer to British like
fucking ruthless school. </connor>
<connor> Oh yeah.
- No, definitely. </connor>
<connor> - And I remember I got shiffer
gaming too much at school. </connor>
<connor> So am I other fuck my gonna. </connor>
<connor> - I mean at that. </connor>
<connor> - I go shiffer gaming too much in school. </connor>
<connor> So am I gonna sit there
and be like, all right. </connor>
<connor> So call of duty, that thing that you play </connor>
<garnt> but give me shit for, </garnt>
<garnt> how about you check out
these animated, he's right. </garnt>
<garnt> Like how do I, </garnt>
<connor> I built up years getting to
like a medium level of like </connor>
<connor> in between a level of popularity. </connor>
<garnt> I was never popular, but I
got out of the bullying zone </garnt>
<joey> if you will. </joey>
<joey> Didn't wanna go back to that. </joey>
<joey> - It's really crazy just how like, </joey>
<garnt> I don't want to say mainstream animes. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's not mainstream. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's not mainstream at all, </garnt>
<garnt> but like I guess just </garnt>
<joey> how much more accepted it's
become as a subculture. </joey>
<garnt> - It's get enough. </garnt>
<joey> - It's definitely,
definitely is because I feel </joey>
<connor> like anime works so
well with Meme culture. </connor>
<connor> - Oh my,
- You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> An anime in a sense is Meme culture </connor>
<garnt> in a lot of ways, I mean </garnt>
<connor> - Flying a room when you
mentioned Meme culture and anime </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> You all know what we're talking about. </connor>
<garnt> - But I feel like because of that, </garnt>
<garnt> it's a lot more people know what anime is </garnt>
<garnt> or at least have seen
a Meme or a screenshot </garnt>
<connor> or a gift of probably Jojo. </connor>
<connor> - This is usually where they start. </connor>
<connor> - That's usually will happen. </connor>
<garnt> - And as it should be, </garnt>
<garnt> - It's the only enemy that matters. </garnt>
<connor> - And then people would just
recognize that a lot more. </connor>
<connor> Cause I remember when I was growing up, </connor>
<garnt> people didn't even know what anime was, </garnt>
<garnt> the word anime they're
like, what the fuck is this? </garnt>
<garnt> That's some cartoon porn,
you know what I mean? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, absolutely. </joey>
<connor> - It's weird 'cause I
think one of the biggest </connor>
<joey> like double-edged swords to anime </joey>
<joey> has been Netflix, </joey>
<garnt> like in the sense that like
it's got a lot of people </garnt>
<garnt> into anime.
- Yeah </garnt>
<garnt> - But then when you get really into anime, </garnt>
<joey> it becomes like the fucking (mumbles). </joey>
<joey> - I mean are we definitely
gonna talk about light, </joey>
<garnt> - True that more future. </garnt>
<garnt> But I think Netflix is also helped a lot </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I mean, they've been pushing </garnt>
<garnt> like I remember like when
they started getting anime </garnt>
<joey> like Death and it would not
get off my fucking recommended </joey>
<joey> on Netflix </joey>
<joey> - Really?
- Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> And like Fullmetal lockers brother </joey>
<joey> had I think they have that. </joey>
<connor> I think they have all the classics </connor>
<connor> which is pretty impressive. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean they have all the
entry level most for me to </garnt>
<garnt> - Need to watch. </garnt>
<joey> Now they have Evangelion as well. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah exactly
- Which is </joey>
<connor> - Crazy they call that </connor>
<connor> - That's just, I can't
imagine how much money Netflix </connor>
<garnt> through no, be like, hey,
can we grab your series </garnt>
<joey> that has been pretty much out of print </joey>
<joey> for like 20 plus years. </joey>
<garnt> - I wanna hear the story
about how they got that </garnt>
<garnt> because people have tried for decades, </garnt>
<garnt> literally decades to
get the often ADV died </garnt>
<garnt> to get the licensing over to the West. </garnt>
<connor> So there must be. </connor>
<connor> - I remember when I </connor>
<joey> - Lots and lots of money. </joey>
<connor> - I wrote whatever that use it badly. </connor>
<connor> I actually couldn't believe it. </connor>
<connor> I was like, this is like one
of the biggest achievements </connor>
<garnt> because it is like, like, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> without you know wrapping
it up in a package nicely </garnt>
<garnt> like Evangelion is one of the
biggest anime like ever made </garnt>
<garnt> and like I know we all know
I know is like hardcore </garnt>
<garnt> when it comes to protecting it's IP. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my God! </garnt>
<garnt> - Cause I remember for the
longest time Hollywood wanted </garnt>
<garnt> to make that Evangelion adaptation </garnt>
<connor> and unknown was just like, fuck off fame. </connor>
<connor> - Like he did a solid, he does this. </connor>
<garnt> - There are so many
live action adaptations </garnt>
<garnt> being made right now. </garnt>
<garnt> I couldn't keep track of them all. </garnt>
<garnt> I remember when there was just one </garnt>
<connor> and everyone would just
wait a shit on that one. </connor>
<connor> But I think there's like </connor>
<garnt> over 10 adaptations being made right now. </garnt>
<connor> - We need to do an episode
or we do like a Tier List </connor>
<connor> of the worst Netflix adaptations </connor>
<connor> - We need to do a Tier
List of the fly back. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh God yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - So anyways guys look
forward to all of that stuff. </joey>
<garnt> - This was just a taster. </garnt>
<garnt> We didn't really plan much
of what we were gonna say. </garnt>
<joey> - As you can see, we're
just talking out of our. </joey>
<garnt> - We were just talking about
there wasn't a topic planned </garnt>
<garnt> and we just kind of evolved (laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - The only talk we talked
about was Killing Stalking, </connor>
<joey> which last five minutes. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> - There we a lot more structure in future </connor>
<garnt> when we get a bit more used to it as well. </garnt>
<garnt> Let me have more topics to talk about </garnt>
<joey> but because right now,
we'll do wanna cover. </joey>
<connor> I think it would make it
really interesting video </connor>

<connor> on about things that are
like evolving situations. </connor>
