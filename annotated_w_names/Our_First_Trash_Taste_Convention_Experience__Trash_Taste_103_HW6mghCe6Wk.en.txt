<SPEAKER_00> i went to momocon like one of the few </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> years and i was like it's the same </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> weekend as mcm so it's been a very very </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> long time since i've been to mcmahon </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> well irregardless it was a very </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> different experience yeah because not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> only it was our first con in three years </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_03> taste yeah so we had no idea what to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> expect and uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> i mean a lot of [ __ ] happened yeah sure </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i mean it's it kind of put things </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> into perspective just one like how long </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_02> two how long it's been since the world </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_00> i know there's a japan expo in paris </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that's gigantic yeah i don't know i know </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_00> anime expo japan it's like it's like mix </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and match bro it's one of them i don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know which one it is we're all talking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about the same convention </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_02> you say japan expo </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's huge i don't know anyone who's gone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to it but i mean that's because british </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> friends oh god yeah yeah yeah and then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's gamescon in germany right which </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> is awesome i've been the gamescom </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> gamescon is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> massive yeah yeah i remember i went to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gamescon and like i was like yeah man i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kind of this is this is when the switch </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uh was about to come out right right and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um i remember that uh nintendo had a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> booth to play super mario odyssey for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like 10 minutes right and the line was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like eight hours </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it was ridiculous there was like a a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> japanese woman just standing outside </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with like a thing that said like oh the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wait time is like 600 minutes or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> something right i was like i was like i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> was like what and people were like yo </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> joining in this cure you know the thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> closes before this this is done what do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you what what what is this math right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah but like gamescom is like so big </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that also i feel like you can't really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> do anything like it gets to a point </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> where it's almost you know it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this has reached a capacity where i can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no longer do anything i think i played </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i i the only games you could actually </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> get on in a reasonable amount of times </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> were like the games that were like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> destined to [ __ ] fail the moment they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> came out yeah games that nobody gave a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] about is it kind of like e3 in a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> sense yeah it's it's e3 but for europe </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> but it's right it's i it's open to the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> public i think all days bar won and it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was just like it was insane i i don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really want to go back i think if i were </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to go back it would be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> under </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like a press pass or something where you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> can just be like see it loses i'm going </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in la i'm gonna go to the front yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just like i cut the entire line i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hyped for like i was hyped for super </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> mario odyssey but i'm not waiting over </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> an hour hyped like an hour was pretty </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> much my yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> anything is worth me waiting an hour in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> terms like games for me like i can't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> think of a single game where i'm just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like yo okay two hour light with two </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> hour wait time for like a for like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> five minute demo or something yo let's </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> waited was like an hour and a half aaron </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> 40 at tgs to play persona 5. right was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it worth it there were 40. i mean yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but you know you know how long that game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> is yeah five minutes is not a lot of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> time so you know like you can't do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> anything you can't sink your teeth into </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you know what i mean like you're just </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_02> end of the iron 40 i got to the front of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the line i was like wow that was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a bike </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> definitely not as quiet as our studio </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah like you know i was waiting for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like an hour and 30 hour and 40 minutes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then i got to the front of line i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was just like wow i don't know if this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was even worth it or not oh bro you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> what i actually play a game i played at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gamescon and that was like no line four </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> this is before cuphead came out and i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> was like so [ __ ] hyped to play </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cuphead yeah right it was only like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ten minute wait i like cuphead and i was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like [ __ ] yes this game is awesome </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i can't wait to buy it and it was good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that was good but uh yeah so uh we went </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> to mcm for three days oh i mean connor </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and i were there for three days </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> one day just because i had some things </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> to do in and out here and there so i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> only wanted to commit to one day </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> um but yeah how was your first uk con </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> experience joey it was uh i mean we'll </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> get into the details later but it was a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> lot of ups and a lot of downs that's for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sure it's very much a roller coaster i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> mean like you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like i expected like you know british </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> fans to be super chill and they were for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the most part um but of course you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> at the same time it's like this is our </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> first con as trash tastes right so it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like i knew that like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know my fans like the anime man fans </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like british fans would like chill as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they usually blaming trash technically </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i mean like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> could you say that it was like a hundred </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> percent chill </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i mean i i think it was for the most </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> part it was like okay so here's the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> thing it was like 99.9 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> chill yeah you know but then you um </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there were like those one or two people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that obviously really really stood out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and some of them even made waves uh you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> might have even seen some clips online </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about some of the people we've had to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> deal with over the weekend yeah um </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because it just like the intensity </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was just like way more intense than </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> anything that i've ever experienced in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> my life before oh like saying yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> we enjoy we walked around on um so it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a three-day con right friday saturday </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sunday </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they have this odd ticket system </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that i've never seen in any other con </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where like every single day they have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like a priority ticket which means you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> can come in from nine right and then a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> general ticket which means you can come </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> in from i think 11 or twelve something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like that yeah confused about that i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> didn't quite get it it's just cheaper i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't really understand it but um we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> walked around on like friday at like 10 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a.m before everyone got in and like we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> could walk around it's pretty chill like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> we got stopped a lot but i stopped </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> 10 a.m which is literally </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the deadest time of the entire year </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> you're not gonna get a deader time yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah exactly in that time so at least </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like you know i got to actually like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> walk around even for a little bit to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like actually see what the con was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> in all the other places because it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> freaking massive isn't it yeah that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> really big it's just like there's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 20 warehouses just attached to each </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> other yeah yeah exactly but um yeah i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> mean that was cool but then you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's very yeah once the actual like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> general admission started to come in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> around like 11 12-ish yeah yeah it got </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> very heated very quickly very powerful </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so what was your guys's expectation </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> going into this convention </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i was expecting like okay obviously more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> people are gonna know us now not just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for individual stuff but for trash taste </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if anything there's probably going to be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> more people who know us for trash taste </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah but i wasn't expecting it to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> be like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> 10 times as much no you know like i mean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i had some expectations obviously i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> expected more like uh to be more </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> recognized and everything like that now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that i've shown my face more i've got an </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> extra channel now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just talk [ __ ] with the boys you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um but this was definitely like an </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> eye-opening weekend for me because we've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like speculated before about what what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> an anime convention is going to be like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> now since trash chases started i think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this weekend has definitely cemented </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that anime conventions will never be the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> same again </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for us and it's like it was like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bittersweet realization because i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> remember we were all it was it was a sad </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> day when we all realized this i think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah and it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right after our panel uh so we had our </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> first </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> trash taste panel ever ever uh and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for the most part you know i i thought </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you were it was good but then there was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> some really really stand out things that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> hard to forget about our first trash </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> chase experience so if you've been </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> living under a rock there's probably </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> about 30 different perspectives of uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> some dude running up onto the stage </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> 30 different perspectives of me [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> my pants </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah i mean we weren't really like uh we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> didn't really prepare anything that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of announced like we could have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> prepared something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like we're going to do a q a we're just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> going to just keep it simple like how </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> we've always done it right because we've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> always done panels where it's just okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> q a easy we don't need to think too much </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about it you know people are normally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> chill we don't it's it's like it's a q a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know what i mean it's like how how </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> riled up can fans get most of the times </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but i mean the thing is with the q and a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it's it's completely made by how good of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the questions people ask yeah and you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> know i think it's just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> roll of the dice sometimes that some </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people just asked questions that were </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> either just like cringy or yeah um would </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ask questions that didn't really </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> you know it sucks and i but i know it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like a part of yeah i i guess i guess it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was just like you know we've we've seen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the comments and everything and i'm sure </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you get it on your twitch chat all the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> time oh yeah yeah here at hearing it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like in person like as a mate i'm just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> like you know it just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i've i felt my bro man </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> because i i would feel uncomfortable </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like i mean it's happened so many times </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> now where it's kind of like all right i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just have the routine of dealing with it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of like ha ha but that well that's the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> one thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's another one that i've kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> figured out like going to this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> convention doing the panel is that like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it you know because we've talked about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> parasocial relationships so many </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> freaking times on the show yeah and it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like you'd think that like after the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> amount of times we've talked about it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people start to be like okay yeah i get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the boys perspectives on it but there's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> also the fact where if you talk about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> parasocial relationships it makes it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> seem like okay the person listening </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> isn't a parasocial relationship they're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> listening they're hearing but then it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like okay but it doesn't always like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> translate well yeah but also i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> understand how like on the day you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> sometimes people get weird moods and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> something so i get it yeah i i will say </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that it was like like i said like 99 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like i met like a lot of people there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and like the people i can respect was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just like look i know you could you've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> talked about it plenty of times you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i know you more than you know me i just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> want to say i get that and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and i still like love your stuff you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know i still respect everything you've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> done and that's that was like just a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> genuine okay i met like a few people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like at the bar at the hotel who i just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> had like a genuine conversation with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from like from like that starting point </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where yeah where you know we acknowledge </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this but i still want to get to know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this person because we're in a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> environment where i can get to have a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> more chilled conversation about it right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but then you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you do just get these you know one or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> two maybe fans who just don't watch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> trash taste as often as other people you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know right no because like especially </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> reading the subreddit and reading how </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> much people have like called this out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i'm just like that's that's that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] great yeah unfortunately not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> every one of our viewers is on the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> subreddit for example you know not every </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> viewer watches every episode uh so you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> will get that casual viewer who just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> doesn't know more and like doesn't know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about the boundaries much like other </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> viewers i think i don't know i mean to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> me it was like this was just all a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> learning experience </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like this is no way made me not want to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> go to cons or anything no no no no no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like i i just you know like like we've </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> said this a million times but yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everyone was super [ __ ] nice </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the signings were great yeah everyone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was really respectful except you got </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> shot by a nerf gun yeah yeah yeah that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was helpful i i wasn't there to say yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so it was because it's like open right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah it was over so we had like a table </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and there's three of us i was in the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> middle joey's on the end and then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> there's gone on this end yeah and this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> end is completely open yeah so any </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> anyone could have walked up and like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> thrown anything at guns yeah which is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> just an oversight they should have had </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> someone there who is like stopping like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i i think i think it was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's it's a learning experience not just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for us but for the convention itself </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> for for the convention as well so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i remember remember the conversation </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where we talked about we don't know if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we need security for future conventions </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah uh this taught us that we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> definitely yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> we definitely do need security like that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that was like a very much a big </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> eye-opener for us i mean uh obviously we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> had uh the incident happened where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> someone came on the stage who i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> apparently okay so this is a whole </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] thing right you said it was a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> learning curve look you said it was a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> learning experience for the convention i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> feel like i don't know they should know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that it was it would have been better </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and to be fair they stepped it up but i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> feel like it should have been there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> anyway like we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> practically had like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no security really for like the first </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> two days yeah yeah like i i think they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> definitely should have had security for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the panel but i i talked to some people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> afterwards uh who working there and they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> said </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this is like there's never been this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> this has never happened before this has </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> never even come close to happening yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> there was never like a president a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> precedent </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of this like ever happening at mcm right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so it was also it wasn't oversight but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> also </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> we just like a lot of people just didn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> expect it because it's just never </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> happened before right um i mean i i yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i agree and i don't want to go too hard </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> because obviously like we want to go to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cons again </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it blows my mind that you would have a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> main stage event and not have like at </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> least one scary dude in the front yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> just start like you know cause it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like it was anyone could have come up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone could have come up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like you know mcn haven't had like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> insanely large guests in the past yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> so i'm thinking like what do they do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> well they had like tom hiddleston yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's like there's no way like tom </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hiddleston could do a panel on stage and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there wouldn't be a single [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> bodyguard anyway </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe it's just like a thing of their </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like all right well we have some guests </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> this year none of them are super high </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> profile i guess we can scale it back </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> save some money yeah but obviously </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> you know yeah but and also a lot of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> these cons they they know youtubers are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> big they know it but they don't like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> they don't know it yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> they understand oh he has three million </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> subs but they're like yeah but we have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> the guy who voices in like fairy odd </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> parents here and i know what that is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right and i don't know who this trash </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> guy is yeah who's these rubbish </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> lads yeah who's these rubbish lads what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are they right so there's this complete </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like a lot of cons do have this kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like disconnect between like because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that a lot of the cons are very are ran </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> by people who understand like older </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> media yeah traditional media they don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> really understand like youtubers that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they should buy now but they don't and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so i feel like there's a lot of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> oversight that happened there and then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> getting to this guy in particular who </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> came on the stage which was which was a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> weird thing because this guy didn't do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> anything for the first 20 minutes yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and then started shouting he was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone thought he was like just a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> heckler yeah yeah i thought he was a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> heckler yeah because i was just like you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know we've all dealt with hecklers as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> well of course uh so you know uh someone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> asked the question and then we just i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> just like heard someone shouting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> something in like the [ __ ] background </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or something i'm just like oh okay it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just ignore him passionate anime fans </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i've heard it all before you know um and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then suddenly i see some guy just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> walking up to the stage and i'm just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like is this happening </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah is this is this happening i heard </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like a gadget no no i'm coming on yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like what and then someone's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> stood up and i was like yeah yeah [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> someone's coming out yeah yeah and i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like oh no worries security will deal </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> with it yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there'll be someone there yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i was just like okay he'll get he'll get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to the stage oh no he's on the stage </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well he'll get near the sofa oh no he's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> near the sofa oh oh he's sitting next to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> joey and then i remember just like just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> waiting because you i i i yeah yeah i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> assumed that there would be someone who </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> would have come on and i'd be like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> someone's coming from backstage yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah that was like i was like i was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> backstage no i was like no no one on the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> side yeah um </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> oh and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a good like 30 40 seconds passed where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like nothing happened like even the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> crowd was like uh like is this a bit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like what's happening yeah it was so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like out of left field that i i talked </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> to some people and originally they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thought that it was just a special guest </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a special guest </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> just just a bit in like the in like our </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> show or something and uh and we were </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> just like i think the best way to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> describe it is just we were just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> shell-shocked </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> uh yeah i mean you know it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> definitely traumatizing that's for sure </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like that's like nev yeah as i said it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was like it was like unprecedented like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's never happened at like any </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> probably never any of our panels right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like i don't know how calm we looked on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> camera but i'm pretty sure internally we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> were freaking out i was [ __ ] myself </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because i was like this dude like sat </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> right next to me like he kind of like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> shoved me out of the way yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like kind of in the middle of the couch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah and he like shoved me out of the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> way and then he like you know i mean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone who was there saw it but like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> he tried to like grab the mic off my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> head yeah because he wanted to say </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> something and i was like uh no dude like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah what the [ __ ] are you doing yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah and then yeah he just like starts </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> rambling off about something i don't </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> know the dude might have a knife you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know yeah yeah the dude might [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> suddenly swing at me right i was like i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't know what to do like i didn't like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> push him off or anything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah this guy was big </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i mean like you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i'm not not saying that i would punch it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> if like a [ __ ] two-foot man came on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the stage but like i'd be a lot more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> likely just to be like to try and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> leverage my own position </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if they were if a child comes on to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> stage you're like okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for the drop kick </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you're in the situation right someone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> comes up and like they're they're you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you look at him and you're like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if this guy really wanted a swing for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> any of us odds are it's gonna [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like really [ __ ] hurt yeah and i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> probably won't be able to punch like he </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he was really tall yeah and big right so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just like it's you just sit there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you're like weighing your odds </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you're like what do i need to do like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what's the best way to handle this like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm processing processing processing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> because like you've rarely find yourself </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in a situation like this where you don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know what the outcome is going to be so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in your head you're just like what's the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> worst outcome this could possibly be and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how could i prepare for it because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're kind of in like fight or flight </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mode at that point at that point yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and also it's like you know there was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that like side of me as well that was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like okay say for example like if i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] tripped him up as he was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> trying to flee and he like smashes his </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> head in and he's gonna [ __ ] abby </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> heard me and like try and like sue me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> for defamation and damages right i don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> want that either so it's like i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> literally couldn't do anything and i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> just had to sit there and be like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> just just praj </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> would help me i was just like just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> hoping i was like okay you know like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> obviously a lot of people like man you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> should have just like punched him or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> something and it's like well it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> do i do i don't want to be the one to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> escalate it you know at the end of the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> day we're still on stage and we're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> trying to create create a clash was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> a month yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that's that's not what they paid the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> amount of the money for man </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just like you're sitting there you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> have to like go through it i'm like all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> right well what does this guy want like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> why is he on stage right and so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> initially i was just like okay maybe he </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just wants to be funny and i was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> well this is great because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm i can handle cringe like my half of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my videos on my channel are like try not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to cringe challenges and like i'm fine </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> dealing with a guy trying to be funny on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> stage i'll just out out wait him and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cringe like i know that i can sit here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and if this guy was trying to be funny </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which we he wasn't but if he was i was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like it's fine i'll just wait until he </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> feels so unbearably awkward that he'll </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just leave yeah and then i'll be like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> all right good which is what i think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> happened eventually but this guy was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> completely you know he was not in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> right state of mind like this guy was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> clearly unwrapped and he was also doing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it to a bunch of other panels as well so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he clearly wasn't like a targeted thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> he was just like going around just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wreaking as much havoc as possible so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah what i heard was i don't know how </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> okay this is this is not 100 confirmed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but this is the story that i was told </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> apparently he did this to another stage </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> after after hours after hours oh [ __ ] i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> thought it was before no no after ours </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and then they try to get him removed but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> at the time they didn't right yeah just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because for some reason they didn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> listen to the person who was trying to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> get him removed or something it was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a whole thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then uh yeah we were told the next </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> day that uh yeah he was arrested </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> afterwards and uh i think charged i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't know what with uh but apparently </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when they asked him why </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah why why he did it yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sentenced </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and sent us the children </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> eyes of cringe </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i sentence you for being cringy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> so what are you in for i was cringing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't know maybe like trespassing or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> something yeah i i either way i mean you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know glad that something happened yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um you know they they caught him in it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when they asked him why he did it he </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> said something along the lines of uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah he apparently just wanted to go up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on stage like he didn't really know who </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> we were yeah yeah he was just there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> trying to get on stage to things yeah so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> it was just unfortunate timing that it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> was a guy at our panel who just wanted </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to jump on stage yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i like i mean yeah it could have been </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> anyone you know at the end of the day </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> we're lucky it turned out well like you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know if that guy really wanted to do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something this could be a really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> different story i mean i see it as a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> positive experience because it really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's really easy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you want to be in my scene say that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> okay okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i see it because i see it as an event </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like this where something this big </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> happened and nothing bad came out of it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right it really put things into </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> perspective for us </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh yeah it made it so it made it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> guaranteed that something like this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> isn't gonna happen again because now we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are more aware of it now we're gonna </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> convey this to wherever we go to so i i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> think you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's obviously not a good thing that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> happened and maybe we should have been </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> more prepared for it but it did happen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> nothing too bad came out of it outside </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of aside from just a lot of cringe a lot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of cringe </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and just like getting you getting his </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> ass flashed like in front of our face </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> because like he's just yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> his trousers was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like it wasn't even like a half crack </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like he might as well have not been </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> wearing pants it was like the full ass </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> crack and i was like oh god </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> why </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> why also he stank like he really [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> stank </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> like i was like holy [ __ ] that you like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you smell you definitely smell like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> girl that's not a shot i just [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> hope that guy gets the help he needs </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because he's really [ __ ] unwell yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah definitely yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i don't know it was just [ __ ] you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it sucked as well because you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> halfway through the panel we have to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like the panel was it was going okay at </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that point i'd say yeah and then we were </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> already kind of like [ __ ] dude you got </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> to do this panel now after that happened </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like pretend like nothing happened at </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> least if it was like you know near the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> beginning or near the end then you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they'd be like it'd be a little bit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> easier to kind of just like clean it up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and get over it but it was like dead set </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the middle of the panel yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah so it was like the hardest to kind </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> of recruit recuperating like get back </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> onto the floor of things you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because i remember i tried to like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> tried to like continue the panel and all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like like the only image that was in my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mind was just that that ask that bare </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ass crack like that that bare ass crack </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just like hypnotized me to be like oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> where am i right now for me it was that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and also just like in the back of my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> head being like what if someone else </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> also does this yeah like what if like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> another person is just like well they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> didn't [ __ ] do anything or now it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> my time to get 15 minutes of fame you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> know i was like i was like so [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> scared for that yeah it's like and also </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> it was just like oh good i'm gonna see </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this all over the subreddit and the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> twitter feed in like 17 different </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] angles yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but yeah it was whatever i mean yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah no like again as like the silver </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> lining is that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> now we know now we're going to be a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> little more prepared for future cons and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> future events and stuff like that and um </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> just a lot of trauma and a lot of cringe </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> just a lot of emotional damage trauma by </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> cringe basically emotional damage but no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> physical damage so that's good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah aside from the panel how how else </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> was your guys's con experience yeah i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> did yeah it was good yeah i mean the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> signing was freaking awesome yeah like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that was a good thing you know at least </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like everyone who came to the signing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was super nice super respectful you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> lots of like really cool artists and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> stuff like that i just like kind of wish </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> i had enough time to like go to the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> artist alley because i feel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> mcn's artist ally was like really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> freaking good compared to like other </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cons that i've been to because like you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> naturally when you're at a signing a lot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> of people bring up stuff that they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> bought oh yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> some of the stuff i was genuinely like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where the hell did you get that yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because i want to get it but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> unfortunately we didn't have enough time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> to go to the artist alley this year so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that was a little disappointing but yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you know well it's kind of hard to walk </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> around in general this year i feel like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> because i feel like the last convention </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we went to we was like ax 2019 and we've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> said that you know we could still walk </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> around the convention right yeah like we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> could you know we'd get stopped every </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> now and again you know especially at </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a you know at a event like ax but it was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it wasn't to the point where it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> completely stopped your movement and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> like made it so you couldn't walk around </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and i felt like that was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> very very different this year yeah like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i i didn't even bother trying especially </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> after i heard what connor tried to do oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> my god </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i knew you're going to [ __ ] tell me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> oh we got it we got it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> so funny it's so funny so like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> after the panel and after our signing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> was it after the signing that was after </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the signing okay so after like our day </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> was free and we had like a good two </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> three hours to enjoy the convention we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> were like up in the green room right now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah yeah we're we're so we're up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in the green room normally at this point </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we're just like great we've got two </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> three hours to enjoy the convention </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> let's just walk around and stuff like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that but like seeing how many people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> were at our signing and seeing how many </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people couldn't even make it to our </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> signing because the signing got cut off </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh the line was like full capacity like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> an hour or two even before we even </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> started the sliding i'm like yeah i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> thought about everyone who wanted the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> signature uh yeah yeah sorry </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> we would have done it if we could have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah we would have done it if there was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> enough time yeah yeah i think we were </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> signing for like two and a half hours </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and that was like capping the line two </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hours before </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> the line even opened yeah um but yeah so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i i got the feeling that probably not a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> good idea to walk around especially </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> without security and uh conor was just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like guys i got this i got the perfect </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> disguise </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so let me tell you what connor's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> disguise was his disguise was a to wear </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a face mask like a normal covert like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> surgical face mask and some sunglasses </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and a hat </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so first things first wearing a sun </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wearing sunglasses inside totally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> inconspicuous no one's going to look at </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you at all why would you we weren't we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wearing sunglasses inside </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> second thing he forgot that the shirt he </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was wearing was a trash taste shirt that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hasn't been released yet no yeah it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> a trash taste shirt that the general </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that hasn't been shipped out to the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> general public yet </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> also it's the trash taster that you see </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> him wear in almost every video and every </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> episode so it's like it's like that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> shirt has just been like synonymous with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like yep that's kind of [ __ ] i you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> i just uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i wanted to say hi to some of my friends </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so i was like hey i'll just come quickly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and say hi i was i wasn't gonna stay out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> long i'm just gonna go say hi and yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> obviously i knew it wasn't a foolproof </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> disguise i was i wasn't [ __ ] going to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> film any any movie scenes fooling </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> anybody right like i was just like maybe </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it'll just buy me enough time where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people will double glance and then i can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> just walk away yeah right right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay and so and how far did you get well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> no so i went to meet my friend who i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> told to come meet me uh at this like at </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the gate so it was like i literally </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> walked out like two meters and then my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> friend was problem was that at this area </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that was really convenient for me uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like people were waiting for sydney yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> science sydney stuff and obviously </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> people like were waiting around there </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_01> give me a moment and then they were like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just asking for photos and then the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> moment i turned around to like go back </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_04> this side and then because my friend </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> left who i was talking to yeah people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just filled the void and i was like oh </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_00> quickly took a picture with them and i </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_02> greatly appreciative </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> very grateful we [ __ ] love it but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah you know i mean like because uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> after our signing i really really wanted </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> to go to sydney's panel right because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> her panel wasn't on the main stage it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> was on like one of like the side stages </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that was like in the middle of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> convention it was like it was kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like a two or three minute walk yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah so it was like a two three </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> minute walk through like this crowd and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i remember asking one of the handlers </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_04> should not be walking through that crowd </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right like they literally were just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> after what has happened on stage we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cannot stop you but we highly highly and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> they're not like begging me please don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> go because i could see like the sweat </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> drop on her face like being like oh i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't like if he says yes i can't deny </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> him but yeah i don't want to deal with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like the consequence of it right right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> actually like so on the second day right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so on on the sunday uh we were hanging </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> out at uh like that one of the bars it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> was like the nov hotel which is like far </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> enough from the convention that you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like not too many people there but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> close enough that you could walk to and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> from the convention right right so i was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hanging out there with a few of my mates </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on like the sunday and it was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everyone was still in the convention so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> it was like pretty dead and so you guys </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> you guys in like the green room or </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_04> other side of the convention and i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> remember going out with my mate to see </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the optimal path right to walk to the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hotel that we're going to and what it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> felt like i walk outside and everyone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> started to go outside to like the big </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> grassy area because the convention is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> over now so you just see like this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> massive crowd and what it felt like is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know like in that [ __ ] zombie </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> movie where they're on the like the roof </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where they're on like the roof of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mall and they have to get like the food </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_02> literally like the opening scene to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> death right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's what it felt like because i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> just like okay let me let me plan on my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> route what's like the most optimal route </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i can uh i can i can walk without like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what's the least possibility i can grab </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the bench </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_01> damn it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was just a perfect disguise i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> immediately gave up yeah so i don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> think i don't think it's gonna work </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's why i was laughing my ass off </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when conor was like they'll never know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's me i didn't expect it to work yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i was like it'll just buy me enough time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you might as well just add a sign that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> says i am conor that trash does just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like it says i am not confident i am not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gonna i'll do that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sure we'll get a giant [ __ ] like one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> one of those pizza flipping something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> arrow here that's like i am not coming </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> now because like i actually did try it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on sunday and it worked for a bit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> actually </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because like people would definitely </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> recognize me like hey like as i was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> walking around the convention uh people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> would definitely recognize me but it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> wasn't like it was like the corner strap </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> well what kind of wanted to do which was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it brought you enough time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that they didn't like you didn't get </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> stopped immediately </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but i could see like on like every like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fifth person i walked past they they did </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like the double take they did like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> double right they would walk past and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> then like something would click and then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> they just like is that yeah yeah yeah or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> like yeah who was that guy i i felt i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> felt a disturbance in the force for a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> second there but like that bought me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> enough time to be like okay they've </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> looked around and i'm already like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like enough the world yeah yeah so it it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> definitely didn't hide my identity but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> it made people wouldn't like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not immediately not like immediately </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like not run up from a distance yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah yeah yeah and i i think like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as long as you don't stop in one place </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> for too long then then it's useful but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but the problem with that is that like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you know if you if you have that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> particular mask on for instance then the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> word is going to spread so yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah so the guy in that mask yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> that's gone right and then it just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> doesn't work anymore right because it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like now they're just looking for the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> guy in that mode </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> right it's a one trick pony yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah exactly you got to get like a new </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mask for like every day or like every </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] convention or something </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_02> starts going off on like the entire </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> synopsis right of dick fight island </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is apparently just a bunch of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> dudes on an island and they fight with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> their dicks that's what i'm guessing is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but he goes into it in like such graphic </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> detail right and so i'm like yeah that </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> v8 because it just looked like </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_00> you're not you're like the end of the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> universe you want to explain what's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> happening because i explained about this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay so at the signing right we had like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a dedicated section for our signing you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know there was a picture of all three of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> us that said trash taste and then there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was individual photos of like yeah man </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> gig and then next to that there was a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> picture of connor </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> said see dogs with a z yeah va </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> admiring you know the posters being like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> oh yeah you know we look sick in these </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then i did a double take with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> connor's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> see what he said </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't know i see dogs </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> just like you should change your name to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> see dogs va it looks so sick </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it was that and they were coming the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> next day and it's just like like black </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that would make and i laughed even </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it was the most like inconspicuous like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> i just kind of felt like i was like i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> don't care everything everyone kept </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> coming out to me like wow you must be so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> offended i'm like why would i give a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] yeah i mean i've had that happen </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> before yeah yeah yeah i've had it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i was just like i don't really care </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's not like it's i'm suddenly now like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> a different person it's like a file </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> location where if you type in the wrong </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> thing it's like dot c-dog dot exe is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> missing it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm still here like at least like at </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> least you know the large majority of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> your name was still there and intact </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like i've had i've been to a convention </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> where they had a sign up and it said the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> anime guy yeah so i'm just like i'm like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's just a completely different </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> person </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they must've done that on purpose to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] with it no no they weren't they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> were genuine they genuinely thought i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> was the anime guy and i was and i didn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have the heart to tell them yeah at the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> time another timeline i was just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> all right you know what i'm it's good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> enough [ __ ] it yeah for me like every </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> convention i go to it's like a 50 chance </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> of whether it be giggup or gig uk that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> is that is like i swear half the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> conventions i go to is just gig uk </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> unfortunately i guess i guess it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> helpful for having kids </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in london it should have been gig uk </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah it makes sense right yeah it's uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> when we go to like australia it'll be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> gig aus right yeah yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or just geek us in like us </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> in america </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but yeah like another thing like i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> noticed is just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> every time you like you hang out with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> your mates or with somewhere where you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> think you're private it's just like if </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if someone mentions that wouldn't this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> be a funny time for you to get noticed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it is like the worst [ __ ] it is it is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> all it's like summoning the devil you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know it is going to happen so that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because that happened to me uh well it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> happened to me indirectly right because </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_00> deep right yeah yeah yeah like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if someone's having a drink </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> a bunch of drinks enjoying themselves </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they want to be like oh my god yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like whatever i don't mind that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah um but i noticed that like whenever </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we would like if i went outside or like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> any of you guys went outside they would </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like kind of like also then happen to go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> outside </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> at the same time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and just listen to whatever you're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> talking about and then you know i'd go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to the toilet then suddenly okay they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> were in the toilet as well and i was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> like okay this is like all right a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> little suspect like nothing happened so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i was like all right cool cool cool </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's chill it's kind of like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> tailgating a little bit yeah just kind </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> of like watching i guess which is like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> obviously it's like not ideal but it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> nothing bad like i'm not like whatever </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> uh but then like you guys went to bed </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_04> and they came over and they were like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hey uh do you mind if i like take that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> seat it was like 1am so it's kind of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> winding down yeah and i was like yeah i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> mean i don't really think that's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> appropriate because like no one really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> knows you you only know me you know it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> kind of it's kind of weird and stuff and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they were like oh </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_02> was trying to be like as like polite but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no as possible right because like you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know at the end of the day like there's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> still somebody who </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> even though i guess some people would be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like no you have the permission to be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like [ __ ] off at that point yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> people just people say that i'm like i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> still don't want to do that like to me </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_04> want to be that guy they shoot at their </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> shot and it didn't work and they should </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_04> also like you know people get excited </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they shoot their shot they didn't do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> anything they they asked yeah they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> didn't just sit down because people have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> done that before yeah people just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] pulled up yeah like on the panel </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_00> you have the right anyone has the right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> to be like hey can i join you and i have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the right to say no yeah and [ __ ] off </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> like exactly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm not gonna get pissed at someone for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> trying to shoot their shot yeah if you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> want to whatever yeah is it is it kind </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> of rude and insensitive to do it yeah it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> is but at the same time but at the same </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> time like respect my privacy yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> if you did it respectfully i'm gonna </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> give you the respect to be like explain </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> it nicely like that's not appropriate no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and if you don't get it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then maybe one of my friends won't be so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> nice but i'll still be nice but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i don't know please just leave the phone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know i i i we i don't know i just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> say these stories because it's like it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on my mind i wanted to talk about it but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i i know it's gonna happen again it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> gonna be the last time uh yeah if you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> ever see me around and you ask to sit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> next to me i'm probably gonna say no 99 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> no no [ __ ] i'm going to say no uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i'm i'm gonna say i'm gonna say no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> probably because i don't know you and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it's weird you know and uh yeah it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> like it's not organic yeah yeah i think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> in a convention setting it's hard to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like draw </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like a comfortable line you know whereas </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe if you meet someone at a bar and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you're not with like a massive group of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> friends it's different it's different </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's difficult definitely it's very it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> very different it's like it's you kind </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of do have to like read the room </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sometimes which i know some people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> aren't as in tune with that as other </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people but you know you try not to hold </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> things against people unless they like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> seriously do cross like a social </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> boundary yeah you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_04> privileged as you all say so don't [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> i had one time i was in london last time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i never told this there's like someone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um like a mexican restaurant </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was like the thing in the movie it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> was like the person over there wants to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> buy you a drink </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_01> drink on the [ __ ] menu and i was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like trying to spike so yeah so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> then i realized i was like yeah i'm not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> doing this again </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm not letting them choose the drink </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> though the weirder one for me is like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the ones where it's like just in passing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but you're also like not too sure either </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because of the lack of information like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's the ones where you're like when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're in the hotel lobby and you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> trying to get to the toilet or something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then a person is walking past you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you just very briefly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have eye contact and they just go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then they walk off and i'm just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> do i know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's not until i turn around and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> sometimes they'll turn around be like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know like hey love your stuff and i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was like hope you're having a good night </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and stuff like that you know maybe </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they're just being friendly i don't know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but it's like it's just the silent knot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like what is this code for something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but uh that's cool though sorry it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> cool like that's the one thing i i guess </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> as well that i've just been like kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> getting back used to again because yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know because i personally have been </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> stuck in japan for the past three years </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> now and it's like yeah stranger </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> friendliness is not as big of a thing as </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it is saying like the uk yeah especially </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] elizabeth line that's just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] opened up yeah i like heard </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about it and it's like some like fancy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> new line that's like recently opened up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah so apparently it's this it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this line that's been planned for like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that was meant to open i believe in like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh many years ago yeah yeah like like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 2020 i believe nothing that's open </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> nothing in the uk yeah never gets done </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> on time yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then it got it got delayed it got </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> delayed but like the hype was real </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i thought like i come into london coming </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to a convention people be like oh have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you started watching spike's family are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you watching any new anime no everyone's </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_01> that's the real hype man i gotta try my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i gotta try real stuff yeah yeah but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like from what i heard it's just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's a air-conditioned line and i'm just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like isn't that just every train in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like the the series of questions we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> got were very different to how the the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> the list of questions i would normally </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> get at a signing right because like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> before trash days it was always like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what do you think about this anime what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> do you think about this manga and there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was like definitely like you know some </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> amounts of those yeah but i think the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> top three questions i received </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> during that entire weekend was yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> number one was have you had a tesco meal </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> deal yet number two was have you been to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> greggs yet yes and number three was have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you been to spoons yet </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> nothing to do with anime it was all just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like have you had these things yeah have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you had any of them well yeah you took </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> me to a spoon the last time i was here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> but apparently you took me to like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> worst it was the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah but no i i still haven't had the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> tesco meal doing i really wanted greg's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i haven't had a grapes yet at all so uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean yeah we're here for a little bit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i've forgotten how passionate people are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> about greg's yeah that's very good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> greg's is the bakery yes the bakery yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah so much more than that though yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it is it's it's an experience </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know i'm just a bakery yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like i feel like you have to go there at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> least once to get your british passport </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know that's that's the last test </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because it's it's really weird because i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> didn't realize how </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> unknown greg's was to people outside of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> england right uh because you know we a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> lot of people british people we speak </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about nando's we speak about spoons but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like not a lot of people speak about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> greg's abroad and it's just one of these </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> british things that if you're in england </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you you would have been to a greg's at </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> least once in your life you might not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> always talk about it but it's part of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> being british right right and i didn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> realize this until i came back to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> england and uh and you know everyone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> started asking me if i'd gone to like if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i'd gone back to greg's yet </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's important greg's important thing i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> feel yeah from from what i heard from </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people like i feel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> being british person and not going to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> greg's is like being a japanese person </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and not going to family mod </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like it's like that level of like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know to me like family it's he's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> even more than family mart because you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can find family mart all over asia it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's it's like it's like all over asia </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> family marts in thailand actually </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like i don't know either but this is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> news to me yeah yeah yeah exactly so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it's it's not like a specific it's it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> obviously very japanese like i'm gonna </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> assume it started in japan but it's like </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_02> only available in the uk right and it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's nothing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so there's like a real like british </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_04> didn't realize there were so many </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> different meal deals and like there were </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_04> would be like a person in front of me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> being like all right so here's the meal </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_04> deal that you can get where if you were </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to buy them individually it would cost </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_01> pounds </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> every person at the same time it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i knew it was real [ __ ] as well because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there was like a bunch of people also </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like when they mentioned the tesco meal </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> deal they were like they came up to me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and they were like yeah you know tesco </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> meal deals are amazing but they opted by </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 50p and it's an absolute [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> travesty and i'm just like i wish i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> could feel your anger right now because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it seems very real right there's one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like one minute walk not even one minute </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like it's literally opposite our hotel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh [ __ ] yeah so yeah yeah there's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> usually there was this article in the uk </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> uh that some doctor was calling for meal </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> deals to be banned because they're too </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> unhealthy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really and they're too like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> appealing yeah because they're still </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> feeling because people people just buy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> these like every day for lunch because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's such good value for money and they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> taste [ __ ] amazing but they're really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> bad for you because the sandwiches are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like absolutely like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just stuffed with awful stuff yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it's like a mcdonald's burger it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like you don't want to know what goes in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but you know it tastes so bad it tastes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> good right yeah why does it taste so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> damn good what does ronald put in those </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are exactly the same as all right oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah they're like like you know the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> sandwiches are like not fresh at all but </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> easy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> bro yeah just tapping that card yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like monopoly so like i know the us </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> has contactless japan has contactless </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in the form of suica no no one you can't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> use that like restaurants and stuff </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right it's it's for like other places </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah it is getting better though too </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah because like a lot of i i did </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> notice that a lot of places because like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> in australia as well now it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> everything is just like yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> dude i mean like in the uk now it just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> seems to be that like the default is now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the tapping the credit card yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's way too easy to spend a lot of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> money yeah yeah just something pops up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> you're like i don't even know how much </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> it is [ __ ] tap and then you're like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm broke now [ __ ] because like i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> remember like the the first time like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they they bring that out right and they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just kind of like hand it to you it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i was because i'm so used to doing it in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> japan right so i pulled my phone out to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like get my suitca ready right and i was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> just like nope that's not it that's it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> credit card it's credit card i think you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> could do with your phone now if you had </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the right things yeah right and it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like and and because you know i'm so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> used to like even in japan when you do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like the whole tapping thing yeah like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> not only can you see how much money </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> you've spent but it's also like there's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a little bit of a process right yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like you know kind of get it going but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah in the uk it's literally just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and you're done yeah yeah because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because a lot a lot of the times uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because with contactless here they like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's they have like a specific device </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for contact lists or they'll like show </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you the side with the contactless on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah uh and it's not decided with the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> price on so you don't even know how much </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> is that yeah exactly exactly like i i've </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> realized after coming back this time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they've increased the limit again yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> so when first contactless started coming </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> out i believe the limit was like 20 when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when i was at 20. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then it got really increased to 30 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and then i believe 40. and i was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 80. we we just [ __ ] doubled the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> amount with a single tap of your card </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you can spend 100 bucks you know that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so scary like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i realized how dangerous this was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because at the convention uh i was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> buying i was like buying a round of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> drinks um </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and uh i didn't like i normally in japan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they at least they tell you the price </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right they tell you the price of how </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> much you're spending and here they don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> even tell you the price they just assume </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know the price and they they they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> give you the contact thing and you beep </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it so i i bring back i bring back the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> drinks and i remember one of my friends </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> asked me oh was uh are the drinks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> expensive here and i would just go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i didn't know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> so i feel like yes is the answer but i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> don't know yeah and then and they're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i say i think it's probably expensive </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they'll and they're like no no is it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> london expensive or is it london hotel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> expensive and i was just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> yes yes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> yes either one of those yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> i probably have to ask how much drinks </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are but right now i literally have no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> idea i just tapped my wallet away i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> literally don't know how much i've spent </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> while i've been here just because again </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they don't tell you yeah it's so easy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's literally just like throwing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> monopoly money out true true being like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah cool okay that was easy sweet and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> then it's only when you get back to the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> hotel and you're like oh [ __ ] i wish it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was monopoly money because at least with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> monopoly money you kind of like know how </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> much you're spending you're like you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> know i keep tracking my monopoly money </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i spend it very carefully </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah because it's scary i remember like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because we went to we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we we had a night and we ended up just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like quickly just like as a group mates </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the casino right and so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh we didn't you know we didn't play </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that much but you know i played a little </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bit and i ended up with some some like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> physical money on me at the end of the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> night right and i remember like cashing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> out getting this physical money in my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> wallet and i was like this is useless </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when am i ever going to spend this when </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> am i ever going to spend this physical </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> money that they've given me right and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> because you don't ever need to spend </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like cash at all yeah i noticed yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah so now it's just like a paperweight </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> in my [ __ ] wallet </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_01> success it's not even it's like what am </SPEAKER_01>
