<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - What's wrong? Why would I wanna do this? </connor>

<joey> Welcome back to another episode of the Trash Taste podcast. </joey>
<joey> - I could fucking hear like your gears turning in your brain </joey>
<connor> as you were just like, I gotta think of something. </connor>
<connor> - Hombres? </connor>
<joey> - I gotta think of saying ... </joey>
<garnt> - Hombre! </garnt>
<joey> - Hombre? </joey>
<joey> - Is that the correct pronunciation? </joey>
<connor> - No, I just love saying it like that. </connor>
<joey> It's like saying "Jose" instead of "Ho-se." You know? </joey>
<joey> (chuckling) </joey>
<joey> - Jose! </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Spanish language is quaking. </connor>
<joey> - Josie! </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - So the Pitbull album, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Dale. </connor>
<connor> - Dale? </connor>
<connor> - Dale. </connor>
<connor> - (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> - Dale, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, jala-peno. </connor>
<connor> - Oh god, okay, that one ... </connor>
<connor> - Jala-peno. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, that one I actually kinda ... </connor>
<garnt> - Jala-peno. </garnt>
<garnt> - Jala-penos. </garnt>
<garnt> - But yeah, I am hombre number one </garnt>
<garnt> with hombre number two and three, </garnt>
<garnt> Connor and Garnt. </garnt>
<garnt> - Hey! We're the hombres. </garnt>
<garnt> - Hello. </garnt>
<garnt> - We're the hombres- - For today. </garnt>
<garnt> - And you've just been clickbaited, baby! </garnt>
<garnt> We're not leaving Japan! </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, no, you haven't been clickbaited, </garnt>
<connor> because we are leaving Japan! </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] True. </connor>
<connor> - Technically. In a sense. </connor>
<garnt> In a sense. - Technically speaking. </garnt>
<joey> - If you leave Japan and come back, you still left Japan. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - This just sounds dramatic. </connor>
<connor> - So you weren't clickbaited. </connor>
<joey> You were just tricked. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - No, don't say that Joey! </garnt>
<garnt> - You weren't tricked. You weren't tricked either! </garnt>
<garnt> It's true as well. </garnt>
<connor> It's dramatic, we're just being dramatic. </connor>
<connor> - We may be over-drama ... </connor>
<connor> No, we just dramatized it. </connor>
<connor> We didn't over-dramatize it. </connor>
<garnt> - It's not overly dramatized. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> when you're at a party, </garnt>
<joey> instead of individually going around </joey>
<joey> being like, "I'm heading off now, I'll see you guys later." </joey>
<joey> It's going, "Guys, I'm leaving!" </joey>
<connor> And then walking out. </connor>
<joey> - And I am not returning for a considerable amount of time! </joey>
<garnt> - Yes, which is basically what every YouTuber does! </garnt>
<joey> Like, when someone says, "I'm leaving," </joey>
<garnt> YouTube or something, it's just like, </garnt>
<garnt> oh, someone's burnt out and needs a break. </garnt>
<garnt> Okay, okay, okay. </garnt>
<joey> I get it, I get it. </joey>
<garnt> You need one more like, YouTuber video, </garnt>
<joey> to like, you know, </joey>
<garnt> gain the clicks before you go on your holiday. </garnt>
<joey> - Of course. So this is that YouTube video for Trash Taste. </joey>
<joey> But like, yeah, we'll explain why in a second, </joey>
<garnt> but like, can I, </garnt>
<garnt> I wanna make a quick announcement. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - For myself, if you would let me. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Okay. </garnt>
<joey> - I started my own clothing brand. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, did you actually? </joey>
<joey> - I'm wearing it right now. </joey>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Oh fuck yeah! </garnt>
<garnt> - I was gonna ask, I was like ... what is this? </garnt>
<joey> - So, yeah, I've been working on this for like, a year. </joey>
<garnt> - Right. - Okay, nice! </garnt>
<garnt> - In secret. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh nice! </garnt>
<garnt> - No one knows about it. Until now. </garnt>
<garnt> Like they didn't know about it. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm like, oh, what? </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - So yeah, by the time this episode comes out, </garnt>
<joey> it will be like, pretty much close to launch. </joey>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - So I figured while we're here, </garnt>
<garnt> I'll just announce it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Building up hype. </garnt>
<garnt> - Building up hype. </garnt>
<garnt> - Nice, nice, nice. </garnt>
<joey> - What's the brand called? </joey>
<joey> - It's called Nonsense. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh okay. </garnt>
<joey> I was gonna ask if it's called Fuck That Noise. </joey>
<joey> - It's not called Fuck The Noise. </joey>
<joey> So this is just one of them. </joey>
<joey> Actually, Kai, can you go upstairs and get </joey>
<joey> the other shirt I have? </joey>
<joey> But yeah, so ... </joey>
<garnt> - This episode is sponsored by Joey! </garnt>
<garnt> - This episode is sponsored by me! </garnt>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Are we getting a cut? </joey>
<connor> - You get mates rates. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh okay, all right, okay okay. </garnt>
<garnt> Free (indistinct). </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, free (indistinct). </garnt>
<garnt> - I got it, I got it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, but, </garnt>
<garnt> you know, I figured, </garnt>
<garnt> this would be the perfect opportunity to like, </garnt>
<garnt> announce it, since you guys don't know about it. </garnt>
<joey> Yeah, I have another shirt here. </joey>
<garnt> - What made you decide to start working on a clothing brand? </garnt>
<joey> - I like drip! </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah! </garnt>
<garnt> - You know? And it's like, </garnt>
<garnt> there's a lot of drip I like </garnt>
<garnt> and there's a lot of drip I like wearing, </garnt>
<garnt> but like, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> what better way to flaunt out my drip </garnt>
<garnt> than to just make my own drip. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Just make ... </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, so this is ... </garnt>
<garnt> - Joey's literally went, "I'll do it myself!" </garnt>
<garnt> - I'll do it myself! </garnt>
<garnt> So this is the long tee. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Right. That looks sick. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Ooh, that looks nice! </garnt>
<garnt> - Back design's like this. </garnt>
<joey> - Ooh! - Ooh! </joey>
<garnt> - [Garnt] That looks nice! </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> You can check that out. </connor>
<connor> But yeah! </connor>
<joey> - Damn. - Damn. </joey>
<joey> What a business mogul, dude. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Business mogul. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Very nice. Ooh! Very thin! </joey>
<garnt> - Guys, look at this entrepreneur! </garnt>
<garnt> - I am now, I can call myself an entrepreneur, finally! </garnt>
<joey> - Business starter. </joey>
<connor> You gonna put it in your Twitter bio though? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah yeah. Yeah of course, I have to. </joey>
<connor> - Startup. - Don't do that. </connor>
<joey> Don't do that. </joey>
<joey> - Nonsense founder. </joey>
<garnt> I have to do that! </garnt>
<joey> - Nonsense founder and CEO! </joey>
<garnt> - But yeah, so I've been working on this brand thing </garnt>
<connor> for like a year now. </connor>
<connor> - Sorry. </connor>
<connor> - Great pitch. </connor>
<connor> - That was ... </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> I did not mean for that to be that loud. I'm so sorry. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] But yeah, I've been working on this for like </connor>
<connor> a year now. </connor>
<connor> And you know like, I've always been known to like, </connor>
<connor> you know, wear good clothes, </connor>
<connor> and like, I like you know, fashion. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] I'm privileged. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] I'm privileged. </connor>
<connor> I'm privileged to wear good clothes. </connor>
<connor> But you know, I've always been like, </connor>
<connor> interested in like clothing, </connor>
<connor> like fashion and streetwear, stuff like that, </connor>
<connor> so I was like ... </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - There's so much good streetwear out there. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Mhmm. </connor>
<joey> - But like, nothing that was like, </joey>
<joey> really like speaking to me, personally, right? </joey>
<joey> It's like, there's a lot of good brands and whatnot. </joey>
<joey> But it's like, so I was just like, </joey>
<joey> I'll fuckin' do it myself! </joey>
<connor> I'll make it ... </connor>
<connor> - Was it a pain in the ass? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah! Absolutely it was a pain in the ass! </joey>
<connor> - I haven't done it, so I don't know. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, so like, </connor>
<connor> yeah so it's like a full on proper brand or anything </connor>
<joey> and like, the one thing I was always scared of, </joey>
<joey> right, is like, </joey>
<joey> whenever YouTubers release clothes, </joey>
<joey> it's usually under the merch umbrella, right? </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah yeah yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But like, I didn't want this to be merch. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause it's like, 'cause you know, </joey>
<joey> these designs, and like, </joey>
<joey> all the designs we're gonna be releasing </joey>
<joey> have nothing to do with me </joey>
<joey> or like the likeness of me or anything like that. </joey>
<garnt> I want it to just be like, </garnt>
<garnt> something separate to me. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right. - Right. </garnt>
<joey> - That like, in the case that like, </joey>
<joey> the anime man or whatever </joey>
<joey> just fucking implodes in on itself, right, </joey>
<joey> in a couple years time, </joey>
<joey> that this can still be around. </joey>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - So it's like, I'm already not watching anime. </connor>
<joey> - Exactly! It's already on the dire straits, right? </joey>
<connor> So I was like ... </connor>
<connor> - I'm gonna plan a backup. </connor>
<connor> - Exactly. </connor>
<connor> It's already on the dire straits so I'm like, </connor>
<connor> you know what? </connor>
<connor> Like, I'll try something new. </connor>
<connor> I'll try something, like, challenging. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So yeah. </connor>
<garnt> So by the time this episode is out, like, </garnt>
<garnt> all the social media stuff is probably ready to go. </garnt>
<garnt> - We literally didn't know anything about this, by the way. </garnt>
<garnt> - We didn't know anything. </garnt>
<joey> - This is, you do not understand how hard it was </joey>
<joey> to keep it a secret from these guys. </joey>
<garnt> - I'm like, Joey's kept a secret from us boys? </garnt>
<joey> What's going on? </joey>
<garnt> - Like literally I started this </garnt>
<joey> before we moved to this office. </joey>
<joey> - Are you serious? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, like at the old office. </joey>
<joey> - What? - Wow. </joey>
<joey> - So it's been like, over a year. </joey>
<connor> - Fucking hell! </connor>
<connor> - That I've been working on this. </connor>
<connor> So yeah, I'm very passionate about this, </connor>
<garnt> and I want it to do well, </garnt>
<garnt> and I hope you guys like it. </garnt>
<garnt> - I have so many questions! </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know where to start. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's all, everything is designed by me as well. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, all sketched by me and everything. </garnt>
<joey> I obviously got designers and everything </joey>
<joey> to like, clean it up and everything, </joey>
<joey> but like, all the designs are done by me. </joey>
<connor> And yeah, I hope people like it, </connor>
<connor> so check out Nonsense. </connor>
<connor> We're gonna be doing this thing </connor>
<connor> where we release a new design every month. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Okay, okay. </connor>
<connor> - One new design a month. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I thought like, </connor>
<connor> originally I was like, </connor>
<connor> should I do like the usual thing where it's like, </connor>
<joey> oh, I drop, you know, </joey>
<joey> like a collection, </joey>
<joey> like a summer collection or a winter collection. </joey>
<joey> But I was like, nah, </joey>
<joey> I'm selling it to people on the internet </joey>
<garnt> and the people on the internet </garnt>
<garnt> have the fucking attention span of a goldfish, </garnt>
<garnt> so I'm like, let's just like, </garnt>
<garnt> keep bringing stuff out, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Keep the drip dripping. </garnt>
<connor> - Exactly! Keep that tap just slightly open </connor>
<joey> so that the water's just constantly dripping, you know? </joey>
<connor> Rather than keeping it closed and then suddenly being like, </connor>
<joey> "Here you go!" </joey>
<connor> So yeah, that's the plans for it. </connor>
<connor> Obviously I'm not like, you know, </connor>
<joey> fucking quitting anything else. </joey>
<joey> This is just like another thing I'm doing on the side, so. </joey>
<joey> Hey, if you like it, </joey>
<connor> then check it out, I guess. </connor>
<joey> And then hopefully preorders will start soon. </joey>
<connor> - Was there anything that was surprisingly difficult </connor>
<connor> while making your own clothing brand? </connor>
<joey> That caught you off guard? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, like, well for one, </joey>
<joey> like, you know, </joey>
<connor> everything's designed by me, but like, </connor>
<connor> I can't do like graphic design. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah, of course. </connor>
<joey> - Or you know like, I can't do like, </joey>
<connor> logo design and stuff like that, right? </connor>
<connor> So like, even just coming up with like, </connor>
<connor> you know, just like the font and stuff like that </connor>
<joey> for Nonsense, and like, </joey>
<joey> I don't know if the logo is anywhere. </joey>
<joey> But like, yeah, like you know, </joey>
<joey> just something like that, right? </joey>
<garnt> Like even just coming up with like, </garnt>
<joey> that font, took me like two months. </joey>
<garnt> - Well that's why graphic designers are like, a job, right? </garnt>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - I basically just described what a graphic designer is. </joey>
<connor> - You're like, damn, this shit hard! </connor>
<joey> There already a job? </joey>
<connor> There already a job for this? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah! Right, because like, you know, </connor>
<garnt> I'm not used to that with like video creating, right? </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, usually it's like, </garnt>
<joey> nine times out of 10, </joey>
<joey> I think of an idea, </joey>
<joey> and then I try and make it work </joey>
<joey> and then whatever I have, you know, </joey>
<joey> I have to work with, right? </joey>
<joey> Especially with the kind of content I make. </joey>
<joey> So it's like, you know, </joey>
<joey> even if it's not like, perfect perfect, </joey>
<joey> I have to get something out there, right? </joey>
<joey> Otherwise I won't, you know, </joey>
<joey> I'll have the fuckin' upload schedule of, </joey>
<joey> you know, 2015 Garnt, essentially. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> - So it's like, but like, </joey>
<joey> with this, I have to like, </joey>
<joey> really be careful with it. </joey>
<joey> Because I don't wanna get a design out there </joey>
<joey> and it just looks like shit. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - You know? Because it's like, </joey>
<joey> my brand is on the line, essentially. </joey>
<garnt> - How many fonts did you have to go through? </garnt>
<joey> - Uh, like ... </joey>
<joey> Well I mean, for one, </joey>
<garnt> like the actual, the official font for the brand </garnt>
<garnt> is completely custom. </garnt>
<garnt> So I had to get like a typographer. </garnt>
<garnt> Not a graphic designer, a typographer, </garnt>
<joey> I had to find a typographer, </joey>
<joey> to be like, and like a font specialist, </joey>
<connor> to be like, "Here's the brand. </connor>
<connor> Here's what the brand is about. </connor>
<connor> Here's the kind of designs I want. </connor>
<connor> Can you come up with just like, a shitload of fonts?" </connor>
<connor> And we literally went through about 100 fonts </connor>
<joey> and just decided, that's the one we want. </joey>
<garnt> - Because the thing about fonts is that </garnt>
<garnt> it's something that, like, </garnt>
<joey> most people don't really appreciate or think about. </joey>
<joey> Until you have to choose one. </joey>
<connor> Like I remember like, </connor>
<connor> just having to choose one just to use for my like, </connor>
<joey> my YouTube videos, or just like- </joey>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah, right? </connor>
<joey> - A logo or something, and I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> where the fuck do I even start? </joey>
<garnt> And then you go through like the Photoshop like, font, </garnt>
<garnt> and you like realize ... </garnt>
<garnt> - Just Calibri, innit? </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - Just Light Arial. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> And then you talk to graph- </garnt>
<garnt> - Sans serif? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. And then you talk to graphic designers </garnt>
<garnt> and they're just like, they're just like built different. </garnt>
<garnt> They see a font and they can like, name the font. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. They can name the font, </joey>
<garnt> they can name like, the exact kerning between like, </garnt>
<connor> each of the fonts. - Yeah, I know right! </connor>
<connor> - They're like, "That's like an eight kerning right there." </connor>
<connor> It's like, what the fuck is all this? </connor>
<connor> - I don't even know what that means. </connor>
<connor> - Kerning is like the space between letters. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, okay okay. </connor>
<connor> - So like, I got like a, </connor>
<connor> you know, working with like a typographer and everything, </connor>
<connor> like I gained like a whole new appreciation for like, </connor>
<connor> graphic design and typography, 'cause like, </connor>
<connor> that shit's hard as fuck! </connor>
<connor> And I can see why! </connor>
<connor> You know like, in the case of like this for example, like, </connor>
<connor> just changing the spacing, </connor>
<connor> the kerning between each of the letters, </connor>
<connor> makes like a completely different design. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And you wouldn't think otherwise, though, </connor>
<connor> when you make like a YouTube thumbnail, right? </connor>
<connor> Yeah, just fucking put the font there </connor>
<connor> and you're good! </connor>
<connor> - Right. - Right, kinda thing. </connor>
<garnt> So it's like, it made me appreciate like, </garnt>
<garnt> subtle design. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - If anything. </garnt>
<garnt> And like, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> because I'm kinda going with like, </garnt>
<garnt> kind of a combination between like </garnt>
<garnt> streetwear but also loungewear. </garnt>
<joey> - [Garnt] Right. </joey>
<joey> - So like, you can wear this like, </joey>
<joey> outside of course, and you know, it'd be great. </joey>
<joey> But you can also, </joey>
<joey> it's comfortable enough where you can wear it inside. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - As well, so for you weebs out there </joey>
<joey> that don't go outside, you can still wear it! </joey>
<connor> - This is like the longest Trash Taste ad we've ever done. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - This is an ad that's not an ad that is an ad. </garnt>
<joey> It's not an ad. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I'm sponsoring myself right now. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah no, because like, </joey>
<joey> you know, talking about like, </joey>
<garnt> fonts and having to choose fonts and just like </garnt>
<garnt> being thrown into a world that you just </garnt>
<garnt> don't understand sometimes, </garnt>
<garnt> that you never knew that, you know, </garnt>
<connor> there was this much thought into it. </connor>
<connor> Like I remember like recently, </connor>
<connor> this is like going off on a tangent, </connor>
<connor> but I remember recently, </connor>
<connor> I've just got like, </connor>
<connor> had like a binge. </connor>
<garnt> Not really a binge, but just like, </garnt>
<garnt> had my recommended taken over by these </garnt>
<garnt> really weird keyboard ASMR videos? </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know, I don't know if you guys </garnt>
<garnt> know what I'm talking about. </garnt>
<joey> - I think I've seen a couple of them, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I know what you're talking about. </joey>
<garnt> - Because how I basically discovered it </garnt>
<garnt> was just this random keyboard video, right? </garnt>
<garnt> And I was just like, why is there a keyboard video </garnt>
<joey> of just someone typing on my timeline? </joey>
<joey> So I click on it, just, </joey>
<joey> because I think the video title was </joey>
<joey> "Just listen to the sound of this keyboard," </joey>
<joey> or something like that, right? </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right. Yeah, right. </joey>
<connor> - And it was just like him, like, </connor>
<connor> or like, him or her, </connor>
<connor> like just pressing the keys, right? </connor>
<connor> And just, and the title was, </connor>
<connor> "Just listen to the space bar," right? </connor>
<garnt> And it's pressing the keys, right? </garnt>
<garnt> And then you go to the space bar. </garnt>
<garnt> And it just sounded like a space bar. </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, "It's just a space bar!" </garnt>
<garnt> And then I go to the comments section </garnt>
<garnt> to be like, "What's going on?" </garnt>
<garnt> And all of the comments were just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "I was having a nice time </garnt>
<garnt> until you pressed the space bar. </garnt>
<garnt> And then I vomited." </garnt>
<garnt> And it was just like, </garnt>
<garnt> the vomit emotes or something like that, </garnt>
<joey> and I was just like, </joey>
<garnt> I've never been put into a world </garnt>
<garnt> that I just did not understand. </garnt>
<joey> - Well, I mean like, </joey>
<joey> I kinda felt that when, </joey>
<joey> I think it was Connor, right? </joey>
<garnt> Who got like, I think one of your fans made like </garnt>
<garnt> a custom keyboard for Connor, right? </garnt>
<garnt> But then they also, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> with the custom keyboard, which looked sick as fuck, </garnt>
<connor> there was also this like, other smaller keyboard, </connor>
<connor> where you could test out ... </connor>
<connor> - Oh, that was Garnt's. - Oh, that was me. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, that was Garnt? Okay. </connor>
<connor> Where it was like a smaller keyboard </connor>
<garnt> where you could test out all the different types of keys </garnt>
<garnt> and like hammers, and I was just like, </garnt>
<joey> what's the difference? </joey>
<joey> They are, like, I touched all of them and I was like ... </joey>
<joey> Half of these sound the fucking same. </joey>
<connor> - I think they, as someone who's like using </connor>
<joey> one of the expensive keyboards, </joey>
<joey> 'cause, only 'cause it was given to me. </joey>
<joey> I would never have gone out my way and paid that much. </joey>
<joey> To me it was all the same. </joey>
<joey> Now I get it 'cause I use it. </joey>
<joey> Before I didn't understand what the difference was. </joey>
<garnt> But I really like the smoothness, </garnt>
<garnt> and like the subtle clicks. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, now that I've watched ... </garnt>
<connor> - It's a very slight click, but it's really nice. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, now that I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> like 20 keyboard videos down, </garnt>
<garnt> I kinda get it. </garnt>
<joey> There's like a nice ... there's like ... </joey>
<joey> It's like the thonk sound, right? </joey>
<joey> It's the thonk sound where it's ... </joey>
<joey> - Do you though? Or have you just been </joey>
<garnt> conditioned to understand it? </garnt>
<connor> - Maybe I've just been conditioned! </connor>
<joey> I feel like ... </joey>
<joey> - Listen, I'm one of you. </joey>
<garnt> Cherry MX Brown Switches can suck my dick, there you go. </garnt>
<garnt> Welcome keyboard enthusiasts. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I'm like ... </garnt>
<garnt> - The cherry switches, I can actually tell, </garnt>
<joey> they fucking suck now. </joey>
<connor> I used to have it. </connor>
<joey> - Was it, wait, like why? Why? </joey>
<connor> - It sounds like a car crashing </connor>
<connor> every time you fucking press it in. </connor>
<connor> It's so goddamn loud and clicky. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh, you mean like the clicky one? </garnt>
<garnt> - Super super clicky one. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, fuck those ones. </garnt>
<garnt> Fuck, they, like I had one, </garnt>
<connor> in my old office in the UK, </connor>
<connor> and since I went back to the UK, I like, I had it. </connor>
<connor> - It's probably the Cherry Brown MX switches. </connor>
<connor> They're like the cheapest ... </connor>
<connor> - I think it's like the Cherry Blue MX switches. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Oh okay okay. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah yeah. </connor>
<connor> The Gatreon ones? </connor>
<connor> The Gatreon is like, Gatreon's where it's at, man. </connor>
<connor> - I've got the Gatreon Black Ink ones. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh, that's a good one. </garnt>
<garnt> That's a good one. </garnt>
<connor> - And like, it's like, oh it's fucking good. </connor>
<connor> It's fucking good, dude. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I really like the Gatreon, like, </garnt>
<connor> milk yellow, I believe? </connor>
<connor> It's literally called something milk, </connor>
<connor> because it like, it just has this like, </connor>
<garnt> nice little thonk to it, </garnt>
<garnt> and it's nice, it's like ASMR, right? </garnt>
<garnt> So just, it's so smooth, </garnt>
<garnt> and it's so, it's milky! </garnt>
<joey> And it's like milky! </joey>
<joey> - It just sounds like (indistinct). </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - The guy ... </joey>
<garnt> - What the fuck are you talking about? </garnt>
<garnt> - He told me like what lube he used. </garnt>
<garnt> And I was like ... </garnt>
<connor> I don't need to know what you jacked off with, </connor>
<connor> but I mean I appreciate it. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, so to explain, </garnt>
<connor> like I'm also getting a custom keyboard made </connor>
<connor> because a fan messaged me. </connor>
<connor> But I like ... </connor>
<garnt> - Dude, I mean like, </garnt>
<connor> I did pay for this thing. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, so he was like, </connor>
<garnt> "Oh, do you wanna get a keyboard made for you?" </garnt>
<garnt> And it's in the process of being made. </garnt>
<garnt> And I was just like, "Yeah, sure!" </garnt>
<garnt> Thinking that he was just going, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> he was just going to send something that he recommended. </garnt>
<garnt> And he was like, "No, we're gonna do the entire process." </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like what kinda keyboard do you want? </garnt>
<garnt> Do you want like a 100%? Do you want a 75%? </garnt>
<garnt> Do you want like a 50%? </garnt>
<garnt> And I was just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "What? You are saying numbers right now. </garnt>
<garnt> It's a keyboard. What are you talking about?" </garnt>
<connor> - I'll have a full 100% keyboard. </connor>
<connor> I want a keyboard, and I want every part there. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, why would I only need 75% of the keyboard? </joey>
<joey> Gimme the whole thing! </joey>
<connor> - I don't like the number pad and all that shit on the side. </connor>
<connor> I don't. </connor>
<joey> - I used to not care, </joey>
<joey> but now that I have a keyboard </joey>
<joey> that doesn't have a number pad, </joey>
<connor> I understand why it's unnecessary to have it. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I realized until it was gone, </connor>
<joey> I never fucking used it. </joey>
<connor> - I know some people who like, go ham on it, </connor>
<joey> and like, good for you. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, good for you. </joey>
<garnt> But I'm out here, I'm totally fine with the top thing. </garnt>
<garnt> Also, I just wanna save room! </garnt>
<garnt> - I use the number pad. </garnt>
<connor> - Okay. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. Mostly because when you ... </garnt>
<garnt> - All right Boomer. - Huh? </garnt>
<garnt> - All right Boomer. </garnt>
<garnt> - Just ... mostly, it's useful, </garnt>
<garnt> because it's, all the numbers are just close together! </garnt>
<garnt> - No, I agree. </garnt>
<connor> I recognize it's the superior way to handle numbers. </connor>
<connor> - It is. It is. </connor>
<connor> - But I just (indistinct). </connor>
<connor> - With the amount of like, </connor>
<garnt> two factor authentication I have, </garnt>
<joey> you know what I mean? </joey>
<garnt> Like, I'm constantly using it! </garnt>
<garnt> - It's not that long! </garnt>
<garnt> - It is! It is! It is. </garnt>
<garnt> - This ... there you go. </garnt>
<garnt> - Although, I definitely had a moment where like, </garnt>
<garnt> you know, I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> you know, I should probably start using the number pad </garnt>
<garnt> on my old keyboard, because it's there. </garnt>
<garnt> But then I had a moment where I was just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Damn, it's so hard to use with my left hand." </garnt>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> And I was just like doing this and I'm like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, maybe I should just take my hand off the mouse </joey>
<joey> and just do this." </joey>
<joey> - Oh, I thought you were like ... </joey>
<joey> - I was like, oh, why is it not on the left side? </joey>
<joey> It'd be so much easier! </joey>
<joey> But then I was like, oh, </joey>
<joey> I could just let go of the mouse, </joey>
<joey> and perhaps just do this. </joey>
<garnt> - I thought you were implying like </garnt>
<garnt> your right hand was like, on your dick or something. </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] Oh, like jacking off? </joey>
<garnt> - You're like jacking off and you're like, </garnt>
<garnt> (indistinct) my credit card details. </garnt>
<joey> (indistinct) </joey>
<joey> - When I'm like, jacking off while like, playing Run. </joey>
<connor> Like just ... </connor>
<connor> - I mean, if you're like an accountant or something, right? </connor>
<joey> You gotta be pressing numbers all day, </joey>
<joey> then it obviously makes sense. - True, true! </joey>
<joey> - But like, for normal guys ... </joey>
<connor> - Like, I should be used to that layout as well </connor>
<connor> because it's like, you know, </connor>
<connor> every calculator is that layout, right? </connor>
<connor> So it's like, why is it so hard for me to use </connor>
<joey> when it's on a keyboard? </joey>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - Even though on a calculator it's like, </joey>
<garnt> basically second nature. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, like, I mean, </joey>
<garnt> the reason I like the number pad </garnt>
<garnt> is because buying a lot of things online </garnt>
<garnt> you gotta enter your credit card number a lot. </garnt>
<connor> Log into your bank account details. </connor>
<connor> - How much shit are you buying? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah! </garnt>
<connor> - It is like, actually beneficial to have that </connor>
<connor> real estate taken up. </connor>
<garnt> - Um, like, I don't know, </garnt>
<garnt> like, I just have enough ... </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like I use it a lot, </garnt>
<garnt> because sometimes I need to log into my bank, and you know, </garnt>
<garnt> when you're entering purely just numbers </garnt>
<garnt> and it's not like a password, </garnt>
<garnt> that's when the number pad is useful. </garnt>
<garnt> And like, when you're like, </garnt>
<garnt> entering the numbers on a line- </garnt>
<connor> - Marginally, though. </connor>
<garnt> Marginally useful. </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like ... </garnt>
<garnt> - Mr. Optimization! </garnt>
<connor> I thought you'd be one of me, man! </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> I thought you'd be one of me! </garnt>
<garnt> - Listen, you're trying to optimize two things at once. </garnt>
<garnt> How fast can you type stuff in, </garnt>
<joey> but also the space in your desk, you know? </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right, right. </joey>
<joey> - I got a lot of like, shit on my desk, </joey>
<joey> 'cause you know, 'cause I got like, </joey>
<garnt> god knows how many, </garnt>
<garnt> I got like two audio interfaces. </garnt>
<connor> I got a bunch of other cables. </connor>
<garnt> - I will admit, the aesthetic looks better </garnt>
<connor> without the number pad. </connor>
<garnt> But it's, the aesthetic looks better, but ... </garnt>
<garnt> - Also, travels easier. </garnt>
<garnt> You know, tryna put a number, </garnt>
<garnt> you can put like a, what are they called? </garnt>
<garnt> Are they 75%? Half keyboards? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, 75%, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - 75% keyboard, you can put that in a backpack. </garnt>
<connor> You can't put a full one in your bag. </connor>
<connor> That's too big. </connor>
<connor> Why would you ... </connor>
<connor> Sometimes you're going somewhere, </connor>
<connor> I mean you're going to a LAN event or something. </connor>
<connor> Not that I do anymore, but. </connor>
<joey> - When was the last time you went to a LAN event? </joey>
<connor> - University. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah! </joey>
<joey> I think it was like high school for me. </joey>
<joey> - But also like, you know, </joey>
<joey> what if you don't like the keyboard on your laptop. </joey>
<joey> I get it, 'cause sometimes the laptop keyboards suck, </joey>
<joey> and then you wanna bring one with you </joey>
<joey> if you're gonna be like, having your remote setup. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right. </joey>
<joey> - Packing like a full size keyboard in a backpack </joey>
<joey> is a pain in the ass. </joey>
<joey> - I've never been that desperate. </joey>
<joey> I've never been like, every time I've touched the </joey>
<joey> laptop keyboard ... </joey>
<joey> - You don't realize how good having like, </joey>
<connor> things smaller and taking up less space is. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah but like, it's not, </connor>
<connor> like my laptop keyboard isn't so fucking detrimental to me </connor>
<connor> where I'm like, "I gotta pack another keyboard!" </connor>
<joey> You know? Like ... </joey>
<connor> - It's about the ergonomics! </connor>
<garnt> - You are saying that you'd rather pack a keyboard </garnt>
<garnt> without a number pad than just use the laptop keyboard? </garnt>
<garnt> That makes less sense! </garnt>
<garnt> That makes less sense! </garnt>
<garnt> - No it doesn't! </garnt>
<garnt> - That is the opposite of optimization! </garnt>
<garnt> - You're taking up more space now! </garnt>
<garnt> You're taking up more space! </garnt>
<garnt> - If I'm having like a remote setup, right? </garnt>
<garnt> I'm going to a place, I'm gonna be streaming, </garnt>
<connor> I'm gonna be playing games. </connor>
<joey> I don't wanna play games on the laptop keyboard. </joey>
<joey> - Just bring a controller! </joey>
<joey> - Can bring a controller, </joey>
<joey> but some games don't use controllers! </joey>
<joey> - Well then don't play those games! </joey>
<garnt> - Okay, well, but I wanna play these games, Joe! </garnt>
<joey> You're just being pedantic now for no reason! </joey>
<joey> - Just play a game that you can use the controller! </joey>
<joey> - I know for a fact I'm not alone. </joey>
<joey> I've seen people do this so many times. </joey>
<garnt> People don't wanna use the fucking keyboard on the laptop </garnt>
<garnt> for like eight hours. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm sure you're not alone, </garnt>
<garnt> but it's (indistinct). </garnt>
<connor> - There's so many people who do this! </connor>
<garnt> This is not weird! </garnt>
<garnt> - I've never gotten to the point where, okay, </garnt>
<garnt> I have a remote setup, right? </garnt>
<garnt> A remote setup is not like your permanent setup, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - But if I really really really need a keyboard, </connor>
<connor> I'd just buy like a fucking five dollar keyboard </connor>
<connor> or something like that, you know? </connor>
<connor> Like, it's ... </connor>
<connor> - No, 'cause then you may as well use the laptop one, </connor>
<connor> you know what I'm saying? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, no, like, </garnt>
<garnt> if I really really wanted like a remote ... </garnt>
<connor> Like a remote setup, but like ... </connor>
<garnt> - It's just about the ergonomics, you know? </garnt>
<connor> Like using a laptop keyboard for hours, </connor>
<connor> like actually fucking hurts your wrists. </connor>
<joey> - Using a keyboard for hours hurts my wrists. </joey>
<connor> That's why I try and use a controller for every game! </connor>
<joey> - Like a nice keyboard, </joey>
<joey> you know, good ergonomics, </joey>
<joey> doesn't hurt your wrists. </joey>
<joey> - [Man] You bring the rest as well. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah yeah yeah. </joey>
<joey> You got the rest too? </joey>
<joey> Laptops don't have rests! </joey>
<joey> You know, my laptop, it's amazing, right? </joey>
<joey> But I have to like, </joey>
<connor> it's just, there's no support or anything, </connor>
<joey> I'm just putting my hand ... </joey>
<joey> - I'll just bring the fucking rest then! </joey>
<connor> - I just feel like ... </connor>
<connor> - I mean you gotta put it down </connor>
<connor> on like the fucking trackpad and shit. </connor>
<garnt> It's kind of in the way, it's kind of annoying. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, it just doesn't work! It doesn't work. </garnt>
<garnt> - I just feel like the entire point ... </garnt>
<garnt> - Thank god someone in the office understands this point. </garnt>
<connor> - I just think like, </connor>
<connor> the whole point of a laptop is to be portable. </connor>
<connor> - No, it is! </connor>
<joey> - Like, and ... </joey>
<connor> - But what's? </connor>
<garnt> - At that point you might as well just </garnt>
<garnt> bring a monitor as well! </garnt>
<garnt> - But if the keyboard fits in the bag, it's portable! </garnt>
<garnt> You know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> Like, you can't bring a (indistinct). </garnt>
<garnt> The reason why a laptop's portable </garnt>
<garnt> is 'cause it's not a giant fucking case, </garnt>
<joey> not 'cause the keyboard is like, on it. </joey>
<joey> That's like, one of the reasons. </joey>
<joey> If I'm whipping it out in a cafe, </joey>
<joey> yeah, I'm gonna use the laptop keyboard. </joey>
<joey> I'm replying to emails, it's not a big deal. </joey>
<joey> If I'm streaming or gaming, I want a fucking keyboard. </joey>
<connor> - But in, how are you like, </connor>
<garnt> if you're at the point where you're </garnt>
<garnt> bringing a portable setup, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Of like, in which, </garnt>
<garnt> tell me this hypothetical situation </garnt>
<garnt> where you need to set up an entire stream setup. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I'll tell you, it's not just a fucking laptop </garnt>
<garnt> you need to bring. </garnt>
<garnt> If you're bringing your entire fucking stream setup, </garnt>
<garnt> how much are you bringing? </garnt>
<connor> Like, what are you bringing? </connor>
<connor> - Well, when I went to the UK last time </connor>
<connor> I brought it with me. </connor>
<joey> You know? You just bring, </joey>
<joey> 'cause if I wanna film some anyway, </joey>
<joey> I'd bring a camera, anyway. </joey>
<joey> The camera has two uses. </joey>
<joey> I can film other stuff. </joey>
<joey> - Do you bring lights? </joey>
<joey> - No, I don't bring lights. </joey>
<joey> You don't need lights. </joey>
<joey> You know, you can figure out lighting. </joey>
<joey> It's not a big issue. </joey>
<joey> It's just having a good camera, a good mic. </joey>
<garnt> And then if you wanna play games or shit, </garnt>
<garnt> you bring a keyboard and a mouse! </garnt>
<garnt> You're not gonna fucking use the trackpad, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - No, you're not gonna use the trackpad. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] You're not gonna use the trackpad, but ... </garnt>
<garnt> - A trackpad is like, totally different than a mouse, right? </garnt>
<connor> - Right right, but I mean, </connor>
<connor> if you have a 75% keyboard, it's not that big. </connor>
<garnt> - But then like, another thing is like, </garnt>
<garnt> are you still gaming on the laptop, </garnt>
<garnt> or do you have like a monitor that you're using as well? </garnt>
<connor> - On the laptop's fine. </connor>
<connor> The screen I have on my laptop's pretty good. </connor>
<joey> - Well that's not very ergonomic, is it? </joey>
<joey> - Of course it is! </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause you're fucking going like this! </joey>
<joey> - No dude! My desk's over there, </joey>
<joey> my other keyboard's here, </joey>
<joey> this one's there, it's further away. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause just, I have more room now </joey>
<joey> 'cause the keyboard's not attached to the thing </joey>
<joey> so I can place the screen where I want it to </joey>
<joey> so it is ergonomic. </joey>
<joey> - Is it me or does this just sound very pretentious? </joey>
<connor> - No, this is not! </connor>
<garnt> This is, if I wanna like, </garnt>
<garnt> do a fucking setup! </garnt>
<garnt> - If you wanna go portability, </garnt>
<garnt> why not go for a 50% keyboard then? </garnt>
<garnt> Or? </garnt>
<connor> - A 50%? </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Or a 25. </joey>
<joey> - Or 30%. </joey>
<joey> - I didn't even know what 50%, what is a 50%? </joey>
<connor> How can you remove less? </connor>
<garnt> - There is ... you would be surprised! </garnt>
<connor> You would be surprised, okay? </connor>
<connor> - What are we removing? </connor>
<connor> - [Man] Smaller keys. </connor>
<garnt> - Smaller keys. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well no, I won't be able to press it! </garnt>
<garnt> I already have fat fingers, dude. </garnt>
<connor> I need to like ... </connor>
<joey> - Why don't you just invent a keyboard which is just </joey>
<connor> the space bar and the arrow keys? </connor>
<connor> - I don't, who uses the arrow keys? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Well, if you're playing games on a keyboard ... </connor>
<connor> - WASD, dude! </connor>
<joey> - Okay, or WASD. </joey>
<connor> - I want all the letters! </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> I gotta fucking type! </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, use the fucking laptop typing! </joey>
<joey> - [Man] So the thing with 50% boards, </joey>
<joey> you don't have like the numbers on top. </joey>
<connor> - Right right. - Yeah yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I think gaming you need the numbers. </connor>
<joey> - [Man] Yeah, you need the numbers! </joey>
<connor> - Like, it is really not that hard </connor>
<garnt> to bring a 75% keyboard in your bag or in your suitcase. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's also not hard to just bring a fucking controller. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like half of a pizza box! </garnt>
<garnt> You know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> It's like not even, it's tiny! </garnt>
<garnt> It doesn't take up room! </garnt>
<garnt> And your clothes are the padding! </garnt>
<garnt> This isn't hard! Why is this so crazy to you? </garnt>
<garnt> It's like I'm bringing a fucking like, </garnt>
<garnt> pet dog in my bag. </garnt>
<garnt> Why is this so unbelievable? </garnt>
<garnt> - It just sounds- </garnt>
<garnt> - Because it's just like, at that point, </garnt>
<garnt> at that point where you are bringing ... </garnt>
<garnt> - No! </garnt>
<garnt> - No, at that point where you're bringing a streaming setup, </garnt>
<garnt> a number pad is not that much more surface area. </garnt>
<garnt> Okay? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, but what I'm saying is like, </connor>
<connor> that's just unnecessary. </connor>
<connor> Like in general. </connor>
<connor> Like in any keyboard setup. </connor>
<joey> - Just put the fucking keyboard in your checkin! </joey>
<garnt> - Technically if you get a 50% keyboard, </garnt>
<garnt> you're removing unnecessary keys, right? You know? </garnt>
<garnt> That's the entire ... </garnt>
<connor> - No it's not! </connor>
<connor> 75% is like the perfect key experience! </connor>
<garnt> - It's called a preference, Connor! </garnt>
<garnt> It's called a preference, okay? </garnt>
<connor> - Okay look, I would argue, right? </connor>
<connor> The reason why 75% is no different from the 100% </connor>
<connor> is 'cause you don't lose anything, right? </connor>
<connor> You just have numbers twice. </connor>
<connor> I don't need numbers twice. </connor>
<connor> I just need numbers once! </connor>
<joey> This is not, why is this, </joey>
<joey> like you're saying like, </joey>
<joey> removing the second number pad </joey>
<joey> is not equal to being like, </joey>
<joey> "Get rid of half of the alphabet!" </joey>
<joey> This is not the fucking same at all! </joey>
<joey> I can't believe this is an argument you're making! </joey>
<joey> - I don't know, man. </joey>
<joey> - [Man] Imagine in a hotel you're stuck for a week. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah yeah! </garnt>
<connor> - [Man] You want the TV screen to be your second monitor. </connor>
<connor> You leave your laptop there, </connor>
<garnt> and you can sit at your bed with your wireless 75%. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah! Every hotel, every Airbnb has a TV! </connor>
<garnt> - I do not pack a keyboard wherever I go. </garnt>
<connor> - That's fine! But why are you clowning on me? </connor>
<connor> This is not like a clown thing to do! </connor>
<connor> This is a normal thing! </connor>
<joey> - It just sounds incredibly pretentious and tedious to me. </joey>
<connor> - How is it pretentious? What? </connor>
<joey> 'Cause I wanna bring a keyboard? </joey>
<joey> - Let me just get my 75% keyboard out. </joey>
<connor> - No no no, because everyone works differently! </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah, I know. </connor>
<connor> - Like I can't go to a Starbucks and work. </connor>
<connor> Like that's not, I'd be like, why? </connor>
<garnt> It's so pretentious, Garnt, </garnt>
<garnt> if you go to a Starbucks to type, you know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> Like, just work from home. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Specifically a Starbucks. </garnt>
<connor> - Specifically! </connor>
<connor> - Like, I don't see how this is pretentious! </connor>
<connor> I'm losing my mind over this argument. </connor>
<garnt> - No no, it's the way that you're framing it as like, </garnt>
<garnt> "This is the superior way to type. </garnt>
<garnt> This is the only keyboard that works. </garnt>
<garnt> Number pads, irrelevant. Unnecessary." </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, they are unnecessary! </garnt>
<garnt> - Number pads fell off. </garnt>
<garnt> - All I'm saying is, you have your preference, </garnt>
<garnt> I like using a number pad </garnt>
<garnt> because I use it enough functionally </garnt>
<connor> for me to be able to justify that </connor>
<connor> it is a convenience for me! </connor>
<connor> All right? I like number pads! </connor>
<garnt> - Right, but how did this get to me being clowned on </garnt>
<joey> for bringing keyboards with a laptop? </joey>
<connor> How did this get ... </connor>
<connor> - It's Trash Taste, baby! </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - That's not the reason you were clowning on me, Garnt! </connor>
<connor> The reason you were tryna clown on me </connor>
<connor> is 'cause I brought a keyboard places. </connor>
<joey> - 'Cause it's funny, that's why! </joey>
<garnt> - It's a lot, okay? </garnt>
<garnt> It's a lot. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just like, there is ... </garnt>
<garnt> I understand it's a preference, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> I understand it is a preference </garnt>
<garnt> that you want to bring your keyboard. </garnt>
<connor> - Have you never thought like, </connor>
<connor> when you were like, trying to play games, </connor>
<garnt> aren't you like, "Why are my hands </garnt>
<garnt> so fucking close to the screen?" </garnt>
<garnt> - No. </garnt>
<connor> Because here's the thing, like, </connor>
<joey> I don't really ... I'm not a gamer. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah! You have to understand, we're not gamers. </garnt>
<connor> We're not gamers like you! </connor>
<joey> - Right, right! </joey>
<joey> So why don't you just say that in the first place </joey>
<joey> instead of pretending like you were? </joey>
<joey> - I never pretended like I was! </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause ... </joey>
<joey> - I told you what I'm using the keyboard for </joey>
<garnt> and then you're like, "No, that doesn't make sense." </garnt>
<garnt> - Well you're streaming, right? </garnt>
<connor> I also have a portable streaming setup, </connor>
<connor> but I just don't need a keyboard for it. </connor>
<joey> - I just, yeah, </joey>
<joey> I don't think to myself, "I can't game without this." </joey>
<joey> - I am a (indistinct) in League of Legends. </joey>
<joey> I have a 1% keyboard. </joey>
<joey> It's the R key, okay? </joey>
<garnt> That's, like you know, like ... </garnt>
<joey> - I just, like if I need to game while I'm out and about, </joey>
<joey> I just bring a fucking controller </joey>
<joey> and just play games that use a controller. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah but like, what if someone's like, </connor>
<connor> oh, do you wanna, </connor>
<connor> you've arranged a game with someone. </connor>
<connor> The game doesn't have a controller. </connor>
<joey> - Then I'll use the keyboard. </joey>
<connor> I'm not gonna fuckin' have a hissy fit over it </connor>
<connor> and be like, "Where's my 75%?" </connor>
<connor> - I wouldn't have a hissy fit! </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I would have brought it fucking with me! </connor>
<joey> So there wouldn't have been a hissy fit. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, but what if you didn't? </joey>
<joey> - I always bring it with me! </joey>
<garnt> It's not happening- </garnt>
<joey> - That's just a waste of space! </joey>
<garnt> - It's not a waste of space! </garnt>
<garnt> It's fit, it's small! </garnt>
<joey> How is a keyboard a waste of space? </joey>
<joey> What? </joey>
<joey> - I don't know, I've ... </joey>
<joey> - Always fucking arguing. </joey>
<connor> I just feel like you guys are just being pedantic. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, 'cause it's funny. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean I feel like the argument is, </garnt>
<garnt> are you a gamer or are you not a gamer, you know? </garnt>
<joey> - You are 100% gamer, we're only ... </joey>
<joey> - Even if I was doing work, you know? </joey>
<joey> I wanna write a lot of emails and stuff, </joey>
<joey> to the point of like, </joey>
<connor> if I'm doing a lot of work, you know, </connor>
<joey> I'm typing for a few hours, </joey>
<connor> like yeah, I'm just gonna bring my own. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause like, for me it's like, </connor>
<connor> I will be so much less efficient </connor>
<connor> using the laptop one, </connor>
<connor> 'cause I just wanna be comfortable. </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<connor> I mean, I'm ... okay. </connor>
<connor> That is just purely just </connor>
<garnt> you looking for any like, I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> Like ... </garnt>
<garnt> - No! </garnt>
<garnt> - Because I'm the scriptor here. </garnt>
<garnt> I actually write more than you, Connor! </garnt>
<garnt> I actually write more than you! </garnt>
<connor> - That's the same like, because, </connor>
<connor> well you work one way, everyone must work the same way, </connor>
<connor> and you've, you like ... </connor>
<garnt> Like, so if someone writes a lot, </garnt>
<garnt> they're the ones that we should ask like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Okay, tell me about keyboard ergonomics, </garnt>
<garnt> and how well ..." </garnt>
<connor> Like, no! That's not how it fucking works! </connor>
<garnt> - Are you saying that you can't write as efficiently </garnt>
<garnt> if you don't have the right keyboard and everything? </garnt>
<garnt> How did you function before like, </garnt>
<garnt> the 75% keyboards got popularized? </garnt>
<garnt> You know? </garnt>
<connor> Because it was ... </connor>
<connor> - I'm not doing wingdings! </connor>
<connor> We're not writing with a fucking number pad, Garnt! </connor>
<connor> This has nothing to do with the 75% now! </connor>
<connor> What are you talking about? </connor>
<connor> Now we're talking about the difference between laptop </connor>
<connor> and keyboard! </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I am! </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just like, if ... </garnt>
<connor> - Well, so you know your laptop </connor>
<garnt> doesn't have a number pad, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I know! </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Like ... </garnt>
<connor> - I'm not saying that it doesn't have like a number pad. </connor>
<joey> - That's why he brings a portable number pad. </joey>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - I just bring like a portable number pad! </garnt>
<garnt> - No you don't! </garnt>
<garnt> - No no no, I don't, I don't. </garnt>
<connor> - He brings a 5% keyboard that's just the number pad. </connor>
<connor> - Listen. How you work is like, totally up to you, right? </connor>
<connor> If you are a person who gets really agitated </connor>
<joey> by a certain way, </joey>
<joey> and that's just like, that bugs you. </joey>
<connor> I think that's just, that's up to you. </connor>
<joey> Could you just knuckle down sometimes </joey>
<joey> and get on with it? Yeah, you can! </joey>
<joey> But I mean, at the end of the day it's, </joey>
<joey> if you're doing something creative </joey>
<joey> and it's something that you're your own boss with, </joey>
<joey> you're probably gonna work as much as you want. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And sometimes, comfort is a factor in that. </joey>
<connor> And for me, that's what I need. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, but you're gaming. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah but, if I am working though, as well! </connor>
<connor> It's the same thing! </connor>
<connor> I just don't wanna use it. </connor>
<joey> - Right right right. </joey>
<joey> Anyway. - Anyway! </joey>
<garnt> - I don't even know how we got onto this! </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't even know, man! </garnt>
<garnt> I don't even know. </garnt>
<garnt> - That was the most long-winded, </garnt>
<joey> dumbass argument we've ever had on Trash Taste, like. </joey>
<connor> - I just felt like I explained a very valid point </connor>
<connor> and then I got jumped on it. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't know. </garnt>
<connor> I don't know what you were explaining, exactly. </connor>
<connor> I don't even know. </connor>
<connor> - I don't even know who you are! </connor>
<connor> - That it is totally a reasonable behavior </connor>
<connor> to not wanna use the laptop thing. </connor>
<connor> - Okay okay. </connor>
<garnt> Because like, maybe it's because I don't have a </garnt>
<garnt> custom keyboard yet, but like, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't fully understand- </garnt>
<connor> - I don't take my main keyboard. </connor>
<joey> I take some like, $50 one that's ... </joey>
<joey> - I take my side bitch keyboard. </joey>
<joey> - I just need one that's further away </joey>
<connor> and that I can set up to be more like ... </connor>
<garnt> - Wait, so you don't even take your good </garnt>
<garnt> optimized custom keyboard? </garnt>
<garnt> - Not like the super expensive one, no. </garnt>
<garnt> I just take like one that I can ... </garnt>
<garnt> - So you have several keyboards? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah! Well I learnt my lesson. </garnt>
<connor> 'Cause my keyboard broke one time, </connor>
<garnt> I couldn't do any work or couldn't stream or anything. </garnt>
<garnt> And I, you know, I was fucked. </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, well this seems dumb. </garnt>
<garnt> So now I just bought, I have a spare keyboard. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, because like ... </garnt>
<garnt> - It's a good idea if your entire job </garnt>
<garnt> revolves around doing like, </garnt>
<connor> being able to use this one device. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You should probably have backups of everything </connor>
<connor> that could possibly break. </connor>
<joey> - That's fair enough, but I don't think I've ever </joey>
<connor> broken a keyboard before. </connor>
<connor> - Keyboards break! </connor>
<connor> - I didn't break it. They break sometimes. </connor>
<garnt> - All the time, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - You know, whether you've had a key that was acting up </garnt>
<garnt> that was pissing you off, </garnt>
<garnt> or maybe the, yeah yeah, it happens all the time. </garnt>
<garnt> Keyboards are fucking frail things. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, 'cause to me like ... </garnt>
<garnt> - Mouses break all the time. </garnt>
<connor> I got like three backup mouses. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. 'Cause like, maybe like this comes down </garnt>
<garnt> to the conversation of like, </garnt>
<garnt> me in tech, like, </garnt>
<connor> even though I'm an engineer, </connor>
<connor> I don't like, I just need a job to be done. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> I don't really care about aesthetics </connor>
<connor> or like, stuff too much. </connor>
<connor> I just like ... </connor>
<connor> - It's not aesthetics. I don't care about that. </connor>
<connor> - You don't? Well. </connor>
<connor> - It's just about, it's about like, </connor>
<garnt> preference of like, how I like it to work. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You know? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, 'cause like, </connor>
<connor> for example like headphones, for example. </connor>
<garnt> I literally don't like ... </garnt>
<garnt> My preference with headphones </garnt>
<garnt> is to buy like the cheapest headphones </garnt>
<garnt> I can possibly, right? </garnt>
<joey> - Oh, I'm the opposite with headphones. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah yeah yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I know people are like, </garnt>
<garnt> really really really anal ... </garnt>
<connor> - When you're talking about headphones </connor>
<garnt> you're talking about in-ear, right? </garnt>
<joey> - In-ear. </joey>
<connor> - You don't use headphones, right? </connor>
<connor> - I don't use headphones. </connor>
<joey> - Like clam shell headphones, you mean? </joey>
<connor> - Those are headphones, right? </connor>
<joey> They're earphones. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh sorry, yeah! Earphones! </garnt>
<garnt> - Earphones, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I only use earphones for like running. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I only, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I prefer to use headphones every other time. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't, like yeah, </garnt>
<garnt> to me like, headphones, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know why, </garnt>
<garnt> I think it might be because I have like, </garnt>
<joey> jaw problems or something. </joey>
<joey> Like if I wear headphones for too long </joey>
<joey> it just like really starts to </joey>
<joey> put pressure on my jaw and stuff. </joey>
<joey> But like yeah, with earphones, </joey>
<joey> and like, this is going above the tech, </joey>
<joey> but like, there are certain things like, </joey>
<joey> earphones, sunglasses where, </joey>
<garnt> I try to buy the cheapest possible </garnt>
<garnt> because I've gone through too many. </garnt>
<garnt> Or you know, like, </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes you buy like, </garnt>
<garnt> I remember buying like one ... </garnt>
<joey> - What like, at the end of every day you're like, crack! </joey>
<garnt> All right, next one! </garnt>
<garnt> - No yeah, because like, </garnt>
<connor> sometimes I misplace them, </connor>
<connor> but especially with sunglasses, right? </connor>
<garnt> It's so easy to misplace sunglasses, </garnt>
<garnt> especially 'cause you wear them out. </garnt>
<joey> And sometimes you don't always have your case on you </joey>
<joey> or sometimes you, you know- </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] You don't have a bag or anything. </joey>
<joey> - You take 'em off and you like, </joey>
<connor> clip them on your shirt </connor>
<connor> and they just fall off sometimes. </connor>
<connor> I've had that happen too many times, and with earphones, </connor>
<garnt> sometimes you misplace them or you like, </garnt>
<garnt> forget that they're in your jean pockets or something. </garnt>
<garnt> - So the headphones kinda make you uncomfortable </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause they like, put pressure on your head. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah yeah yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's the same thing for me and the keyboard </garnt>
<garnt> and the wrist though. </garnt>
<joey> It hurts my wrist if I have to use that flat thing </joey>
<joey> for ages. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause your wrist is like, why? </joey>
<joey> Why are we doing this? </joey>
<garnt> Also, I'm like paranoid about getting </garnt>
<garnt> any wrist injuries- </garnt>
<garnt> - Like carpal tunnel and stuff. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah 'cause I, you know, I wanna game. </connor>
<garnt> - Well you game way more than us. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, so I ... </connor>
<garnt> - That's a legitimate concern for you, isn't it? </garnt>
<connor> - I'm very cautious about like, wrist injuries. </connor>
<connor> So I want the most ergonomic setup all the time. </connor>
<joey> - Why don't you get those like, wrist guard things then? </joey>
<joey> I've seen a couple streamers wear them. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I mean that's ... </joey>
<joey> They normally have that on when it's too late. </joey>
<connor> And they've already like, done the damage. </connor>
<joey> - I know some people who have it on like, </joey>
<connor> to actually just prevent it from happening- </connor>
<connor> - I mean if you have a good setup, </connor>
<connor> you shouldn't need that. </connor>
<connor> - Right, but you know, </connor>
<garnt> even people with good setups can sometimes, </garnt>
<garnt> you know, game a little too hard. </garnt>
<garnt> - But like headphones like, </garnt>
<garnt> for me it's like, I can't have the in-ear ones, </garnt>
<connor> 'cause every single in-ear headphones </connor>
<connor> for some reason wants to like, </connor>
<joey> excavate your ear, and get really in there. </joey>
<joey> And that hurts the shit out of my ears. </joey>
<joey> So I can't use those. </joey>
<joey> - It's probably because you don't have like, </joey>
<joey> the right size buds, right? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I have one that comes with a bunch of </connor>
<joey> replaceable ones, but even then like, </joey>
<joey> AirPods unironically are the ones that I like the most, </joey>
<connor> 'cause they don't really go in your ear much. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, they kinda like, sit on top of it. </joey>
<connor> - That's what I like the most, </connor>
<joey> but I don't use Apple, so I don't have them. </joey>
<joey> And that's why I use like the over ear ones. </joey>
<connor> Also the sound's way nicer. </connor>
<joey> - I only use the over ear ones </joey>
<connor> if it's like in the winter, </connor>
<connor> because it also like, keeps my head warm. </connor>
<connor> But like, in the summer here especially, </connor>
<joey> I'm just like, no headphones, go away. </joey>
<connor> - I actually always use them. </connor>
<joey> I'm ... </joey>
<joey> - Dude, like I've seen you like, </joey>
<joey> walking in like, the Japanese summer with headphones on, </joey>
<garnt> I'm like, bro, that looks painful. </garnt>
<joey> - That is dedication there. </joey>
<connor> - I don't know, that's just how I like listening! </connor>
<connor> That's the comfort. </connor>
<connor> - I mean your headphones have taken a fucking beating. </connor>
<joey> It's like, I remember seeing it and it's like- </joey>
<connor> - [Joey] It's like falling apart! </connor>
<connor> - It's like falling apart, man, like holy shit! </connor>
<connor> - I'm like, dude, buy some new headphones, dude! </connor>
<garnt> - Well it's 'cause ... </garnt>
<garnt> It's 'cause I'm waiting for the, </garnt>
<garnt> right now I'm using the Sony WX1003, </garnt>
<garnt> worst naming system of all time. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah yeah. </joey>
<joey> - What the fuck is going on? </joey>
<joey> Sort it out. </joey>
<joey> - String of numbers and letters. </joey>
<joey> - And then like the next one, the fours, </joey>
<garnt> isn't really a significant upgrade. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I'm hoping that the fives, </garnt>
<joey> when they ever come out, </joey>
<joey> which I don't even know if they will, </joey>
<joey> are like a decent upgrade. </joey>
<joey> So I'm kind of in that weird spot where it's like, </joey>
<joey> they're broken, and they're not working properly. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But like, because they're like, </joey>
<joey> you know, $300 headphones. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I want them to last like, five years. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. - Yeah of course, of course. </garnt>
<joey> - So, if I buy the fours now </joey>
<garnt> and then the fives come out and they're like, </garnt>
<garnt> the most best upgrade and you can hear God through them. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm gonna be really pissed off that I bought these fours. </garnt>
<garnt> And I didn't just wait a few months extra. </garnt>
<joey> But I don't even know if it's coming out. </joey>
<joey> They haven't even announced it or anything, </joey>
<joey> so I'm just waiting, kinda hoping. </joey>
<joey> - You're waiting for something </joey>
<joey> you don't know it's gonna come out. </joey>
<joey> - The one side is completely broken </joey>
<joey> so it keeps falling out. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Just duct tape that shit. </joey>
<connor> - I thought about it. </connor>

<garnt> - Back to the episode. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, you're the gamer, right? </garnt>
<garnt> You talked about keyboards, right? </garnt>
<connor> 144 hertz monitors. </connor>
<connor> - All right. </connor>
<connor> Okay, if you genuinely think there's no difference </connor>
<connor> between a 60 and 144 hertz you're a clown. </connor>
<connor> - Is there a point, if you don't play FPS. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah! </connor>
<joey> - 'Cause I genuinely like, </joey>
<garnt> because we have in the office, I've never used them. </garnt>
<connor> - You notice it more with FPS games. </connor>
<connor> But like, even normal games, </connor>
<connor> that are not like, locked to 60, </connor>
<connor> look way better in 144. </connor>
<joey> - I think that's the problem. </joey>
<joey> I only play games that are locked to 60. </joey>
<connor> - Because you're on the Switch. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - If you actually game on your PC, </joey>
<connor> 144 hertz is way, it looks way better than, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> I'd rather have 144 hertz than like, </connor>
<connor> a more like, higher resolution. </connor>
<connor> - Right. - Right. </connor>
<joey> - For me it's way nicer and smoother. </joey>
<joey> And it just looks good. </joey>
<joey> I don't know why. </joey>
<joey> Resolution after- </joey>
<joey> - It's milky! </joey>
<joey> - After like 2k, I can't fucking tell the difference. </joey>
<joey> Like ... </joey>
<joey> - Yeah! </joey>
<joey> - I, 4k games- </joey>
<joey> - Especially on a monitor, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Barely look any different from 2k to me. </connor>
<connor> But I feel way more difference from 60 to 120 hertz, </connor>
<connor> 144 hertz. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, 'cause I feel the difference with FPS, </garnt>
<garnt> I just don't play FPS. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah, same. </garnt>
<garnt> - So I was just like, what are the game types, </garnt>
<connor> would really like, really make me feel the difference? </connor>
<connor> Because I'm already ... </connor>
<garnt> - Minecraft. </garnt>
<garnt> - Any game where you're, you know, </garnt>
<connor> you're moving around, you're controlling a character moving. </connor>
<joey> - Minecraft's probably the only one where I've </joey>
<joey> probably like, somewhat slightly seen it. </joey>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - You just notice it's just more fluid! </connor>
<joey> - It looks kinda smooth. </joey>
<joey> - And you'll notice when you go back that it's like, </joey>
<joey> not quite the same. </joey>
<joey> It's not bad. </joey>
<joey> It's not like, you know, </joey>
<connor> if you haven't got a lot of money, right? </connor>
<connor> And you're choosing between like, </connor>
<connor> a better PC, or like, </connor>
<garnt> a monitor that makes you like, (indistinct) instantly, </garnt>
<garnt> then just get a better PC. </garnt>
<connor> Get better parts or something, right? </connor>
<connor> Like, it's kinda like the cherry on top. </connor>
<connor> But there's no point buying a monster PC </connor>
<connor> if you're then not also gonna get a good monitor for it. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Right, right. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause you're basically buying like, </connor>
<connor> an engine with a car that can't fit it. </connor>
<joey> It's like, okay well, I mean. </joey>
<joey> It's, you know, a lot of people will have like, </joey>
<joey> 3080s and still use 60 FPS monitors, </joey>
<joey> and I'm like ... </joey>
<joey> (chuckling) </joey>
<joey> Why? </joey>
<joey> You've put like, rockets on a scooter! </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's like, it's just too much. </joey>
<joey> Like you're overpowering it. </joey>
<garnt> I don't know, I mean, </garnt>
<connor> I game a lot, so I guess I ... </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, I am that guy who has a 3080 and ... </garnt>
<garnt> - No you don't fucking ... </garnt>
<connor> - And uses 60 FPS, but like, </connor>
<connor> that's because it's like a fucking monster to render </connor>
<connor> when I'm editing. </connor>
<connor> That's my thought. - Yeah, that's true. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, same same. </connor>
<joey> - That's the only other like, I think, </joey>
<joey> if you're not gaming, </joey>
<garnt> if you're doing industry stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> - I definitely use it like that more than the gaming. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like I've definitely noticed like </garnt>
<joey> a massive massive difference with rendering and editing. </joey>
<garnt> Like, that's like, I don't need 60 FPS to edit, you know? </garnt>
<connor> - If you're streaming, it's also very good. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because the NVIDIA cards have dedicated video chips </garnt>
<garnt> that are completely separate to the gaming. </garnt>
<garnt> So you can game and stream at the same time </garnt>
<connor> and it doesn't affect the performance. </connor>
<connor> It does a little bit. </connor>
<connor> That's just 'cause they have other things going on. </connor>
<garnt> - What do you think about, </garnt>
<joey> so do you care about the keyboard thonk then? Like ... </joey>
<joey> - I mean ... </joey>
<connor> - The ASMR sounds? </connor>
<garnt> - The ASMR sounds. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I do. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, I like what I have right now. </garnt>
<garnt> Maybe I should, </garnt>
<garnt> (indistinct) can remind me to record something, </garnt>
<joey> I don't know. </joey>
<joey> I'll probably forget. </joey>
<joey> - He's gonna play an ASMR of his keys! </joey>
<joey> - It's just like, I don't know, it's a nice click! </joey>
<garnt> It's a really nice click. It's subtle. </garnt>
<joey> - 'Cause like, I'm on the fence right now, </joey>
<joey> because I'm gonna be getting my custom keyboard </joey>
<joey> within like a few months, </joey>
<joey> so maybe I'm gonna be like, </joey>
<joey> "Man, Connor was right this entire time." </joey>
<joey> - Couple months from now, you're gonna be on that side! </joey>
<joey> - Yeah yeah yeah! </joey>
<joey> 'Cause like, I remember going on this video, </joey>
<joey> and just looking at the comments section, </joey>
<joey> and I'm just like ... </joey>
<joey> I've seen less horny comments on Pornhub comments, you know? </joey>
<joey> Like, my god like, I literally feel like </joey>
<connor> everyone is cumming from like the sound of these keys, </connor>
<connor> and I'm just like ... </connor>
<garnt> That's a nice sounding key, I guess. </garnt>
<connor> - It's weird 'cause it's like, it feels like, </connor>
<connor> almost like PlayDoh-y at first, </connor>
<garnt> 'cause you're so used to the really harsh clicks. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - Yeah yeah yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Of other ones, and it feels like, </garnt>
<joey> "Ooh, it's really like, </joey>
<joey> squishy and soft." </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Like wet. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But then after a while, </joey>
<joey> you get used to it and you're like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh no, this is actually like, really firm." </joey>
<joey> Or the clicks are really solid. </joey>
<garnt> But they're not like, in your fucking face. </garnt>
<garnt> It's not like it's screaming, "Hey, you just clicked me! </garnt>
<garnt> Hey, hey you just clicked it!" </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause you don't wanna be that </garnt>
<connor> asshole on Discord who's like, </connor>
<connor> click click click click click! </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, because I remember when mechanical keyboards </garnt>
<garnt> got popularized, and that was like the popular key. </garnt>
<connor> - Because it was like, everyone bought the $30 </connor>
<garnt> mechanical keyboard on Amazon, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause they thought mechanical equaled good. </garnt>
<joey> When in fact mechanical was just ... </joey>
<connor> It was loud as shit. </connor>
<connor> - I just can't get over like, </connor>
<connor> you describing like the sound of these keys </connor>
<connor> and you know, it just sounds like, </connor>
<joey> you know, hearing the experience of someone </joey>
<joey> going on a drug I've never been on, you know? </joey>
<joey> It's just like, "At first it's like really wet, </joey>
<joey> but then once you get used to it it gets like really firm, </joey>
<joey> and it's like ..." </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] It's true, it is true. </joey>
<joey> - That's when the euphoria hits you. </joey>
<joey> - [Man] It's the (indistinct). </joey>
<joey> - Yeah! - It's the lube! </joey>
<joey> - It's the lube! - It's the lube! </joey>
<garnt> - Like they're in the, 'cause like- </garnt>
<garnt> - I lube my fingers when I'm using it. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause when I was picking the keys, </garnt>
<joey> 'cause like, I'll take a picture </joey>
<joey> and send it to you (indistinct) </joey>
<joey> but like, I have like a whole fucking like- </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Test keyboard. </joey>
<joey> - It's a test, it's a square of just keys, </joey>
<joey> of different keys, </joey>
<joey> and like, it's, </joey>
<garnt> it's bad for someone with ADHD, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause it's just like, </garnt>
<garnt> you're just like constantly poking it, </garnt>
<garnt> and you're just like, "Ooh, this just feels nice." </garnt>
<garnt> - This is a fun toy! </garnt>
<garnt> - Ooh this is a fun toy, this is! </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, fidget spinners got nothing on this! </garnt>
<garnt> And then you have to like click one, </garnt>
<connor> and then you have to choose one key from like, 100. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, at some points, </connor>
<connor> like, keys just like, meld together. </connor>
<connor> And there are like, different like, </connor>
<connor> the different like, lubeness of keys and like, </connor>
<connor> I didn't know lubeness like, mattered with keyboard keys. </connor>
<connor> Like I'm just like, okay. </connor>
<connor> At which point, I'm like, </connor>
<connor> I get it, it's like a hobby, right? </connor>
<connor> It's a hobby kind of object, right? </connor>
<connor> Because you have to be really into it </connor>
<connor> to really care about it this much. </connor>
<connor> - A key-phile. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, a key-phile, right? </connor>
<connor> At which point does it get like, too much? </connor>
<connor> Where ... </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Where it's ... </connor>
<connor> - Never too much. </connor>
<connor> - Is it never too much? </connor>
<connor> - It's never too much. </connor>
<connor> - All right. I'm waiting, I'm waiting. </connor>
<connor> I'm waiting for my first custom keyboard. </connor>
<connor> - People are like, this is why we're gonna have flying cars. </connor>
<joey> - They're the ones that are gonna invent a flying car. </joey>
<joey> - People get too invested in this. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah yeah yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Someone told me, I was streaming yesterday. </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, completely unrelated, </garnt>
<garnt> but you said ADHD so, it came up in my mind. </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, "No no no, I checked," </garnt>
<joey> 'cause chat was accusing me of having ADHD. </joey>
<joey> And I was like, "No, I don't have ADHD." </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] What? </joey>
<joey> - I was like, "I can focus on things. </joey>
<joey> I get really fixated on things." </joey>
<joey> And they're like, "You know focusing too much </joey>
<joey> is a sign of ADHD, right?" </joey>
<joey> And I was like, "What?" </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And apparently it is. </joey>
<joey> So I was like, wait what, </joey>
<joey> so if I concentrate too much on things ... </joey>
<joey> - You have ADHD. </joey>
<joey> - But if I don't concentrate enough I have ADHD too? </joey>
<joey> - Yup. </joey>
<joey> - I'm like wait, what, hold up! </joey>
<joey> What does that mean? </joey>
<joey> What does that ... how does that work? </joey>
<connor> - I don't know, it's like, </connor>
<joey> you can't be on too far of either side of the spectrum. </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah yeah. </connor>
<joey> - 'Cause then you have a problem, apparently. </joey>
<joey> - I guess, 'cause it doesn't specify </joey>
<joey> that you can't pay attention. </joey>
<joey> It's attention deficit disorder, </joey>
<joey> so you've got too much attention or too little. </joey>
<joey> But I was just like, what? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Who's making these rules up, huh? </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know ... </garnt>
<connor> - People have ADHD, I guess. </connor>
<garnt> - People who are more informed than us! </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> I was like, god damn these people! </joey>
<joey> Coming up with these definitions. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, that's crazy. </joey>
<joey> - It's usually the person that says you have ADHD. </joey>
<joey> Like, officially. </joey>
<joey> - How do you test if someone concentrates too much? </joey>
<joey> How do you test ... I'm genuinely curious. </joey>
<joey> - [Man] It's basically like you can't control yourself </joey>
<joey> and you realize that, "Oh shit, it's like ..." </joey>
<joey> - Oh, you get lost in something? </joey>
<connor> Oh, I see I see. </connor>
<connor> - [Man] So you get obsessed with- </connor>
<connor> - That's kinda (indistinct). </connor>
<connor> - [Man] Yeah, it is, but at the same time, </connor>
<connor> it's like, you can't control it. </connor>
<connor> - But I feel there's a lot of people like </connor>
<connor> in just this internet age that, you know, </connor>
<joey> because we're so fucking over-sensitized </joey>
<joey> and just overwhelmed with </joey>
<joey> all this fucking information, right, </joey>
<connor> all at the same time, right. </connor>
<joey> There are so many people who are just like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, there's so much fucking shit to do on the internet! </joey>
<joey> Do I have ADHD?" </joey>
<joey> I'm like, no, you're just on the internet. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, sometimes I wonder, </connor>
<connor> I'm like, I don't think like, </connor>
<connor> I have a problem. </connor>
<joey> I think there's just so much shit that's being </joey>
<joey> shoved in my face. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah! That's what it is! </joey>
<connor> - Sometimes. I don't know. </connor>
<connor> - But that's why like, I reckon there's probably, </connor>
<connor> I mean like ... </connor>
<joey> - I don't know, I mean, you have ADHD. </joey>
<garnt> How does it feel? </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, I got ... it is weird, right, </garnt>
<garnt> because the reason ... </garnt>
<garnt> I only like recently got diagnosed with ADHD </garnt>
<joey> and it was just like the most ah-hah moment of my life. </joey>
<joey> Like, of course I do! </joey>
<joey> You know? </joey>
<joey> - Like, oh, that's what that was! </joey>
<joey> - Yeah! Because like, you know, </joey>
<joey> especially like growing up in Asian culture, </joey>
<garnt> mental health and mental conditions </garnt>
<garnt> are very like- </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Don't exist! </garnt>
<connor> - Literally that meme image of, "Just don't be sad." </connor>
<garnt> Like ... - Yeah yeah! </garnt>
<connor> - Cutting the water faucet. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, turning the water off, like- </connor>
<connor> - Don't be sad. </connor>
<connor> - Don't be sad. </connor>
<connor> So I remember like, 'cause I have this like, </connor>
<garnt> such a vivid memory in school, right? </garnt>
<connor> Of, I knew someone in school who </connor>
<connor> got diagnosed with ADHD and they got like, </connor>
<connor> some like advantage or something in like, </connor>
<joey> a test that we were taking, right? </joey>
<joey> They got like, extra time or something. </joey>
<joey> And I remember like describing like, </joey>
<joey> what his experience of ADHD was, </joey>
<joey> and I was just like, "What a fucking liar!" </joey>
<joey> Like, "What a fucking liar! I do that! </joey>
<garnt> And he's getting some free time on an exam! </garnt>
<garnt> What the fuck?" </garnt>
<garnt> And it just like, 'cause like it just didn't, </garnt>
<garnt> it just, for some reason, </garnt>
<garnt> it just never fucking occurred to me, </garnt>
<garnt> that unfortunately I had the same symptoms, </garnt>
<garnt> because I was raised ... </garnt>
<garnt> not even raised, but like, </garnt>
<garnt> a lot of people in my culture </garnt>
<garnt> and the environment I grew up with, </garnt>
<garnt> it was just, we were, </garnt>
<garnt> it was put in our minds that, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> mental health just wasn't really like, </garnt>
<garnt> it was either like a very very serious thing, </garnt>
<garnt> or it just like, was, just didn't exist. </garnt>
<garnt> And then you've just gotta get on with your day, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Like there's no such thing as a mild symptom, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah yeah yeah! </garnt>
<joey> - It's like you either had it or you don't have it. </joey>
<garnt> - So what made you think, </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh, I should go and see if I have it." </garnt>
<connor> Like, what was the turning point? </connor>
<garnt> Like what ... </garnt>
<garnt> - This is gonna be awful. </garnt>
<connor> Enough comments on Trash Taste. </connor>
<connor> - No way! Are you serious? </connor>
<garnt> - Mentioning it. I am actually serious. </garnt>
<connor> - Wait, why? </connor>
<garnt> 'Cause you were like, fidgeting with things? </garnt>
<garnt> - Huh? </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause you were fidgeting with things? </garnt>
<garnt> - Honestly, seeing myself on camera, I'm just like ... </garnt>
<connor> Damn, man, I do that shit? What? </connor>
<connor> But yeah. Because like, obviously I've never been on camera, </connor>
<connor> and especially with me being on camera documented so much </connor>
<connor> on Trash Taste, I'm like, </connor>
<connor> damn, I do a lot of weird shit! </connor>
<connor> - So people psychoanalyze us all the time. </connor>
<joey> - Like I understand- </joey>
<joey> - We start to notice habits, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah yeah yeah. </joey>
<joey> I started to notice habits, </joey>
<joey> 'cause you're looking at yourself through the third person. </joey>
<connor> And then also, you know, </connor>
<connor> there's always gonna be comments that are like, </connor>
<connor> psychoanalyzing and over-analyzing stuff. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah, people say some really wild shit. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah yeah yeah. </connor>
<connor> But then like, I saw some comments that are just like, </connor>
<connor> fuck, they kind of make sense, </connor>
<connor> and then I Googled it. </connor>
<joey> Google what they say, I'm like damn, </joey>
<joey> that doesn't look like it's just someone </joey>
<joey> talking out their ass. </joey>
<joey> And then like the final straw </joey>
<connor> was meeting someone here who has ADHD </connor>
<joey> and they described their symptoms, I'm like ... </joey>
<joey> Fuck, okay. </joey>
<joey> I need to go get diagnosed. </joey>
<joey> I need to go get checked out. </joey>
<joey> And yeah, it was thanks to Trash Taste, I guess, </joey>
<garnt> and thanks to random YouTube comments. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well done guys! </garnt>
<garnt> - Well done guys! </garnt>
<garnt> You're like, it's like the one time in the world where </garnt>
<joey> you guys were actually correct with your diagnosis. </joey>
<joey> And you weren't just a bunch of like, </joey>
<connor> Reddit armchair psychologists. </connor>
<garnt> - I've seen some wild ones. </garnt>
<garnt> I see some wild diagnoses. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I do. I have as well. </garnt>
<connor> - In a few years of Trash Taste. </connor>
<garnt> - That's not an excuse to psychoanalyze all of us, okay? </garnt>
<joey> A broken clock is right two times, you know guys? </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - I remember my, fucking, </garnt>
<connor> when I was growing up, </connor>
<connor> everyone was like, convinced I had like, dyslexia. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And like, I was like, </connor>
<joey> "No, I don't think I do. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I don't really have a problem reading the words. </joey>
<joey> I just really fucking hate doing it." </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> - But, 'cause they would describe the symptoms to me </joey>
<connor> as like a, you know like, </connor>
<connor> when I was like 10 or something. </connor>
<connor> So to give some back story to this, </connor>
<connor> I went to a Welsh school. </connor>
<connor> I didn't like reading. </connor>
<connor> I liked gaming. </connor>
<connor> I was probably- </connor>
<connor> - Gamer from birth. </connor>
<connor> - My parents probably wished that </connor>
<connor> nobody had ever introduced me to gaming. </connor>
<connor> But I was introduced to gaming very very young. </connor>
<connor> We're talking like, four, five, six. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh wow. </garnt>
<garnt> - I found out about video games. </garnt>
<garnt> And I became like, obsessed. </garnt>
<garnt> And I read the games. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, I've said this before, </garnt>
<garnt> I beat all of, </garnt>
<joey> like one of the first games I ever played </joey>
<joey> was Pokemon Gold in French, </joey>
<joey> and I beat the whole game in French. </joey>
<joey> I don't know how. </joey>
<joey> - Even though you don't know any French. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, this must have been literally </joey>
<joey> the birth of me bashing my head against the walls </joey>
<joey> to figure out shit in video games, not reading. </joey>
<garnt> So I've been doing this since like a young age. </garnt>
<garnt> I never really, like, read stuff. </garnt>
<connor> I just kind of did it. </connor>
<connor> This is probably like, sounds very like, </connor>
<connor> monkey-esque already, </connor>
<connor> and not, you know, </connor>
<joey> not very intelligent. </joey>
<joey> - It's very like, a primeval like- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it is. </joey>
<connor> And I went to a Welsh school. </connor>
<joey> So I didn't really read English, like ever. </joey>
<joey> We learned everything in Welsh. </joey>
<connor> I spoke in Welsh in school. </connor>
<connor> So I never read English, like ever. </connor>
<connor> The only thing I'd ever read is like, </connor>
<garnt> we go to the store, I can read the, </garnt>
<garnt> I would just read the fucking- </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Bread. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, bread, whatever like. </garnt>
<garnt> But like, when I would be quizzed on like, </garnt>
<garnt> how to spell shit, I like, wouldn't know. </garnt>
<connor> They'd be like, "Spell said," </connor>
<connor> and I'd be like, "Oh yeah, just Z. Z-E-D, innit? Said." </connor>
<connor> I'd be like, I don't know. </connor>
<joey> - Your. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. So like, this is from like age eight or whatever. </joey>
<connor> Like, I was fucking awful. </connor>
<connor> And so when we started learning English more, </connor>
<connor> I was like, yeah, </connor>
<joey> I just don't read books, ever. </joey>
<connor> And they're like, "What? You don't read books?" </connor>
<garnt> And my parents were like, "Yeah, we tried to! </garnt>
<garnt> We tried to make him read, he wouldn't." </garnt>
<garnt> - But he keeps playing those goddamn video games! </garnt>
<garnt> - To be fair, like, </garnt>
<garnt> my parents tried their goddamn hardest to get me to read. </garnt>
<joey> It was just not gonna happen. </joey>
<joey> Like I was just, I had absolutely zero interest in it. </joey>
<joey> So I was so so bad at English. </joey>
<joey> But like, they knew I was very competent </joey>
<joey> at all other subjects. </joey>
<joey> Like I was very like, you know, </joey>
<joey> maths and science and all that, </joey>
<joey> really really high marks, </joey>
<joey> like I was, you know, </joey>
<connor> I mean I got like A-star and shit in maths and all that, </connor>
<joey> it's like the highest grade you can get. </joey>
<joey> I went and did engineering and all that. </joey>
<joey> So there's no problem with like, </joey>
<garnt> I wasn't like, bad at learning. </garnt>
<garnt> It was just, I just hated this one subject. </garnt>
<joey> But they were convinced, they were like, </joey>
<connor> "Well if he's competent in other stuff, </connor>
<connor> he just must have some dyslexia or something." </connor>
<connor> And they would tell me what the symptoms were. </connor>
<connor> And it was so annoying, because as a kid, </connor>
<connor> this is where I started learning where </connor>
<connor> adults like, fuck with you as a kid. </connor>
<connor> They would like try and spoon-feed me the answers to like, </connor>
<connor> to dyslexia. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<joey> - They would like, try and tell me I had symptoms </joey>
<joey> that I didn't have. </joey>
<joey> - And to like, get you to agree to it? </joey>
<joey> - Just because they wanted to have like, </joey>
<connor> so they can tick it off as like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, we've figured it out. </connor>
<connor> We'll sort him out." </connor>
<connor> And then whenever I have any issues, </connor>
<connor> they'd be like, "God, don't worry, </connor>
<joey> we don't have to put in more work. </joey>
<joey> He's just dyslexic." </joey>
<joey> You know what I mean? Kinda? </joey>
<joey> This is where you like ... </joey>
<joey> I get it, 'cause the teachers, </joey>
<joey> they want an answer. </joey>
<joey> They want a reason. </joey>
<joey> - They wanted a solution, right? </joey>
<connor> - They wanna know why, and I can understand, </connor>
<connor> everyone wants a reason why, but like, </connor>
<connor> unfortunately mental health and shit like that </connor>
<connor> and learning is like, </connor>
<connor> the most complicated shit known to man. </connor>
<connor> And there is never ever just a one solution that fits all. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah like, just because somebody sucks at something, </connor>
<connor> it doesn't mean there's an inherent problem </connor>
<connor> with them, right? </connor>
<joey> - So I would like, talk to my teachers and stuff, </joey>
<joey> and I remember talking to my English teacher </joey>
<joey> and she like, made me like, </joey>
<connor> stay after class and she'd talk to me, </connor>
<connor> and she'd be like, </connor>
<connor> "So, you can read these words, right?" </connor>
<connor> And I was like, "Yeah, I can read them." </connor>
<connor> She's like, "They don't look like messed up or </connor>
<connor> jumbled at all?" </connor>
<connor> And I was like, "No, not really." </connor>
<joey> And then she was like, </joey>
<joey> "Sometimes the words are hard to read," </joey>
<connor> I'm like, "Yeah, I don't know the word sometimes. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I don't really know it. </connor>
<connor> So it's kind of hard to read, </connor>
<connor> 'cause English is kinda funny </connor>
<connor> and the pronunciation is weird." </connor>
<connor> And then, so she was like, </connor>
<joey> "Hmm, okay okay." </joey>
<joey> So then another teacher came in a few weeks later </joey>
<joey> and started asking me more questions </joey>
<joey> about dyslexia and stuff. </joey>
<joey> And I was like, "The words are not fucking jumbled, okay? </joey>
<joey> I've seen the movies, they don't fucking do that!" </joey>
<joey> And I know that's not how it works, but I'm like, </joey>
<joey> "I do not have a problem! </joey>
<joey> I can see all the letters in order! </joey>
<joey> They do not move, I know what I'm reading! </joey>
<joey> I am just shit at this subject, </joey>
<joey> and I don't like it!" </joey>
<joey> - They just like, start shaking your body like, </joey>
<joey> "What about now?" </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> It was literally like, </garnt>
<garnt> thank god I wasn't a kid that would just like, </garnt>
<joey> and I felt bad, 'cause like, </joey>
<joey> kids are so easily like, pushed into saying yes or no. </joey>
<joey> I'm so glad I was a stubborn fuck from like a young age. </joey>
<joey> Where I was like, "No! The words are not jumbled! </joey>
<connor> I don't have a problem reading the words, </connor>
<connor> I just hate this shitty subject! </connor>
<connor> I hate English!" </connor>
<connor> And they were like, "No no no no no! </connor>
<garnt> You have to be! You have to have a disability or something!" </garnt>
<garnt> - You got this fucked! </garnt>
<garnt> - You must be! You must be! </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, you must be! </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm very glad that, I don't know where I got </garnt>
<joey> the stubbornness from, but I was glad! </joey>
<joey> 'Cause like, I remember like, </joey>
<connor> it was really annoying. </connor>
<connor> And they kept insisting I had it. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, no! No! </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] It's like, stop! </joey>
<joey> - I do not have this! </joey>
<connor> I have no problem reading Of Mice and Men! </connor>
<connor> I just don't like it! </connor>
<joey> I'd rather watch the movie! </joey>
<joey> - They're like, tryna just like brainwash you, right? </joey>
<joey> - Okay. So this is what I'm realizing. </joey>
<joey> And I understand now why like, </joey>
<joey> you know, this whole discussion about diagnosing kids </joey>
<connor> is like, I get why it's like a touchy subject. </connor>
<connor> Some parents are like, "My kids! You can't diagnose them!" </connor>
<connor> And then, you know, some people are so quick to jump to it. </connor>
<connor> It's a really uncomfortable subject and kind of touchy, </connor>
<joey> 'cause the kids often can't, like I was a kid. </joey>
<joey> I couldn't fully express that, you know, </joey>
<joey> I can't just be like, listen, </joey>
<joey> I didn't really connect with the subject, I don't like it. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, they can't fend for themselves, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. I can't really fully explain </joey>
<joey> why I don't want to, why I don't engage with this. </joey>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But they'd, you know, they're just like- </connor>
<joey> - But they're like, "No, we're the adults. </joey>
<connor> We know more than you." </connor>
<joey> - Right, right! </joey>
<connor> So it's kind of a ... it's weird, man. </connor>
<connor> And I think that's why like, </connor>
<joey> when you get parents that are super passionate about it </joey>
<joey> and stuff, and then there's also the thing of like, </joey>
<joey> some parents don't want to </joey>
<joey> get their kids diagnosed with things. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause they don't wanna like, be like, </joey>
<connor> "My kid has a problem," </connor>
<garnt> or has something, right? </garnt>
<garnt> My parents didn't really give a shit. </garnt>
<connor> They were like, "If he's got it, he's got it. Whatever." </connor>
<garnt> Like, just deal with it, but yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, 'cause I think with how mental health is now, </garnt>
<garnt> it's just like, it feels like, </garnt>
<connor> at least it feels like, </connor>
<connor> if you're diagnosed with something, </connor>
<connor> then the kinda feeling is, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, there's something wrong with me," </connor>
<connor> or something like that. </connor>
<joey> You know, there's something broken with me. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause like, with me and ADHD, for example. </joey>
<joey> Like, I didn't realize that I was abnormal, you know? </joey>
<connor> Because I would have, I would do all of these things, </connor>
<connor> to basically be able to like, </connor>
<connor> seem like I was able to function, you know? </connor>
<connor> And I'd only learned recently that </connor>
<connor> that was like my coping mechanisms for like my </connor>
<connor> whatever, like how my brain works, you know? </connor>
<connor> I had figured out ways to live with it. </connor>
<connor> And I thought everyone had to do that. </connor>
<connor> You know, that's just what I thought. </connor>
<connor> And like, especially with like, </connor>
<connor> after being diagnosed, it hasn't like, </connor>
<connor> changed my life or anything like that. </connor>
<connor> It's like, the biggest thing that it's done for me, </connor>
<connor> is like, it's just helped me understand myself. </connor>
<connor> And I think that's just, </connor>
<connor> I think that's like the most valuable thing. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Right? - Definitely. </garnt>
<garnt> - Sure. It makes sense of things that you were like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Why? Why am I like this?" </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah yeah yeah! Exactly! </connor>
<connor> 'Cause it's just helped me like, </connor>
<connor> deal with it even more. </connor>
<garnt> 'Cause I just remembered, </garnt>
<garnt> because it wasn't just the YouTube comments as well. </garnt>
<connor> I remember specifically seeing this one YouTube video, </connor>
<connor> and that was like the last straw, where it was like- </connor>
<connor> - Dr. Mike diagnosed me. </connor>
<connor> - No no, where it was like, </connor>
<connor> where it was like, "What ADHD feels like," </connor>
<joey> and someone like, edited a video of their day, </joey>
<joey> and like, edited it in a way to like </joey>
<joey> show how they perceived the world. </joey>
<joey> - Like thoughts and- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, how they perceived the world. </joey>
<joey> And it was like, such a one for one copy </joey>
<connor> of how I see the world, I was just like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh my god." </connor>
<joey> Like, that was like the ah-hah moment. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I think there was one scene in particular, </joey>
<connor> 'cause he was going about his day, </connor>
<connor> and he was like, being scolded by his teacher </connor>
<connor> or his mum or something. </connor>
<connor> And he was like, fidgeting, right? </connor>
<connor> He was fidgeting. </connor>
<joey> And he would get told off for that. </joey>
<joey> Because his mum or his teacher, </joey>
<joey> I can't remember who it was exactly, </joey>
<joey> but they were just like, "Can you concentrate, please? </joey>
<joey> I'm trying to tell you something serious, </joey>
<joey> and you're doing something else!" </joey>
<joey> And I'm just like, and he said, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, but it helps me to concentrate." </joey>
<joey> And I'm just like, that's been my entire life! </joey>
<joey> That's been, it like, </joey>
<garnt> I need to fidget with something in order to concentrate, </garnt>
<garnt> and if I don't, I just lose like, </garnt>
<garnt> my trail of thought or something, right? </garnt>
<joey> - He's just like me! </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah! I was just like, holy shit. </garnt>
<garnt> Maybe I should fucking go in and get this done. </garnt>
<joey> - So wait, so how do they ... </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I've always been curious, like, </joey>
<joey> when you go see a doctor, right, </joey>
<garnt> and you wanna like, you know, </garnt>
<joey> figure out if you are actually diagnosed with it. </joey>
<joey> How does the doctor like, check that? </joey>
<connor> - Well- </connor>
<joey> - Is there like a test? </joey>
<joey> - He just puts like a Rubik's cube on the table </joey>
<joey> and he's like ... </joey>
<joey> - It's like, "I'll be back in 15 minutes." </joey>
<garnt> - Puts like a fidget spinner on the table. </garnt>
<garnt> - What do you think about this? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah no, 'cause I've always been curious like, </joey>
<joey> you know, how does the doctor like, </joey>
<joey> kind of determine whether you actually have ADHD </joey>
<joey> or if it's just like something </joey>
<joey> similar to that that's not necessarily ADHD, right? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah I mean, at the moment I'm at like, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm still like processing it and learning through it. </garnt>
<joey> 'Cause at the moment, at the beginning they take you </joey>
<joey> and they do like this just, </joey>
<joey> it's a survey first. </joey>
<joey> So it's like the first test. </joey>
<joey> Then afterwards, if you tick enough boxes </joey>
<connor> to be like, "Oh okay, there's, you know-" </connor>
<connor> - A chance, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - There's a chance, then you go in to the psychologist </connor>
<connor> and you know, they ask you like, </connor>
<connor> a bunch of questions. </connor>
<connor> For me at least. </connor>
<connor> I don't know, because like, </connor>
<connor> another friend in England just recently </connor>
<connor> got diagnosed with ADHD as well, </connor>
<connor> and I think in England </connor>
<connor> they have a different kind of process. </connor>
<connor> - It's probably different to every country. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah yeah, I think it's different to every country. </connor>
<connor> In England I believe there's like a, </connor>
<joey> you have to go to like a group session as well, </joey>
<garnt> or something like that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's different in every country, </garnt>
<garnt> but for me it was more just a one on one talk </garnt>
<joey> with my, you know, with the- </joey>
<joey> - The psychologist. </joey>
<joey> - The psychologist, where they just asked me like, </joey>
<joey> very detailed questions about </joey>
<joey> my experiences, how I perceive events. </joey>
<connor> And like, I can't remember everything, </connor>
<connor> 'cause there was like a lot of fucking questions, </connor>
<connor> but it was kinda, </connor>
<connor> it was basically like a therapy session </connor>
<connor> where it was just like, </connor>
<connor> "So tell me about this experience." </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Talk me through it. </connor>
<connor> - Talk to me about this. </connor>
<connor> Tell me about that. </connor>
<connor> And yeah, I mean, </connor>
<connor> ever since being diagnosed, </connor>
<connor> I've like, like I said, </connor>
<joey> my life hasn't changed that much. </joey>
<joey> I just know now, it's like written in paper, </joey>
<joey> that this is- </joey>
<joey> - You got the plaque now. </joey>
<connor> - No no, I got the plaque of just like, </connor>
<connor> "Here's how your brain works, </connor>
<connor> and here's why your brain does this shit." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And ever since knowing that, I'm like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, that makes sense!" </connor>
<connor> Now I have like a word to put to how I felt for </connor>
<joey> a lot of my life. </joey>
<joey> And yeah, that's it like, </joey>
<joey> that's the thing. </joey>
<joey> I feel a lot of people, </joey>
<joey> a lot of people maybe have, you know, </joey>
<joey> maybe have different conditions </joey>
<joey> or different mental conditions </joey>
<joey> that they've just never really thought about. </joey>
<joey> Because, like me, </joey>
<joey> maybe you found a way to cope with it day to day, </joey>
<joey> you know, because like me, </joey>
<joey> maybe you thought that, </joey>
<joey> "Hey, maybe everyone's like this!" </joey>
<joey> And then you've just found a way to live normally </joey>
<joey> because you've grown up. </joey>
<joey> You've grown up in an environment where </joey>
<joey> you just need to like, just get on with it, basically. </joey>
<joey> And a lot of the times like, </joey>
<joey> not every mental condition is just like, </joey>
<connor> on the extreme end. </connor>
<connor> Sometimes it's like, really really subtle. </connor>
<connor> But if you've ever like, had a thought that, </connor>
<connor> "Maybe I do have this," or, "Maybe I do have that." </connor>
<connor> I think it might be worth just talking to someone. </connor>
<connor> Not to like, have like a life-changing ah-ha moment, </connor>
<garnt> but just learning more about yourself </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like is the most valuable thing </garnt>
<garnt> that someone can do. </garnt>
<garnt> And ... doesn't mean that there's necessarily </garnt>
<garnt> anything wrong with you, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> - I think more people would probably go </garnt>
<connor> if it was like, easier to get seen. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, definitely. </garnt>
<garnt> - (indistinct), right, it's like. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah yeah yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - You gotta be either rich </joey>
<joey> or have a lot of time on your hands. </joey>
<joey> Or both. - Or both. </joey>
<joey> - To get anything done, healthcare wise, </joey>
<joey> or mental health wise. </joey>
<joey> I know in the UK it's not too great. </joey>
<connor> I know they're like, trying to get better at it, </connor>
<connor> but I know it's not adequate. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, in the UK it's like the waiting list is like, </garnt>
<connor> it's fucking, like huge. </connor>
<joey> - No kidding. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, because yeah, </joey>
<joey> because I feel like the biggest problem, </joey>
<joey> especially like, everywhere but America I can see, </joey>
<connor> is like, access to mental healthcare is difficult as hell. </connor>
<joey> Especially in Asia. </joey>
<joey> - In Japan, dude! It's like ... </joey>
<joey> - Oh my god! In Japan ... </joey>
<connor> - Half the time it's just like, nonexistent. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah yeah yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Mental health in Japan is the (indistinct). </connor>
<joey> There is no ... </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> It's like, go to the pub, </connor>
<joey> drink a beer, and don't think about it. </joey>
<joey> - It's like, I know why you're sad! </joey>
<connor> It's because you're not drunk right now. </connor>
<connor> Go to an izikaya. Have a couple of beers. </connor>
<connor> You'll be all right. </connor>
<joey> And it's just, no. </joey>
<joey> - I'm just like, I was walking home, </joey>
<connor> and I saw a guy just like, on the floor. </connor>
<connor> He was crying. </connor>
<connor> In Tokyo, and I was like, </connor>
<connor> "Why is like, no one helping him?" </connor>
<connor> Like, loads of people just walking past him, </connor>
<connor> like, why is no one saying like, </connor>
<connor> "Hey, are you okay?" </connor>
<connor> It's just so weird to me! </connor>
<connor> I was like, what? </connor>
<joey> People were just like, "Man, I don't wanna ... </joey>
<connor> Don't wanna get involved." </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, they don't. </joey>
<connor> That's the thing. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] That's so fucking sad. </connor>
<connor> - They see, 'cause you know, again. </connor>
<connor> Collectivist society, they see one, you know, </connor>
<connor> cog that's out of the system, and they're like, </connor>
<connor> "Well, that's not our problem. </connor>
<connor> We just gotta keep the system moving." </connor>
<joey> - Well the UK isn't great, but I think, </joey>
<joey> at least where I was from, </joey>
<joey> if someone was like, crying in the street, </joey>
<joey> like everyone would be like, "Are you okay?" </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah! - Yeah yeah yeah! </joey>
<connor> - I'd say most English-speaking countries </connor>
<joey> there would definitely be at least a couple people </joey>
<joey> being like, "Hey, you all right dude? What's up?" </joey>
<garnt> - At least like, someone checking on them. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah! Exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> And you know, not to say that Japan isn't, </garnt>
<connor> you know, the fucking cruel mistress of the world </connor>
<connor> in that sense, right? </connor>
<connor> Like there's definitely people, </connor>
<connor> I've seen people, you know, </connor>
<connor> go up to strangers and be like, you know. </connor>
<joey> (speaks foreign language) </joey>
<joey> - I wanted to help, but I was like, </joey>
<joey> I don't want this to be a awkward language barrier situation </joey>
<joey> where you actually need help </joey>
<connor> but I'm just like, (speaks foreign language). </connor>
<joey> You know? </joey>
<joey> I felt so sad about that, </joey>
<joey> I couldn't do anything to help this dude. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I was like, I don't know, </joey>
<garnt> just imagining what situations he could be going through </garnt>
<garnt> made him so fucking sad. </garnt>
<joey> I was like, what if his parents like, </joey>
<connor> said he couldn't go home or something. </connor>
<garnt> I don't fucking know, I was like, </garnt>
<connor> ugh, fuck it! </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah man. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. I just wanted to add an addendum to what I said. </garnt>
<connor> If you do, like, </connor>
<connor> I think a big issue nowadays as well is like, </connor>
<connor> there's a lot of self-diagnoses. </connor>
<joey> Like, especially, I've seen it on TikTok especially. </joey>
<joey> - The internet doctors. </joey>
<connor> - Like, they're like, I've read one Google article. </connor>
<garnt> I am, like, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, I got this ADHD, </garnt>
<garnt> or I'm like ... </garnt>
<connor> - Well it's almost like the, what's the word? </connor>
<connor> The like collection of, you know, </connor>
<joey> people kind of, say what you will, </joey>
<joey> but online they kinda see it as like a badge of honor. </joey>
<joey> Sometimes. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah yeah yeah! - Yeah yeah yeah! </joey>
<joey> - Some people do. </joey>
<joey> They're like, "If I have XX thing and I have it in my bio, </joey>
<joey> I'm like, I'm part of a group." </joey>
<garnt> - You get brownie points. </garnt>
<joey> - It's weird! </joey>
<joey> - Or you're like, immune to like, </joey>
<joey> sometimes like being an asshole or something. </joey>
<joey> You know? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah yeah yeah! </garnt>
<joey> - Like it's just like, I don't know. </joey>
<joey> It sucks, 'cause you don't wanna be like, </joey>
<connor> "Man, people are faking it." </connor>
<connor> But it's like, there are people faking it! </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] No, there are. </connor>
<connor> - People see it as like a badge of honor in a way. </connor>
<connor> That's like, what? </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] And you know, even if you- </connor>
<joey> - Even if you're proud about it! </joey>
<connor> You could be proud about it and be open about it. </connor>
<joey> But like- </joey>
<joey> - Exactly. </joey>
<joey> - Is it like, self ... </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] But like, don't be a dick about it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, self-diagnosing so that you can </joey>
<garnt> then go and brag about it online is like, what the fuck? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - People actually have to deal with this shit! </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah yeah, I know right? It ... </garnt>
<garnt> - And then that whole argument comes into like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Well, we couldn't afford to go to a doctor </garnt>
<garnt> and get actual diagnosis," </garnt>
<garnt> and it's like, yeah but you probably, </garnt>
<garnt> still should never diagnose. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't think anyone ever would recommend you self-diagnose. </garnt>
<joey> - No no no, you could be completely wrong about that. </joey>
<joey> - Especially with something as delicate, </joey>
<joey> and as complicated as mental health! </joey>
<garnt> 'Cause it's like, like I said, </garnt>
<connor> the mind is a complicated thing. </connor>
<connor> And people do weird shit a lot of the times, </connor>
<garnt> and you can never know unless you really see </garnt>
<garnt> like an expert, you know? </garnt>
<connor> - But then it also sucks as well, </connor>
<connor> 'cause then you see an expert </connor>
<connor> and maybe the expert was shit at his job or something, </connor>
<garnt> you know? So ... </garnt>
<garnt> It's always just like a fucking minefield of- </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah yeah. - Like, like. </garnt>
<connor> - Counterarguments. </connor>
<garnt> - Have you ever like, had a bad experience with like </garnt>
<garnt> a doctor or anything like that? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I've had doctors where I'm like, </connor>
<connor> "Yo, this thing is actually like, fucking hurting me." </connor>
<connor> And then he's like, "Oh no, it's good." </connor>
<connor> And I'll be like, "What? Bro, no, I'm in like some bad ... </connor>
<connor> It's a bit of pain." </connor>
<connor> And he's like, "No, you're good." </connor>
<connor> And then I go to another doctor and he's like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh holy shit man, you got a, </connor>
<connor> this is like, you gotta sort this out." </connor>
<joey> - I've had a lot of instances where I go to like </joey>
<connor> a local doctor, or like a local GM and they'll be like, </connor>
<connor> "I'll refer you to a bigger hospital." </connor>
<connor> After looking at it for like two seconds. </connor>
<connor> And then you go to the bigger hospital </connor>
<connor> and they're like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh. Here's some drugs you can get anywhere." </connor>
<connor> I'm like, why did the guy at the local GM </connor>
<joey> not do that instead of fucking wasting my time </joey>
<joey> taking me to another bigger hospital </joey>
<joey> that's way further away, </joey>
<joey> to do the exact same job that he could have done? </joey>
<joey> You know? So ... </joey>
<joey> It's probably the only one I've had. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah because, especially me like, </garnt>
<garnt> right now I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> I think my biggest 30s like health thing </garnt>
<connor> that I've found somewhat </connor>
<connor> is like my jaw issue. </connor>
<connor> And so I've been like, </connor>
<connor> trying to get someone, </connor>
<connor> I've been trying to find an expert </connor>
<connor> to help me sort it out, so, </connor>
<connor> you know, I go to the dentist, to try and like, </connor>
<connor> try and find out what's wrong with my jaw, right? </connor>
<connor> And so, like, </connor>
<connor> I remember the first time I've tried to get it sorted out </connor>
<connor> was, I remember when I went to like, </connor>
<connor> several dentists in the UK. </connor>
<connor> And one of them said, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, do you still have your wisdom teeth?" </connor>
<connor> And they were like, and I was like, </connor>
<connor> "Yeah, I still have my wisdom teeth. </connor>
<connor> But like, they're not like, </connor>
<connor> the spacing in it isn't, </connor>
<connor> like it isn't bad or anything. </connor>
<connor> It's not like, hurting me or anything like that." </connor>
<joey> And they were like, </joey>
<joey> "Yeah, we recommend you get that taken out." </joey>
<joey> And I was like, okay. </joey>
<joey> Do I, that's a big commitment, you know? </joey>
<joey> Because you know, at the time, </joey>
<joey> I was still a YouTuber. </joey>
<garnt> So you know- - You can't talk. </garnt>
<garnt> - You can't talk for a while. </garnt>
<joey> - You can't talk, you can't talk, </joey>
<connor> so I like, I wanted to make sure that </connor>
<connor> I needed to go through this procedure. </connor>
<connor> So I went to a second dentist for a second opinion. </connor>
<connor> And he was like, </connor>
<connor> "No, definitely don't take your wisdom teeth out. </connor>
<connor> That's not the issue. </connor>
<connor> Here, have this mouthguard." </connor>
<connor> And I was like, okay. </connor>
<connor> He gave me the mouthguard. </connor>
<connor> It like, improved it a little bit, </connor>
<connor> but like the problem still persisted, </connor>
<connor> so I went back to him, </connor>
<connor> and he's like, "Yeah, honestly, </connor>
<connor> maybe you need braces or something? </connor>
<connor> That's gonna cost like 30,000 pounds or something." </connor>
<connor> I was like, okay. </connor>
<joey> Let's be sure I need to go through this! </joey>
<joey> So like, at this point, </joey>
<joey> I'd moved to Japan, right? </joey>
<joey> And then come to Japan. </joey>
<joey> I do the same thing, go to the dentist, </joey>
<joey> and they were like, </joey>
<joey> "You don't need to take your wisdom teeth out </joey>
<joey> but maybe just take the top wisdom teeth out." </joey>
<joey> And I'm just like, I'm getting like a, </joey>
<joey> like every dentist I've gone to so far </joey>
<joey> has given me a different opinion about </joey>
<joey> what needs to be done! </joey>
<joey> So I'm like, who do I listen to? </joey>
<joey> - And you go to another one and it's like, </joey>
<joey> so you only need to remove half your wisdom teeth. </joey>
<joey> Just like the top half, just like shave it off a little. </joey>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah yeah yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - Just shave the top off and you'll be all right. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I'm just like, it's so like, </joey>
<joey> I wanna get it fixed, </joey>
<joey> but I just, it's scary because, </joey>
<joey> whatever I go through, </joey>
<joey> it's a big commitment obviously </joey>
<garnt> in time and cost, and it's my body. </garnt>
<garnt> I wanna make sure it's done right. </garnt>
<garnt> But at the same time, everyone I say, </garnt>
<garnt> everyone I meet is telling me different things. </garnt>
<garnt> So I have no fucking clue who to listen to, basically. </garnt>
<connor> - I got like tonsillitis like, </connor>
<garnt> I used to get it like every year. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - And they were like, "Just remove your tonsils." </garnt>
<garnt> And I was like, aw I don't know, </garnt>
<joey> I don't really want ... </joey>
<joey> 'Cause they say there's a chance </joey>
<joey> it can like affect your voice. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And I was like, I'd rather just be sick once a year </connor>
<connor> and have like a lot of pain. </connor>
<joey> - Well you haven't had it in a while though, right? </joey>
<connor> - No, luckily I haven't had it in a while. </connor>
<joey> Like I don't think I've had it in Japan. </joey>
<joey> - Right. - Luckily. </joey>
<joey> But yeah, I used to get it like every year. </joey>
<joey> It was a pain in the ass. </joey>
<connor> I just didn't want my voice to change! </connor>
<connor> I was like, I like my voice right now. </connor>
<connor> It's kind of important to my job. </connor>
<joey> What if I change it and ... </joey>
<connor> - Although they say like, </connor>
<connor> you know, you'll have a chance that the voice will change, </connor>
<connor> but it's not like you're gonna be like, </connor>
<connor> (in high pitched voice) "Hey guys, what's up?" </connor>
<joey> (in normal voice) You know? </joey>
<garnt> - I know I know, I was just like, </garnt>
<garnt> I have learned how to use my voice. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - For like voice acting. </joey>
<joey> Very specific, like, </joey>
<joey> I can feel it- </joey>
<joey> - I guess you don't wanna like, relearn it, right? </joey>
<joey> - I don't know how it would feel. </joey>
<joey> I don't ... they just told me there's a chance </joey>
<joey> it could change slightly, </joey>
<joey> and I was like ... </joey>
<joey> For me, it's just not worth it. </joey>
<connor> I was like, I'll just be sick every now and then. </connor>
<joey> - I'll take the sickness. </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] Like, I'll just be sick. </connor>
<garnt> - Tonsillitis isn't real. </garnt>
<joey> - It's not an illness! </joey>
<garnt> - It's a mindset! </garnt>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> - It's a lifestyle! </connor>
<garnt> - That shit fucking sucks! </garnt>
<garnt> Have you had that? Have you got yours removed? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah yeah. - No, I still have mine. </garnt>
<garnt> - I still have mine, yeah, as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh dude, when you get it, it fucking hurt. </garnt>
<garnt> Have you ever had it? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I've had it. - No. </connor>
<connor> - It's horrible. - Never had it. </connor>
<connor> - It was fucking horrible. </connor>
<connor> - Your voice, your like throat closes up so much. </connor>
<connor> And it feels like it's like, </connor>
<connor> you know there's like fucking squishy toys </connor>
<connor> where you put your finger in it? </connor>
<joey> That's how I imagine your throat looks like. </joey>
<joey> - Ew! </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] It's horrible. It's so gross. </connor>
<connor> - That sounds gross, yeah. </connor>
<connor> No thank you. </connor>
<connor> - It's not that bad. It's just your voice. </connor>
<connor> - Wait, how do you get it? </connor>
<garnt> You just like, is it like a virus you pick up or? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I believe it's virus. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like an infection on your tonsil. </garnt>
<connor> - [Joey] Oh, okay. </connor>
<connor> - It might be viral or bacterial. </connor>
<joey> - Kissing someone with it or something, I don't know. </joey>
<garnt> - Sucking too many dicks, right? </garnt>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> (indistinct) </garnt>
<connor> - Now that I'm a Jojo fan, I gotta be careful. </connor>
<connor> - Can't be going on any (indistinct). </connor>
<joey> - Don't wanna pick up tonsillitis </joey>
<joey> from my next blowjob. </joey>
<connor> - I don't know, generally I just avoid going to the hospital </connor>
<connor> or clinic at all costs. </connor>
<connor> I'm like ... - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I've said this before, I just don't wanna go. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I'd rather, I'll be like dead before I go. </connor>
<connor> Unless it's like, really severe. </connor>
<garnt> And I'm in like a lot of pain. </garnt>
<connor> - [Joey] Right. </connor>
<garnt> - So, we kind of went on like a one hour tangent </garnt>
<joey> from Joey saying we're gonna get back to explaining </joey>
<joey> the title of this video. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Holy shit, I completely forgot about that! </joey>
<joey> - In true Trash Taste - - Trash Taste classic. </joey>
<joey> - Fashion. </joey>
<joey> Joey's like, "We'll get back to this." </joey>
<joey> - We'll get back to this. </joey>
<joey> And they never did! - One hour later. </joey>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, so, we're gonna be leaving Japan after this episode </joey>
<joey> for a little bit of time. </joey>
<joey> Specifically two months. </joey>
<joey> Quote unquote. </joey>
<garnt> - Is it two months? </garnt>
<connor> - Month and a half? - Month and a- </connor>
<connor> - Something like that. </connor>
<joey> - It doesn't really matter because I mean, </joey>
<joey> you guys aren't gonna know the exact dates, </joey>
<joey> but we're gonna be filming Trash Taste abroad. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, we're going- </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] All sorts of places. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, we're going, </connor>
<garnt> the next arc is gonna be Trash Taste abroad, basically. </garnt>
<garnt> And we're gonna say goodbye to this studio for now. </garnt>
<garnt> Because we're gonna be filming in </garnt>
<garnt> some of the different countries that we're gonna be in. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean obviously one we can say, </joey>
<connor> because we announced it, like, </connor>
<connor> a couple of episodes ago, but like you know, </connor>
<joey> if you guys watched the episode four episodes ago, I think, </joey>
<joey> where we announced we were going to AX. </joey>
<joey> By the way, see you guys there. </joey>
<joey> Then obviously you'll know we're gonna be in LA for a while. </joey>
<garnt> - Yup! - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - So yeah, we're filming some episodes in LA. </joey>
<garnt> - And some in London as well. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, we're gonna be, </joey>
<joey> because these boys are gonna be coming to </joey>
<joey> the wedding as well, my wedding. </joey>
<joey> Which, by the time of release of this episode </joey>
<joey> should have just- </joey>
<joey> - It should have happened. </joey>
<garnt> - Should have already happened! </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah yeah yeah yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - So congrats. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah! </garnt>
<garnt> - Garnt! </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> Congrats, I guess! </garnt>
<garnt> - Thank you. </garnt>
<joey> - If everything goes well. </joey>
<joey> - Garnt is married if you're watching this. </joey>
<joey> - Garnt's married if you're watching this. </joey>
<joey> - This is, yeah, I'll be a married man IRL </joey>
<joey> by the time this episode comes out. </joey>
<joey> - IRL as opposed to virtually. </joey>
<garnt> - Massive W. </garnt>
<connor> - As opposed to YouTube Garnt, you know? </connor>
<garnt> - Garnt's gonna be at the alter and the guy's like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Do you say I do?" </garnt>
<joey> Garnt's like, "Wait, what, why?" </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> I was fidgeting, bro. What's happening? </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> - So put the fidget spinner down! </connor>
<garnt> - [Connor] Come on! </garnt>
<garnt> - But yeah like, so we're gonna be filming </garnt>
<garnt> some episodes in London, some in LA. </garnt>
<garnt> And we're gonna have like, a lot more guests on </garnt>
<garnt> than we usually would for Trash Taste. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, there's gonna be like a lot of guests on. </garnt>
<connor> - It's gonna be like an (indistinct). </connor>
<joey> - So we had like, no guests for like 20 episodes. </joey>
<joey> And then we're gonna have a lot of guests in a row. </joey>
<joey> And like obviously, you know, </joey>
<garnt> some people are gonna like that. </garnt>
<garnt> Some people don't like it. </garnt>
<garnt> But I think we just wanna, </garnt>
<garnt> we wanna go somewhere and mix it up </garnt>
<garnt> and try something. - Yeah! </garnt>
<garnt> - And you know, if you don't like the episodes, </garnt>
<connor> or you don't like, we'll be back! </connor>
<joey> You know, nothing's gonna change. </joey>
<joey> - Don't worry, we have over 100 episodes at this point. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, you know, Trash Taste isn't going anywhere. </connor>
<connor> So, you know, </connor>
<joey> it's something we wanna do, </joey>
<joey> we wanna mix it up, </joey>
<joey> and we hope that the change of scenery </joey>
<joey> will look interesting as well. </joey>
<joey> I mean it obviously won't maybe not look as professional, </joey>
<joey> but hopefully it'll still be the same old podcast. </joey>
<joey> - Nice breath of fresh air. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. Because like, we've had so many guests </garnt>
<garnt> that we've wanted to come on </garnt>
<joey> and it's been like two years of just </joey>
<joey> constantly waiting and waiting, it's like, </joey>
<joey> maybe it's gonna come, maybe? </joey>
<joey> And then now that we can fly out, </joey>
<joey> maybe, like, we are just basically, </joey>
<joey> it's the floodgates just opening, right? </joey>
<joey> And it's just, everyone coming on at once </joey>
<garnt> because it's everyone that we've wanted to come on </garnt>
<garnt> and we've talked to before about wanting to come on, </garnt>
<garnt> all coming on at once! </garnt>
<garnt> So ... we're excited. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's going to be a lot of fun, I hope. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. - I think so! </connor>
<connor> - It'll be a lot of big episodes back to back, I think. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah yeah. - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And we're not just going to be filming guest episodes. </garnt>
<garnt> We're gonna be filming some specials as well. </garnt>
<joey> You're gonna have your like, </joey>
<joey> your first Trash Taste specials abroad as well. </joey>
<joey> We're not gonna spoil what those specials are. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But, yeah, we have- </joey>
<connor> - Should be good. </connor>
<garnt> Should be good. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah yeah yeah. We have a lot planned for Trash Taste. </garnt>
<connor> In the coming months. </connor>
<connor> - And if you miss just us, </connor>
<joey> I'm sure there'll be some episodes sprinkled in there </joey>
<joey> that are just the three of us. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah yeah. - Definitely. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I know there's a good, a vocal bunch, </joey>
<joey> on the subreddit that love the just us three episodes. </joey>
<connor> And I guess they're so used to it now, so. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's such like an interesting divide though, right? </joey>
<joey> Because it's like, you know, </joey>
<joey> in my head it was like, </joey>
<joey> yeah, the fucking guest episodes are like, awesome, </joey>
<joey> because it's like a new person, new perspective, </joey>
<joey> you know, whatever, new topics to talk about right? </joey>
<garnt> But then there are a lot of people who are just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Who?" </garnt>
<connor> Like, you know like, </connor>
<connor> they look at the four of us, </connor>
<joey> it's like, "Who dis? Who dis man?" </joey>
<joey> - I get it. </joey>
<joey> I think we try to make the guest episodes </joey>
<joey> so even if you don't know the guest </joey>
<connor> you can kinda, they can come on, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I mean we've had, what, </connor>
<joey> three guest episodes before this one, right? </joey>
<connor> - Also, you know, our guest episodes </connor>
<connor> aren't as personal, so I understand that people might not </connor>
<garnt> enjoy them as much, if that's what they like most </garnt>
<garnt> about Trash Taste. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah yeah yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because obviously we can't go into </garnt>
<connor> a lot about how we feel about things </connor>
<garnt> and our own life, 'cause it's like, </garnt>
<connor> all right, we're tryna make sure the vibe is good </connor>
<connor> and that the guest can vibe. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. Exactly. </joey>
<garnt> - Well that's why we decided to just have it </garnt>
<garnt> the three of us when we started, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Because we were like, </garnt>
<garnt> if we put a fourth person in there, </garnt>
<garnt> not a whole lot of like, </garnt>
<garnt> deep conversation's gonna happen, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> It was gonna be like too, </garnt>
<joey> it's gonna be too on the surface. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean we're clowns, </garnt>
<garnt> but sometimes we wanna not be clowns </garnt>
<joey> and just wanna chill and vibe, you know? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> Just vibing, bro! </joey>
<connor> - Just vibing! </connor>
<connor> - True, true. </connor>
<garnt> - We're clowns but we also vibe as clowns as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's a clown vibe. </garnt>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> - So I'm sure they'll be fun America stories </connor>
<joey> while we're there. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah. </joey>
<connor> - And I'm sure I'll gain a lot of weight. </connor>
<joey> - A lot of fun UK stories as well. I'm sure. </joey>
<connor> - God, I'm not looking forward to gaining weight. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I'm trying, </garnt>
<garnt> I've been trying my fucking hardest </garnt>
<connor> to not gain weight before like, </connor>
<connor> obviously my wedding as well, but like, </connor>
<connor> it's really hard whenever you travel out </connor>
<joey> because one of the hardest things </joey>
<joey> is keeping to a schedule, right? </joey>
<joey> Or keeping to habits. </joey>
<joey> And like, when you're living in the same place, </joey>
<joey> and you like, build this habit, </joey>
<joey> you know, you can stay on this habit </joey>
<joey> and it's so much easier, </joey>
<joey> but when there's like, </joey>
<joey> even like a slight change in environment or something, </joey>
<joey> you know, it's so easy for just like </joey>
<joey> one domino to fall over, </joey>
<joey> and like everything just falls over. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah. - Yeah, that's true. </joey>
<joey> - And you just like, slip into like, </joey>
<garnt> the complete opposite lifestyle of what you had. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm trying my best to stay healthy right now. </connor>
<joey> I've been like going to the gym like every day. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Just like, working out, </joey>
<joey> 'cause I'm like, I need it. </joey>
<joey> I need to be healthy before we go out there. </joey>
<joey> - Couldn't be me. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - I don't know, I also wanna get in shape as well, so. </joey>
<joey> I mean I feel more energized when I've worked out. </joey>
<joey> So I feel like I need that. </joey>
<connor> - I go on like the exercise bike </connor>
<joey> every now and then still, </joey>
<joey> at home, 'cause we bought one, </joey>
<joey> quite a while ago, so like, </joey>
<joey> whenever I have time, I do that, </joey>
<joey> but like, I don't know, </joey>
<joey> again, like, </joey>
<joey> I was going to the gym for a while, </joey>
<joey> and then just that one trip out </joey>
<joey> for like a week, just completely throws everything </joey>
<joey> out the window, you know? </joey>
<joey> And then you come back and you're like, </joey>
<garnt> well fuck, now I gotta start from the scratch again! </garnt>
<garnt> You know? </garnt>
<connor> And you're just like, not motivated at all. </connor>
<connor> And that's just like, it's just a complete, </connor>
<joey> like, habit killer. </joey>
<connor> - Also depends on like, I don't know, </connor>
<connor> I'm kinda picky. </connor>
<connor> Like if that, 'cause some hotels are like, </connor>
<connor> we have a gym. </connor>
<connor> And then you rock up to this gym, </connor>
<connor> and it is literally like a treadmill from the 80s, </connor>
<connor> that like, it is just so shit. </connor>
<connor> And you're like, well okay, </connor>
<connor> I mean I guess I'll do that, </connor>
<connor> and they got like no weights or anything, </connor>
<connor> and you're like, okay, </connor>
<connor> I mean, all right, I guess I'll just run. </connor>
<connor> And then you're just like, okay, </connor>
<connor> and then you go to the next place </connor>
<connor> and they're like, "We have a gym." </connor>
<connor> Oh, gym's closed or something. </connor>
<connor> Like it's just like, it's so hard to like, </connor>
<connor> stay consistent working out when you're traveling and stuff. </connor>
<connor> It's impossible. </connor>
<connor> - I don't even try to pretend to </connor>
<joey> try and keep up with the habits. </joey>
<connor> - I remember when I was going to the gym crazy, </connor>
<joey> like when I lost the majority of my weight, </joey>
<joey> like before I came to Japan. </joey>
<joey> I was doing it whilst going to the conventions, </joey>
<joey> and it was so fucking hard. </joey>
<joey> Fucking waking up in the morning before a convention </joey>
<joey> and going to the gym. - To the gym? Oh my god. </joey>
<joey> - It was so hard. </joey>
<connor> Oh my god, and also bringing your gym gear with you? </connor>
<garnt> It's a pain in the ass. </garnt>
<garnt> - Just bring your 75% dumbbells, man! </garnt>
<garnt> That's all you need, right? </garnt>
<connor> That's all you need! </connor>
<garnt> - You don't realize, right? </garnt>
<garnt> In your suitcase, shoes take up a lot of room! </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, yeah yeah yeah! </garnt>
<garnt> - Weirdly! Shoes are a pain in the ass. </garnt>
<joey> And then also, shoes get dirty. </joey>
<joey> So you're like, I wanna kinda like, </joey>
<garnt> cover them up. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's just like a pain in the ass. </joey>
<joey> And then you gotta bring gym clothes, </joey>
<connor> which you're not gonna wear any other time. </connor>
<connor> - Okay. </connor>
<garnt> - Any other time! </garnt>
<garnt> - Like, I remember before, </garnt>
<garnt> when I used to travel, I'd be like, </garnt>
<garnt> I'd have to use like, </garnt>
<garnt> the weight limit to its fucking maximum, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Oh, of course. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like you'd have to pack as much as you can </garnt>
<garnt> and if you don't, </garnt>
<garnt> then you could squeeze in more there, </garnt>
<garnt> but now I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> I wanna pack as light as possible, right? </garnt>
<garnt> And like, shoes are the most like, </garnt>
<garnt> annoying things, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - So annoying. </garnt>
<joey> - Because they're like- </joey>
<joey> - Because they're light, </joey>
<joey> but they take up the most space. </joey>
<garnt> - Well the thing is, are they light? </garnt>
<garnt> Sometimes shoes aren't light! </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, if you're packing like, boots, </garnt>
<garnt> like if you're packing like fucking Doc Martens </garnt>
<joey> then it's like, I need like, </joey>
<joey> separate luggage just for these fucking Doc Martens. </joey>
<joey> But like ... </joey>
<joey> - Because like, here's the thing. </joey>
<garnt> Like, do you normally pack extra pairs of shoes with you? </garnt>
<connor> - I only pack the everyday shoes and the nice shoes. </connor>
<connor> - It depends where I'm going. </connor>
<connor> Sometimes, like, </connor>
<connor> if I'm going to like, </connor>
<garnt> say like a completely different, </garnt>
<garnt> like if I'm going somewhere that's like, </garnt>
<garnt> really summery and beachy, </garnt>
<garnt> then like, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> I'll take like, a couple of like flip flops. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, flip flops don't count! </garnt>
<garnt> They aren't shoes. </garnt>
<garnt> - But like, you know, if I'm going somewhere </garnt>
<garnt> and I know I need to go to like, </garnt>
<garnt> a fancy dinner or something, then you know, </garnt>
<joey> I'll bring some like, dress shoes and shit like that. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah yeah yeah, and they are just like the most </garnt>
<garnt> fiddliest things to try and fucking fit in your luggage. </garnt>
<garnt> - But if I just need like, a pair of sneakers, </garnt>
<joey> then I'm just taking the one pair of sneakers. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah yeah yeah. - You know? </garnt>
<garnt> - Like how many jeans do you bring? </garnt>
<connor> How many pairs of trousers do you bring? </connor>
<connor> - Oh, one pair of trousers. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah 'cause- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, one pair of jeans. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause I'm just like, for some reason, </joey>
<joey> it's so weird, I like bring like 10 T-shirts, </joey>
<garnt> five hoodies or whatever, </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm like, do I need an extra pair of jeans? </garnt>
<garnt> Sometimes the answer's no, you know? </garnt>
<connor> - I saw this YouTube Shorts, </connor>
<connor> it was people going around asking people </connor>
<connor> how much underwear they brought for like a five day trip. </connor>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> - And I was just like, I was shocked. </joey>
<joey> - Is it not five? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah! Well how much would you bring to a five-day trip? </connor>
<connor> How many pairs of underwear? </connor>
<garnt> - Okay, like ... </garnt>
<garnt> Like, it's five minimum, </garnt>
<garnt> but sometimes I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> maybe I need that extra pair of underwear. </garnt>
<garnt> - Maybe I'll shit myself? - Maybe I'll shit myself! </garnt>
<garnt> - Maybe I'll shit my- </garnt>
<garnt> It's not underwear. It's socks. </garnt>
<garnt> How many pairs of socks do you bring? </garnt>
<joey> - Oh, I always bring extra socks. </joey>
<joey> - Wait, why? </joey>
<joey> - Because, you know, </joey>
<joey> you might run into an instance where like, </joey>
<joey> say wherever you are is rainy, for instance, right? </joey>
<joey> Your socks get wet. </joey>
<joey> You don't wanna wear those wet socks </joey>
<joey> for the rest of the day. </joey>
<connor> - Okay, but see, I'm talking about underwear. </connor>
<joey> Socks I can kind of ... </joey>
<connor> - Okay, underwear for me, </connor>
<connor> if it's a five day trip, </connor>
<joey> I'm bringing max six. </joey>
<connor> - How much are you guys bringing? </connor>
<connor> What are you guys bringing? </connor>
<joey> - [Man] Max six. </joey>
<connor> - For a five day trip. - Six? </connor>
<connor> - [Man] Max six. </connor>
<joey> - Six, right? Six? </joey>
<joey> - [Man] Socks? </joey>
<joey> - Underwear. - Underwear. </joey>
<garnt> How many pairs of underwear for a five day trip? </garnt>
<joey> - Six. - Yeah, six. </joey>
<garnt> - Like, for me, the amount of socks </garnt>
<garnt> and the amount of underwear you bring should be equal. </garnt>
<garnt> Right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yes. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yes? - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Joey you were, your face was just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Yeah, yeah, yeah." </garnt>
<connor> - On this video, people were like, </connor>
<connor> eight, nine, 10, 11. </connor>
<joey> And then like, three. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it was as if I had like, one. </joey>
<joey> - It was like, whoa. </joey>
<joey> But like, eight? </joey>
<joey> What is happening? </joey>
<joey> Are you bringing eight pairs of under- </joey>
<joey> What has happened on your trips? </joey>
<joey> - You gotta like, double up, right? </joey>
<garnt> - Like, I'm sorry. </garnt>
<garnt> When you're working out, it's a different story, right? </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause if you're planning to work out, I get it, </garnt>
<garnt> because when I work out- </garnt>
<connor> - You're gonna sweat in 'em. </connor>
<connor> - I'm running through socks and underwear. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, of course! Of course! </connor>
<connor> - I'm not re-wearing that underwear. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, of course. </garnt>
<garnt> - It sucks, 'cause you're like, </garnt>
<connor> fuck, I only got half a day out of this underwear. </connor>
<connor> I need to fucking wash it. </connor>
<connor> Kinda sucks. </connor>
<connor> But like, if you're just going on a trip, </connor>
<connor> why do you need more than five pairs? </connor>
<garnt> It doesn't make any sense to me. </garnt>
<garnt> - It also depends on the climate. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause if you're going to like, </garnt>
<garnt> especially like a southeast Asian country, </garnt>
<joey> you are sweating through that fucking underwear, man. </joey>
<joey> Like- </joey>
<joey> - Okay, that's- </joey>
<joey> - You're taking like four showers a day. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah yeah yeah! </joey>
<joey> The swamp ass, man, </joey>
<connor> it's just like, it's on another level. </connor>
<connor> You need those extra pairs of underwear, man! </connor>
<connor> - But like, this was like in America. </connor>
<garnt> Like, I don't think there's a single place in America </garnt>
<joey> where you need more than five pairs of underwear. </joey>
<joey> - Aw, I guess, unless you're going on like a </joey>
<connor> five day trip to like, Death Valley. </connor>
<connor> - Maybe, like, I just think that like, </connor>
<joey> you know, whatever. </joey>
<joey> And I've been trying to like, you know, </joey>
<garnt> like I said, I'm trying to minimize. </garnt>
<garnt> But also, did you ever try and do anything sneaky </garnt>
<garnt> with your suitcase at the airport? </garnt>
<garnt> Did you ever try to like, get past the weight limit? </garnt>
<garnt> - How so? </garnt>
<connor> - One time ... I can't remember which airport it was in. </connor>
<connor> The thing where the suitcase was. </connor>
<connor> There was no other staff to this side. </connor>
<garnt> There was just the person there behind the desk. </garnt>
<garnt> And I had the suitcase just like, </garnt>
<garnt> the suitcase I had was kinda like, </garnt>
<garnt> the wheels were kinda, like not centered. </garnt>
<garnt> Not on the edge, but like, </garnt>
<garnt> kind of going towards the center. </garnt>
<garnt> So the edge was leaning off. </garnt>
<connor> And so I just do that thing where you just like, </connor>
<connor> put your foot, and just like, </connor>
<connor> slightly lift it up, </connor>
<connor> to like, get a kilogram or two off. </connor>
<connor> And then just hold it, </connor>
<connor> like some kind of Nen user, you know? </connor>
<connor> You gotta have the conversation while just </connor>
<joey> slightly holding it. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause it was gonna go over. </joey>
<connor> I knew it was over </connor>
<connor> because on the way there it was over. </connor>
<garnt> So on the way back, I was like ... </garnt>
<garnt> - How much was it over? </garnt>
<garnt> - Like five kilograms. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, fuck. You're not getting away with that. </garnt>
<garnt> - So I, no I did! </garnt>
<garnt> - Huh? </garnt>
<garnt> - I got it down to like, </garnt>
<garnt> it was 20 kg limit, right? </garnt>
<garnt> It was going to like 24, 25. </garnt>
<garnt> - 20 kg limit? </garnt>
<garnt> Who are you flying with? </garnt>
<garnt> - Most of the airlines have 20 kg on one bag, limit. </garnt>
<garnt> - Is it not 23? </garnt>
<joey> - Normally 20. Actually, it depends on the airline. </joey>
<joey> - [Man] A lot of them are 20. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, sometimes 15 as well. </joey>
<joey> So I was like, </joey>
<joey> I need to shave five off this bag (indistinct). </joey>
<connor> And it was so- </connor>
<connor> - Warm up the calf. </connor>
<connor> - Dude, it was so hard! </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I'm like, on the desk like this, </connor>
<connor> trying to get my documents. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like ... </connor>
<garnt> My foot is like steel right now. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, lifting it up. </garnt>
<connor> But you gotta keep it even! </connor>
<connor> 'Cause if it's wobbling, </connor>
<connor> they know what you're doing. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But like, I figure, what are they gonna do? </connor>
<connor> They're not gonna kick me off the plane </connor>
<connor> if they find out I'm- </connor>
<joey> - It just reminds me of like, you know, </joey>
<connor> in Giorgio where they put the chocolate </connor>
<connor> under the water, and just like, </connor>
<joey> change the level of it. </joey>
<joey> While you're just having a conversation. </joey>
<joey> I've been fucking with you this entire time! </joey>
<joey> - I knew, 'cause I had to pay the fee on the way there! </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I didn't have any other way of taking it. </joey>
<joey> They charged me like, $70 or something. </joey>
<joey> To bring on this bag. </joey>
<joey> The flight was like 300! </joey>
<joey> And I was broke! </joey>
<joey> I couldn't afford 70, so I was like, </joey>
<connor> "I'm gonna do this, bro." </connor>
<connor> So it was like a Jojo, like, </connor>
<connor> fight thing, where I was like, </connor>
<connor> holding it up with my like, </connor>
<connor> left foot on the desk, </connor>
<connor> doing my passport, getting the ticket. </connor>
<joey> - He was like, Nani! </joey>
<connor> - Put it on, and when I put it on, </connor>
<garnt> I just kept talking to her, </garnt>
<joey> so it seemed like nothing was ... </joey>
<joey> And I wasn't that close to it either! </joey>
<joey> Because the desk was really tall. </joey>
<joey> And there was no one else. </joey>
<joey> - So you can't see. </joey>
<joey> - No one could see me doing it, </joey>
<joey> and there was no one behind me, </joey>
<joey> and I was scared that someone would call me out, </joey>
<joey> but no one did, so yeah. </joey>
<connor> It all worked nicely. </connor>
<joey> - No, if there was someone behind you </joey>
<connor> they would have just been like, "Damn." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, if somebody called me out, </connor>
<joey> I'd have been like, "What is wrong with you? </joey>
<joey> Let me, you wanna be fucked over by them too? </joey>
<joey> Come on!" </joey>
<connor> But one time, I will say, </connor>
<connor> when I was moving to Japan, </connor>
<connor> and I had like, three suitcases, </connor>
<connor> the woman was like, </connor>
<garnt> my suitcases were like, way over. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I had like, my computer gear and stuff. </garnt>
<joey> So it was like, 10, 15 kg over. </joey>
<joey> And she just like, looked at me, </joey>
<joey> and I was like, I must have looked really sad, </joey>
<joey> 'cause I was like, I'm moving! </joey>
<garnt> And she was like ... </garnt>
<garnt> (sighs) All right, I won't tell anyone. </garnt>
<garnt> And then she just let it off for free. </garnt>
<garnt> - Aww, that's- </garnt>
<garnt> - I love it when they do that sometimes! </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, because like, </joey>
<garnt> it's so hard, so because like, </garnt>
<garnt> here's the thing, like, </garnt>
<garnt> I've had to like do similar things, </garnt>
<garnt> but I try to prepare as much as possible </garnt>
<connor> before going in. </connor>
<connor> So you weigh it and then you're just like, </connor>
<connor> how much can you like, physically bring on a carry on? </connor>
<connor> Okay? </connor>
<connor> Like you push that to the limit, </connor>
<connor> because you have the carry on, </connor>
<garnt> and then sometimes you can have like, </garnt>
<garnt> a bag, which is not too big, </garnt>
<garnt> or doesn't look too big. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's not allowed to be big. Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - But like, you push the limits about </garnt>
<joey> how much you can have on a carry on </joey>
<joey> and a personal item? </joey>
<joey> Is that what it's called, right? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, a personal item. </connor>
<connor> - So you have to spread things as equally as possible. </connor>
<connor> And I noticed like, the magic number is between like, </connor>
<connor> .5 and one kilograms, right? </connor>
<joey> If it's between, if it's over, </joey>
<joey> by like less than like, one kilogram, </joey>
<joey> or just like ... </joey>
<joey> Like, I've met airlines that it's like, </joey>
<joey> if it's exactly one kilogram, they will charge you. </joey>
<joey> But if it's like, 0.9, they're just like ... </joey>
<connor> We'll let it go. We'll let it go. </connor>
<joey> The 0.1 kilograms makes a big difference. </joey>
<joey> - That just reminded me of like, </joey>
<joey> the time when I got stranded in Canada, </joey>
<joey> the one time, because I lost my passport. </joey>
<joey> So, I don't know if I've told this story on Trash Taste. </joey>
<joey> But like, this is like five, six years ago. </joey>
<joey> I went to a con in Montreal. </joey>
<garnt> And you know, I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> hanging out with a bunch of mates or whatever. </garnt>
<garnt> And then I was flying back to Australia, </garnt>
<garnt> but I had to stop by in Toronto first. </garnt>
<garnt> So it was like, Montreal to Toronto, </garnt>
<garnt> and then Toronto back to Sydney. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - So then, I got to Montreal Airport, </garnt>
<connor> and I was like, "I can't find my fucking passport." </connor>
<connor> And you know, this is the first time ever </connor>
<joey> I've lost my passport, let alone overseas, right? </joey>
<joey> Which is fucking terrifying. </joey>
<joey> I find out later that my friend who was with me </joey>
<joey> at the con the entire time, </joey>
<garnt> I had accidentally put my passport in his bag, </garnt>
<garnt> and he had already flown home </garnt>
<garnt> back to like, I think he lives in like, </garnt>
<garnt> San Jose or something. </garnt>
<garnt> So he was already in America, with my passport in his bag. </garnt>
<garnt> And so, I got to Montreal airport- </garnt>
<garnt> - That's like, nightmare. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] It was. It was a fucking nightmare, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - I think I'd cry. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. No, and like, </connor>
<connor> I got to Montreal airport, </connor>
<connor> I told them the situation, they were like, </connor>
<joey> "All right, what you can do is that, </joey>
<joey> there's an Australian embassy in Toronto anyway. </joey>
<joey> So just, we'll let you fly to Toronto at least, </joey>
<connor> but then you're gonna have to find a hotel, </connor>
<connor> go to the embassy, get a new passport." </connor>
<joey> - Right. - Right? </joey>
<joey> So, you know, I'm fucking freaking out, right? </joey>
<joey> So I fly to Toronto. </joey>
<joey> I put in a hotel. </joey>
<joey> And then my friend who had the passport was like, </joey>
<joey> "I can try and like, email," </joey>
<joey> not email, but like ... </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> "I can try and send this to you. </connor>
<joey> Like, mail it to you," right? </joey>
<joey> Through like, FedEx or whatever. </joey>
<connor> But like, I don't know how long it's gonna take, right? </connor>
<connor> Not to mention, it's technically in a different country. </connor>
<joey> So it has to go through like, customs and shit. </joey>
<joey> Right? </joey>
<joey> I stayed in that hotel for five days straight. </joey>
<joey> - Oh my god. </joey>
<joey> - Every day. </joey>
<joey> - FedEx? Took five days? </joey>
<joey> - Five days. </joey>
<connor> - Bruh. Bruh. </connor>
<connor> - Did he like, cheap out? </connor>
<joey> - No no no no no no! </joey>
<joey> It was stuck in customs for like, three and a half days. </joey>
<connor> - Bro! </connor>
<joey> - So it got to Canada, like on the morning of day two. </joey>
<joey> But because it's just a passport, </joey>
<joey> it was literally just stuck in customs for like, </joey>
<joey> three whole days. </joey>
<joey> - What the fuck were they doing? </joey>
<connor> - I don't know, checking it was legitimate or something? </connor>
<connor> Like, no illegal activities or whatever? </connor>
<connor> But like, I, dude like, </connor>
<connor> I was so fucking depressed. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause like, I'm stuck in this hotel, </connor>
<connor> in the middle of Toronto. </connor>
<connor> I don't know anyone who lives there, right? </connor>
<connor> I wake up in the morning, </connor>
<joey> and I'm literally sitting in front of the reception phone </joey>
<joey> just hoping that I get a call being like, </joey>
<joey> "You've got a package." </joey>
<joey> Right? </joey>
<connor> - I hope you had an ergonomic keyboard. </connor>
<joey> - No, I didn't. </joey>
<connor> - Fuck, man. </connor>
<garnt> - I was like, if I only had my 75%. </garnt>
<garnt> - Damn, dude! </garnt>
<garnt> - You were training up for COVID, man! </garnt>
<garnt> Like- </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I know. </garnt>
<garnt> So like, so the first thing I had to do though, </garnt>
<connor> was I had to go to Toronto airport </connor>
<connor> to like, change my flight, right? </connor>
<connor> To be like, "Hey, I've lost my passport. </connor>
<connor> I don't know what to do." </connor>
<connor> And it was like this like Canadian woman who was there. </connor>
<connor> And she was like, "Okay, um, you know, </connor>
<connor> because it's an unfortunate situation, </connor>
<joey> we can change your flight for free, </joey>
<joey> if you fly tomorrow." </joey>
<joey> And you know, I didn't know when this package </joey>
<joey> was gonna arrive, right? </joey>
<joey> So I was just like, "Okay yeah, sure, let's do that." </joey>
<joey> You know. </joey>
<joey> Just so I don't get my flight completely canceled. </joey>
<joey> Of course, next day happens. </joey>
<connor> It doesn't arrive. </connor>
<joey> - [Connor] Oh shit. </joey>
<joey> - So then the next day I had to go back to Toronto airport, </joey>
<joey> and the same woman was there. </joey>
<joey> And she was like, "Okay. If you wanna change it to like, </joey>
<joey> two or three days later, </joey>
<joey> which is the next available flight, </joey>
<joey> it's gonna cost you like, you know, </joey>
<joey> a couple of thousand dollars." </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Jesus. </joey>
<joey> - Right? </joey>
<joey> And at the time, you know, </joey>
<joey> because I'd only just started doing YouTube. </joey>
<joey> I didn't have that kinda money. </joey>
<joey> I was still living off fucking scraps, right? </joey>
<joey> For YouTube Ad rev. </joey>
<joey> And so I was like, and you know, </joey>
<joey> I was like, on the verge of tears, </joey>
<garnt> being like- - I would be too! </garnt>
<joey> - I was like- </joey>
<garnt> - On the verge? I'd be crying already! Like- </garnt>
<joey> - I was on the verge of tears and just being like, </joey>
<connor> and I was just like, </connor>
<connor> "I don't have that kind of money right now." </connor>
<connor> And I was like, what do I do? </connor>
<connor> Should I call my mum? </connor>
<connor> But it's like, three in the morning </connor>
<connor> in Australia right now. </connor>
<connor> Blah blah blah blah blah. </connor>
<connor> And then the woman just like, kinda like, </connor>
<connor> was just looking at me panicking for a little bit. </connor>
<connor> And then she just starts typing away on a keyboard. </connor>
<connor> And then she prints out this ticket. </connor>
<connor> For two days to go. </connor>
<connor> And she hands it to me, </connor>
<connor> and then she just, I'll never forget it, </connor>
<connor> she just says, "I'd better not see you here ever again." </connor>
<garnt> (chuckling) </garnt>
<joey> - Oh my god! </joey>
<joey> - And she just gave me this free ticket. </joey>
<garnt> Dude, I fucking cried. </garnt>
<joey> I just like, I like, </joey>
<joey> I got on my knees and I just broke down crying. </joey>
<joey> Because this lady just literally just gave me this </joey>
<garnt> $2000 plane ticket. </garnt>
<garnt> Just, because she felt sorry for me? </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm like, that would never happen in Japan. </garnt>
<connor> In Japan it's like, "Hold on, I gotta call up the manager," </connor>
<connor> and then the manager's manager. </connor>
<connor> - Oh no. In Japan they'd be like, sorry. </connor>
<connor> - They would never let it happen. </connor>
<connor> So like, luckily, </connor>
<connor> two days later, I got the fucking, </connor>
<connor> you know, passport, and I got the package. </connor>
<connor> And I fucking ripped that shit open in the hotel room, </connor>
<joey> saw my passport, broke down crying again, </joey>
<joey> because I'm like, finally I can go home! </joey>
<joey> And then, yeah. </joey>
<joey> I got to Toronto airport and I got my flight back. </joey>
<joey> And I was like, whoever you were, lady, </joey>
<joey> I will never fucking forget you. </joey>
<joey> That was like, that was the moment where I was like, </joey>
<joey> you know what? </joey>
<joey> People are awesome. </joey>
<joey> There is a god! </joey>
<garnt> - I can confirm that that would never happen in Japan, </garnt>
<garnt> because I didn't have that much of a stressful situation, </garnt>
<garnt> but something kinda similar happened to me recently. </garnt>
<joey> So, recently we went on a trip together. </joey>
<joey> And after the trip, I was meant to fly to America. </joey>
<connor> Fly to America to meet Sydney's family. </connor>
<connor> Because I haven't seen them since before COVID, </connor>
<connor> so I wanted to see them once before I get married, </connor>
<connor> and become one big happy family. </connor>
<connor> So I had the tickets booked, </connor>
<connor> and because the schedule was so tight, </connor>
<connor> I had pre-packed all of my travel stuff </connor>
<connor> before going on the trip with the boys, basically. </connor>
<connor> Sydney flew out, I believe like, a week before me. </connor>
<connor> So she had flown off already, right? </connor>
<joey> And I remember, I packed everything before. </joey>
<joey> And I put my passport in my travel bag. </joey>
<joey> Right? </joey>
<joey> And I remember coming home, </joey>
<joey> and I remember being absolutely knackered </joey>
<joey> from coming back from this boys' trip. </joey>
<joey> And then I was just like, </joey>
<joey> checking everything was ready to go, </joey>
<joey> ready to fly in like a day or two. </joey>
<joey> And then I notice the bag is missing. </joey>
<joey> - Oh no. - Oh shit! </joey>
<joey> - And then I start panicking, </joey>
<joey> 'cause I know the most like, </joey>
<joey> if there's one document I need, </joey>
<joey> it's my passport! </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, of course. </joey>
<joey> - Right? Especially because </joey>
<joey> I'm getting married in two months. </joey>
<joey> I can't be losing my fucking passport. </joey>
<joey> I need to fly back to the UK. </joey>
<joey> So I like start fucking searching around the house </joey>
<connor> and everything, and I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> "She better not have. </connor>
<connor> She better not have." </connor>
<connor> And I phone her, I phone her, </connor>
<connor> and she's asleep, and it's 2 a.m. right? </connor>
<connor> - Wake the fuck up! </connor>
<garnt> - I give her like 10 phone calls, she's not picking up. </garnt>
<garnt> Phone her mum, she's not picking up. </garnt>
<joey> Luckily her dad was still awake. </joey>
<joey> Luckily, I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> "Russel, I need you to do me a massive favor. </joey>
<joey> Can you wake Sydney up now? </joey>
<joey> Can you wake Sydney up, right now! </joey>
<joey> Right now!" </joey>
<connor> And so, yeah. </connor>
<connor> He rushes over, he wakes Sydney up, </connor>
<connor> and I'm like, "Sydney, do you have the bag? </connor>
<connor> Do you have the bag, Sydney?" </connor>
<connor> And she was like, (mumbles incoherently) </connor>
<connor> What? </connor>
<connor> I was like, "Sydney! Sydney, this is not the time </connor>
<connor> to be asleep! You need to wake up now, </connor>
<connor> and you need to check that you have the fucking </connor>
<connor> Aska travel bag, okay? Do you have it?" </connor>
<connor> And she's just like, "Um, yeah. Yeah I have it." </connor>
<garnt> I'm like, "Is my passport in there?" </garnt>
<garnt> And she's like, "Oh fuck." </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> Oh fuck! </garnt>
<garnt> And so, like she, like ... </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, I don't know why she had </garnt>
<garnt> never used this bag before, like, </garnt>
<garnt> this is the one time she decided to use this </garnt>
<garnt> as a travel bag. </garnt>
<connor> But unfortunately she didn't check the contents </connor>
<connor> of the bag, so ... </connor>
<connor> - Who doesn't check a bag? </connor>
<connor> Was there like, nothing else in this bag? </connor>
<connor> Was it just the passport in the bag? </connor>
<garnt> - It was my passport and my other like, </garnt>
<joey> vaccine travel documents that I needed. </joey>
<joey> - So basically all, everything you needed. </joey>
<garnt> - So, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> So everything I needed to travel out of Japan. </connor>
<connor> - What the actual fuck? </connor>
<garnt> - So it was like, empty. </garnt>
<garnt> It started from like the front pocket </garnt>
<garnt> which had like, literally like, </garnt>
<garnt> the one, everything I needed. </garnt>
<garnt> - Your life. - Yeah, my life. My life. </garnt>
<garnt> - Your proof for existence. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, my proof of existence to Japan, right? </garnt>
<garnt> And so we're like trying to like, </garnt>
<garnt> plan this out to be like, </garnt>
<connor> can I make this flight if we like, </connor>
<connor> do a frame perfect like, </connor>
<connor> frame perfect drop of this to like, </connor>
<connor> fucking DHL, right? </connor>
<garnt> And we're like, "What's the closest DHL?" </garnt>
<connor> Okay, so it's this place. </connor>
<connor> We can go home, you can wake up tomorrow and go get it. </connor>
<connor> And then, I've realized unfortunately, </connor>
<connor> it's America, and they don't work on the weekends. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. Oh fuck! </connor>
<garnt> - So I'm like, oh fuck! </garnt>
<garnt> I have to wait two days before they can even </garnt>
<joey> put the drop-off. </joey>
<garnt> Even if DHL are like, super on point, </garnt>
<garnt> which they were, actually. </garnt>
<garnt> DHL were like, very fast about it. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm still not gonna get it in time. </garnt>
<garnt> So, I have to like, </garnt>
<garnt> if I wanna go to America- </garnt>
<garnt> - Change the strat! </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I have to like, delay. </garnt>
<joey> I have to like, change the flights, right? </joey>
<joey> So that was stressful enough, </joey>
<joey> not having my passport on me, right? </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So I remember phoning up ANA. </joey>
<joey> To be like, look. </joey>
<joey> I'm in this situation now. </joey>
<joey> Like, I don't know if I qualify for a change of flight. </joey>
<joey> Because the thing is, like, </joey>
<joey> I believe I bought a flexible ticket, right? </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right. </joey>
<joey> - So I wasn't, I didn't buy one on like, </joey>
<connor> I didn't buy a ticket, on like some random fucking site. </connor>
<connor> - You bought it from ANA. </connor>
<connor> - I bought it from ANA itself, right? </connor>
<connor> And so I thought, paying like, </connor>
<connor> a bit of a premium price, </connor>
<connor> as opposed to buying from like, </connor>
<joey> fucking Skyscanner or whatever, </joey>
<joey> that I, you know, </joey>
<joey> that there was a little bit of wiggle room on that, right? </joey>
<connor> 'Cause it wasn't a cheap ticket. </connor>
<connor> And like, I don't know why flying to America right now </connor>
<joey> is so fucking expensive, from like everywhere. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause it was like, the cheapest economy ticket they had, </joey>
<joey> and it was still like, fucking like, </joey>
<joey> almost like a grand, or like two grand. </joey>
<joey> I can't fucking remember. </joey>
<connor> - Jesus. - Jeez. </connor>
<garnt> - One way? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, one way! </garnt>
<garnt> - Fucking hell! </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah yeah yeah, it was like ... </garnt>
<connor> - Aren't one way flights though, weirdly expensive? </connor>
<joey> - Return flights are like, weirdly more, </joey>
<connor> like less expensive. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah yeah yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I think it's something to do with how long you're gone </connor>
<connor> and there's different price points based on </connor>
<connor> if you're flying with the same carrier </connor>
<connor> and how far apart you're flying. </connor>
<garnt> - Something like that. </garnt>
<connor> - There's some really strange rules with ticket pricing. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, so I phone up ANA, </connor>
<connor> and I'm like, look, </connor>
<connor> here's the situation. </connor>
<joey> Can I change my flight? </joey>
<joey> Can I change my flight to, you know, </joey>
<joey> a few days after? </joey>
<joey> Or whatever's convenient. </joey>
<joey> And they're like, "Yes, there's a flight on X day, </joey>
<joey> that's still available, I've still got seats." </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, great! </joey>
<connor> Can I change to that flight? </connor>
<connor> How much would it cost? Would it cost anything? </connor>
<connor> And I remember her like, hearing like the, </connor>
<connor> the keyboard tapping. </connor>
<connor> - That's never good. </connor>
<connor> - And then she pauses. </connor>
<connor> And she pauses, and she's just like, </connor>
<connor> "Um, hold on, can I, </connor>
<connor> I need to go see the manager quickly." </connor>
<connor> - Oh my god. </connor>
<connor> - And I'm like, that's not- </connor>
<connor> - That's not a good sign. </connor>
<connor> - That's not a good fucking sign. </connor>
<connor> - Everything in Japan. </connor>
<connor> If anything needs the manager. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah yeah yeah. 'Cause I'm like, oh man, </connor>
<connor> how many hundreds of dollars am I gonna have to like </connor>
<connor> fucking pay to like change my flights? </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And then like, I wait for like five minutes, </connor>
<connor> I'm like, okay, I can afford like a few hundred dollars </connor>
<connor> luckily enough. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I really wanna go see the family. </connor>
<connor> And then she comes back. </connor>
<connor> And then she's like, </connor>
<garnt> "Okay. I have just confirmed with my manager. </garnt>
<garnt> If you would like to change your plane ticket </garnt>
<garnt> to this date, it is $4000." </garnt>
<garnt> - What? </garnt>
<garnt> - And I was like ... </garnt>
<joey> Can you repeat that? </joey>
<joey> - Could you repeat that? </joey>
<joey> Could you repeat that? </joey>
<joey> - Could you repeat that? </joey>
<connor> - That doesn't make any fucking sense! </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause they said it in yen, right? </connor>
<joey> 'Cause they said it in yen, I was just like ... </joey>
<joey> - 400,000 yen. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, so I was like, </joey>
<joey> "My Japanese must be rusty, </joey>
<joey> 'cause I think I must have misheard." </joey>
<joey> - There must have been some static! </joey>
<joey> - Yeah! 'Cause I think like, </joey>
<joey> is that what it is in Japanese? </joey>
<joey> I must have added an extra zero in my head, </joey>
<joey> because that is not 400,000 yen. </joey>
<connor> I must have heard 40,000 yen. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And just misheard. </connor>
<connor> So I was like, "Could you repeat that please?" </connor>
<joey> And then they repeated that, and I was just like, </joey>
<joey> "So, to confirm, in English, </joey>
<joey> that is 400,000 yen, right?" </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I was like, I'm like, </joey>
<joey> my (indistinct) is not (indistinct) enough. </joey>
<joey> I'm (indistinct) right now. </joey>
<joey> My (indistinct) is definitely not </joey>
<joey> (indistinct) enough right now. </joey>
<joey> I'm mishearing this, right? </joey>
<joey> - Oh my god! </joey>
<joey> - And then she was like, yes, </joey>
<joey> it is 400,000 yen. </joey>
<joey> And I was just like ... how is this possible? </joey>
<garnt> And she was like, "I apologize. </garnt>
<garnt> Because there's a small change fee </garnt>
<garnt> and the tax is different." </garnt>
<connor> Like, I couldn't understand. </connor>
<garnt> Like, no matter what she says, </garnt>
<garnt> there is no justification </garnt>
<garnt> for an increase from like- </garnt>
<connor> - Yes, you got a flex ticket </connor>
<garnt> and somehow it ended up costing </garnt>
<connor> more than the original ticket. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, like you're not, </joey>
<joey> you didn't like, upgrade to business class or anything, </joey>
<garnt> right, like that's the kind of price we're talking about. </garnt>
<joey> - This was economy. </joey>
<joey> And I was just like, "Is that 4000 yen </joey>
<joey> on top of the two?" </joey>
<joey> Like, is that- </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] On top of the thousand. </joey>
<joey> - Is that like, 4000 on top of the ticket </joey>
<joey> that I just already paid for? </joey>
<joey> And she was like, yes. </joey>
<joey> - Wow. </joey>
<joey> - So- </joey>
<joey> - So it's a $5000 one-way ticket to America. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah yeah! </joey>
<joey> And so like, I'm like, </joey>
<joey> "There is no fucking way this makes sense." </joey>
<joey> So I go on fucking Skyscanner. </joey>
<joey> Like, as we're on the call, </joey>
<joey> and I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> "I can see, I can buy a ticket on your website </joey>
<connor> for $2000. Like, a new ticket for $2000. </connor>
<connor> How does it make sense that you're charging me </connor>
<connor> $4000 to change my ticket? </connor>
<connor> To change it? Change it, right?" </connor>
<connor> And she was like, "I apologize, sir, </connor>
<connor> that's just how the system works. </connor>
<garnt> It's the upcharge for changing the ticket." </garnt>
<garnt> - No, that's a scam, bro. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I'm just like, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> So, it's cheaper for me to buy a new ticket </garnt>
<garnt> even if it's like double the price at this point </garnt>
<garnt> from what I originally paid. </garnt>
<connor> Can I get a refund for the original </connor>
<connor> ticket I paid? </connor>
<connor> - It's gonna cost you $1000. </connor>
<connor> - For the original ticket I paid. </connor>
<connor> In order to get the refund back </connor>
<connor> so I can buy a new ticket. </connor>
<connor> And she was like, "Oh yes. </connor>
<garnt> The cancellation fee will be $900." </garnt>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - How? How? </connor>
<connor> What's the justification? </connor>
<connor> - How does that work? </connor>
<connor> - Didn't you buy a flexible ticket? </connor>
<connor> Isn't the whole point of these that they- </connor>
<garnt> - Flexible tickets means you can change it. </garnt>
<connor> You can't refund it. </connor>
<garnt> - Some of them let you. </garnt>
<garnt> - Some of them do! </garnt>
<joey> - You can change it! </joey>
<joey> - Some of them do, and I was just like, </joey>
<garnt> "Am I talking to the circus right now?" </garnt>
<garnt> Like, I didn't say that, </garnt>
<garnt> but that's what I wanted to say. </garnt>
<garnt> - You are not the clown! </garnt>
<garnt> You are the whole circus right now. </garnt>
<connor> - Am I applying for clown (indistinct)? </connor>
<joey> What's going on? </joey>
<connor> Oh my god, dude. </connor>
<connor> - So my choices are either to </connor>
<connor> pay $4000 to change my ticket, </connor>
<connor> or to like, get $900, </connor>
<joey> to pay $900 to cancel a ticket- </joey>
<joey> - To buy a $2000 ticket. </joey>
<joey> - To buy a new $2000 ticket. </joey>
<joey> And I'm just like, I am not doing this! </joey>
<joey> I'm like, after like, </joey>
<joey> so, for the first time in my life, </joey>
<joey> I was like, "Can I speak to the manager?" </joey>
<joey> Like, I, 'cause the thing is, </joey>
<joey> I am not the type of guy who goes Karen mode, okay? </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Of course, of course. </joey>
<joey> - I am not the type of guy. </joey>
<garnt> But they were taking the piss! </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, I think anyone in that situation </joey>
<joey> would go Karen mode, 'cause that's fucking ridiculous. </joey>
<joey> Like ... </joey>
<joey> - So I ask for the manager, and like, </joey>
<garnt> it was, the reasoning for like the upcharge of that much </garnt>
<garnt> is because I wanted the flight within like, </garnt>
<garnt> if I had waited I believe like, </garnt>
<garnt> I believe like eight days, eight or nine days, </garnt>
<joey> then it would be a lot cheaper, </joey>
<joey> but because there was this like, window, </joey>
<joey> where I wanted to change the flight to, </joey>
<joey> even though there were flights available, </joey>
<joey> and the flight ticket was cheaper to buy new, </joey>
<joey> changing to that, </joey>
<joey> changing to within that date range </joey>
<joey> meant that they had to upcharge the ticket. </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> - And there was nothing that- </joey>
<joey> - Which still doesn't make sense. </joey>
<joey> - Yes, which still doesn't make sense, </joey>
<joey> so there was nothing I could do about it. </joey>
<joey> I talked to the manager, I was like, </joey>
<joey> "Look, is there anything you can do at all, </joey>
<joey> because like, I'm not lying, </joey>
<joey> but this is ridiculous." </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - You are not giving me any way out- </joey>
<connor> - I'd be pissed off. </connor>
<connor> - You are not giving me a solution. </connor>
<connor> My solution is, I pay $900 to pay $2000. </connor>
<garnt> Like ... </garnt>
<garnt> - That is so dumb. </garnt>
<joey> - Like like like, you are not- </joey>
<connor> - That's literally like the enter the lottery </connor>
<connor> to buy the ticket, you know? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah yeah yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh my god! </joey>
<connor> - So, unfortunately, I didn't get a solution. </connor>
<connor> I lost $900 to cancel my ticket, </connor>
<connor> and I flew to England for a fraction of the price </connor>
<connor> for this headache to go to America. </connor>
<connor> - Christ. </connor>
<connor> - So yeah, unfortunately- </connor>
<connor> - I don't know what's going on with flights to America. </connor>
<connor> It's insane right now. </connor>
<connor> I was trying to get flights from the UK. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Inflation, dude. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, flights from the UK to America as well, </connor>
<joey> it's crazy expensive! </joey>
<joey> - Really? </joey>
<joey> - I was like, what the fuck? Yeah. </joey>
<connor> Meanwhile, flights from Tokyo to London were like, </connor>
<joey> it was like $1000 with business! </joey>
<joey> I was like, what the fuck is going on? </joey>
<joey> What is happening? </joey>
<joey> - No one's wanting to go to the UK right now. </joey>
<connor> - Well, I think no one's wanting to go from Tokyo as well. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, that's true, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. So okay, I got, </garnt>
<garnt> because I gotta ask now. </garnt>
<connor> Just remind me, have you guys ever gone full Karen? </connor>
<connor> Have you guys ever needed to like, </connor>
<connor> ask for the manager? </connor>
<joey> - [Connor] I don't think so! </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Joey, don't answer that! </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - I could legitimately say no, </joey>
<joey> but of course the entire fucking audience is gonna be like, </joey>
<joey> (indistinct). </joey>
<garnt> But like, legitimately, no I haven't. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause, just like, I'm not the kind of person </garnt>
<garnt> to like, go to a restaurant and be like, </garnt>
<joey> "My soup is 20 minutes late." </joey>
<joey> I'm just like, I don't fucking care. </joey>
<connor> - I feel like I normally try to like, </connor>
<joey> when I'm talking in those situations, </joey>
<joey> I normally try to build up some rapport with the person </joey>
<joey> I'm talking to. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah! </joey>
<joey> - And they'll normally be like, </joey>
<joey> "Yo listen, you know, </joey>
<joey> nothing can be done." </joey>
<joey> And I'll be like, "I mean, I'll take your word for it." </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, there's like, you know, </connor>
<connor> I feel there's like, </connor>
<connor> if there is a problem with some kinda service or, </connor>
<connor> you know, situation, </connor>
<connor> there's only so much that </connor>
<connor> I know the manager can do anyway, </connor>
<connor> so I'm just like, just don't even bother. </connor>
<connor> I'll fold, I don't give a fuck. </connor>
<joey> Like, it's not a life or death situation. </joey>
<connor> - In that situation I'd be tempted to, </connor>
<connor> but even then I'm like, I'm so lazy that I'm like, </connor>
<connor> all right, I guess ... </connor>
<joey> - I also don't wanna cause a scene. </joey>
<garnt> You know, even though I'm perfectly in the right </garnt>
<garnt> to cause a scene, because I'm the one getting fucked over, </garnt>
<garnt> like, there's a part of me that's just like, </garnt>
<garnt> no, I don't wanna like, </garnt>
<garnt> be the asshole, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> So it's like, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know, I don't think I've ever ... </garnt>
<joey> - I've never done it, </joey>
<joey> but I mean, I don't think like, </joey>
<joey> I don't know, it's weird, </joey>
<joey> 'cause like, if you cause a scene, </joey>
<joey> sometimes you get what you want. </joey>
<joey> It sucks. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, right? </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause it's like, I don't, </joey>
<joey> I'd just rather not. </joey>
<joey> - I've been in situations where- </joey>
<connor> - Wish you would just treat me like a human being. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. I've been in situations </joey>
<joey> where I've been in like a restaurant or whatever, </joey>
<garnt> and I've seen someone else cause a scene, </garnt>
<garnt> and they get what they want, </garnt>
<joey> and I'm just like, what an asshole! </joey>
<joey> You know? </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause the thing is like, </joey>
<garnt> it's, 'cause I hardly ever go full Karen, </garnt>
<connor> but I've seen it work. </connor>
<connor> I just like, I could, </connor>
<connor> I don't have the ability to do that myself. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I remember like, on this trip back to England, </connor>
<joey> there was this point where, </joey>
<joey> we were on a night out. </joey>
<joey> We were with all our friends, right? </joey>
<joey> And Sydney was tired, </joey>
<joey> and so like, I took her home, </joey>
<joey> took her home like, earlier. </joey>
<joey> Everyone else went on drinking. </joey>
<joey> And eventually they ended up in a casino, right? </joey>
<joey> And so I was like, cool, I'm not tired yet. </joey>
<joey> Is it cool if I go out to, you know, </joey>
<joey> continue with my mates and continue drinking </joey>
<joey> and have fun? </joey>
<joey> And then I was like, yeah. </joey>
<joey> Sydney was already passed out, so I was like, cool. </joey>
<garnt> I'm just gonna go. </garnt>
<connor> - Please make noise if you object. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - I don't hear anything! </garnt>
<connor> (overlapping chatter) </connor>
<joey> - And so there was a sizable group inside the casino. </joey>
<joey> So I get there, and I wanna go in, </joey>
<connor> and there's a bouncer at the door. </connor>
<connor> And he's just like, sorry. </connor>
<connor> You can't come in unless you're a member. </connor>
<connor> And I was just like, but, </connor>
<connor> I know you've let plenty of other people in, </connor>
<connor> because my entire friend group is in there. </connor>
<connor> And my entire friend group was in there, </connor>
<connor> and they weren't members, </connor>
<connor> so what's happening with that? </connor>
<connor> And then he was just like, </connor>
<connor> oh, you know, </connor>
<connor> he was like, sorry, no members right now. </connor>
<connor> No entry right now unless you're a member. </connor>
<connor> And I was just like, </connor>
<connor> I know, like, </connor>
<connor> I know he can let me in, you know? </connor>
<connor> It's not like a massive casino, </connor>
<connor> and the thing is, I see people walking out. </connor>
<joey> I see like, plenty of people walking out. </joey>
<joey> And I like, you know when you can tell, </joey>
<joey> like, that there's a bouncer, </joey>
<joey> who just wants to go on a power trip. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah yeah yeah. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Like, you know what I mean. </joey>
<joey> You know what I mean. </joey>
<connor> - Of course, of course. </connor>
<connor> - I like, I knew it wasn't like, </connor>
<connor> it wasn't like the busiest place in London or whatever. </connor>
<connor> It was a place that I knew the bouncer was just </connor>
<connor> trying to be an asshole. </connor>
<connor> Because I could clearly see </connor>
<connor> there were people walking in and out, right? </connor>
<connor> And there were people that were going out </connor>
<connor> and saying that they were leaving, </connor>
<connor> and so I was just like, okay, </connor>
<connor> what is the right angle to go for </connor>
<connor> to try and get myself in, right? </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause I guess you wanna see your friends, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, 'cause I'm like, </connor>
<connor> I really wanna see my friends, </connor>
<garnt> because the night wasn't even like that late. </garnt>
<connor> - Was it like a Saturday or something? </connor>
<connor> Was it a Saturday or, like a Tuesday? </connor>
<garnt> - I believe it was a Sunday. </garnt>
<connor> - I could understand maybe if it was a Saturday, </connor>
<joey> it was really busy, you know, </joey>
<garnt> they'd maybe wanna limit it </garnt>
<garnt> to customers they know are gonna spend </garnt>
<garnt> a shit ton of money. </garnt>
<connor> - But it wasn't even like that busy, right? </connor>
<connor> - No, it wasn't even that busy. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, so he's just being a dick. </joey>
<joey> (chuckling) </joey>
<joey> - Because, 'cause here's, </joey>
<joey> so 'cause like, so I'm like, </joey>
<joey> okay, I gotta at least try to get in, right? </joey>
<joey> Because if I don't get in, </joey>
<connor> I didn't get to say goodbye to all my friends </connor>
<connor> and like my night's over. </connor>
<connor> So I'm gonna at least like, try to get in. </connor>
<connor> And of course, I don't go full Karen. </connor>
<connor> I try to go for like- </connor>
<connor> - 75%. </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - So I go for the friendly approach. </garnt>
<garnt> You know? Like ... </garnt>
<connor> - You gotta start from like the moment one, right? </connor>
<garnt> - The rapport approach, right? </garnt>
<garnt> The rapport approach. </garnt>
<connor> - The (indistinct) approach. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, the (indistinct) approach! </garnt>
<garnt> - But there's nothing wrong with like, </garnt>
<joey> being like, tryna explain, </joey>
<joey> like, just, </joey>
<joey> you know, maybe if there's not like a giant line behind you. </joey>
<joey> Listen, I wanna see my friends, </joey>
<joey> they're all in there. </joey>
<connor> (chattering in agreement) </connor>
<garnt> - Calmly explain the situation, right? Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - I'd be like, look mate, </joey>
<joey> like I understand that you don't want like </joey>
<joey> a big group of like, strangers coming in or whatever </joey>
<joey> at this time of the hour. </joey>
<joey> I get that, you know, </joey>
<joey> you're just like, you got some rules </joey>
<joey> that you need to follow and everything like that. </joey>
<joey> Look, I'll be honest. </joey>
<joey> I'm just one guy. </joey>
<joey> I'm not local around here, </joey>
<joey> because I've literally flown in from Japan </joey>
<joey> just to hang out with my mates, </joey>
<joey> and I don't get this chance often. </joey>
<joey> And I was just like- </joey>
<joey> - The sympathy approach. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause I was like, dude, </joey>
<joey> I'm not here to like, ruin your night. </joey>
<joey> I'm not here to like, </joey>
<connor> I will spend fucking money in there. </connor>
<connor> I know you just don't want </connor>
<connor> some fucking random dickhead </connor>
<connor> just like walking in and everything like that. </connor>
<connor> I am not that random dickhead. </connor>
<garnt> I'm not drunk. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like a good- </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm a good boy! </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm a good boy, okay? </garnt>
<garnt> - I can attest. </garnt>
<garnt> Garnt is very well behaved. </garnt>
<garnt> Garnt is very very well behaved. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like, I was trying to be as </garnt>
<garnt> well fucking spoken as possible. </garnt>
<joey> This was like me like, </joey>
<joey> putting on the tuxedo, like- </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Speech 100. </joey>
<joey> - The Winnie the Pooh meme. </joey>
<joey> Speech 100, but like, </joey>
<connor> fucking hell, this guy just was not having it. </connor>
<connor> He was like- </connor>
<garnt> - Some bouncers are like that. </garnt>
<connor> They're just like, they're not having it. </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause the thing is, he would not even like, </garnt>
<connor> have a conversation with me. </connor>
<connor> Like he was like, no. </connor>
<garnt> - I can get it, 'cause they probably deal with like </garnt>
<garnt> some really fucking awful asshole drunks. </garnt>
<garnt> - I get it, I get it. I get it. </garnt>
<garnt> - But at the same time it's like, </garnt>
<joey> sometimes you're like, dude, </joey>
<joey> I'm not the problem here, dude! </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm not the one causing you problems! </garnt>
<connor> I guess maybe I am by talking to you too much, but ... </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> I was just like, look, </garnt>
<garnt> you know, and eventually, </garnt>
<garnt> I was just like ... </garnt>
<garnt> Fine, I guess, </garnt>
<garnt> you know, I guess my night's over. </garnt>
<garnt> And then one of my friends comes out, right? </garnt>
<connor> And she sees what's going on, </connor>
<connor> she's like, "What's going on here?" </connor>
<connor> And I was like, they have some rules, </connor>
<connor> and the bouncer's just like, </connor>
<connor> not communicating with me at all. </connor>
<connor> I don't think there's any way to get in. </connor>
<connor> And she's like, bet. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> She's like, Karen mode activated. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> There was like, an instant like, </joey>
<joey> an instant switch to be like, </joey>
<garnt> "Um, excuse me? Like, do you know that </garnt>
<joey> he's getting married in a month!" </joey>
<joey> - I thought she was gonna be like, </joey>
<garnt> "Do you know who he is? </garnt>
<garnt> He's the anime zone! </garnt>
<garnt> The greatest YouTuber!" </garnt>
<garnt> - And she goes, and she's able to just like, </garnt>
<garnt> go on this like, somehow- </garnt>
<connor> - This guy probably wants to get rid of her. </connor>
<garnt> He's like, fuck this. </garnt>
<garnt> Fuck off. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like this fucking five minute rant, right? </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, you know, </garnt>
<joey> when Senator Armstrong is just like, standing there, </joey>
<joey> and (indistinct) is just like fucking like, </joey>
<joey> pulling the punches, and he's just ... </joey>
<joey> - It's not budging. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, he's not budging! </joey>
<joey> But like, after about five minutes, </joey>
<joey> he's just like, "Fine, you can go in." </joey>
<joey> I was just like, "That worked? That worked?" </joey>
<joey> I thought being like the nice guy would work! </joey>
<garnt> But just like, fucking like, </garnt>
<garnt> going like, just like, </garnt>
<garnt> just going full Karen and just like, </garnt>
<garnt> calling for the manager </garnt>
<garnt> and just like, not letting up? </garnt>
<garnt> That works sometimes! </garnt>
<joey> - But I think that's the thing, right? </joey>
<joey> It's like, I think the reason why </joey>
<joey> I don't go Karen mode, like, ever, </joey>
<joey> is because I've been on the other side of that before. </joey>
<joey> Like when I used to work at like a bar. </joey>
<connor> And like, oh my god, I still remember this dickhead </connor>
<connor> to this day, but like, </connor>
<connor> it was this absolute knobhead who, like, </connor>
<connor> he came in. </connor>
<connor> I was working, when I was working up at the ski (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> I was working behind a bar, some nights. </connor>
<connor> And you know, I had to pour like beers and shit </connor>
<connor> and whatever. </connor>
<connor> But then of course this fucking, </connor>
<connor> this dickhead walks in with like, 10 of his mates, right? </connor>
<connor> And he was like, and he said, </connor>
<connor> "Oi, oi, can you come here for a second?" </connor>
<connor> And I was like, oh, you're talking to me? </connor>
<joey> All right, yeah, whatever. </joey>
<joey> That's a bit weird. </joey>
<joey> And then he's like, "Can we get 20 B-52s please?" </joey>
<joey> And to explain what a B-52 is, </joey>
<joey> it's this liqueur shot </joey>
<joey> that's three layers, right? </joey>
<joey> And so the layering shit, </joey>
<joey> if you've ever made layering stuff, </joey>
<joey> you gotta like, slowly pour it, </joey>
<joey> at the back of a spoon, </joey>
<joey> otherwise it mixes, right? </joey>
<garnt> So in other words, making one of these takes a long time. </garnt>
<garnt> Because you wanna make it look nice, right? </garnt>
<garnt> And this motherfucker was like, 20 of them please. </garnt>
<garnt> And I was like, "Okay, sure." </garnt>
<garnt> I was the only one at the bar, right? </garnt>
<garnt> So I was like, all right, </garnt>
<garnt> I better start fucking slaving away at it then. </garnt>
<joey> But, you know, because it's, </joey>
<joey> you know, a restaurant, right? </joey>
<joey> And like a bar, I wanted it to like, look nice. </joey>
<joey> I'm not just gonna fucking pour it in, right? </joey>
<joey> I start pouring, you know, a couple of them. </joey>
<joey> And then around like, the third one that I'm making, </joey>
<joey> this dickhead just walks into the bar, </joey>
<joey> and he was like, "Oi, where the fuck are the B-52s?" </joey>
<joey> He was like, "Get your manager!" </joey>
<joey> And I was like, "Motherfucker, you wanna make it? </joey>
<connor> You wanna? Be my guest! </connor>
<connor> Be my guest, dickhead! </connor>
<connor> Make it right now! </connor>
<connor> You wanna make it any faster than me? </connor>
<connor> Do you want them or not? </connor>
<connor> You haven't even paid for it yet! </connor>
<connor> I don't even have to make 'em for you!" </connor>
<connor> And so of course, but you know, </connor>
<connor> that's what I said in my head, right? </connor>
<joey> But on the outside I was like, </joey>
<joey> "I'll get the manager right away." </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> So then the manager- </joey>
<joey> - I am the manager! </joey>
<joey> - So then I call the manager over, </joey>
<joey> and she's like this Japanese lady, right? </joey>
<joey> But like, you know, </joey>
<connor> who looks really nice on the outside, </connor>
<connor> but on the inside she's like, </connor>
<connor> a reverse Karen. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, 'cause she has to deal with like- </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause she has to deal with dickheads like this, right? </garnt>
<garnt> So then she comes out and you know, </garnt>
<garnt> this nice like, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> short Japanese lady comes out and she's like, </garnt>
<joey> "Oh, what seems to be the problem?" </joey>
<joey> And you know, this guy starts going off being like, </joey>
<joey> "Yeah, so he's fucking taking forever </joey>
<joey> making these drinks, you know, </joey>
<connor> like we've been waiting forever." </connor>
<connor> By forever they mean like, you know, 10 minutes. </connor>
<connor> Right? </connor>
<connor> And, I've never seen someone go </connor>
<joey> reverse Karen on a customer before, right? </joey>
<joey> And she was just like, "Um, excuse me? </joey>
<connor> Do you wanna make these? </connor>
<connor> I don't think so! </connor>
<joey> So give him some fucking time!" </joey>
<connor> - I love videos of like </connor>
<joey> the employees of fast food places </joey>
<joey> just chewing out fucking- </joey>
<connor> - Yeah yeah, just being like, </connor>
<joey> and she was just like, she literally was like, </joey>
<connor> "Get out." </connor>
<connor> - Good, yeah! </connor>
<joey> Fucking too right! </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, and you know, </joey>
<joey> he was, you know, </joey>
<joey> going off and being like, </joey>
<connor> "This is the worst place ever. </connor>
<connor> Fuck you guys." </connor>
<connor> She was like, I don't give a fuck. </connor>
<connor> Get out. Get the fuck out, right now. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, and you know, </connor>
<joey> because I was like, fucking too shy and like, </joey>
<joey> scared to like say anything, </joey>
<joey> so in the back I was like, yeah! </joey>
<joey> Get 'em! </joey>
<joey> Yeah, get 'em! Get 'em! </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> So, I've been in that situation before. </joey>
<joey> So I think every time, you know, </joey>
<joey> I'm in a situation where, you know, </joey>
<joey> perhaps something is late or, you know, </joey>
<joey> where most people wouldn't want to go Karen mode </joey>
<joey> in some situations. </joey>
<joey> I always remember that situation, I'm like, no! </joey>
<joey> I don't wanna be that dickhead. </joey>
<joey> I'll wait. </joey>
<garnt> - Well because like, part of the reason that I was, </garnt>
<garnt> like, 'cause, I got like, </garnt>
<garnt> slightly annoyed at the bouncer, </garnt>
<connor> wasn't because of the fact that he wasn't letting me in. </connor>
<connor> But because like, he just refused to like, </connor>
<connor> engage with me. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - At all. Because like- </garnt>
<garnt> - He wouldn't explain it to you? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, he just wouldn't explain it to me! </connor>
<connor> Because like, I could like, </connor>
<connor> I could tell he was just like, </connor>
<joey> he probably had a bad day or something. </joey>
<joey> I don't fucking know, but like, </joey>
<joey> he just wanted to exert his power upon someone. </joey>
<connor> Like, I could feel that energy. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause like, I've been to like, </connor>
<joey> places before where </joey>
<joey> you talk to the bouncer, and they explain to you like, </joey>
<joey> look mate, it's (indistinct), </joey>
<joey> there's nothing I can do. </joey>
<joey> You know like, I would be like- </joey>
<joey> - Like they're like, trying to help you, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah! And I'd be like, I get it. </joey>
<joey> Because I'm like, I'm a human as well. </joey>
<joey> But like, I was like, </joey>
<connor> he was like, nah. </connor>
<connor> Gotta prioritize our members. </connor>
<connor> And I was looking around. </connor>
<connor> I was like, thinking- </connor>
<connor> - Who? </connor>
<connor> - What fucking members? </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Who? </joey>
<connor> - It's you and me. </connor>
<joey> I was like, there is no line here. </joey>
<joey> There is no line. </joey>
<joey> There's no line of people waiting to come up. </joey>
<joey> I know for a fact, </joey>
<connor> because after I went in, </connor>
<connor> the casino was like 90% empty! </connor>
<connor> So I was just like, what? </connor>
<connor> I was just like, you know, </connor>
<connor> this is an asshole being an asshole, </connor>
<garnt> and this is like, the only thing that could beat an asshole </garnt>
<joey> is a Karen. </joey>
<joey> And like, (laughing) </joey>
<connor> - Unstoppable force beats an immovable object. </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> You know those YouTube videos </connor>
<garnt> where they're like, yeah, </garnt>
<joey> just like, bribe your way into everything, </joey>
<joey> you know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah yeah yeah! </joey>
<joey> - Like, oh you want an upgrade at a hotel room? </joey>
<joey> Just slip the person 50 bucks. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I've always thought about stuff like that. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I'm like, I'd love to be able to </connor>
<connor> have the slickness and the coolness </connor>
<connor> to pull that shit off, but I'm just thinking like, </connor>
<joey> how do I discreetly just give you like, 10 pounds? </joey>
<joey> In a way that like, doesn't make me look fucking stupid. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I was like, what if you say no to me? Right? </joey>
<connor> And I'm like, "Aw, gimme a second." </connor>
<connor> Just pull out a 10 note. </connor>
<connor> Can I come in? </connor>
<connor> - Please? - Please? </connor>
<connor> - Like, can I come in now? </connor>
<connor> Like, surely I would have to preemptively </connor>
<connor> give him some money. </connor>
<connor> And at that point, what if no one else paid money to get in, </connor>
<connor> and I'm the asshole who gave him 10 pounds? </connor>
<connor> And alternatively, what if you go to like that whole, </connor>
<connor> I see all those fucking TikToks of, </connor>
<garnt> just give your hotel check-in person 50 bucks! </garnt>
<garnt> Like, it's like, okay, </garnt>
<garnt> what if the hotel's just actually full? </garnt>
<joey> Like, you actually just gave them $50 </joey>
<garnt> and you're a dickhead? </garnt>
<connor> - I've seen that before though! </connor>
<garnt> Where like, I saw a guy at like a club </garnt>
<joey> or like a bar or something, </joey>
<joey> who like, you know, </joey>
<joey> did like the whole dickhead, being like, </joey>
<connor> pulls out a 20 and like, </connor>
<connor> puts it into the bouncer's, like, pocket. </connor>
<connor> And the bouncer looks at it and he's like, </connor>
<joey> "All right, gimme a second, </joey>
<joey> I'm gonna go talk to the manager about it." </joey>
<connor> And he goes in, he comes out and he's like, </connor>
<joey> "Sorry, we're full." </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> And then everyone in the line just starts laughing </joey>
<joey> being like, what a dickhead! </joey>
<connor> - I've seen it work and not work. </connor>
<joey> I've seen like ... </joey>
<joey> - When it doesn't work, it's hilarious. </joey>
<joey> - But to me it's like, all right, </joey>
<joey> the benefits don't outweigh the absolute humility </joey>
<joey> of getting rejected, trying to offer money to someone </joey>
<connor> to get into something. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, it's like you not only lost money, </joey>
<joey> but you also didn't get what you wanted. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah yeah. - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<connor> - There's some people who like have the, </connor>
<joey> I think they have the personality </joey>
<joey> that matches up to that kind of behavior. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah! </joey>
<joey> - I'm not slick at all. </joey>
<joey> I cannot do this stuff. </joey>
<joey> - I can't do that. </joey>
<joey> - And I've been with guys who are just like, </joey>
<connor> "Let's come to a solution," </connor>
<connor> and then they like, fucking give the 10 bucks- </connor>
<garnt> - Do you mean Jan? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I was like, just say Jan. Just say Jan. </garnt>
<connor> - I've not seen Jan do it, </connor>
<connor> but I bet Jan would do it. </connor>
<connor> - No, not unless like, </connor>
<garnt> Jan has the energy that he could pull it off. </garnt>
<joey> - No, Jan has the energy he can pull it off </joey>
<joey> without ever getting his wallet out. </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah but Jan would- </connor>
<joey> - He's just like, let's talk. </joey>
<joey> - Jan would do it, get rejected, </joey>
<joey> and then not care that he was rejected. </joey>
<joey> He'd just be like, okay, </joey>
<joey> we'll go somewhere else. </joey>
<garnt> But to me it's like, that's crushing embarrassing. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I can't do that. </garnt>
<garnt> - You know what? If you tell me it's full, </garnt>
<joey> I don't have a magical Karen that appears </joey>
<joey> to sort it out for me. </joey>
<joey> - I don't have like, Karen's not my, </joey>
<connor> I don't have like a- </connor>
<connor> - I'm like a cool Karen. </connor>
<joey> - I don't have like a stand I can pull out, </joey>
<connor> it's like, Karen! </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> - I don't have a Karen to come out and help me, so, </connor>
<garnt> I guess I'm done. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah 'cause like ... </joey>
<joey> - I'd just go for tryna be a clown a little bit, </joey>
<joey> maybe they'll feel like, oh that was funny. </joey>
<joey> I'll let this guy in. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah yeah yeah. </connor>
<garnt> I try and like, humor my way through things, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause- - It doesn't work. </garnt>
<joey> - No, it doesn't work. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause the thing about those bribes that I've seen </joey>
<garnt> is just like, how do you know how much to give? </garnt>
<garnt> You know like, what's the right amount to bribe someone </garnt>
<connor> of like- </connor>
<garnt> - Well, if you're tryna get into like, </garnt>
<connor> you know, a Michelin star restaurant, </connor>
<garnt> I don't know how that would work. </garnt>
<garnt> That doesn't make any sense. </garnt>
<joey> But like a club, if it's a shit club, </joey>
<joey> maybe you just give 'em like, I don't know- </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] I've got six pence. </joey>
<joey> - And I want two drinks. </joey>
<joey> Maybe people who do this often know. </joey>
<joey> There's a system. </joey>
<joey> I don't know. </joey>
<joey> - There's like a tier list, right? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, maybe they can explain it to me how it works. </garnt>
<garnt> Based on like, how nice or expensive the drinks are. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm like, I've never heard of being </garnt>
<garnt> rejected from a casino though. </garnt>
<joey> That's, only like drunk people get rejected </joey>
<garnt> from casinos normally. </garnt>
<garnt> Were you tipsy, Garnt? </garnt>
<garnt> - I was not tipsy. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like Garnt's telling the story </garnt>
<joey> meanwhile he was like, two bottles deep. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean- </garnt>
<joey> - He was like Wolf of Wall Street, </joey>
<garnt> like fucking crawling up to it. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's how I remember it at least! </garnt>
<garnt> I'm sure it came out as just like- </garnt>
<garnt> - Hello, my name is Garnt Maneetapho </garnt>
<joey> and I would like to enter this establishment. </joey>
<joey> And meanwhile, (groans incoherently). </joey>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - I just flew in from Japan! </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - Well you said you had to take Sydney home, right? </connor>
<joey> So odds are you probably, even if you did drink, </joey>
<connor> you probably would have fucking sobered out. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - He had to take Sydney home, so. </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - It was a good night. </garnt>
<garnt> We went to the casino. </garnt>
<joey> It was a happy end to the story. </joey>
<joey> - That's good. </joey>
<joey> - And it was the one time in my life that </joey>
<joey> seeing someone go full Karen </joey>
<joey> was impressive, and it actually worked as well. </joey>
<garnt> - Damn. Not that I would ever have the balls </garnt>
<joey> to do it myself. </joey>
<garnt> - No, I was just standing there, </garnt>
<garnt> and I was just, I was impressed. </garnt>
<joey> - That's what everyone needs, though. </joey>
<joey> Like, you don't need to be a Karen. </joey>
<joey> You just need to know a Karen. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - That's all you need. </joey>
<connor> You just need that one mate who will be there- </connor>
<connor> - Karens are bad, except for when they work for me. </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Karens suck, unless you can tell them </joey>
<joey> to do something that you want to get out of them. </joey>
<garnt> - Okay, no no no. </garnt>
<garnt> Karens suck unless the manager or the person </garnt>
<joey> is being an equal asshole. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Exactly, yeah. Agree. </joey>
<joey> - Like you know, like normally I don't advocate for this, </joey>
<joey> like, at all. </joey>
<garnt> Because you know, service people go through enough. </garnt>
<garnt> Service people go through- </garnt>
<garnt> - I see videos of people like, </garnt>
<connor> arguing at McDonald's, asking for free food. </connor>
<joey> I'm like, what happened at birth that you became like this? </joey>
<joey> Like, how were you dropped hard enough </joey>
<joey> to go to a McDonald's and like, </joey>
<joey> berate a 14-year-old kid. </joey>
<connor> - You're just like, being a brat about it, right? </connor>
<garnt> Like they're probably a brat their entire life. </garnt>
<joey> - There are only very few points, </joey>
<garnt> and some, and then like yeah, </garnt>
<joey> if the service person is being an asshole, yes. </joey>
<joey> You should be a Karen, </joey>
<joey> even though I still don't have it in me </joey>
<joey> even if they are being an asshole. </joey>
<joey> There have been plenty of points where I'm like, </joey>
<joey> I should go full Karen, you know? </joey>
<joey> Because there have been plenty of points where </joey>
<joey> they have been the assholes, </joey>
<garnt> and I'm totally within my rights to go full Karen, </garnt>
<connor> but like, it's just, </connor>
<garnt> it's just so hard man. </garnt>
<garnt> It's so hard. </garnt>
<connor> - Luckily Google reviews exist, so. </connor>
<connor> - Yes. </connor>
<joey> - I mean you know, like that fucker who ordered </joey>
<garnt> the 20 B-52s, I would have loved to have like, </garnt>
<garnt> snapped back at him. </garnt>
<garnt> But I just, I couldn't, man. </garnt>
<garnt> I couldn't. </garnt>
<joey> I didn't have the balls. </joey>
<garnt> - Or when they tell you that you get charged </garnt>
<joey> $4000 to change your ticket. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] It's so stupid. </joey>
<garnt> - Absolute, absolute (indistinct). </garnt>
<joey> - So yeah, bottom line, </joey>
<joey> just don't be a Karen. </joey>
<joey> Just know a Karen. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - I activate my stan! </joey>
<joey> Karen! </joey>
<connor> - Okay, that's what you can do. </connor>
<connor> If the bouncer is like, being a dickhead to you, </connor>
<joey> just be like, "Oh, you're approaching me? </joey>
<joey> Karen!" </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Oh my god. </joey>
<garnt> - Karens are just real stans. </garnt>
<garnt> - Standing here, I realize! </garnt>
<connor> - Shut the fuck up. </connor>
<connor> Get an ergonomic keyboard </connor>
<connor> and you can get a Karen, I guess. </connor>
<connor> Then you can tell her when to shut up. </connor>
<connor> All right, thank you so much for watching </connor>
<joey> this episode of Trash Taste. </joey>
