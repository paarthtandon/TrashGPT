<garnt> question for you connor have you noticed </garnt>
<garnt> that since you moved to japan you just </garnt>
<garnt> start bowing for </garnt>
<garnt> everything no but you know what i do do </garnt>
<garnt> i do anime reaction noises </garnt>
<garnt> no i do the same thing as well yeah and </garnt>
<garnt> you're thinking what the [ __ ] that's </garnt>
<connor> weird as [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> why would you do that like yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> okay this is why it makes so much sense </connor>
<connor> now right because whenever </connor>
<connor> they ask me for like anything at the </connor>
<connor> supermarket i'm like it's caught off </connor>
<connor> guard right </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah you know i'll see myself </connor>
<connor> it makes total sense why they do it in </connor>
<connor> anime now now because </connor>
<joey> i've noticed when uh japanese people </joey>
<joey> when you're talking to them they need to </joey>
<connor> make it known that </connor>
<joey> they're listening yeah so they all like </joey>
<connor> in in england people just </connor>
<connor> kind of just stand stand there or just </connor>
<connor> nod japanese like </connor>
<joey> hi hi hmm and i've started doing the </joey>
<joey> same thing as well </joey>
<garnt> whenever someone's talking i'm always </garnt>
<joey> having to make it known that i do that </joey>
<joey> in interviews and people are like can </joey>
<connor> you </connor>
<joey> just shut up for five seconds and just </joey>
<connor> like the opposite japanese </connor>
<connor> all right oh yeah i guess we're putting </connor>
<connor> that at the beginning </connor>
<connor> and that's the intro go ahead take it </connor>
<connor> away take it away </connor>
<joey> what's up you naughty neanderthals </joey>
<joey> welcome back to another episode of trash </joey>
<joey> taste podcast i am not gonna stop doing </joey>
<connor> how long are you sitting on that for was </connor>
<connor> that like like two seconds </connor>
<garnt> i bet you have a [ __ ] script or just </garnt>
<joey> going through the alphabet </joey>
<joey> excel sheet exactly i'm like i have to </joey>
<connor> make an alliteration somehow </connor>
<connor> so let's just let's just pick a letter </connor>
<connor> and just roll with it well welcome to </connor>
<connor> trash taste the show where we talk about </connor>
<joey> a trash taste and everything else in the </joey>
<joey> world i'm your host for today joey </joey>
<garnt> and as always we're doing this now we're </garnt>
<joey> probably doing this </joey>
<joey> okay hello so this episode </joey>
<joey> uh i thought we would maybe talk about </joey>
<joey> something i don't know if </joey>
<joey> it's going to get a little too personal </joey>
<garnt> we'll try not to go too personal route </garnt>
<garnt> but you know to go back to the whole </garnt>
<garnt> thing about </garnt>
<garnt> how we first started talking about him </garnt>
<garnt> and how we got into anime we've already </garnt>
<garnt> done an episode on that yeah we've </garnt>
<garnt> already done our origin story </garnt>
<garnt> but how did we meet or how did we make </garnt>
<joey> our first i don't know how to say it </joey>
<joey> anime friend </joey>
<joey> is that a thing i don't know okay so i i </joey>
<garnt> have a question for you guys </garnt>
<garnt> okay to start this off because we talked </garnt>
<garnt> about our anime origin story like how we </garnt>
<garnt> got into anime yeah </garnt>
<joey> but when you guys were anime fans </joey>
<joey> did you have any friends in school or </joey>
<joey> anything or </joey>
<joey> how did you guys deal with that because </joey>
<joey> i was a closet anime fan </joey>
<joey> yeah i was a complete closet anime fan </joey>
<garnt> for all of </garnt>
<connor> school but yeah but yeah i think that's </connor>
<connor> a british thing though like i got i got </connor>
<joey> rinsed for playing video games so like </joey>
<joey> imagine if i came out and was like </joey>
<joey> this i like this i like animations this </joey>
<joey> is my new thing now </joey>
<joey> i like these drawn two dt's can you </joey>
<connor> believe i got mocked for playing video </connor>
<connor> games in school and now it's just like </connor>
<connor> the accepted past time right i </connor>
<joey> got so much [ __ ] for that that's weird </joey>
<joey> because in my school </joey>
<joey> video games were quite normalized was it </joey>
<garnt> just your school </garnt>
<garnt> maybe did you no no i got rinsed to my </garnt>
<joey> school unless you're playing </joey>
<connor> fifa or cod there was and i still got </connor>
<connor> rid </connor>
<connor> what like i would be sitting in my room </connor>
<joey> in university playing some rpg </joey>
<connor> hoping that nobody opens the door to </connor>
<garnt> discover the fact that i was playing </garnt>
<garnt> i was playing jrpgs i think if i came </garnt>
<connor> out </connor>
<connor> saying that i was a massive jrpg fan </connor>
<connor> where i was you know playing persona 3 </connor>
<joey> or something </joey>
<connor> yeah i probably would have gotten beaten </connor>
<connor> up as well but i got so much [ __ ] for </connor>
<joey> playing runescape and i still to this </joey>
<joey> day </joey>
<joey> really i think i love runescape i </joey>
<connor> remember some videos popped up in my </connor>
<connor> recommended recently and i had a great </connor>
<joey> time watching them </joey>
<joey> because i got because in my school i </joey>
<joey> think my my group of friends we were </joey>
<connor> more so than not i guess like the the </connor>
<connor> nerdy group of friends yeah so we so </connor>
<connor> a lot of my friends from high school got </connor>
<connor> me into games like like runescape </connor>
<joey> like starcraft uh you know other just </joey>
<joey> like land games like civilization like </joey>
<joey> those games back in the day but when it </joey>
<joey> came to anime </joey>
<joey> i think i had a really tough time </joey>
<joey> because i was literally the only </joey>
<garnt> asian kid in my school oh no same way i </garnt>
<garnt> was the only asian kid in my school with </garnt>
<joey> like any amount of asian </joey>
<joey> like i'm not even like full blood asian </joey>
<joey> but it's just like oh </joey>
<joey> this boy's a little bit oriental </joey>
<joey> he's rice what the hell yeah so i i was </joey>
<joey> i think i was a closet anime fan for </joey>
<joey> man i want to say like majority of my </joey>
<joey> high school life </joey>
<joey> but then my group of friends who got me </joey>
<joey> into like starcraft and runescape i was </joey>
<joey> like okay you guys are nerdy enough </joey>
<joey> maybe i can try and convince them to </joey>
<joey> watch something and i convinced one of </joey>
<joey> my friends to watch ava </joey>
<joey> oh so i was like why ava that's not </joey>
<garnt> really the uh </garnt>
<joey> gateway anime i would think of don't </joey>
<connor> know maybe because i </connor>
<connor> was recently re-watching ava yeah and i </connor>
<connor> thought okay this is probably </connor>
<joey> normie enough no that they could maybe </joey>
<garnt> be kidding </garnt>
<garnt> recommending ava as someone's first </garnt>
<garnt> anime that could go one of two ways </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and there's no there's gonna be no </garnt>
<garnt> middle ground either he's going to think </garnt>
<garnt> this is amazing and </garnt>
<joey> he's a fan but the thing is i didn't </joey>
<garnt> want to get them into like </garnt>
<garnt> naruto or one piece or dragon ball to </garnt>
<garnt> start with because </garnt>
<garnt> we all know if your gateway anime is one </garnt>
<joey> piece </joey>
<joey> naruto or dragon you're gonna be </joey>
<joey> announcing all you're gonna be talking </joey>
<joey> about for the rest of your career so </joey>
<garnt> hey man i don't know man i mean i got in </garnt>
<garnt> through naruto </garnt>
<garnt> but i mean i remember the point you got </garnt>
<connor> it i got it i got it </connor>
<garnt> there there was there was the point when </garnt>
<garnt> i would only watch shonen and i know </garnt>
<garnt> exactly the exact phase you're talking </garnt>
<garnt> about yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and then you figure out that huh there's </garnt>
<garnt> other things </garnt>
<garnt> outside of shonen that are pretty cool </garnt>
<garnt> in this medium </garnt>
<garnt> and some people i guess just never </garnt>
<connor> figure that out i feel like </connor>
<connor> naruto fans are like the british with </connor>
<connor> food it's like no no no potatoes is </connor>
<joey> all we need spice what is that about </joey>
<joey> what is about what is it about like it's </joey>
<connor> not </connor>
<connor> obviously not all shown in fans but a </connor>
<connor> lot of shonen fans who </connor>
<connor> as as you said like get into say naruto </connor>
<connor> and yeah just </connor>
<connor> exclusively talk about naruto's like </connor>
<connor> what is it i want to know what their </connor>
<connor> mentality is right with anime where it's </connor>
<joey> like do they just think that </joey>
<joey> everything that's not naruto is just </joey>
<joey> hentai like </joey>
<joey> there's like no no there's no in-between </joey>
<joey> it's either shonan or just like straight </joey>
<joey> up </joey>
<garnt> r18 [ __ ] they're like what is it what is </garnt>
<garnt> this high school romance [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> i don't want to feel i want to feel i </garnt>
<joey> want to feel one emotion and that's hype </joey>
<connor> i'm like show jokes </connor>
<joey> it must be the thing of like i get it </joey>
<joey> cause the type is [ __ ] but like just </joey>
<connor> they just </connor>
<connor> must want hype their whole life just </connor>
<garnt> being like a crack addict yeah right </garnt>
<garnt> like you you only want to feel that high </garnt>
<joey> you get from crack it's like it's like </joey>
<joey> steroids this is just the same </joey>
<connor> like yo e3 it was crazy this year every </connor>
<connor> game every game i'm hyped for every game </connor>
<connor> and then they don't play any of them </connor>
<joey> like the next modern warfare yeah but in </joey>
<joey> the moment there's like a bad </joey>
<joey> news article about the game that just </joey>
<joey> came out in e3 they're like yeah i knew </joey>
<joey> it was [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> the whole time the whole time yeah no so </joey>
<joey> like my anime friend </joey>
<connor> i got so there was a group of them i was </connor>
<connor> like me and maybe </connor>
<connor> like i'd say like six or seven guys who </connor>
<connor> i used to like really really closely </connor>
<connor> hang out with in high school </connor>
<connor> and i got one of my friends who got me </connor>
<connor> into like starcraft </connor>
<joey> i got him to watch ava and i i wanted to </joey>
<joey> try that just with one person i didn't </joey>
<joey> want to like bring </joey>
<joey> a whole group of people into the guys </joey>
<joey> group viewing so i kind of was just like </joey>
<joey> any meaning </joey>
<joey> i got you watch ava and he was like okay </joey>
<joey> i'll give it a go </joey>
<joey> and he was kind of mere about it at </joey>
<connor> first i like </connor>
<connor> i like anime and i i was like at points </connor>
<joey> like kinda like yeah </joey>
<joey> and that was the moment where i was like </joey>
<connor> oh gateway anime are important </connor>
<joey> and ava is not that always </joey>
<joey> yeah so i think i think that one friend </joey>
<connor> he he watched ava </connor>
<connor> and then he eventually found death note </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah and he and and one piece and </connor>
<connor> those like the two shows that he heavily </connor>
<connor> gone into so i was like okay </connor>
<connor> then maybe i can try it out with the </connor>
<joey> other boys hey watch death now watch one </joey>
<connor> piece </connor>
<joey> there was boys before us these are the </joey>
<joey> og boys </joey>
<joey> do you know what the do you know what </joey>
<joey> the name of our like this is going to be </joey>
<joey> really cringy but </joey>
<garnt> that we had like a group name what was </garnt>
<garnt> the name joey it was the </garnt>
<garnt> [Music] </garnt>
<joey> we were called hbk because we were </joey>
<garnt> did you guys ever play handball in </garnt>
<garnt> school i think that's an australian </garnt>
<garnt> i think that's an australian thing so in </garnt>
<connor> australian schools we play handball but </connor>
<connor> not like the olympic sport handle like </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> school grounds handball but usually most </connor>
<connor> kids in australia </connor>
<joey> stop playing handball by around like </joey>
<joey> sixth grade right so it's very rarely </joey>
<joey> you go into middle school </joey>
<joey> and play handball we played handball all </joey>
<joey> the way until high school graduation </joey>
<joey> and we were the only ones and so from </joey>
<joey> nowhere we were called hbk which is the </joey>
<connor> handball crew </connor>
<connor> [Laughter] </connor>
<joey> and we were through with the k you were </joey>
<joey> the cause and and </joey>
<joey> it's not like and and it was just out of </joey>
<joey> nowhere one day </joey>
<joey> just the other boys in our year just saw </joey>
<connor> us playing handball and they were like </connor>
<connor> hbk </connor>
<connor> and we're like what the [ __ ] what the </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] does that mean we later found that </connor>
<connor> man handball crew </connor>
<joey> and normal people would be like oh </joey>
<connor> that's [ __ ] cringy yeah we were like </connor>
<joey> handbook hell yeah </joey>
<garnt> i think i think handball is something </garnt>
<joey> i've only heard australians play in </joey>
<joey> their school </joey>
<joey> because oh yeah i've seen obviously he's </joey>
<garnt> seen handball in the olympics and </garnt>
<connor> everything like yeah </connor>
<connor> when we had like a british team like </connor>
<connor> when did they play that i know right but </connor>
<connor> it's completely different to the olympic </connor>
<connor> sport yeah so so when i saw handball </connor>
<connor> because i'd always known handball as </connor>
<garnt> that thing that you play in school </garnt>
<garnt> where it's like four white squares and </garnt>
<joey> you kind of like yeah it's it's </joey>
<garnt> basically just tennis but with your hand </garnt>
<connor> yeah and a tennis ball and in really </connor>
<joey> confined space so when i saw handball </joey>
<joey> the olympic sport i was like what the </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] is this </garnt>
<garnt> this is a handball no it's really </garnt>
<garnt> interesting to hear you say going back </garnt>
<garnt> to the anime um </garnt>
<connor> conversation that we were having because </connor>
<joey> i didn't even make my first anime friend </joey>
<connor> till i started youtube like that was </connor>
<joey> years after i started youtube i i didn't </joey>
<connor> start </connor>
<connor> talking to other people who liked anime </connor>
<joey> until </joey>
<joey> the age of the internet where i </joey>
<joey> literally started talking to other </joey>
<joey> people who reviewed anime </joey>
<joey> right right because back when i was in </joey>
<joey> school and especially when i was in </joey>
<joey> university </joey>
<joey> i did everything i could to keep it </joey>
<garnt> under wraps </garnt>
<garnt> like this even in uni even in uni it was </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> top secret confidential if you find this </garnt>
<garnt> out </garnt>
<garnt> i'm i'm i'm gonna change my identity or </garnt>
<connor> something like that </connor>
<connor> i remember someone walked into my room </connor>
<connor> of me watching no game no life in </connor>
<connor> university and </connor>
<connor> it was the moment of like how do i how </connor>
<connor> do i explain </connor>
<connor> what's going on here because one of the </connor>
<connor> bad scenes as well i'm like </connor>
<connor> i i have a really similar story so </connor>
<connor> so in uni we're you know first year of </connor>
<connor> university </connor>
<connor> uh in england at least we have this </connor>
<connor> thing called freshest week where you </connor>
<connor> basically </connor>
<connor> go out every night and get pissed and </connor>
<connor> very very drunk get very very drunk and </connor>
<connor> just go clubbing sounds awesome yeah so </connor>
<connor> me being </connor>
<connor> the you know socially awkward nerd that </connor>
<joey> i was back then um i would still try to </joey>
<joey> go out as much as i could but yeah i </joey>
<joey> mean </joey>
<connor> he can get tiring off you know six or </connor>
<garnt> seven days of just </garnt>
<garnt> pure clubbing every day man that that </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] gets to you yeah yeah </garnt>
<connor> it was a lot man yeah i don't know how </connor>
<connor> people do it and people would like look </connor>
<connor> forward to it </connor>
<garnt> the next year i know i'm like i don't </garnt>

<garnt> already in this in this one week of </garnt>
<garnt> freshers so this one night i was just in </garnt>
<connor> a club </connor>
<connor> and i wasn't even that drunk because </connor>
<connor> you'd be i'd been drinking </connor>
<connor> five or six days before that yeah and so </connor>
<connor> i was just in the middle of this darn </connor>
<connor> floor </connor>
<connor> dance floor and i just had like this </connor>
<joey> epiphany i'm having a [ __ ] time i'd </joey>
<joey> rather be watching </joey>
<joey> i'd rather be watching anime right now </joey>
<garnt> like i was just that one guy who just </garnt>
<joey> danced in a club and just had the this </joey>
<garnt> is [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> that's literally every time i go to the </joey>
<joey> club yeah i'm like i need more drinks </joey>
<connor> so so instead of getting more drinks i'm </connor>
<garnt> just like you know what i'm gonna [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> off and go home and watch some bloody </garnt>
<garnt> anime </garnt>

<joey> scrolling through just looking for </joey>
<joey> something to watch and he's like you </joey>

<joey> and uh and i just kind of slowly turned </joey>
<joey> to him just as a gag i was like </joey>

<joey> like i'm like we should check it out </joey>
<joey> let's just watch one episode just for </joey>
<joey> shits and giggles let's let's watch an </joey>
<joey> episode of kisses </joey>
<joey> so imagine he just me and my friend </joey>
<joey> sitting in a room just you know six feet </joey>
<joey> apart because we're not gay </joey>
<garnt> so we're just watching just just bonding </garnt>
<joey> over an episode of kisses just bonding </joey>
<joey> over an episode like every incest </joey>
<joey> moment happens in like porn and it was </joey>
<joey> worse because </joey>
<joey> we didn't i don't know how long he was </joey>
<joey> standing at the door but his little </joey>
<joey> brother </joey>
<joey> was standing at the door he was just </joey>
<joey> watching us watch kisses and we were </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> into it too we were like oh hell yeah </joey>
<connor> like we were like </connor>
<connor> these kids that like mike was out mind </connor>
<joey> you we were very drunk </joey>
<joey> so we were like oh i was like who's your </joey>
<connor> favorite and he's like oh man they're </connor>
<joey> both </joey>
<joey> really cute and just you know full of </joey>
<joey> like you you would have thought we were </joey>
<joey> like making a reaction video we were </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> full on commentating the entire thing oh </joey>
<joey> my god </joey>
<joey> and what was supposed to be just you </joey>
<joey> know just for shoots and giggles just </joey>
<joey> one episode of kisses we binged the </joey>
<garnt> entire series in one night </garnt>
<garnt> what yeah oh my god did he enjoy it he </garnt>
<garnt> loved it </garnt>
<joey> and that and that was the moment where i </joey>
<joey> was like this guy's excited </joey>
<connor> if joe don't don't go home with joey </connor>
<joey> drunk yeah he'll try and show you shitty </joey>
<joey> oh yeah i've done that i like the fact </joey>
<garnt> that you had to wait until he was alone </garnt>
<joey> and yeah because because these other </joey>
<joey> boys were like </joey>
<joey> discussing you know how good the </joey>
<joey> alabaster rock in one piece was and i'm </joey>
<joey> like i don't think these boys are ready </joey>
<joey> for kisses </joey>
<joey> these these guys are like these guys are </joey>
<joey> one level one thief and these guys are </joey>
<joey> like level 10 mafia boss right so i was </joey>
<joey> like let's let's let's </joey>
<garnt> experiment with joe joey's like the </garnt>
<garnt> sensei who sees the hidden potential in </garnt>
<garnt> that one student </garnt>
<garnt> he's like i i can teach you the way </garnt>
<joey> didn't you </joey>
<joey> you're ready to learn you're ready to </joey>
<joey> upgrade so did he </joey>
<garnt> so did he enjoy more of that kind of </garnt>
<joey> show afterwards so then </joey>
<joey> so then that was the point where we </joey>
<joey> basically </joey>
<joey> him and i we found out that we found out </joey>
<connor> from each other that we're into </connor>
<connor> those kinds of shows or we're okay with </connor>
<connor> that we're just </connor>
<connor> into each other yeah we were just into </connor>
<joey> those kinds of shows </joey>
<connor> yeah because after we finished kisses </connor>
<connor> we're both just like </connor>
<connor> i gotta i just gotta let you know bro </connor>
<connor> now that we've had this [ __ ] like </connor>
<joey> journey together </joey>
<joey> that i'm like secretly into these shows </joey>
<connor> he's like </connor>
<connor> every single moment of this story could </connor>
<connor> be like a coming out to each other </connor>
<joey> and he was like dude i'm kind of into </joey>
<joey> these shows </joey>
<joey> and then from there and from doing this </joey>
<connor> on purpose </connor>
<garnt> and dude i'm kind of injured </garnt>
<joey> and yeah so so from then that point on i </joey>
<joey> i kind of was i became a lot more open </joey>
<joey> with like my my </joey>
<joey> my your your my my trashy taste in anime </joey>
<garnt> right sure </garnt>
<garnt> joey's like yes i'm hentai sexy i'm </garnt>
<connor> right are you purposely picking words </connor>
<connor> this is free real estate all right like </connor>
<connor> go go for it but </connor>
<connor> yeah but that was the point where i i </connor>
<connor> slowly realized oh </connor>
<connor> if i'm closeted then yeah i'll obviously </connor>
<connor> have a lot of fun you know just </connor>
<connor> kind of enjoying this medium for myself </connor>
<joey> but yeah there's a whole other enjoyment </joey>
<joey> when you get someone else into it as </joey>
<garnt> well </garnt>
<garnt> i know i remember the first time i was </garnt>
<garnt> able to have conversations about anime </garnt>
<garnt> with other people and that was just </garnt>
<garnt> so liberating for me yeah that i had </garnt>
<garnt> spent </garnt>
<garnt> all of these years enjoying this medium </garnt>
<garnt> but have literally </garnt>
<garnt> nobody to talk to it about yeah and then </garnt>
<connor> i made youtube videos to be like okay </connor>
<connor> if i can't have anyone to talk to about </connor>
<connor> i'm just gonna talk to the void </connor>
<connor> and hopefully someone will listen and i </connor>
<connor> remember having the some of the first </connor>
<connor> genuine conversations </connor>
<connor> online because it had to be online back </connor>
<connor> then um about shows that i liked and it </connor>
<connor> just </connor>
<connor> i just felt free yeah yeah because um </connor>
<connor> yeah i don't know who your first friend </connor>
<connor> in uh in like the anime youtube sphere </connor>
<garnt> was </garnt>
<garnt> for me it was uh probably horden reviews </garnt>
<garnt> and </garnt>
<garnt> the people from what's potaku we're </garnt>
<joey> going going way back then </joey>
<joey> i think mine might have been misty your </joey>
<garnt> yours missed it </garnt>
<connor> a lot of them were just like fleeting </connor>
<joey> you know mutuals you know yeah </joey>
<joey> i'd say you guys probably the first </joey>
<joey> proper friends that i i made outside </joey>
<connor> that first </connor>
<joey> you know yeah because it was it was </joey>
<joey> strange for me because i'm i'm the </joey>
<connor> complete opposite when it comes to </connor>
<joey> my friend circle on youtube where you </joey>
<joey> would think that </joey>
<joey> i would be very quick to bond with other </joey>
<connor> antitubers </connor>
<connor> once starting an anime youtube channel </connor>
<joey> yeah weirdly enough for like the first </joey>
<garnt> two years or so i was only friends with </garnt>
<connor> gaming youtubers </connor>
<garnt> yeah but that's also because i was doing </garnt>
<connor> a lot of gaming stuff alongside stuff </connor>
<connor> and i think it honestly might have been </connor>
<connor> misty that was the first like proper </connor>
<connor> anna tuber </connor>
<connor> and that was when i discovered this </connor>
<connor> entire community of antitubers i was </connor>
<garnt> like oh my god i'm not the only one </garnt>
<garnt> yeah there are other people who do this </garnt>
<connor> stuff as well and then that's when i </connor>
<connor> kind of to </connor>
<joey> drift away from more of the gaming stuff </joey>
<joey> and focus on what my channel was </joey>
<connor> actually about </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah i remember i i realized we get </connor>
<connor> comments sometimes that are like </connor>
<joey> me listening to the podcast and it's </joey>
<joey> like that guy sitting next to me </joey>
<garnt> it's great because i remember i was </garnt>
<garnt> doing my a levels i remember listening </garnt>
<joey> to paul taku actually oh i'm about to </joey>
<garnt> listen to it yeah </garnt>
<connor> i would do my i remember i have this </connor>
<connor> distinct memory of you guys arguing i </connor>
<joey> don't know </joey>
<connor> what but i was doing over a lot of </connor>
<garnt> things yeah i was doing my math a levels </garnt>
<garnt> i was and i remember just listening to </garnt>
<garnt> it and i was like man and i want to like </garnt>
<garnt> be in that and talk to them i don't have </garnt>
<garnt> friends i want to like talk to friends </garnt>
<garnt> about anime because i know even at that </garnt>
<connor> point when i was like </connor>
<connor> like 17 i still had no one to talk to </connor>
<connor> about anime yeah </connor>
<connor> and uh i didn't really make friends </connor>
<connor> until university but </connor>
<connor> i got banned from my uh anime uh </connor>
<connor> club facebook group because they were </connor>
<connor> talking about like housing abridged and </connor>
<connor> i was like oh [ __ ] i voiced in there i </connor>
<connor> said in the comments i was like oh yeah </connor>
<connor> i voiced </connor>
<connor> it and then they banned me they thought </connor>
<connor> i was lying </connor>
<connor> because they were like they're like why </connor>
<connor> would someone in our university you know </connor>
<connor> first year </connor>
<connor> voicing in housing bridge and then i </connor>
<connor> went to the club and i explained </connor>
<connor> that like it's like two months later </connor>
<connor> yeah i i happened to go there anyway </connor>
<connor> and i was like yeah can you like unban </connor>
<connor> me from the club i don't know why you </connor>
<connor> guys banned me </connor>
<connor> and they're like oh we don't know i'm </connor>
<garnt> like i know i know you [ __ ] know why </garnt>
<garnt> we can't we can't have someone having </garnt>
<connor> clout yeah i do </connor>
<connor> i i was in that group for like a year </connor>
<joey> and i made one comment about that i got </joey>
<joey> immediately banned [ __ ] you swansea </joey>
<garnt> so you joined the anime club in </garnt>
<garnt> university then i joined i paid the two </garnt>
<garnt> two pound a year membership and then all </garnt>
<connor> they did was watch ghibli movies </connor>
<joey> and like that's all they did i like this </joey>
<joey> i joined the anime called my universe's </joey>
<connor> biggest mistake it's like it's weird </connor>
<connor> because it's like a mixture of like </connor>
<garnt> it's a mixture of people who like don't </garnt>
<garnt> really care about anime and like one or </garnt>
<garnt> two people who are way too into it or </garnt>
<connor> into really different niches so </connor>
<garnt> yeah i felt like i don't know i couldn't </garnt>
<connor> really talk with none of them watched </connor>
<connor> the same [ __ ] i watched yeah </connor>
<connor> um and it's the same with gaming like </connor>
<connor> the gaming club in my uni was like </connor>
<connor> supposed to be </connor>
<connor> gaming and it was orange magic the </connor>
<joey> gathering </joey>
<connor> well i mean it's type of gaming it's </connor>
<connor> type of game you think a gaming club </connor>
<joey> yeah they're diverse files yeah yeah and </joey>
<connor> i was like well i guess i'm not joining </connor>
<connor> any clubs in unis </connor>
<joey> brony club it is i'm trying to get oh go </joey>
<connor> i was gonna say like i made a whole </connor>
<connor> video on it like a while ago but i i </connor>
<connor> joined </connor>
<connor> i joined the anime club there was one </connor>
<connor> anime club at sydney uni </connor>
<connor> and i joined it and uh i went to one of </connor>
<connor> their events </connor>
<connor> yeah just one and it was a screening and </connor>
<connor> it was of paprika </connor>
<connor> right i was like okay it's a screening </connor>
<joey> and it's of a non ghibli movie okay </joey>
<garnt> whoever is picking it must know they </garnt>
<garnt> have they have taste they they know </garnt>
<garnt> something outside of just </garnt>
<joey> miyazaki i know i was like okay and and </joey>
<joey> i wanted to watch paprika because i </joey>
<joey> hadn't seen it yet </joey>
<connor> and so i went to it and the club wasn't </connor>
<connor> that big it was maybe </connor>
<connor> i'd say 40 people in this room yeah </connor>
<connor> which is quite small club for especially </connor>
<connor> sydney uni </connor>
<connor> and i was like okay these people all </connor>
<connor> seem to be excited about this movie </connor>
<connor> let's watch it </connor>
<connor> and this is the one thing i hate about </connor>
<joey> anime clubs and also this is the one </joey>
<joey> thing i hate about cinemas in the us </joey>
<joey> is that they love to [ __ ] commentate </joey>
<garnt> on what's happening in the movie i </garnt>
<garnt> cannot stand that </garnt>
<joey> i can't [ __ ] i can't stand especially </joey>
<garnt> u.s cinemas </garnt>
<garnt> yes it's something about us cinemas </garnt>
<connor> where it's like if there's like a big </connor>
<connor> epic right like say you go and watch </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] avengers or something yeah and </connor>
<connor> something massive happens or some you </connor>
<joey> know </joey>
<joey> whatever there's always like at least 10 </joey>
<connor> or 20 people who are just like </connor>
<connor> yeah and they just go </connor>
<joey> off about like they give like they're </joey>
<joey> like [ __ ] rotten tomatoes </joey>
<garnt> i feel like i'm 80 years old whenever </garnt>
<garnt> i'm like one of those screens because </garnt>
<garnt> i'm just like </garnt>
<joey> quiet down i'm trying to enjoy the film </joey>
<joey> i'm like can you </joey>
<connor> shut the [ __ ] up we're trying to watch </connor>
<connor> the movie there's like special occasions </connor>
<connor> you know where it's kind of warranted </connor>
<connor> like watching uh </connor>
<connor> end game all right i get it you can </connor>
<connor> shout i watch pro man </connor>
<connor> ax insane the hype made it amazing you </connor>
<connor> the worst thing was </connor>
<connor> i uh one of my exes i went to the cinema </connor>
<connor> with never watched </connor>
<connor> uh a movie in the cinema before and i </connor>
<connor> was like all right cool </connor>
<connor> and then she was one of those people </connor>
<connor> didn't know that because how do you know </connor>
<connor> that </connor>
<connor> that's not like on a tinder buyer right </connor>
<connor> and then she like </connor>
<connor> shouted during the first five minutes </connor>
<connor> and i was like okay </connor>
<connor> in my head i'm thinking all right let's </connor>
<connor> let's not make this a reoccurring thing </connor>
<connor> and then like two minutes later shouts </connor>
<connor> again and i'm like please </connor>
<connor> please don't do that please i'm i'm </connor>
<connor> british </connor>
<connor> i can't do this i can't be seen with you </connor>
<connor> if you're making a commotion in public </connor>
<connor> yeah and that's how i realized that that </connor>
<joey> wasn't right for me that's why i like </joey>
<connor> japanese citizens man because like </connor>
<connor> it's no okay okay go ahead go ahead oh </connor>
<connor> no no i know how you feel about japanese </connor>
<connor> cinemas all right </connor>
<connor> but like for uh there's a part of it </connor>
<connor> that i like and there's a part of it </connor>
<connor> that i don't like the part that i like </connor>
<connor> about it is that people aren't [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> shouting their rotten tomatoes reviews </connor>
<connor> no one says anything no one says </connor>
<connor> anything i like that </connor>
<connor> yeah i like that because especially if </connor>
<garnt> it's a movie that you need to immerse </garnt>
<garnt> yourself in like a [ __ ] paprika </garnt>
<garnt> for instance it's like i wanted to be </garnt>
<connor> just quiet and </connor>
<connor> and i want to get into it yeah but the </connor>
<connor> uh the bad thing </connor>
<connor> is that i went to go see the connor </connor>
<garnt> super movie right which is easily one of </garnt>
<connor> the funniest anime movies i've ever seen </connor>
<garnt> yeah and i but i felt really bad </garnt>
<joey> laughing out loud because i was </joey>
<joey> literally the only person laughing out </joey>
<joey> loud in the cinema </joey>
<joey> and every time i was like </joey>
<joey> i don't think that was supposed to be </joey>
<joey> funny did anybody else find that funny </joey>
<joey> i've had similar experiences in uh thai </joey>
<joey> movies or </joey>
<connor> going to thai cinemas where i remember </connor>
<connor> watching your name entire cinemas and i </connor>
<connor> don't know if it's just a cultural </connor>
<connor> difference yeah but there would be </connor>
<connor> times when they were laughing and i </connor>
<connor> would be like what </connor>
<joey> what why why is this funny and then </joey>
<connor> they'd be a really funny joke and then </connor>
<connor> i'd be the only guy laughing </connor>
<garnt> i'm like am i the [ __ ] here am i do i </garnt>
<garnt> just have a weird really weird sense of </garnt>
<garnt> humor i know </garnt>
<joey> i feel so bad because i was like is is </joey>
<connor> anyone genuinely not finding this movie </connor>
<connor> funny like </connor>
<connor> am i the only one yeah i i hated it i've </connor>
<connor> been going to the cinema at least before </connor>
<connor> kovid like i was going like pretty much </connor>
<connor> every week </connor>
<connor> and like there's some of things they do </connor>
<connor> great like i know </connor>
<connor> i showed you guys this in the cinema </connor>
<connor> yeah that when you get buy popcorn on </connor>
<connor> the drink they give you this </connor>
<connor> this tray yeah and you're like oh that's </connor>
<joey> cool and then you realize </joey>
<connor> you can put it in the cup holder yeah </connor>
<joey> and it sticks so you have a whole tray </joey>
<joey> that's in the cup holder it's [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> genius yeah no i don't have to hold this </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> i can just put it on you don't have to </joey>
<joey> put like [ __ ] greasy things yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<connor> put your popcorn on your tray and the </connor>
<connor> person next you can you know have it </connor>
<connor> whatever </connor>
<connor> amazing right amazing and then uh the </connor>
<connor> thing that i hate </connor>
<connor> oh also yeah no noise the only time i've </connor>
<joey> ever seen the make noise in a japanese </joey>
<joey> cinema right i was watching the movie </joey>
<joey> and it was about a bomb that was </joey>
<joey> going to go off in one of the olympics </joey>
<joey> right yeah and it's this police officers </joey>
<joey> accused anyway they go to his house to </joey>
<joey> search his house </joey>
<joey> and they ask him do you have any guns </joey>
<joey> he's like yeah i have guns </joey>
<joey> and he shows his like under his mattress </joey>
<connor> and he has like a hundred guns </connor>
<connor> okay and the whole cinema goes whoa </connor>
<joey> every japanese first like whoa what's </joey>
<joey> good </joey>
<connor> and then also one really annoying thing </connor>
<joey> right when the movie ends </joey>
<joey> right the credits come all right see you </joey>
<joey> guys i'm off </joey>
<joey> japanese cinemas you cannot leave no </joey>
<connor> until the credits are over </connor>
<connor> yeah and some of these credits go on for </connor>
<connor> like 20 [ __ ] minutes </connor>
<garnt> and i'm like the first few times i was </garnt>

<connor> culture </connor>

<garnt> you guys i'm not waiting for you can't </garnt>
<garnt> caveman brain activate again </garnt>
<joey> i don't i don't care about the seven </joey>
<joey> people who did costume design i'm sorry </joey>
<joey> like i'm not sticking around for that </joey>
<connor> one and then like i'm the [ __ ] who </connor>
<joey> like in front of a hundred things like </joey>
<joey> all right see you guys </joey>
<connor> i'm just walking like i don't give a </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] i'm not waiting 30 minutes yeah i i </joey>
<joey> found that aspect cool because you know </joey>
<connor> obviously the people go to the cinemas </connor>
<connor> they they they're respecting they're </connor>
<connor> like okay i want to know who did and who </connor>
<garnt> worked on this movie </garnt>
<garnt> but as you said i think the japanese </garnt>
<garnt> like film industry is aware that people </garnt>
<joey> have to stick around to the chris that </joey>
<joey> are like </joey>
<joey> how do we like extend this as long as we </joey>
<joey> can it's like a youtuber trying to send </joey>
<connor> a video to 10 minutes like </connor>
<joey> how do we extend this credit to 10 </joey>
<garnt> minutes to get that mid-roll in </garnt>
<garnt> i don't know like i've i i used to be </garnt>
<connor> the same where </connor>
<connor> i would think why the [ __ ] would anyone </connor>
<connor> stay when the credit's rolling i i i </connor>
<connor> give no i </connor>
<connor> i don't give a [ __ ] about this and i </connor>
<connor> remember i did it once for </connor>
<connor> a movie that just blew me away um i </connor>
<connor> think </connor>
<connor> um i can't remember the exact name </connor>
<connor> but i remember most recently i did it </connor>
<connor> after watching your name and silent </connor>
<connor> voice </connor>
<connor> and it's actually just a really nice </connor>
<connor> feeling just to </connor>
<connor> just to like absorb everything you just </connor>
<connor> watch and just sit there in silence i </connor>
<connor> don't know when </connor>
<connor> when sometimes i can live yeah when a </connor>
<connor> movie you like hits really deep </connor>
<connor> then like we're doing this again we're </connor>
<connor> doing this oh my god </connor>
<connor> but when when when a movie affects me </connor>
<garnt> that way </garnt>
<joey> there you go you got it you got the </joey>
<garnt> money you got this just </garnt>

<garnt> the you know the behind the scenes </garnt>
<garnt> bloopers </garnt>
<garnt> reels oh no like that shit's [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> cool but when it's </garnt>
<joey> a black screen it's just white text </joey>
<joey> scrolling </joey>
<joey> which it often is which it often is and </joey>
<joey> then i'm just like </joey>
<joey> i mean you guys know we have to stick </joey>
<joey> around for the craze can you at least </joey>
<connor> make it </connor>
<connor> entertaining in some fashion and even </connor>
<connor> isn't it the worst </connor>
<connor> as well when the credits song is just </connor>
<connor> like i'm not digging this credits </connor>
<connor> at all and i have to [ __ ] sit here </connor>
<joey> and listen to the whole god damn </joey>
<connor> song i'm too lazy for that i just leave </connor>
<joey> and then i i watch the </joey>
<connor> after scene credit on youtube yeah it's </connor>
<joey> gonna be on yeah but you can use the </joey>
<joey> gaijin card right </joey>
<connor> uh yeah i mean no one really cares </connor>
<connor> sometimes when i do it the japanese be </connor>
<connor> like well we can do that </connor>
<connor> and then they'll get up too i noticed </connor>
<joey> follow the white man </joey>
<connor> wait wait wait wait no one's stopping </connor>
<connor> him </connor>
<garnt> like i don't know he he just cheated the </garnt>
<garnt> system </garnt>
<connor> i never thought you could do that </connor>
<connor> because when i do it i notice i'll get a </connor>
<connor> few lucks and then i'll be like two </connor>
<connor> people who stand up and go as well yeah </connor>
<connor> i'm like yeah join me it is it is </connor>
<garnt> freedom so </garnt>
<connor> it's like it's like the trust system </connor>
<connor> that japan runs on like buying alcohol </connor>
<connor> i'm slowly breaking it </connor>
<connor> i don't know i i've just the more i </connor>
<connor> don't know i say the older i get </connor>
<connor> i the more i i you know have less time </connor>
<connor> the more i just </connor>
<connor> don't appreciate [ __ ] the waste of my </connor>
<connor> time and i'm just like nope i'm not </connor>
<joey> waiting for your credits yeah </joey>
<joey> so speaking of gaijin car though have </joey>
<joey> you guys ever used the gaijin card </joey>
<joey> in like funny situations should we </joey>
<garnt> explain what the gaijin card is </garnt>
<garnt> sure you should probably go for it go </garnt>
<garnt> for it i mean i'm sure everyone knows </garnt>
<connor> what the gaijin card is right but </connor>
<connor> basically the gaijin card </connor>
<connor> is gaijin means foreigner yeah in </connor>
<connor> japanese but </connor>
<connor> the guys playing the gaijin card </connor>
<connor> basically means you get away with [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> that japanese people wouldn't be able to </joey>
<joey> get away with in japan </joey>
<joey> but they forgive you because you're </joey>
<joey> supposed to be like a mindless foreigner </joey>
<connor> i mean yeah </connor>
<connor> i i try not to actively like take </connor>
<connor> advantage of eggs i feel like it's not </connor>
<connor> fair for me to like use </connor>
<connor> you know being a foreigner yeah you know </connor>
<connor> because everyone goes through the same </connor>
<connor> struggles right life's hard enough </connor>
<connor> but i mean there's some stuff like </connor>
<connor> apparently you're not supposed to eat </connor>
<connor> and walk here right </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah i i do that i i don't like if </connor>
<connor> i if i have like 10 minutes to get to my </connor>
<connor> train and i haven't had breakfast yeah </connor>
<connor> i'm grabbing that sandwich and eating it </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> i don't throw my [ __ ] away i don't make </connor>
<joey> a mess so i'm like you know it's fine i </joey>
<joey> always wonder that that </joey>
<joey> then why is it that a lot of convenience </joey>
<garnt> store food is so </garnt>
<garnt> perfectly packaged for on-the-go right i </garnt>
<joey> know right and it's like </joey>
<garnt> you can't eat it on the go though </garnt>
<garnt> onigiri just that that's that's </garnt>
<connor> basically a rice sandwich </connor>
<connor> yeah that's that's meant to be eaten as </connor>
<garnt> you're walking along but yeah </garnt>
<connor> no you you know what you're watching no </connor>
<connor> one gives me looks or anything or </connor>
<connor> anything like that it's just uh </connor>
<connor> i i'm told i'm not supposed to do this </connor>
<connor> but [ __ ] i'm gonna do it anyway but the </connor>
<joey> stuff i wouldn't dare do i like playing </joey>
<connor> i like doing the reverse guiding card i </connor>
<connor> like playing the gaijin card and then </connor>
<connor> immediately after i've committed </connor>
<joey> the act just bust out the japanese just </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> psych reverse uno </joey>
<joey> can you give us an example of the </joey>
<joey> situation uh so an example of a </joey>
<joey> situation i'm trying to think </joey>
<connor> what would be i mean you know something </connor>
<connor> like that right like not allowed to eat </connor>
<connor> on the go or like not allowed to eat on </connor>
<connor> the train for example </connor>
<connor> where you know uh i would you know as </connor>
<connor> you said like sometimes i'm busy and </connor>
<connor> sometimes i gotta get something down </connor>
<connor> before i catch the train </connor>
<connor> so i would eat on the go and people </connor>
<connor> would kind of you know just </connor>
<connor> be like whatever um but then what i like </connor>
<connor> to do just to [ __ ] with people is </connor>
<connor> i i like to i finish the food </connor>
<joey> and then just just because i love seeing </joey>
<joey> people's reactions to this </joey>
<joey> i finish the food and then i pretend to </joey>
<joey> get in a phone call and i just </joey>
<joey> talk in japanese as loud as i can </joey>
<joey> just because seeing the confused phases </joey>
<joey> of japan </joey>
<joey> being like is he gaijin or is he not </joey>
<joey> guided </joey>
<joey> i don't even know anymore is my favorite </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] past time i've i've done </garnt>
<joey> the exact same thing but just when i'm </joey>
<joey> in thailand yeah and you know when </joey>
<joey> you know when people gossip about you in </joey>
<joey> their native tongue you don't know </joey>
<joey> they don't know that you understand them </joey>
<joey> and you just want to flex on them to be </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] i know exactly what your mother </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] says </joey>
<garnt> you better watch yourself [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> oh dude i've had so many experiences </joey>
<joey> like that especially when you're outside </joey>
<joey> of tokyo where </joey>
<joey> they're obviously not used to the </joey>
<joey> foreigners um </joey>
<joey> i was in the supermarket once uh with my </joey>
<joey> sister we were like really really young </joey>
<connor> maybe like i was maybe like nine or ten </connor>
<connor> years old oh wow um and we were just in </connor>
<connor> the </connor>
<connor> the the aisle that has all like the </connor>
<connor> snacks and stuff right because </connor>
<connor> japanese snacks are like the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> best and we were just picking stuff out </connor>
<connor> and there was this kid probably around </connor>
<connor> the same age as me </connor>
<connor> who was just like staring at us from </connor>
<connor> like down the aisle </connor>
<connor> obviously because we looked foreigner </connor>
<connor> right yeah he'd obviously never seen a </connor>
<connor> foreign kid in his life </connor>
<connor> yeah so he was just staring and then his </connor>
<connor> other friend came up </connor>
<connor> and i could clearly hear that they were </connor>
<connor> like oh look at these [ __ ] foreigners </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> it was those nine-year-olds yeah </connor>
<joey> xenophobia fast yeah </joey>
<joey> legit they were like oh man look at </joey>
<connor> these foreigners that looks so weird </connor>
<connor> right like </connor>
<connor> you know there's something along that </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah yeah and i heard everything </connor>
<joey> and i'm just like oh you </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] prepare for my prepare for my </joey>
<joey> backhand </joey>
<garnt> my nine-year-old backhand i've never </garnt>
<garnt> decked a nine-year-old before but today </garnt>
<garnt> could be the day </garnt>
<joey> yeah you're pushing it i've never </joey>
<connor> close-lined anybody but man </connor>
<joey> you guys are just perfect distance so </joey>
<connor> just to [ __ ] with them i was like oh </connor>
<joey> sh my nine-year-old man was like i'll </joey>
<joey> show them </joey>
<joey> so i i sorry out loud to my sister </joey>
<joey> i said in japanese i said have you </joey>
<connor> finished selecting which one you want </connor>
<connor> and i think my sister quickly picked up </connor>
<joey> on it too because i think she overheard </joey>
<joey> it yeah so she was like all right i'll </joey>
<joey> play your game </joey>
<joey> and and back in japanese she was like </joey>
<joey> yeah i've almost finished um </joey>
<joey> and then she busted out this really like </joey>
<joey> specific japanese reference and from my </joey>
<garnt> periphery </garnt>
<garnt> just i'd never seen like a nine-year-old </garnt>
<garnt> with like a pog champ face in my life </garnt>
<garnt> but it was just like they're like </garnt>
<garnt> what you would have thought these kids </garnt>
<garnt> would have seen like the face of god </garnt>
<garnt> like they were just like </garnt>
<garnt> oh my god what the [ __ ] is that and just </garnt>
<garnt> to [ __ ] with them even further </garnt>
<garnt> when we finish selecting our [ __ ] i </garnt>
<joey> purposely went towards the kids </joey>
<joey> and as i passed by i busted out a </joey>
<joey> sumimasen </joey>
<joey> and that was just like the finishing </joey>
<joey> blow like that might as well i just </joey>
<connor> clotheslined them with my words right </connor>
<connor> there even a death note asked encounter </connor>
<joey> i [ __ ] kicked </joey>
<connor> the don't eat the [ __ ] out of that </connor>
<connor> that's so much more like passive than </connor>
<garnt> what i think i used to do as a kid </garnt>
<garnt> joey slam dunks nine-year-old japanese </garnt>
<connor> and language </connor>

<garnt> kid took my credit </garnt>
<garnt> no like i can totally understand why you </garnt>
<garnt> got angry i just thought man there's </garnt>
<garnt> this </garnt>
<garnt> there's a few steps between between </garnt>
<joey> taking someone's credit and smacking </joey>
<joey> someone in this package </joey>
<connor> this kid had been giving me [ __ ] because </connor>
<connor> like a campsite he'd been giving me [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> for days and i'm just like i'm done dude </connor>
<connor> i'm done </connor>

<connor> punched had a black eye </connor>
<connor> he came he came while i was on my other </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] game just pulls out the plug </connor>

<connor> i was just giving him another i was </connor>
<connor> gonna [ __ ] kill him </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] pulled out the plug whilst </connor>
<connor> i was mid metal slug i'm sorry </connor>
<joey> wow yeah i don't even remember this is </joey>
<joey> gonna be a weird question but when was </joey>
<connor> the first time you ever punched someone </connor>
<connor> bro i got in so many fights was that was </connor>
<joey> that the first time you ever punched </joey>
<connor> someone </connor>
<connor> did you not fight with like oh wait do </connor>
<joey> you only have a sister i only had a </joey>
<joey> sister oh dude i have three brothers </joey>
<connor> dude if i punch my sister i would my my </connor>
<connor> dad would </connor>
<connor> my dad used to say this one threat it's </connor>
<garnt> like a legit threat </garnt>
<connor> right where like if i did anything like </connor>
<garnt> bad in public he just like grabbed my </garnt>
<connor> ear and just whispered being like i </connor>
<connor> brought you into this world i can easily </connor>
<connor> take you out </connor>
<joey> my dad won't remember that but i </joey>
<garnt> specific like it's an eight-year-old </garnt>
<connor> that's like </connor>
<connor> i'm sorry for that 101. me and my </connor>
<joey> brothers so we had three brothers right </joey>
<joey> yeah so it was wrestlemania like oh yeah </joey>
<joey> we must have fought i must have been in </joey>
<garnt> this fight like three days of the week </garnt>
<garnt> right right um was it actually fist </garnt>
<garnt> fights or was it like oh yeah it got to </garnt>
<garnt> the point we would like actually start </garnt>
<connor> like full on punching each other jesus </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah we hated each other i love him </garnt>
<connor> now i love you guys but </connor>
<connor> then it was like [ __ ] because oh god </connor>
<connor> there's so many fights but yeah </connor>
<connor> my dad had this thing we called it like </connor>
<connor> he's probably gonna kill me if i say </connor>
<connor> this but he had this thing called the </connor>
<connor> murder stare </connor>
<connor> and like you know when you started </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] up and he would look at you and </connor>
<connor> you're like </connor>
<joey> he's like bro you're one step away from </joey>
<garnt> like losing everything </garnt>
<garnt> right now it was the look where you he </garnt>
<connor> was like don't do it don't do one more </connor>
<connor> thing </connor>
<connor> i'll end you love you dad by the way </connor>
<garnt> because i was an only child so i i had </garnt>
<garnt> never had to grow up with any siblings </garnt>
<garnt> never had to share anything </garnt>
<garnt> um but yeah that was i had a fairly </garnt>
<joey> uneventful childhood because of that i </joey>
<joey> think in 2020 we call that privilege </joey>
<connor> i got bullied so much in school so i </connor>
<connor> just started just [ __ ] punching </connor>
<connor> everyone back </connor>
<joey> i guess yeah if you get bullied at </joey>
<joey> school you probably have like a lot of </joey>
<joey> people yeah i mean after i started </joey>
<connor> punching </connor>
<joey> back and you know actually getting </joey>
<joey> fights people just left me alone because </joey>
<joey> they knew if </joey>
<joey> they would go for someone else who </joey>
<garnt> wouldn't fight back yeah exactly should </garnt>
<joey> i just challenge them to a chess game </joey>
<connor> i should have man that would have </connor>
<connor> definitely worked against kids you </connor>
<joey> should have challenged them to a chess </joey>
<joey> game and then the moment you when you </joey>
<joey> just punch them in the face </joey>
<joey> it's like double down on it </joey>
<connor> so bad i don't know what stories i could </connor>
<connor> tell if you want any </connor>
<joey> i mean i'm just trying to think like </joey>
<joey> when was the i did you ever punch anyone </joey>
<connor> in school </connor>
<connor> like full-on punch someone yeah i have </connor>
<joey> um </joey>
<connor> what reason uh because this kid it's </connor>
<connor> always dumb as [ __ ] in the sky </connor>
<joey> yeah it's because this kid in my high </joey>
<connor> school was giving me [ __ ] like he was he </connor>
<connor> was the bully about you </connor>
<connor> but the thing is he was that one bully </connor>
<connor> that you know how some bullies are kind </connor>
<connor> of like </connor>
<joey> popular with the kids that they don't </joey>
<joey> bully yeah this kid </joey>
<joey> because he bullied everybody like every </joey>
<joey> single person everybody [ __ ] hated </joey>
<connor> this kid </connor>
<connor> and of course eventually he made the </connor>
<connor> rounds and the next target was me for </connor>
<joey> whatever reason </joey>
<joey> but and obviously going to a high school </joey>
<garnt> where it's a 99 percent white boys and </garnt>
<garnt> i'm the only one with a non-white </garnt>
<garnt> bloodline of course </garnt>
<connor> yeah he's going for the low hanging </connor>
<garnt> fruit yeah yeah yeah so </garnt>
<connor> he would you know say all these like </connor>
<connor> horribly racial slurs </connor>
<connor> at me and stuff and uh and just one day </connor>
<connor> he got </connor>
<connor> he was just really and i didn't mind the </connor>
<joey> racial slurs it's it's when he got </joey>
<connor> up to my face i hate it i hate that so </connor>
<joey> much there's a difference between a </joey>
<connor> bully </connor>
<connor> shouting across the playground yeah at </connor>
<connor> you yeah i don't mind that stuff yeah it </connor>
<joey> was just fine right because that shit's </joey>
<garnt> easy </garnt>
<garnt> but respect my personal space yeah right </garnt>
<joey> the moment you cross </joey>
<joey> into my personal space that's when the </joey>
<joey> hands come out yeah </joey>
<joey> and i i never punched anyone in my life </joey>
<connor> up until that point yeah and i was like </connor>
<connor> okay there's only one way that this kid </connor>
<joey> is going to stop </joey>
<joey> and he's like and in my head i was like </joey>
<joey> doing a kaiji episode where i'm like if </joey>
<joey> i punch him i'm either going to die </joey>
<joey> or or i'm going to come out of this </joey>
<garnt> alive </garnt>
<garnt> joey's like death noting every action </garnt>
<joey> bad this is like the total opposite the </joey>
<connor> way i used to think about it i was like </connor>
<connor> just just punch and figure it out </connor>
<joey> oh no no no i was always the person who </joey>
<connor> was like okay what's gonna happen if i </connor>
<connor> go </connor>
<connor> down this route it was like a visual </connor>
<joey> novel right it's like punch or not punch </joey>
<joey> and it's like </joey>
<joey> i don't know i don't want to get the </joey>
<joey> band i want to get the bad end right </joey>
<joey> so i was like oh so i was like there's a </joey>
<joey> very good possibility that if i punch </joey>
<joey> i'm going to just like </joey>
<connor> batter just and i was like but </connor>
<joey> this kid was just relentlessly just like </joey>
<connor> shouting in my face and just you know </connor>
<connor> like and then the moment he started like </connor>
<joey> pushing me around as well that's when </joey>
<joey> that's when i think i just snapped yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah way all back and just </joey>
<joey> knock this kid in the chat like i </joey>
<joey> brought the [ __ ] bucky move on </joey>
<joey> knocked him in the chin and he fell down </joey>
<connor> on the ground and </connor>
<connor> he just kind of walked off and then </connor>
<connor> nobody in my ear [ __ ] with me </connor>
<connor> that's good that years and that's like </connor>
<joey> okay oh this all right that was the good </joey>
<connor> end that was good </connor>
<connor> like when you know i'd never recommend </connor>
<joey> like fighting back because it can </joey>
<joey> normally like it can go like two ways </joey>
<joey> right </joey>
<joey> one you can get your kick </joey>
<connor> like spit on each other in school and it </connor>
<connor> was that was the stuff that bothered me </connor>
<connor> the most like yeah you can call me [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> don't spit on me what the [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> yeah i hated high school did you guys </joey>
<joey> have this i don't know if this is only </joey>
<joey> an australian high school thing but </joey>
<joey> the last year of the 12th grade like </joey>
<joey> literally the day before graduation </joey>
<joey> i forgot what it was called i think it </joey>
<joey> was called like year 12 free day </joey>
<joey> where basically the 12th graders for the </joey>
<joey> last day of high school </joey>
<joey> they can just run around the school and </joey>
<garnt> do whatever the [ __ ] they want i think </garnt>
<garnt> we had something similar in our school </garnt>
<joey> yeah what you guys didn't have but like </joey>
<garnt> our school took that free day literally </garnt>
<garnt> where some [ __ ] crazy [ __ ] would </garnt>
<connor> happen like we </connor>
<connor> we somehow uh uh we you know the the </connor>
<connor> it started off quite innocently like </connor>
<connor> yeah you know putting lube all over the </connor>
<connor> stair rails and stuff like that and </connor>
<joey> another one was going into one of the </joey>
<joey> teachers offices and filling his entire </joey>
<joey> cup </joey>
<joey> uh entire floor with cups full of water </joey>
<joey> so that he couldn't like go into the </joey>
<joey> into his thing like that </joey>
<joey> and then it got too far when uh </joey>
<connor> one of i think was like a group of boys </connor>
<connor> they got one of the </connor>
<connor> teachers cars and i don't know how the </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] they did it </connor>
<connor> i think it was driving a mini so it was </connor>
<connor> like relatively small car </connor>
<connor> and they somehow put the car on top of </connor>
<joey> one of the school buildings </joey>
<joey> like on the roof and i mean that's too </joey>
<garnt> far but </garnt>
<garnt> that just sounds impressive honestly the </garnt>
<joey> engineering what are the </joey>
<joey> logistics behind this you know this </joey>
<joey> kid's going forward </joey>
<joey> i wasn't there to witness it but imagine </joey>
<connor> just walking to school and you're </connor>
<connor> walking </connor>
<connor> you know along the school uh like wall </connor>
<connor> yeah and you just look up and there's </connor>
<joey> just a car </joey>
<joey> sitting there i'm just like oh how did </joey>
<connor> that get there </connor>
<connor> like the news or some [ __ ] no no no no </connor>
<joey> this is like this is quite </joey>
<garnt> frequent that sounds like a scene from </garnt>
<garnt> some american what do you mean </garnt>
<garnt> this sounds like a scene from some </garnt>
<garnt> american high school movie that you </garnt>
<garnt> watch and you're like oh this is so </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] stupid this one never happened </joey>
<joey> i don't know i don't know if my high </joey>
<connor> school still does it but that's </connor>
<connor> newsworthy in the uk i think </connor>
<joey> that would be yeah of course [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> hell no even the even the girls schools </connor>
<joey> would go crazy like that as well just </joey>
<connor> what the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> because it was you know it was the last </connor>
<connor> last day of high school right yeah it's </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> do whatever the [ __ ] you want while you </connor>
<joey> can because after this day </joey>
<joey> you have adult responsibility so it's </joey>
<joey> like just it's it's you know </joey>
<joey> it's the miley cyrus effect right it's </joey>
<joey> like just get all that [ __ ] out of the </joey>
<joey> way </joey>
<joey> once the contract has ended and you're </joey>
<garnt> good to go right well like i said he </garnt>
<garnt> must have learned some good skills from </garnt>
<garnt> being able to [ __ ] get a mini on a </garnt>
<garnt> school roof </garnt>
<joey> yeah how would you do that even if it </joey>
<joey> wasn't like a multi-story </joey>
<joey> building it was like it was like a </joey>
<joey> demountable so it was just like just </joey>
<connor> getting it up but still </connor>
<connor> still there's like eight of them </connor>
<connor> coordinate this lift </connor>
<connor> like i had nothing to go wrong i wasn't </connor>
<connor> i wasn't there to witness it but it was </connor>
<joey> awesome just </joey>
<connor> staring across the school grounds and </connor>
<joey> just seeing a [ __ ] mini </joey>
<connor> on top of it yeah that was crazy how do </connor>
<connor> you convince kids to join yeah so we're </connor>
<connor> gonna go lift the teacher's mini yeah </connor>
<joey> like i need like five boys who's in this </joey>
<joey> like all right i'll [ __ ] do it yeah </joey>
<garnt> speaking of like high school why is </garnt>
<garnt> there so many high school anime you know </garnt>

<connor> deal with high school </connor>
<joey> what's the deal with high school anime </joey>

<garnt> [ __ ] high school anime </garnt>
<garnt> i've ever heard of or [ __ ] seen some </garnt>
<connor> crazy high school anime out there </connor>

<connor> my big brother's kind of a wimp what's </connor>
<garnt> up with that </garnt>
<garnt> this just sounds almost sounds like a </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] in-betweeners episode it is </connor>
<connor> because then it turned into a [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> tournament arc where then all his </connor>
<connor> friends the next day were like oh well </connor>
<connor> we want to turn now </connor>
<connor> jesus christ there's one time and this </connor>
<connor> is probably the one where i felt most </connor>
<connor> bad </connor>
<connor> is that this guy came up to me he's like </connor>
<connor> kind of chubby </connor>
<connor> what are you doing what are you doing </connor>
<connor> man right what's up with this </connor>
<connor> he pushes me once and i was like all </connor>
<connor> right fine </connor>
<connor> i grab his head and just [ __ ] knee </connor>
<joey> him </joey>
<joey> and bear in mind okay i do not do not </joey>
<joey> condone violence </joey>
<connor> in any sense but but i lost it i was </connor>
<connor> such an angry 13 year old because i was </connor>
<joey> getting bullied since like you were 13 </joey>
<joey> when you did this yeah </joey>
<joey> what the [ __ ] so you weren't even in </joey>
<joey> high school you're like middle school </joey>
<joey> maybe like no i'm like 13 like 15 14 </joey>
<joey> maybe maybe 50 yeah still </joey>
<joey> 15 yeah and this guy didn't i've never </joey>
<joey> had a problem with this guy i didn't </joey>
<joey> realize why he was doing this to me but </joey>
<joey> i think i </joey>
<joey> pissed off one of his friends and then </joey>
<joey> he you know trying to act big i don't </joey>
<joey> think he actually wanted the fight he </joey>
<connor> was just pushing me around </connor>
<connor> but i was like [ __ ] it anyway so i did </connor>
<connor> that and he just dropped and i was like </connor>
<connor> oh no </connor>
<connor> oh no i'm going to be in there i'm going </connor>
<connor> to be in a lot of trouble </connor>
<connor> i don't even think i did it that hard i </connor>
<connor> just thought i saw it in a movie once it </connor>
<joey> looked really [ __ ] cool </joey>
<joey> i saw bruce lee do it once i could do it </joey>
<joey> sir who gets hurt by getting kneed in </joey>
<connor> the face </connor>
<joey> so he pushed me and then i think he was </joey>
<connor> going think i was going to arrow for a </connor>
<connor> push and i just went like douche </connor>
<connor> and then he just like dropped for like </connor>
<connor> five seconds and i was like oh [ __ ] are </connor>
<connor> you okay </connor>
<joey> and he was like yeah yeah i'm fine and i </joey>
<joey> think he was so embarrassed that he </joey>
<connor> didn't tell anyone right </connor>
<connor> and then he came in the next day two </connor>
<connor> black eyes </connor>
<joey> wait how did you get two black how wide </joey>
<joey> is your knee </joey>
<connor> so we came in with two black eyes didn't </connor>
<connor> tell anyone but all my friends knew what </connor>
<connor> happened </connor>
<connor> no one said anything it was like that </connor>
<connor> one week where i had like three fights </connor>
<connor> right no one did anything for me the </connor>
<connor> rest of my school life it was great </connor>
<joey> everyone everyone was nice to me </joey>
<joey> you had more fights in that one week </joey>
<joey> than i think i have my entire life i </joey>
<connor> think i had more fights in that one week </connor>
<connor> than anything this is like fight club </connor>
<joey> because it might work </joey>
<connor> in my school it was it wasn't about like </connor>
<connor> getting into fights it was about </connor>
<garnt> who did you know like if you're cool </garnt>
<garnt> with x person if you call it that person </garnt>
<connor> yeah yeah people don't [ __ ] with you </connor>
<connor> i don't know if it's because it's like a </connor>
<connor> small town thing like my and like the </connor>
<connor> uh it was such a small town thing yeah </connor>
<connor> like the teachers often like forgave the </connor>
<connor> shitty behavior because </connor>
<joey> more often than not all the teachers </joey>
<joey> were friends with the kids parents right </joey>
<joey> so </joey>
<joey> yeah it was kind of a thing of like oh </joey>
<garnt> don't do it again don't do it again </garnt>
<garnt> stop like you need someone in the face </garnt>
<connor> every single time it was like don't do </connor>
<garnt> it again don't do it again </garnt>
<garnt> you know it wasn't like a proper </garnt>
<joey> punishment right now i mean you know </joey>
<connor> it's it is what it is right i don't </connor>
<connor> really care now i've i dealt with it </connor>
<joey> myself did you go to a boys school </joey>
<joey> no oh okay so maybe that's the aspect of </joey>
<joey> a ride because i feel that </joey>
<joey> boys will be more willing to get into </joey>
<joey> fights if it's a co-ed school because </joey>
<joey> they're trying to like impress </joey>
<connor> the girls i never wanted to i just </connor>
<garnt> wanted to play my game to be like yeah </garnt>
<garnt> but it just </garnt>
<connor> there was like one guy who would like he </connor>
<connor> he didn't want to fight me he didn't </connor>
<connor> want to fight me because he i think he </connor>
<connor> knew that he'd get hurt </connor>
<connor> so he would just oh like i said he would </connor>
<connor> spit on me and anytime i try to like </connor>
<connor> fight him he'd just run away </connor>
<connor> so what can i do right it's like that </connor>
<connor> one [ __ ] who like kites amazingly </connor>
<connor> come to me </connor>
<garnt> his torn game's like on point yeah yeah </garnt>
<connor> yeah he just kites you and he's just </connor>
<connor> kidding me </connor>
<connor> then he would run to an area with </connor>
<connor> teachers right and i can't [ __ ] like </connor>
<garnt> punch him </garnt>
<connor> if any 13 year old 14 kids don't fight </connor>
<connor> it's not a good solution </connor>
<connor> i mean i i was just lucky that i was </connor>
<connor> freakishly strong for a 12 or 13 year </connor>
<connor> old as well that helped a lot </connor>
<garnt> yeah um i don't know because for me i've </garnt>
<garnt> always gone through life being like </garnt>
<garnt> okay physical physical like interaction </garnt>
<joey> is always like my last choice </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah yeah i have that now but as a </connor>
<joey> kid i felt like it was my only </joey>
<joey> you weren't the hard way yeah i mean i'm </joey>
<joey> i'm glad that i was angry as a kid </joey>
<connor> because now i have like </connor>
<connor> zero anger at all right i never get </connor>
<connor> angry about [ __ ] now i'm so glad that i </connor>
<connor> just got that [ __ ] out </connor>
<connor> you know i don't know if that's how </connor>
<connor> anger works i don't know if this is </connor>
<joey> science </joey>
<joey> i'm not sure about that it's not but i </joey>
<joey> feel like because i've dealt with so </joey>
<joey> much anger </joey>
<connor> in in my past right i've been able to </connor>
<connor> like really like </connor>
<joey> i don't know it's like you feel it's </joey>
<joey> like you feel </joey>
<garnt> i get like mildly frustrated at things </garnt>
<garnt> like any good british person would but </garnt>
<connor> i never get angry at things mildly </connor>
<garnt> frustrated it's just </garnt>
<garnt> the british that's just the default </garnt>
<garnt> british emotion yeah you know </garnt>
<garnt> anything can mildly frustrate you and </garnt>
<garnt> and that's just that's just the way </garnt>
<connor> we've just grown up right yeah </connor>
<connor> i'll be angry about [ __ ] now but i'll be </connor>
<garnt> like angry you know like </garnt>
<joey> i play it up because i like just </joey>
<garnt> shouting but yeah but </garnt>
<connor> god is like the chillest man on earth </connor>
<connor> like gone is impossible to get mad </connor>
<joey> i've never actually seen you mad well i </joey>
<connor> mean that's the whole monk thing right </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah do you want to talk about it </connor>
<joey> oh </joey>
<connor> that was am i watching an anime right </connor>
<connor> now damn son what are we talking about </connor>
<joey> today joey </joey>
<joey> we're talking about two particular </joey>
<joey> series that bookwork </joey>
<joey> is releasing on their website uh i don't </joey>
<joey> know if you've heard of a conor i'm sure </joey>
<connor> uh gone you've heard of it but there is </connor>
<connor> two series there's one </connor>
<connor> called uh tempu which is about a </connor>
<joey> temple surprise surprise with a monk </joey>
<joey> with a monk </joey>
<joey> with a monk perfect segue into the next </joey>
<joey> part of the show </joey>
<joey> but also the other one is uh </joey>
<joey> which i don't know what the english </joey>
<connor> title is why the hell are you here </connor>
<connor> teacher that's </connor>
<connor> it i've seen episode one of this show my </connor>
<connor> goodness gracious that is not christian </connor>
<connor> but yeah i'm so glad i can read it on </connor>
<connor> bookwalker in the comfort of my home </connor>
<garnt> yes because on bookwalker the manga is </garnt>
<garnt> completely uncensored you get </garnt>
<joey> full nips and everything if you've ever </joey>
<joey> thought about getting with your teacher </joey>
<joey> because that's </joey>
<joey> that's basically the show okay that's </joey>
<joey> basically that's basically the manga i </joey>
<joey> need no more </joey>
<joey> but you might need more because the </joey>
<joey> other manga that they have is tempuru </joey>
<joey> which uh </joey>
<connor> is illustrated by the same guy no sorry </connor>
<connor> yeah illustrated by the same guy who did </connor>
<connor> grand blue you know grand blue i do know </connor>
<connor> i do yeah so illustrated by the </connor>
<connor> completely same guy just different </connor>
<connor> writer but essentially as the name </connor>
<connor> suggests it's about this kid </connor>
<connor> who has these really dirty thoughts but </connor>
<joey> he wants to be a good christian so he </joey>
<joey> basically goes to a temple to get rid of </joey>
<joey> his </joey>
<joey> horny on mean christian thoughts but the </joey>
<joey> problem is that he </joey>
<joey> becomes a monk at a temple that is full </joey>
<garnt> of hot women </garnt>
<garnt> that doesn't sound very monkey today </garnt>
<connor> did that happen to you mom i want to be </connor>
<joey> a monk i swear </joey>
<joey> yeah this was the real reason that i </joey>
<garnt> became the market hoping for that </garnt>
<joey> scenario that sounds pretty good yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah and but like the thing is </joey>
<joey> because it's illustrated by the same guy </joey>
<connor> the grand blue the type of comedy is </connor>
<joey> exactly the same as ground blue so if </joey>
<joey> you love the like </joey>
<joey> really vulgar visual comedy that really </joey>
<joey> made grand blue funny like tempura is </joey>
<joey> exactly the same way and the added bonus </joey>
<joey> is that </joey>
<joey> it's way more hot girls in temperature </joey>
<connor> than ground blue so guys i'm i'm getting </connor>

<garnt> a little known </garnt>
<garnt> secret or it's literally in fact that </garnt>
<garnt> i've i've been a monk </garnt>
<joey> in my life but i've not just been a monk </joey>
<joey> once right just saying that is so cool </joey>
<garnt> to me this is just part of buddhist </garnt>
<connor> culture so in buddhist culture </connor>
<connor> um normally when you want to give your </connor>
<connor> family like good karma </connor>
<connor> everyone in my family has been a monk </connor>
<joey> like twice in their life </joey>
<joey> once when they're a teenager and once </joey>
<joey> when they're like </joey>
<connor> an adult so you you you become a monk </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> once when you're when you're like a </connor>
<connor> teenager we call that being </connor>
<joey> um and then there's you become like a </joey>
<joey> full monk when you </joey>
<joey> become an adult and that's when you kind </joey>
<joey> of hit like your early 20s </joey>
<joey> okay okay so yeah so normally a lot of </joey>
<joey> people just do it like for like one or </joey>
<joey> two days </joey>
<joey> because we believe that it's good karma </joey>
<joey> yeah um i remember when i was about </joey>
<connor> 12 or 13 i i was a monk for two weeks </connor>
<garnt> and then afterwards when i was about 22 </garnt>
<garnt> 23 i was a monk for a full month jeez </garnt>
<joey> yeah yeah because i cuz i because you </joey>
<joey> told me stories about how you were a </joey>
<joey> monk for an entire </joey>
<joey> month but i never knew that you did it </joey>
<garnt> twice oh yeah yeah i mean i mean to me </garnt>
<garnt> it's just </garnt>
<garnt> not part of like being a buddhist and </garnt>
<connor> you know trying to get i was trying </connor>
<connor> i was that good little asian kid i was </connor>
<connor> trying to give like my family good karma </connor>
<connor> and everything but </connor>
<connor> i honestly i honestly like wrapped the </connor>
<connor> experience because it was </connor>
<joey> i'm not i'm not joking when it was </joey>
<joey> literally the life-changing experience </joey>
<joey> for me like well that was it </joey>
<joey> that was me before being a monk and then </joey>
<joey> there's me after being a monk </joey>
<joey> because normally people just do it just </joey>
<connor> to you know </connor>
<connor> uh just to impress their family and just </connor>
<connor> give give their family good karma </connor>
<connor> but i i told my mom if i'm gonna do it </connor>
<joey> i'm gonna go </joey>
<connor> all the way like yeah yeah like there's </connor>
<joey> there's some temples that you go to </joey>
<connor> that don't take it as seriously and then </connor>
<connor> i i went to a [ __ ] hardcore temple </connor>
<connor> where you know we didn't have any </connor>
<connor> technology </connor>
<connor> yeah uh we had to okay so here was my </connor>
<garnt> daily schedule </garnt>
<garnt> okay so i would have to wake up at </garnt>
<joey> around 4am </joey>
<joey> that already sounds like torture that </joey>
<joey> already sounds like </joey>
<joey> like have have to be ready have to be </joey>
<joey> completely ready by five </joey>
<joey> okay and we didn't have any beds we had </joey>
<joey> a concrete floor </joey>
<joey> and one little pillow to sleep on oh my </joey>
<connor> god and we had like the thinnest blanket </connor>
<connor> in the world which wasn't so bad because </connor>
<connor> it's thailand but </connor>
<connor> when sometimes when you're sleeping in </connor>
<connor> the middle of the forest because there </connor>
<connor> would be times when we just go out to a </connor>
<connor> temple in the middle of the forest </connor>
<connor> it can get [ __ ] cold the temperature </connor>
<connor> drops to about </connor>
<joey> two or three degrees sometimes and and </joey>
<joey> like you you just have this like tiny </joey>
<connor> little blanket on a concrete floor </connor>
<joey> to keep you warm right so we'd have to </joey>
<joey> wake up at four get ready by five </joey>
<joey> and then we'd just be like meditating </joey>
<connor> and praying for a good two three hours </connor>
<joey> every day and then afterwards we would </joey>
<connor> basically </connor>
<connor> go out barefoot go to like whatever </connor>
<connor> village or </connor>
<connor> whatever area around the temple um and </connor>
<connor> people would just donate </connor>
<joey> donate the food to we would have these </joey>
<joey> we would carry like these little baskets </joey>
<joey> um on our necks </joey>
<joey> and people would come over and they </joey>
<joey> would you know donate food or whatever </joey>
<joey> they want to donate because we believe </joey>
<joey> that if you give to a monk that's good </joey>
<joey> karma as well yeah yeah </joey>
<connor> so the food that we got donated that's </connor>
<connor> what we would eat </connor>
<garnt> so we we would walk around for a few </garnt>
<connor> hours for the entire day </connor>
<connor> yeah for the inside or was it like just </connor>
<garnt> like enough or </garnt>
<connor> i mean you you get what you're given </connor>
<connor> right </connor>
<garnt> you had no choice about what you could </garnt>
<garnt> eat you could eat basically what you </garnt>
<connor> were given did you ever get anything </connor>
<garnt> like super nasty </garnt>
<garnt> no i mean it's it's i guess in in the </garnt>
<connor> mindset you're not like picky you're </connor>
<connor> like oh really a snickers </connor>
<connor> really no because </connor>
<joey> the whole point of being a monk is that </joey>
<connor> you don't okay you don't care like you </connor>
<connor> you </connor>
<connor> you eat to survive i guess if you're </connor>
<connor> caring about that that's like no that's </connor>
<connor> that's defeating the point of being a </connor>
<connor> monk so you you get what you're given </connor>
<connor> and you </connor>
<connor> you live the simplest life you can </connor>
<connor> possibly live and you basically eat to </connor>
<joey> survive </joey>
<joey> and you get one meal a day and you gotta </joey>
<connor> you gotta be okay with whatever you get </connor>
<joey> given so we would </joey>
<connor> eat at around 11 to 12 o'clock and that </connor>
<connor> would be our first </connor>
<connor> and only meal a day it was it was easier </connor>
<connor> when you're a kidman because kid amongst </connor>
<connor> you get two meals </connor>
<connor> a day okay yeah but when you're an adult </connor>
<connor> yeah when you're an adult when you're </connor>
<connor> more </connor>
<connor> grown up burning through more calories </connor>
<connor> nope </connor>
<joey> you got to survive on one meal a day and </joey>
<joey> afterwards you could there was no </joey>
<joey> cheating so after that you couldn't have </joey>
<joey> any milk </joey>
<connor> or any like liquids that had calories </connor>
<joey> you could only have water water </joey>
<connor> or some kinds of fruit juices and and </connor>
<connor> that was it </connor>
<connor> and yeah it was it was very </connor>
<connor> i i i don't know really how to describe </connor>
<connor> the experience because imagine if you </connor>
<connor> just take </connor>
<connor> every every distraction out of your life </connor>
<connor> and you just live the simplest life </connor>
<connor> possible you don't need to enjoy </connor>
<connor> your food you know you you get you don't </connor>
<connor> really get </connor>
<connor> the pleasures in life but at the same </connor>
<connor> time you just kind of </connor>
<connor> you're okay with everything because you </connor>
<connor> have to be okay with everything </connor>
<connor> and i remember for the first </connor>
<connor> week of being a monk it's [ __ ] hard </connor>
<connor> it is so [ __ ] hard to reprogram your </connor>
<joey> brain </joey>
<joey> to not only be like okay how do i </joey>
<joey> distract myself with my phone how do i </joey>
<joey> not check twitter how do i not watch </joey>
<joey> youtube videos how do i just </joey>
<joey> be okay with my own thoughts and just </joey>
<joey> and and it's so hard because your brain </joey>
<joey> nowadays your brain constantly </joey>
<joey> constantly looking forward to something </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> it constantly needs something to </joey>
<joey> distract itself um </joey>
<joey> and the first week i was just you're </joey>
<connor> kind of like a drug addict right </connor>
<connor> i'm sorry i should tweet give me a tweet </connor>
<connor> i'm i'm sitting there trying to meditate </connor>
<connor> and my mind's just going out a million </connor>
<connor> miles an hour </connor>
<connor> yeah i haven't watched tv in in a week i </connor>
<connor> haven't seen a screen in a week it's </connor>
<connor> it's very very difficult but the more </connor>
<connor> time you do it the more you kind of your </connor>
<connor> you realize that oh this is this this is </connor>
<connor> all </connor>
<connor> these are all just distractions like you </connor>
<connor> can be completely okay with just </connor>
<connor> yourself </connor>
<connor> and your own thoughts and just doing the </connor>
<connor> simplest things </connor>
<connor> and life activities and then when </connor>
<connor> i got to that point i kind of just had </connor>
<connor> time to just reflect </connor>
<connor> on my entire life because what else what </connor>
<joey> else what else are you gonna [ __ ] do </joey>
<connor> when you have nothing to do </connor>
<joey> but literally think back about </joey>
<joey> everything </joey>
<joey> every decision that you've made in your </joey>
<connor> life and the way your mind works </connor>
<connor> you know you know when you're sometimes </connor>
<connor> you're like lying in bed at 11 a.m and </connor>
<connor> your </connor>
<connor> brain reminds you about shitty thing </connor>
<connor> about that embarrassing thing you did </connor>
<connor> when you were 12 or maybe like </connor>
<connor> that time when you punched a [ __ ] kid </connor>
<connor> in front i'm like oh my god i got him </connor>
<connor> good </connor>
<connor> so just just imagine your entire day </connor>
<connor> just being </connor>
<connor> that just being like uh i wonder if i'd </connor>
<connor> made the right choice at this point in </connor>
<connor> my life and then </connor>
<connor> what happened to me was that i kind of </connor>
<connor> just reflected on </connor>
<connor> every every little decision that kind of </connor>
<connor> that kind of led me up to this point in </connor>
<connor> my life and what it made me </connor>
<joey> what it forced me to do was really think </joey>
<joey> huh am i </joey>
<joey> really happy about where i am now like </joey>
<joey> what's what's my life going to be like </joey>
<joey> out when </joey>
<joey> when i when this monkey ends and </joey>
<joey> i was at a really bad point in my life </joey>
<joey> before i became a monk which is kind of </joey>
<joey> why i've really wanted to </joey>
<joey> commit to the facts of being </joey>
<joey> like if if i was going to be a monk i'm </joey>
<joey> going to go all the way </joey>
<joey> get the full detox yeah get the full </joey>
<joey> detox you know because i've seen some </joey>
<joey> temples you you walk in and they have </joey>
<joey> like a flat like a 50 inch flat screen </joey>
<joey> and i'm like this is the monk channel </joey>
<joey> only </joey>
<connor> we only have the mung channel this </connor>
<connor> doesn't seem very monkey to me </connor>
<connor> i don't know about that except paypal </connor>
<connor> you turn the tv on it's like a live </connor>
<connor> stream of like a different temple and </connor>
<joey> then like </joey>
<garnt> praying exactly nice nice content </garnt>
<garnt> so so it forced me to just reflect on my </garnt>
<garnt> entire life and it forced me to really </garnt>
<garnt> think about what i wanted to do </garnt>
<garnt> after my monkey had ended so it was </garnt>
<garnt> truly </garnt>
<garnt> a i don't want to say [ __ ] it was a </garnt>
<garnt> spiritual journey and i really just </garnt>
<joey> discovered i mean i thought in this </joey>
<joey> instance you can because it but it </joey>
<joey> only </joey>
<connor> because people have talked to me about </connor>
<connor> how they have you know how they've had </connor>
<connor> similar experiences when they just </connor>
<connor> shut off social media and everything </connor>
<connor> like that yeah and i'm just like </connor>
<connor> you know no you're already yeah bruh </connor>
<connor> bruh </connor>
<joey> you don't even know get on my level yeah </joey>
<joey> get on my level bro </joey>
<connor> like you didn't have any board games you </connor>
<connor> didn't have any cards to just </connor>
<connor> play around or all you just had was just </connor>
<garnt> yourself and </garnt>
<garnt> and it's just it i can't really convey </garnt>
<garnt> how alien that is because it it was </garnt>
<joey> alien for me as well it was a part of me </joey>
<joey> that just a vision </joey>
<connor> like you know because as you said the </connor>
<joey> only thing you had was just yourself and </joey>
<connor> your mind right yeah yeah and </connor>
<connor> all i could imagine was just monk gone </connor>
<joey> just sitting there and just thinking up </joey>
<connor> a funny jokes </connor>
<connor> i'm gonna roast these noobs when i get </connor>
<garnt> back good roast oh no no no </garnt>
<connor> that that's that totally happened as </connor>
<connor> well that's when i was a monk that's </connor>
<garnt> when </garnt>
<garnt> i uh thought about hmm there's a series </garnt>
<garnt> i'm going to make called anime in </garnt>
<joey> minutes </joey>
<joey> are you serious i'm totally serious </joey>
<garnt> i'm totally serious that that came to me </garnt>
<garnt> when i i remember the exact moment </garnt>
<garnt> because i was i was just walking around </garnt>
<garnt> um walking around one of the thai </garnt>
<joey> villages and </joey>
<joey> it just it just it just [ __ ] came to </joey>
<joey> me because i i thought i remember </joey>
<joey> last uh not last week but a few weeks </joey>
<joey> ago i talked about being zen </joey>
<connor> on the [ __ ] toilet in the shower yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah so that was that's kind of like </joey>
<joey> i i kind of sometimes when i'm just </joey>
<connor> walking and i'm just </connor>
<connor> you know just zoning out sometimes i've </connor>
<connor> reached this </connor>
<connor> point when a lot of ideas just come to </connor>
<connor> me and it came to me when </connor>
<connor> i was a monk as well and i had i got a </connor>
<garnt> lot of video ideas </garnt>
<garnt> and a lot of a lot of ideas when i was a </garnt>
<connor> monk </connor>
<garnt> sensei yeah which which which it was it </garnt>
<garnt> was </garnt>
<joey> these ideas when i was a monk that have </joey>
<joey> developed to me like to my comeback on </joey>
<joey> youtube </joey>
<joey> where i figured out okay if i'm going to </joey>
<joey> come back on youtube how i was i was </joey>
<joey> going to come back on youtube yeah </joey>
<joey> but yeah this has been a very closely </joey>
<joey> guarded secret because </joey>
<joey> you want there are some there are some </joey>
<joey> youtube some very old youtube clips </joey>
<joey> where i'm just wearing i'm just wearing </joey>
<joey> a beanie and nobody knows why i'm just </joey>
<joey> wearing a beanie </joey>
<joey> and it was because it just i had just </joey>
<joey> finished my monkey and i was just </joey>
<joey> completely bold </joey>
<joey> yeah what if they just like took it in a </joey>
<joey> really dark direction it's like oh no </joey>
<connor> the cancer treatment yeah yeah how do </connor>
<joey> you like sign up to be a monk do you </joey>
<connor> just </connor>
<connor> is it like a facebook group you're like </connor>
<joey> i wanna i wanna be a mother you know </joey>
<joey> like how do you </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i mean you just turn up to whatever </garnt>
<connor> temple you you want to </connor>
<connor> do and they they're like okay you go to </connor>
<connor> the head monk and you request </connor>
<connor> to be a monk and they ask okay before </connor>
<connor> you become a monk you need to make sure </connor>
<connor> you have you have no outstanding debts </connor>
<connor> yeah you basically you've got to give up </connor>
<joey> all material connections to the world </joey>
<joey> before you can commit to becoming a monk </joey>
<joey> and you'll have like this interview </joey>
<joey> where you're like okay if you're gonna </joey>
<garnt> become a monk you gotta make sure </garnt>
<joey> yeah do this do this do this you know </joey>
<connor> you know what would be a really cool </connor>
<connor> idea for </connor>
<connor> this channel if like us 3 somehow went </connor>
<connor> to like a temple here </connor>
<connor> and just like experienced it for like a </connor>
<connor> single day wow </connor>
<connor> already on that [ __ ] hey if you guys </connor>
<connor> would like to see that </connor>
<connor> monk episode monk episode like god could </connor>
<joey> be like head monk of trash case it's </joey>
<connor> just [ __ ] like we have to shave our </connor>
<joey> heads you do realize that jerry </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] i just know i can do it all over </joey>
<joey> again i can commit to that </joey>
<joey> i know you caught your hair </joey>
<garnt> but like i don't really talk about it </garnt>
<garnt> but now that now that i am i do </garnt>
<garnt> like highly recommend that kind of </garnt>
<garnt> experience or just </garnt>
<garnt> or just do it doing that kind of </garnt>
<connor> experience because you don't notice </connor>
<connor> how like how distracting life is like </connor>
<connor> just </connor>
<connor> like you don't you don't realize that as </connor>
<connor> soon as you wake up you got things to </connor>
<connor> occupy your mind yeah </connor>
<connor> you got your job or you got you know you </connor>
<connor> wait you </connor>
<connor> the first thing you do is you check </connor>
<connor> twitter you open arc nights </connor>
<connor> and you don't you don't know how crazy </connor>
<connor> your mind can be sometimes so you </connor>
<connor> literally remove </connor>
<connor> every distraction every commitment that </connor>
<connor> you need to do from your daily life and </connor>
<connor> you just have </connor>
<connor> you just have nothing because it's just </connor>
<connor> it's just a void right </connor>
<connor> you're just giving your life a void and </connor>
<garnt> because you give your life a void </garnt>
<garnt> it [ __ ] changes you i i don't know i </garnt>
<joey> don't i don't know how else i know </joey>
<joey> i totally get that like back when i was </joey>
<joey> still doing youtube stuff </joey>
<connor> um i would i went on this like camping </connor>
<connor> trip with a few of my friends </connor>
<connor> and we went to this area that had </connor>
<connor> absolutely no reception whatsoever oh </connor>
<joey> whales </joey>
<joey> yeah we went all the way to wales no we </joey>
<connor> were just in the [ __ ] middle of </connor>
<joey> nowhere in australia with no reception </joey>
<connor> and we would just went camping and </connor>
<connor> because there's no reception </connor>
<joey> i couldn't check anything right like i </joey>
<connor> couldn't like i couldn't even like </connor>
<connor> message you </connor>
<connor> this is like a light version yeah it's </connor>
<joey> basically just like a dieting </joey>
<joey> yeah a diet version of it but i i kind </joey>
<connor> of had </connor>
<connor> like a similar experience to that but </connor>
<connor> only like for that one day and i </connor>
<connor> remember </connor>
<connor> the first couple of hours i [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> hated it because yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah i was getting those you know like </joey>
<joey> drug addicts like i need i need to know </joey>
<joey> who liked my tweet </joey>
<joey> but after a while like when it hit </joey>
<connor> around midday i </connor>
<connor> i eventually was like you know what this </connor>
<joey> is actually really nice like yeah </joey>
<connor> the world is beautiful that's why i love </connor>
<connor> going to the cinema like it's a </connor>
<connor> no one can like be like why don't you </connor>
<connor> answer your phone like yeah in every </connor>
<connor> other situation like oh you should have </connor>
<connor> answered </connor>
<connor> still in the cinema for some reason i </connor>
<joey> was like understandable have a nice day </joey>
<joey> you ignored my text for three hours </joey>
<joey> understandable it's just like a void </joey>
<joey> right it's great like i love it you just </joey>
<connor> literally ignore the world for like </connor>
<joey> three hours and just have fun yeah </joey>
<joey> and that's why it frustrates me when the </joey>
<garnt> void gets pulled back to reality when </garnt>
<garnt> someone in the back is just [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> shouting yeah yeah just being like oh </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i forgot this reality </garnt>
<garnt> oh yeah because especially now i think i </garnt>
<connor> don't know the internet's i feel like </connor>
<connor> has reprogrammed my brain </connor>
<connor> yeah i don't remember i don't know if i </connor>
<garnt> just have adhd </garnt>
<garnt> because i didn't always felt like i was </garnt>
<joey> this easily distracted it's like </joey>
<joey> subconsciously building patterns in your </joey>
<joey> head though like because </joey>
<joey> you you've trained your brain to check </joey>
<joey> twitter </joey>
<joey> yeah and so you'll you you'll have that </joey>
<joey> moment and i'm sure you've all had it </joey>
<joey> where you're like you opened twitter you </joey>
<joey> closed twitter and you opened twitter </joey>
<joey> again and you're like why did i open </joey>
<joey> twitter again yeah like i didn't want to </joey>
<joey> open like i literally just refreshed my </joey>
<joey> feet two seconds ago i </joey>
<garnt> i didn't want to do this i just didn't </garnt>
<garnt> you check twitter on your computer </garnt>
<garnt> and you realize there's nothing nothing </garnt>
<joey> you checked it and then you immediately </joey>
<joey> check it on your phone why am i doing </joey>
<joey> this i wasted time </joey>
<joey> it's the same concept just going to the </joey>
<joey> fridge seeing nothing there closing it </joey>
<joey> sitting back on the couch and then five </joey>
<joey> minutes later going to the fridge </joey>
<joey> it's like it's like food's gonna </joey>
<garnt> magically appear in the freezer right </garnt>
<garnt> yeah so i i mean it was it was </garnt>
<joey> it was an awesome experience for me i </joey>
<joey> like i don't you know if </joey>
<joey> if that's not something that's if not </joey>
<joey> that's it's a little bit it's not an </joey>
<garnt> experience for everyone </garnt>
<garnt> the question is though would you do it </garnt>
<garnt> again um i </garnt>
<garnt> would do it again possibly maybe not to </garnt>
<garnt> this extreme because i feel like i'm in </garnt>
<joey> a lot better place in my life i'm a lot </joey>
<connor> more privileged now </connor>
<garnt> no i mean like like not not just not </garnt>
<connor> just that but like mentally yeah i'm in </connor>
<connor> a lot better place in my life as well </connor>
<connor> um so i don't feel i would need to go to </connor>
<garnt> that extreme again but </garnt>
<garnt> would i want an experience where i just </garnt>
<garnt> kind of just remove myself from the </garnt>
<joey> world and just give myself </joey>
<joey> it's like a short detox yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<garnt> that's that's it's like a detox from the </garnt>
<joey> mind yeah this is how i feel it </joey>
<joey> and i i highly recommend people doing </joey>
<connor> that it sounds really cheesy because </connor>
<connor> people will always think of that leo </connor>
<garnt> some some crazy californian gap y'all </garnt>
<joey> like going on a gap yeah i took a gap </joey>
<joey> year to thailand became a mom </joey>
<joey> exactly that right i was just like shut </joey>
<joey> up dude </joey>
<joey> you probably went to the club every </joey>
<joey> night like shut up yeah so that's why i </joey>
<joey> don't really </joey>
<joey> i don't really like to talk about it </joey>
<connor> because whenever whenever you say yeah </connor>
<connor> it's unpretentious it sounds pretentious </connor>
<garnt> people give you that look to be like </garnt>
<connor> why because it makes it sound like you </connor>
<connor> it was like a vacation for you whereas </connor>
<joey> it was probably someone's life right </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah yeah that's why it sounds </connor>
<joey> or maybe or maybe it sounds like it </joey>
<joey> because maybe some people think you just </joey>
<joey> went through it just to brag about it </joey>
<joey> like later on yeah yeah exactly </joey>
<joey> the fact that you've you you don't </joey>
<joey> really talk about this </joey>
<joey> i never talk about this i remember i i </joey>
<joey> dragged you i dragged that conversation </joey>
<joey> out of you </joey>
<joey> we were like really drunk it's in </joey>
<joey> singapore like three </joey>
<garnt> years ago i think i just drunkly </garnt>
<joey> offhanded mentioned </joey>
<connor> so were you like were you ever angry </connor>
<connor> before you were a monk because i swear </connor>
<connor> i've never seen you angry what's up with </connor>
<garnt> that gun </garnt>
<garnt> i mean i i i've been angry before you </garnt>
<connor> get mildly frustrated you don't get </connor>
<connor> even when you're angry i'm like dude you </connor>
<connor> i don't know if you're angry angry </connor>
<garnt> no like like being a monk just taught me </garnt>
<joey> how to deal with it think </joey>
<connor> about the whole process basically </connor>
<joey> process everything right because </joey>
<joey> when when you just kind of empty your </joey>
<connor> mind you part part of </connor>
<connor> part of the uh commitment we try to make </connor>
<connor> is that we try to </connor>
<connor> learn how we process our way of thinking </connor>
<connor> and you gotta like </connor>
<connor> you gotta kind of it's i okay so the way </connor>
<joey> i see it </joey>
<connor> it's kind of like a logic tree right and </connor>
<connor> and and </connor>
<connor> and this is what happened to me when i </connor>
<connor> was a monk where i'd feel certain </connor>
<connor> emotions and you'd have to like </connor>
<connor> logically think </connor>
<connor> be like why am i feeling this why am i </connor>
<connor> feeling this how did this come </connor>
<connor> and then you kind of learn the roots of </connor>
<connor> basically all your emotions and just </connor>
<connor> anger and then </connor>
<joey> through that i just on the fly i learned </joey>
<joey> how to deal with my anger and just and </joey>
<joey> just i would find another route to be </joey>
<joey> like okay </joey>
<joey> before i get angry maybe i could go </joey>
<joey> maybe i could try dealing </joey>
<connor> with another way which is why i rarely </connor>
<connor> get angry </connor>
<connor> um and i always you know some people get </connor>
<connor> angry very easily </connor>
<connor> um but for me it's not that i don't get </connor>
<connor> angry is that i just </connor>
<garnt> have different ways of dealing about it </garnt>
<connor> than of course than shouting or [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> death i just love </connor>
<garnt> shouting man okay i don't punch anyone </garnt>
<garnt> anymore that's old </garnt>
<garnt> old connor's gone new connor he just </garnt>
<connor> wears cosplays and shouts loudly yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah i love shouting i love like </joey>
<joey> when i shout out </joey>
<connor> i [ __ ] love shouting </connor>
<connor> i don't know why shouting is so fun like </connor>
<joey> so do you like purposely shout to just </joey>
<joey> get like </joey>
<joey> that frustration now before it turns </joey>
<connor> into legit anger or </connor>
<connor> sometimes if i'm like real angry some </connor>
<connor> days or i wake up and i'm upset i'll </connor>
<connor> just go in the mirror </connor>
<connor> and i'll be like come on </connor>
<joey> i only hear i only see that in like </joey>
<joey> movies right like </joey>
<joey> that [ __ ] i wouldn't be i wouldn't be </joey>
<joey> surprised if you're the kind of person </joey>
<joey> who just like punches their pillow </joey>
<joey> frustration out but i just imagined you </joey>
<garnt> in the [ __ ] morning every every </garnt>
<joey> morning </joey>
<joey> okay like in the mirror god you got you </joey>
<connor> got this kind of </connor>
<connor> you got it okay okay you you [ __ ] got </connor>

<garnt> shane i think this is because you're </garnt>
<garnt> you've </garnt>
<connor> you've just recently started doing it a </connor>
<connor> lot right yeah because i remember when i </connor>
<joey> first started filming my face a lot </joey>
<joey> i [ __ ] dreaded doing it oh yeah i did </joey>
<joey> everything to avoid it i would be like i </joey>
<connor> would shave </connor>
<connor> like three times just to make sure it </connor>
<garnt> was perfect in my head but rece but </garnt>
<garnt> really what i was doing was delaying it </garnt>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<connor> yeah yeah like oh my god maybe i need to </connor>
<joey> go get the groceries actually i should </joey>
<joey> do </joey>
<connor> laundry action oh it's too late to focus </connor>

<joey> i can't recall because i was too busy </joey>
<connor> renovating my house yeah yeah but now </connor>
<connor> now i just [ __ ] turn it on and do it </connor>
<connor> i don't i already think about it yeah i </connor>
<joey> don't really </joey>
<joey> i don't really hype myself i have a </joey>
<connor> coffee maybe a red bull if i need it but </connor>
<joey> that's about it yeah caffeine helps </joey>
<joey> definitely but i don't i don't really </joey>
<joey> have like a do it phase you know </joey>
<connor> in the morning if you're feeling down </connor>

<joey> hyping up i do </joey>
<joey> maybe you know sometimes if if because </joey>

<joey> what the emotions are this is how my </joey>
<connor> music tastes works and how i find songs </connor>
<connor> i like one song and then i'll just </connor>
<connor> keep letting youtube suggest me songs </connor>

<connor> remix there's so many good ones there's </connor>
<connor> like one where it's like uh </connor>
<connor> the sort of chino salameh mixed with </connor>

<garnt> remakes </garnt>
<garnt> there's so many good anime releases on </garnt>
<joey> youtube that you're not allowed on </joey>
<joey> spotify </joey>
<joey> right yeah and like because sometimes i </joey>
<joey> want to listen to like daft punk but i </joey>
<garnt> also want to have </garnt>
<connor> you know that anime remix yeah so i can </connor>
<garnt> do that on youtube </garnt>
<garnt> hell yeah dude i've recently kind of </garnt>
<garnt> gone into the rabbit hole of </garnt>
<garnt> the these insane like music remixes and </garnt>
<garnt> and not just like anime obviously you </garnt>
<garnt> know that anime remixes like everyone's </garnt>
<connor> seen the [ __ ] random circulation </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah or whatever right my friend </garnt>
<connor> sent me one the other day which was </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] insane it was september by earth </connor>
<connor> wind and fire oh </connor>
<connor> remixed with crazy train by ozzy </connor>
<connor> osbourne </connor>
<connor> you can remix that song with anything </connor>
<joey> though yeah but it sounded </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] amazing i was like oh my god i i </joey>
<connor> need more i need more i have never seen </connor>
<connor> an earth wounded fire remix uh september </connor>
<connor> that disappointed me except for the </connor>
<connor> taylor swift one that was terrible </connor>
<garnt> but earth winning fire goes in </garnt>
<garnt> everything that we the wii shop one have </garnt>
<joey> you seen that the wii </joey>
<joey> shop bro that [ __ ] collapsed bro </joey>
<connor> i can't do </connor>
<garnt> i've recently fallen into the rabbit </garnt>
<garnt> hole of just listening to j-pop that </garnt>
<joey> they sound like anime opening and </joey>
<joey> endings but they're not </joey>
<joey> oh yeah yeah like polka dots </joey>
<joey> um it's it's it's it's so many yeah </joey>
<joey> there's </joey>
<joey> it's like the rabbit hole right you </joey>
<joey> discover one that the algorithm is like </joey>
<joey> oh oh you like this </joey>
<joey> oh hello hello let me let me show you </joey>
<joey> more it's going so deep right </joey>
<joey> that recently i was recommended a video </joey>
<joey> which is kind of like a it was kind of </joey>
<joey> like a vocaloid kind of remix but i </joey>
<joey> think it was original song but </joey>
<connor> the video had no title yeah and the </connor>
<connor> channel </connor>
<connor> the channel had no title and then i </connor>
<connor> click on it what yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> so so it's it's it's not it's not even </connor>
<garnt> like they have a space or something no </garnt>
<garnt> there's just literally no character for </garnt>
<garnt> the title </garnt>
<connor> you can do that apparently you can </connor>
<connor> there's a there's a thing called like a </connor>
<garnt> half half space or something and it's a </garnt>
<garnt> space that uh </garnt>
<connor> is technically a character yeah but it </connor>
<garnt> doesn't show up as anything </garnt>
<garnt> oh wow so so but but you can't you can't </garnt>
<connor> like highlight it and copy and paste </connor>
<connor> into the search bar </connor>
<connor> there's no interaction with whatever </connor>
<connor> character they're putting down right </connor>
<connor> right </connor>
<joey> so the only way people would have got </joey>
<joey> this </joey>
<joey> is through recommendations yeah and the </joey>
<joey> video has like two million views </joey>
<joey> and then you click i click on it right </joey>
<connor> and then everyone's like </connor>
<connor> ah welcome to the cult i see you're </connor>
<connor> diagnosed </connor>
<connor> i see you have been the chosen one and </connor>
<connor> it's it's it's great because like </connor>
<connor> they're probably going to kill me now </connor>
<connor> because it was like </connor>
<connor> everyone's like mutually agreed not to </connor>
<connor> talk about this which sorry guys i guess </connor>
<connor> i guess the entire the entire [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> the entire [ __ ] internet knows now </connor>
<garnt> but i'm not going to link to it </garnt>
<garnt> if if you're part if you're part of the </garnt>
<garnt> chosen one like </garnt>
<garnt> show me a message if i see anyone </garnt>
<garnt> linking it i'm gonna [ __ ] ban you </garnt>
<connor> you played me this at your house and i </connor>
<joey> was just hoping one day it would pop up </joey>
<connor> in my record </connor>
<joey> still waiting still waiting still wait </joey>
<joey> it's like illuminati man you just gotta </joey>
<connor> wait for that </connor>
<connor> crappy </connor>
<garnt> no but that's that's just the wonders of </garnt>
<garnt> the algorithm i mean i have no idea how </garnt>
<garnt> the algorithm works there's </garnt>
<garnt> there's okay going completely off topic </garnt>
<joey> here but there's been one video </joey>
<joey> one video of mine recently oh yeah </joey>
<joey> that's just been </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] getting recommended to everyone </joey>
<joey> and i have </joey>
<joey> no idea why it's an eight-year-old video </joey>
<joey> that we've not talked about in this </joey>
<joey> podcast so many people have tweeted us </joey>
<joey> about it i'm just like </joey>
<joey> wow yeah so there's been a video </joey>
<connor> recently that's been circulating that's </connor>
<connor> called </connor>
<connor> recently the time of filming yeah </connor>
<connor> recently at the time of filming um it </connor>
<connor> might still be circulating talking about </connor>
<joey> it it's probably going to start getting </joey>
<joey> exactly </joey>
<joey> yeah so i should probably circle back to </joey>
<joey> the start of annie tube itself you guys </joey>
<joey> are about to get a history lesson here </joey>
<connor> go on </connor>
<connor> so okay so do you do you guys know who </connor>
<connor> the very first annie tuber is </connor>
<joey> i thought it was mr anime yeah that was </joey>
<connor> my preconception yeah </connor>
<connor> i mean i'd be surprised if anyone </connor>
<connor> watching this new because that means </connor>
<joey> you've been around for as long as me </joey>
<joey> but the very first anime youtuber is </joey>
<joey> this guy called </joey>
<joey> hard anime reviews okay and he would be </joey>
<joey> he started in 2006 and he would just </joey>
<joey> basically make he would basically make </joey>
<joey> very uh </joey>
<joey> very basic anime reviews with like his </joey>
<connor> camera was like up here </connor>
<joey> worst angle yeah yeah yeah the kind of </joey>
<joey> kind of like the worst angle you can </joey>
<joey> think of the angle we all start </joey>
<joey> and he he's not he's now quit um it's </joey>
<joey> it's funny because i </joey>
<joey> i tried to search him up and see if he's </joey>
<joey> still around and he </joey>
<garnt> his first his first original channel got </garnt>
<garnt> terminated as everyone's did </garnt>
<garnt> back then when they're reviewing anime </garnt>
<garnt> and his second channel </garnt>
<garnt> is called unironically the hard mode </garnt>
<garnt> he called it the hard mode and okay if </garnt>
<garnt> you search this on youtube you have to </garnt>
<garnt> you have to search </garnt>
<garnt> the hard mode no space otherwise you're </garnt>
<garnt> not going to find it because it's </garnt>
<garnt> it's it's like that buried within the </garnt>
<garnt> search search algorithm </garnt>
<garnt> but the second annie tuber was this </garnt>
<garnt> person called mr anime </garnt>
<connor> and um he was he basically made his </connor>
<connor> anime youtube channel </connor>
<connor> to compete with hard because hard was </connor>
<connor> the only anime youtube channel around </connor>
<connor> and then mr anime was the second one and </connor>
<connor> he really at the time he really was </connor>
<connor> one of the big faces of anime youtube </connor>
<connor> and i say big </connor>
<connor> he had like a thousand subscribers </connor>
<connor> that's that's what i mean [ __ ] though </connor>
<connor> back in the day yeah </connor>
<connor> that is big [ __ ] back in 2006 2007. yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> and then it was after mr anime that </connor>
<joey> there were like there were like </joey>
<joey> some some other anime channels here and </joey>
<joey> there but those two </joey>
<joey> are basically the founding fathers of </joey>
<joey> anitu okay </joey>
<garnt> there we we have we have them to thank </garnt>
<garnt> for where we are now basically if people </garnt>
<joey> know </joey>
<joey> the ending to the story then you know </joey>
<garnt> how funny that statement is </garnt>
<garnt> i know right so then after a while </garnt>
<garnt> i um i make my youtube channel and i </garnt>
<garnt> i do i do my own thing and the very very </garnt>
<connor> first shout out i got </connor>
<connor> was from a mr anime video and it's it's </connor>
<connor> still up </connor>
<connor> which video is it huh it's it's mr anime </connor>
<joey> it's it's </joey>
<connor> his channel store yeah his channel what </connor>
<connor> it's all you can view </connor>
<garnt> his entire history and everything that </garnt>

<connor> who's that guy recently who got </connor>
<connor> prosecuted for like child pornography </connor>
<connor> and they took down his channel like that </connor>
<connor> oh really yeah that austin guy the </connor>

<joey> something and he just shouted out a </joey>
<joey> bunch of </joey>

<garnt> the same trace tesla </garnt>
<garnt> um [ __ ] i've just blanked in his actual </garnt>
<garnt> name now </garnt>
<garnt> all that's coming to mind is this mr </garnt>
<connor> anime oh my god </connor>
<connor> i can't believe i blanked on the name </connor>
<connor> mid-story </connor>
<joey> but um why did you doubt me like that </joey>
<joey> come on yeah yeah i i clicked on the </joey>
<joey> article and he had his face </joey>
<connor> and that was just the just the oh [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah yeah is is this is this real </connor>
<connor> like how how i </connor>
<connor> i had like 50 different emotions yeah i </connor>
<connor> kind of just see him because </connor>
<connor> you don't know how to react to this </connor>
<joey> because the more i read </joey>
<joey> just the more sickening it got yeah so </joey>
<joey> the the entire the entire story </joey>
<joey> was that apparently traceless trey </joey>
<connor> sessler mr anime </connor>
<connor> had uh been playing around with his </connor>
<connor> brother </connor>
<connor> and they they were playing around with </connor>
<connor> guns as they did on that as they did </connor>
<connor> see he had a lot of guns in in like his </connor>
<joey> channel and everything but </joey>
<joey> you know me back then me back then i </joey>
<garnt> just think </garnt>
<garnt> americans guns that's what just that's </garnt>
<connor> just what they do </connor>
<garnt> that's what british people think about </garnt>
<garnt> it yeah yeah we literally think </garnt>
<connor> americans just walk around be like i </connor>
<garnt> don't know </garnt>
<garnt> so he would just have guns in his anime </garnt>
<connor> reviews i just thought that was </connor>
<joey> completely normal which </joey>
<joey> you know because he was from texas as </joey>
<joey> well he was from texas </joey>
<joey> like sling in texas yeah exactly so i </joey>
<garnt> was like this is this is completely </garnt>
<garnt> normal this is nothing to worry about </garnt>
<connor> and </connor>
<connor> you know there's a texan watching studio </connor>
<garnt> with that gun just like yeah </garnt>
<garnt> even even now even now i see a text him </garnt>
<garnt> with a gun </garnt>
<connor> i just think you know that's that's even </connor>
<connor> normal even after everything i'm just </connor>
<connor> about to experience but i i read the </connor>
<connor> story and he was playing around with his </connor>
<connor> guns with his brother </connor>
<connor> and apparently he accidentally shot his </connor>
<connor> brother and he and he and he killed him </connor>
<connor> and so he didn't the the official story </connor>
<garnt> that he gave was he didn't want </garnt>
<garnt> his parents to feel guilt or his family </garnt>
<garnt> to feel </garnt>
<garnt> guilt about you know having his having </garnt>
<garnt> their </garnt>
<garnt> son kill one of their brothers so he </garnt>
<garnt> just apparently he just thought might as </garnt>
<garnt> well [ __ ] kill them all </garnt>
<connor> which is which is [ __ ] awful </connor>
<garnt> which is which is [ __ ] awful which is </garnt>
<garnt> a [ __ ] awful conclusion to come to so </garnt>
<garnt> apparently he kills </garnt>
<garnt> his entire family and then and then </garnt>
<garnt> it gets worse because the like the more </garnt>
<garnt> information that comes out </garnt>
<garnt> the more um we find out that he was </garnt>
<garnt> actually </garnt>
<garnt> not only planning to kill his family </garnt>
<garnt> anyway </garnt>
<garnt> but he was actually planning a columbine </garnt>
<garnt> style </garnt>
<joey> school shooting yeah right i i've </joey>
<joey> because i saw like this really good </joey>
<connor> documentary on youtube i'm sure it's up </connor>
<connor> there still </connor>
<connor> rainbot right yeah i think so it's it's </connor>
<connor> basically covers the whole thing but </connor>
<connor> that's how i got all my information as </connor>
<connor> well where yeah he was planning to do a </connor>
<joey> school shooting and </joey>
<joey> he i did he post about it online that he </joey>
<garnt> was going to do it or something like </garnt>
<garnt> that but he basically </garnt>
<joey> was on the way to the school and that's </joey>
<garnt> when he got arrested yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> no because he was he was planning he was </garnt>
<garnt> planning the school shooting for way </garnt>
<garnt> before he's killed his family because i </garnt>
<joey> think </joey>
<joey> i think how he thought was he killed his </joey>
<joey> brother by accident </joey>
<joey> but he was always planning the school </joey>
<connor> shooting anyway yeah like </connor>
<connor> he had he had it all mapped out and </connor>
<connor> everything so in between that he </connor>
<connor> accidentally killed his brother and </connor>
<connor> killed his family and that's what outed </connor>
<connor> him </connor>
<connor> but he was always planning this and </connor>
<connor> there's this really ominous video </connor>
<connor> um it was i think it's the second to </connor>
<connor> last mr anime video that's on his </connor>
<joey> channel that's just called </joey>
<joey> mr anime is planning something </joey>
<joey> i remember watching that thinking ah </joey>
<joey> he's taking a break from any chief i'm </joey>
<joey> just planning a new review he's he's </joey>
<joey> planning a car he's planning a comeback </joey>
<joey> but i don't know it's it because he </joey>
<joey> talks about anime in that video so he </joey>
<joey> might he might have been just </joey>
<joey> purely talking about anime but i'm like </joey>
<joey> with all the information </joey>
<joey> i have we have now he's probably now </joey>
<joey> that was [ __ ] scary </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] that title was [ __ ] yeah and </joey>
<joey> the more information that come that came </joey>
<joey> out the more i just </joey>
<joey> didn't know how to process this because </joey>
<joey> how how do you process the fact that </joey>
<connor> one of the people you looked up to and </connor>
<connor> respected just [ __ ] killed their </connor>
<connor> family and was planning to shoot up a </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] school </connor>
<connor> like what what what what'd you do with </connor>
<connor> that yeah and </connor>
<connor> that bothered me for uh for for like a </connor>
<connor> for a while and i remember that's this </connor>
<connor> was the time i was at university and </connor>
<connor> people were like why why is </connor>
<connor> why does ghan look like someone just die </connor>
<connor> in his family or something </connor>
<connor> but i i think the way the best way i can </connor>
<connor> describe it is </connor>
<connor> imagine if you like live in a small town </connor>
<connor> and you you may be like you know </connor>
<connor> everyone in that small town you might </connor>
<connor> not be friends with everyone in that </connor>
<connor> small town but you feel like this </connor>
<connor> small tight-knit community and then you </connor>
<connor> find that someone in this small tiny </connor>
<connor> community </connor>
<connor> has done something awful yeah it's like </connor>
<connor> something that's </connor>
<connor> not like beyond words you know beyond </connor>
<joey> words awful and it's </joey>
<joey> and then to try to process </joey>
<joey> process this i i made the video </joey>
<joey> which is being recommended now it's </joey>
<joey> circulating everywhere </joey>
<joey> even though it's eight years old um it's </joey>
<garnt> for some reason youtube decided yep </garnt>
<garnt> people want to see gang reacting to mr </garnt>
<garnt> anime murdering his family </garnt>
<garnt> i i don't i don't know how that came </garnt>
<connor> about it's literally on everyone's </connor>
<connor> recommendation it was on my recommended </connor>
<joey> yeah i don't know why like yeah it's </joey>
<garnt> probably not monetized right </garnt>
<garnt> no no it's not money right so it's just </garnt>
<garnt> like it just goes against </garnt>
<joey> everything about the youtube algorithms </joey>
<joey> like it's not monetized it's about a </joey>
<joey> horrible tragedy it's about a very </joey>
<joey> sensitive topic i mean i'm eight years </joey>
<garnt> old i i think i </garnt>
<connor> uploaded this before even like the </connor>
<connor> monetization thing like started on </connor>
<connor> youtube or at least before i was </connor>
<connor> monetized because i was </connor>
<garnt> i had like a thousand plus subscribers </garnt>
<joey> back then so </joey>
<joey> it was it wasn't massive i remember as </joey>
<joey> well that i </joey>
<connor> i i remember stumbling upon a mr anime </connor>
<connor> video </connor>
<connor> even like way before i knew about the </connor>
<connor> whole anime youtubing sphere and </connor>
<connor> everything </connor>
<connor> because it was mr anime's review </connor>
<connor> on gantz that made me want to go watch </connor>
<connor> games </connor>
<connor> and uh wow this guy's got a bright </connor>
<connor> career yeah and i was like wow this </connor>
<garnt> guy's like really fun he [ __ ] had </garnt>
<garnt> do you know how ghetto his setup was he </garnt>
<joey> he had like a a a </joey>
<garnt> webcam or something yeah yeah to record </garnt>
<joey> and he was sitting on his bed and he had </joey>
<joey> his lap it was like a notepad oh it was </joey>
<garnt> like an apple an </garnt>
<joey> apple notebook it was like an apple </joey>
<joey> notepad of the script and he was </joey>
<joey> literally just looking down </joey>
<joey> at the apple notepad just reading off </joey>
<joey> the script and then every now and then i </joey>
<joey> guess </joey>
<joey> because he didn't know how to edit his </joey>
<joey> videos so instead he had </joey>
<joey> a remote that controlled the zoom of the </joey>
<joey> lens </joey>
<garnt> he controlled the zoom of the lens and </garnt>
<garnt> just start talking to the camera and </garnt>
<garnt> then he just zoomed back out </garnt>
<joey> yeah yeah no cuts so he was like i </joey>
<joey> remember in the gantz review </joey>
<joey> he was talking about uh you know the </joey>
<joey> acid scene right yeah in the dance anime </joey>
<joey> and how he was like it made me go and </joey>
<joey> then he stops and zooms in </joey>
<joey> and zooms really far into his face and </joey>
<joey> he goes [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> and then he zooms out with a dead face </joey>
<joey> and it just goes back to reading it </joey>
<joey> yeah and that was the review no cuts no </joey>
<joey> edits </joey>
<joey> and i was like yeah i want to watch this </joey>
<joey> anime </joey>
<garnt> that was quality content back in the day </garnt>
<joey> or youtube i remember when </joey>
<connor> i started coming out with my videos i </connor>
<garnt> was one of the first to actually just </garnt>
<garnt> use an editing software even though it </garnt>
<garnt> was just putting images over whatever </garnt>
<connor> i'm saying i was like people were like </connor>
<garnt> what he's he's using windows movie maker </garnt>
<connor> impossible </connor>
<connor> wow but uh yeah that's that's the story </connor>
<garnt> of </garnt>
<garnt> the first person i ever in like humble </garnt>
<joey> beginnings </joey>
<garnt> yeah that's so fun yeah but i i </garnt>
<garnt> recommend like as [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> of uh of a topic that is like i i </connor>
<connor> definitely recommend that </connor>
<connor> documentary on youtube that somebody </connor>
<connor> made it's great because it perfectly </connor>
<connor> goes through </connor>
<connor> everything about it and at the end of </connor>
<connor> the documentary i don't know how they </connor>
<connor> got this footage but </connor>
<connor> there's this the police footage the </connor>
<connor> police footage yeah of how he's in like </connor>
<connor> the jail cell yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah the interview that [ __ ] is so scary </connor>
<connor> man yeah </connor>
<connor> and to think this is the guy who founded </connor>
<garnt> basically what i do for a living i know </garnt>
<joey> i know right right like that's so </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] scary </garnt>
<garnt> it's it's so weird because i've had a </garnt>
<garnt> con i've had this conversation with a </garnt>
<garnt> few people and </garnt>
<garnt> we just think man there's a lot of [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> that's happened in any tubes yeah yeah </garnt>
<connor> right </connor>
<garnt> i think there's stuff that unfortunately </garnt>
<connor> you know happens in every community yeah </connor>
<garnt> and that </garnt>
<connor> we probably will never find out some </connor>
<connor> really [ __ ] up [ __ ] that people have </connor>
<joey> done oh yeah </joey>
<joey> i mean we've only recently found out </joey>
<connor> about a lot of it right right </connor>
<connor> right i mean you know you you it's it's </connor>
<connor> really unfortunate because we don't like </connor>
<connor> to think that we know people who are </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> that but if time's proven anything it's </connor>
<connor> that </connor>
<connor> you know i've i've met people and been </connor>
<connor> friendly with people who have done </connor>
<connor> really [ __ ] horrible stuff i'm sure i </connor>
<joey> mean i never knew that you know one of </joey>
<joey> my best friends used to </joey>
<joey> punch kids in the face right </joey>
<garnt> i mean once you look once you look up </garnt>
<garnt> and respect a [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> serial killer school shooter then it's </joey>
<joey> all downhill from there right </joey>
<joey> yeah exactly i know how it feels to see </joey>
<connor> a police report and being like oh </connor>
<garnt> no oh yeah i i i just </garnt>
<connor> it's just a mess of emotions it's first </connor>
<garnt> it's </garnt>
<connor> surely this is fake yeah because you see </connor>
<connor> it and you're like i've never seen a </connor>
<joey> police before first of all </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah this could easily be doctored </joey>
<connor> like yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> and then just seeing like all the counts </connor>
<connor> being slowly like added and you're like </connor>
<connor> oh no </connor>
<connor> yeah oh no oh no this is bad yeah and i </connor>
<garnt> think that </garnt>
<garnt> that was the first time because i had a </garnt>
<garnt> conversation with </garnt>
<garnt> aiko the the anime review about how we </garnt>
<garnt> should process this and remember him </garnt>
<garnt> saying </garnt>
<garnt> um yeah i think he just he'll keep the </garnt>
<garnt> the memories of mr anime like the same </garnt>
<garnt> but it's just he has to view mr anime </garnt>
<garnt> and trey sessler as like different </garnt>
<garnt> people and i think that was the first </garnt>
<garnt> time </garnt>
<garnt> the first time i i had just thought </garnt>
<garnt> about the entire process of </garnt>
<garnt> having to view online personalities as </garnt>
<garnt> different </garnt>
<garnt> in person how they portray this the </garnt>
<joey> whole thing of like separating the </joey>
<joey> artist from the creation yeah yeah </joey>
<garnt> exactly right </garnt>
<garnt> it's and yeah the it was more the fact </garnt>
<garnt> that this happened in our small </garnt>
<garnt> community as well because </garnt>
<connor> right it's like happening in like the </connor>
<connor> small back rural town right where </connor>
<garnt> nothing happens </garnt>
<garnt> because i'm sure now in any tube i'm </garnt>
<connor> sure there's some [ __ ] somewhere </connor>
<connor> oh there's probably some someone doing </connor>
<connor> so we don't despicable [ __ ] that we </connor>
<garnt> don't know about you know but </garnt>
<garnt> it they weren't a figurehead in this </garnt>
<joey> very small community yeah they weren't </joey>
<joey> the [ __ ] founding father </joey>
<garnt> the literal founding the literal </garnt>
<garnt> founding the more the more you say that </garnt>
<garnt> out loud the more i'm like </garnt>
<connor> oh the founding fathers tend to normally </connor>
<joey> be sketchy </joey>
<joey> how how do we sell that the anime </joey>
<joey> youtube community is like this really </joey>
<joey> cool thing </joey>
<joey> oh the family father's a serial killer </joey>
<joey> that's a conversation starter i like to </joey>
<connor> think of it of you know </connor>
<joey> it's it's one of those things that was </joey>
<joey> going to be started anyway </joey>
<joey> eventually around that time right it </joey>
<joey> just so happened that he was the first </joey>
<joey> or </joey>
<joey> one of the first maybe that's the reason </joey>
<connor> why nobody used </connor>
<garnt> anime in the username until i came up </garnt>
<garnt> because people because i know for a fact </garnt>
<garnt> that some of my early videos </garnt>
<garnt> man those comments were just like the </garnt>
<garnt> anime man i thought that guy went to </garnt>
<joey> jail </joey>
<garnt> like they legitimately mistook me for </garnt>
<connor> mystery who would res who </connor>
<connor> who would mistake you for that yeah </connor>
<connor> better run rewind that </connor>
<joey> flash back to five minutes ago </joey>
<joey> yeah so but like you know i obviously </joey>
<joey> didn't know </joey>
<joey> about that news until after i started uh </joey>
<joey> my youtube channel because i think </joey>
<joey> what year was it that he got arrested um </joey>
<joey> i mean it was eight years ago </joey>
<joey> i think that's the only reason i </joey>
<joey> remember this is because the youtube </joey>
<garnt> video has been recommended is eight </garnt>
<joey> years ago so what's like 2012 </joey>
<garnt> right probably yeah something like 2011 </garnt>
<joey> 2012 it was probably just a really bad </joey>
<joey> time there because i started 2013 right </joey>
<joey> literally right after it happened yeah i </joey>
<joey> didn't know about it until i </joey>
<joey> started it and i had like a decent </joey>
<joey> following and i was like oh [ __ ] i can't </joey>
<joey> go back now </joey>
<joey> like i can't change my name now i should </joey>
<connor> have i should have changed so what was </connor>
<connor> like the early years of anime youtube </connor>
<connor> like then </connor>
<connor> like and like so you that was over like </connor>
<connor> what well how long you've been new </connor>
<garnt> youtube before 12 years did you say </garnt>
<garnt> um since 2007. okay so how was the anime </garnt>
<joey> so how was the another spear from 2007 </joey>
<garnt> to 2012. </garnt>
<garnt> it was like slow right it was very slow </garnt>
<garnt> so before 2012 which is which is i kind </garnt>
<connor> of like where </connor>
<joey> i think you came along um it was </joey>
<connor> the quality was not good obviously um </connor>
<joey> as as it is but it was it was it was fun </joey>
<joey> i don't know </joey>
<garnt> i i kind of in in a way i'm going to </garnt>
<garnt> sound so boomer saying this but i kind </garnt>
<garnt> of miss </garnt>
<garnt> old youtube where kind of anything went </garnt>
<connor> always look </connor>
<garnt> back fondly at the time when it was </garnt>
<garnt> smaller yeah more manageable because it </garnt>
<connor> was more intimate </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah and you always look back at </connor>
<connor> that period especially on youtube right </connor>
<connor> so i'm sure you all </connor>
<connor> missed the time and you made like one </connor>
<garnt> thousand you could just talk to random </garnt>
<garnt> people </garnt>
<garnt> no no you're like wow you're so cool </garnt>
<joey> yeah you know i remember i made a video </joey>
<joey> when i hit a thousand subscribers and i </joey>
<garnt> thought i'd made it i thought </garnt>
<joey> i thought mom i'm dropping everything </joey>
<joey> dude i i swear like i've always said </joey>
<joey> this to people but </joey>
<joey> the joy of hitting a thousand </joey>
<connor> subscribers is </connor>
<connor> almost comparable to hitting like a </connor>
<connor> hundred thousand or a million </connor>
<joey> subscribers yeah yeah yeah because a </joey>
<joey> thousand is just like whoa because a </joey>
<connor> thousand is like </connor>
<joey> monumental it is because it's a number </joey>
<connor> that is </connor>
<connor> very easily like quantifiable yeah but </connor>
<connor> it's also </connor>
<connor> huge because like thinking like wow </connor>
<connor> there's a thousand people who like me </connor>
<connor> yeah because once it gets to like a </connor>
<connor> million </connor>
<connor> it's it's it starts to become something </connor>
<connor> that you just can't really comprehend </connor>
<joey> yeah like physically </joey>
<joey> whereas a thousand is like holy [ __ ] i'm </joey>
<garnt> popular i'm [ __ ] popular and that </garnt>
<garnt> back then it was just </garnt>
<garnt> it was you know as it grew into it was </garnt>
<joey> all about doing anime reviews and </joey>
<joey> a lot of people had different styles if </joey>
<joey> you came in with an editing software you </joey>
<joey> you were just </joey>
<joey> you were just you were the goat </joey>
<joey> otaku and tristan glass reflection </joey>
<joey> reflection came along and they used </joey>
<joey> sony vegas to edit that video and it </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> blew my it blew my mind they used a paid </joey>
<garnt> price </garnt>
<garnt> yeah just some of the stuff they could </garnt>
<garnt> get away with that i couldn't </garnt>
<joey> using like putting images on windows </joey>
<garnt> movie maker what the [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> it was basically a glorified powerpoint </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> but i think my favorite anime review </garnt>
<garnt> from back then was this guy called uh </garnt>
<joey> grumpy g-sun </joey>
<joey> i [ __ ] love him i do not know this </joey>
<garnt> he's so </garnt>
<garnt> good yeah yeah he he's an og and he </garnt>
<garnt> doesn't make videos anymore but </garnt>
<garnt> what he do is that he'd he'd do anime </garnt>
<garnt> reviews but </garnt>
<garnt> he'd do it in like the middle of some a </garnt>
<garnt> desert in arizona somewhere </garnt>
<joey> right he would review an anime while </joey>
<joey> like hiking through the dish yeah yeah </joey>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<garnt> so so what so he was like he was he was </garnt>
<connor> basically pre </connor>
<connor> casey neistat because what he'd do he'd </connor>
<connor> always start off </connor>
<connor> his videos with like uh with like uh </connor>
<joey> uh with him walking towards the camera </joey>
<joey> in like the middle of the desert so what </joey>
<joey> he would have to do </joey>
<joey> is that he would have to set up his </joey>
<joey> camera </joey>
<joey> hike like hike away off screen and then </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> hike back into view of the camera it </joey>
<joey> wasn't it wasn't like he was hiking a </joey>
<joey> short distance he would be literally </joey>
<garnt> like hiking over hills and mountains </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes to get to the camera </garnt>
<connor> and yeah he how long was his intro like </connor>
<connor> just two minutes </connor>
<garnt> because it was just like super sped up </garnt>
<garnt> and you just see him walking towards the </garnt>
<joey> camera so you it would be like </joey>
<joey> it'd be like it would be like a squirrel </joey>
<joey> just like scurrying like towards the </joey>
<garnt> camera </garnt>
<garnt> and he's like today we're going to talk </garnt>
<joey> about berserk </joey>
<garnt> this sounds amazing as well how a lot of </garnt>
<joey> his reviews he he always had like a </joey>
<connor> place to go right so he would start </connor>
<connor> with at the front of the trail being </connor>
<connor> like today we're going to talk about you </connor>
<connor> know hunter hunter </connor>
<connor> and then as he's walking he would talk </connor>
<connor> about the show and then usually </connor>
<connor> the one i saw i forgot which anime it </connor>
<connor> was but he was hiking up this mountain </connor>
<connor> yeah and </connor>
<connor> i don't he must have like perfectly </connor>
<connor> timed this [ __ ] like he must have done </connor>
<connor> the hike beforehand because </connor>
<connor> the moment he got to the top was when he </connor>
<joey> finished his conclusion on the show </joey>
<joey> yeah and he was just like i've made it </joey>
<joey> to the top guys and that's the end of my </joey>
<joey> review yeah </joey>
<joey> i'm like that's [ __ ] like all right </joey>
<garnt> like thinking back because </garnt>
<garnt> thinking back it was it was very </garnt>
<garnt> different from what everyone was doing </garnt>
<garnt> we were just like </garnt>
<joey> huh old man reviewing anime that's </joey>
<joey> pretty weird but thinking back he was </joey>
<joey> a lot of his ideas were really cool you </joey>
<joey> know he's kind of ahead of his time </joey>
<joey> he was definitely ahead of his time yeah </joey>
<connor> and that's that's why he stands out to </connor>
<connor> me apart from the guy who [ __ ] killed </connor>
<connor> himself i guess </connor>
<connor> no no no not killed himself killed </connor>
<connor> someone else um </connor>
<garnt> but yeah it's it was kind of like the </garnt>
<garnt> wild west back then </garnt>
<joey> i mean all of you i mean it wasn't the </joey>
<connor> internet the wild yeah what's the so if </connor>
<connor> that's the first era right where you're </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<garnt> you know 2007 2012 what came after that </garnt>
<connor> what's like the era </connor>
<garnt> um what years are we talking between </garnt>
<garnt> cause i'm interested </garnt>
<connor> i didn't start till 2015. so all of it </connor>
<garnt> before that is like </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i'd say around about i can't </garnt>
<garnt> remember exactly when it was founded but </garnt>
<connor> that was that was kind of like the wild </connor>
<connor> west of youtube where </connor>
<joey> everyone was kind of doing their own </joey>
<connor> things it was it was a mess of different </connor>
<joey> things </joey>
<joey> and then 2012 was kind of what like </joey>
<connor> where the annie tube community really </connor>
<connor> started to form into this one </connor>
<connor> one conglomerate and i think the big the </connor>
<garnt> big </garnt>
<garnt> event that happened was probably potaku </garnt>
<garnt> potaku was huge </garnt>
<connor> yeah that's the first time i recognized </connor>
<connor> anyone outside of you </connor>
<garnt> yeah and i was like oh there's other </garnt>
<garnt> people yeah and i remember because i was </garnt>
<garnt> always i was already uh so we had four </garnt>
<garnt> original members there was </garnt>
<garnt> holden reviews um jean who were who was </garnt>
<garnt> originally called x disturbed jeans </garnt>
<garnt> and uh tristan the glass reflection and </garnt>
<connor> i remember what started it was </connor>
<connor> tristan one day messaged me out </connor>
<connor> messaging me out the blue with the </connor>
<connor> youtube dm's being like hey do you want </connor>
<connor> to talk about </connor>
<connor> this new anime season and this was </connor>
<connor> before </connor>
<connor> this was before i'd even started </connor>
<connor> watching seasonal anime this was this </connor>
<connor> before </connor>
<connor> this was before the concept of hey you </connor>
<garnt> can watch anime weekly and be hyped for </garnt>
<connor> seasonal anime you know </connor>
<connor> yes i'm pretty sure you made a joke in </connor>
<connor> one of your videos where it's like why </connor>
<connor> would i want to come </connor>
<connor> over the space of 12 weeks when i could </connor>
<connor> just come in one big go </connor>
<connor> that was a joke you made and i </connor>
<connor> remembered that sorry i completely </connor>
<joey> forgot about that </joey>
<joey> that's an amazing joke for some reason </joey>
<joey> that stuck with me and i was like that's </joey>
<joey> a </joey>
<garnt> that's a great example i would i would </garnt>
<joey> like to come in one go </joey>
<garnt> no no i'm thinking about my thought </garnt>
<garnt> process and </garnt>
<joey> my like what the thought process is why </joey>
<joey> would i want a 12th of an orgasm when i </joey>
<joey> could just have one </joey>
<joey> orgasm in one session yeah right that's </joey>
<joey> such a good joke </joey>
<garnt> yeah and so we so we've </garnt>
<garnt> we've made this podcast which wasn't </garnt>
<garnt> even a podcast </garnt>
<garnt> um it was it was kind of just a recorded </garnt>
<garnt> skype call </garnt>
<garnt> and we didn't know where to put it so i </garnt>
<garnt> made the suggestion to put it on youtube </garnt>
<connor> because this was </connor>
<connor> this was before like it was an audio </connor>
<connor> podcast it wasn't a visual podcast like </connor>
<connor> this so nobody </connor>
<connor> thought that putting audio podcasts on </connor>
<connor> youtube would work and i just i was just </connor>
<connor> like well we're youtubers so why not </connor>
<connor> why why not put it on youtube right and </connor>
<connor> yeah it was </connor>
<garnt> i i don't like saying it like this </garnt>
<garnt> because it kind of sounds like it's like </garnt>
<garnt> sucky mundic or whatever but </garnt>
<garnt> but i would say like potaku was a big </garnt>
<garnt> factor in you know shaping the anime the </garnt>
<garnt> anime youtube community </garnt>
<connor> of that time no absolutely i think it </connor>
<garnt> left as somebody who </garnt>
<garnt> you know wasn't even interested in being </garnt>
<garnt> an anime youtuber i definitely shaped i </garnt>
<garnt> think how i </garnt>
<garnt> felt about it because at the time i was </garnt>
<garnt> listening to pottaku like every week </garnt>
<garnt> like i never even i never wanted to be a </garnt>
<connor> youtuber never </connor>
<connor> crossed my mind but definitely when i </connor>
<connor> got into it i think a lot of the </connor>
<connor> influences came from </connor>
<connor> listening to that so i think you may not </connor>
<connor> have shaped the generation you were in </connor>
<connor> but you definitely helped shape the one </connor>
<connor> that came after i mean there's </connor>
<joey> definitely </joey>
<connor> you know a reason why even to this day </connor>
<joey> people who are around in the anime </joey>
<garnt> yeah people back then still are like </garnt>
<garnt> yeah remember pod taco like </garnt>
<joey> like even people who didn't watch pod </joey>
<joey> taku knew pod taco yeah i mean it was a </joey>
<garnt> it's </garnt>
<garnt> it's still a big point in my life otaku </garnt>
<garnt> really really was it </garnt>
<garnt> i i think back to portage very fondly </garnt>
<connor> even though it's like ended now and i've </connor>
<connor> moved on </connor>
<connor> in my life it had he had a big part of </connor>
<connor> shaping me as a person and </connor>
<connor> it's especially because portugal was the </connor>
<connor> first ever friends i made </connor>
<connor> that i could talk to anime with yeah you </connor>
<connor> know i mean that that goes all the way </connor>
<connor> back to the </connor>
<connor> conversation we had at the start but </connor>
<connor> holden and jean were literally </connor>
<connor> the first people i was able to bond over </connor>
<connor> anime with </connor>
<connor> and potaku was kind of like my weekly </connor>
<connor> bi-weekly </connor>
<connor> kind of session where i could just nerd </connor>
<joey> over and i would just </joey>
<joey> with your buddies yeah exactly yeah and </joey>
<connor> apparently a lot of people </connor>
<connor> looked up to us back then because a lot </connor>
<joey> of people apparently didn't </joey>
<joey> also have friends to talk to anime </joey>
<joey> without listening and </joey>
<joey> um and so that really i feel like that </joey>
<joey> cemented the next era of anime youtube </joey>
<joey> before i think i think you came along </joey>
<connor> and i think that was </connor>
<connor> that was kind of the era of youtube </connor>
<connor> where it was i think it was a last era </connor>
<connor> where people could just </connor>
<connor> make content without a monetary </connor>
<connor> incentive in mind </connor>
<connor> right right right because everyone ever </connor>
<connor> we did we did poor taku not because we </connor>
<connor> were getting paid we weren't getting </connor>
<connor> paid for it at all </connor>
<connor> for a lot of it um we we basically made </connor>
<connor> it because we just wanted two </connor>
<connor> projects it was a passion it's it was it </connor>
<connor> was kind of like this </connor>
<connor> but back then this was before we had any </connor>
<connor> kind of monetization yeah </connor>
<connor> we we were just we were just four mates </connor>
<connor> who would just go go on a skype call </connor>
<garnt> um and record the audio and just splice </garnt>
<garnt> it together and upload it on youtube and </garnt>
<joey> then i came in when the fat chicks </joey>
<joey> started rolling </joey>
<joey> no but like i i don't think it's too </joey>
<connor> much to say that </connor>
<connor> you know this podcast included there's a </connor>
<garnt> lot of anime podcasts now right yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah exactly </garnt>
<connor> big and small and i don't think it'd be </connor>
<connor> too far to say that </connor>
<joey> you know pod taco is probably the one </joey>
<joey> who </joey>
<joey> probably got the train rolling in that </joey>
<garnt> side of attitude it it kind of amazes me </garnt>
<garnt> because like before </garnt>
<garnt> this before this came along before trash </garnt>
<garnt> chase came along </garnt>
<garnt> um you look back to some of the views </garnt>
<garnt> and you know </garnt>
<connor> popularity of potaku and it still </connor>
<connor> basically holds up </connor>
<connor> almost to a lot of the bigger podcasts </connor>
<connor> that </connor>
<connor> came after it i mean there's only a few </connor>
<connor> podcasts that i can think of </connor>
<connor> that came after potaku that animated </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> anime related that were able to you know </connor>
<connor> do better in it with it in terms of </connor>
<connor> views and </connor>
<connor> views and stuff and potaka is like six </connor>
<connor> years old now so that that </connor>
<connor> kind of that kind of blows my mind you </connor>
<connor> want to hear a glass from the past sure </connor>
<connor> warning the following audio may contain </connor>
<connor> course language </connor>
<connor> and other material that may not be </connor>
<connor> suitable for a younger audience </connor>
<joey> viewer discretion is advised that is </joey>
<joey> screaming </joey>
<joey> dude there's like maybe a couple of </joey>
<joey> hundred people watching this right now </joey>
<garnt> who just cream their </garnt>
<garnt> nostalgia that that intro is like </garnt>
<joey> ingrained in my minds man </joey>
<joey> that your accent warning is </joey>
<connor> so you have been warned if you go to my </connor>
<connor> channel the very very first video </connor>
<garnt> is like a podcast that looks very </garnt>
<garnt> reminiscent of the editing style of </garnt>
<garnt> another podcast oh really oh really </garnt>
<garnt> it looks very very similar with the the </garnt>
<garnt> cubes flashing up between </garnt>
<garnt> oh yeah yeah oh yeah um because yeah who </garnt>
<garnt> did you edit all of them </garnt>
<garnt> um no so originally it was basically </garnt>
<garnt> between me and tristan </garnt>
<garnt> and holden who had to edit most of the </garnt>
<connor> podcast and so we we basically edited </connor>
<connor> the audio so they would sync up and </connor>
<connor> we would remove a lot of like when you </connor>
<connor> have calls on skype </connor>
<connor> people talking over each other yeah </connor>
<connor> people talking over each other and you </connor>
<connor> have this </connor>
<connor> really awkward pause where it's where </connor>
<connor> it's you cut it all up smoothly yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> exactly and then we were like we wanted </connor>
<connor> to make it a bit more visual </connor>
<connor> so but we couldn't we we couldn't just </connor>
<connor> film ourselves next to each other </connor>
<connor> so we kind of just decided to go with </connor>
<connor> flashing boxes yeah it works really well </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah and that was that was our way </connor>
<garnt> of just evolving the podcast </garnt>
<garnt> and um i remember after poor taku we </garnt>
<garnt> kind of added </garnt>
<connor> a few more people as well right i want </connor>
<connor> to ask about that because i was when as </connor>
<connor> a viewer i was so confused there was </connor>
<joey> just people </joey>
<connor> like towards the end would just start </connor>
<joey> joining in </joey>
<connor> and then i was like jay taku and i'm </connor>
<joey> like what is what is going on with all </joey>
<joey> of this </joey>
<joey> was jimmy on the podcast yeah jimmy </joey>
<garnt> right nice </garnt>
<garnt> it was so odd because it just seemed </garnt>
<garnt> like people were just recycling in and i </garnt>
<connor> was like wait </connor>
<connor> this is not what i want i wanted the </connor>
<connor> boys </connor>
<connor> i'm on the big fallback you know like as </connor>
<connor> a viewer i was so confused i don't think </connor>
<garnt> you guys like ever explain any of that </garnt>
<connor> right yeah so i mean </connor>
<garnt> i'd be interested in knowing well for me </garnt>
<garnt> it was because the scheduling just got </garnt>
<garnt> super hard </garnt>
<garnt> because like i said we weren't getting </garnt>
<garnt> paid for anything so this was this was </garnt>
<garnt> just us </garnt>
<garnt> making time making making time and we </garnt>
<garnt> got to a point with potaku where we were </garnt>
<garnt> having a [ __ ] hard time keeping up </garnt>
<garnt> with this two-week schedule </garnt>
<garnt> so i i wanted to and it had been a while </garnt>
<connor> since potako started so i wanted to </connor>
<connor> spice things up </connor>
<connor> um and i wanted to see if there was like </connor>
<connor> we could get some chemistry with other </connor>
<connor> people </connor>
<connor> and that's when i brought on the idea of </connor>
<connor> jaitaku </connor>
<connor> and adding more people and making making </connor>
<connor> a distinct brand of potaku is where we </connor>
<connor> just talk about </connor>
<connor> pure whatever we want to talk about it's </connor>
<connor> kind of like a free-flowing podcast and </connor>
<connor> jaitaku </connor>
<connor> is we're going to pick a specific topic </connor>
<connor> and we're going to stay on top right </connor>
<connor> right </connor>
<connor> and that was that was the kind of idea </connor>
<connor> of jaetaku it was it kind of hit </connor>
<connor> everything because it added some new </connor>
<garnt> elements to the podcast </garnt>
<garnt> and it also made it so less of a load </garnt>
<garnt> was on the original four as well </garnt>
<garnt> um but yeah it's it's interesting to </garnt>
<garnt> hear what you guys thought about it as a </garnt>
<connor> viewer perspective i think </connor>
<connor> because i didn't watch every single one </connor>
<connor> and then </connor>
<connor> i think i just saw like three j takus </connor>
<connor> and i was so confused </connor>
<connor> then i watch it i'm like who are half of </connor>
<garnt> these people yeah like </garnt>
<garnt> yeah it's so strange and i think i think </garnt>
<garnt> what um it was </garnt>
<garnt> it really worked at first because jay </garnt>
<garnt> jay taku did his job </garnt>
<garnt> and then it got to the point when </garnt>
<garnt> jaetaku kind of even maybe </garnt>
<connor> became the flagship series because if </connor>
<connor> you look on if you look on the potaku </connor>
<connor> channel </connor>
<connor> a lot of the most viewed videos ended up </connor>
<connor> being jaitaku </connor>
<connor> originally videos like our most viewed </connor>
<connor> video </connor>
<connor> was one where we literally just talk </connor>
<connor> about hentai nice </connor>
<connor> of course know but that that was that </connor>
<connor> was back when </connor>
<connor> talking about him hentais are like very </connor>
<connor> hush-hush </connor>
<connor> nobody likes nobody publicly liked </connor>
<connor> hentai on twitter </connor>
<connor> or any any [ __ ] like that allowed me to </connor>
<joey> introduce myself </joey>
<joey> hi but um yeah so jaitaku kind of became </joey>
<connor> one of the flagship series um because it </connor>
<connor> just got more views and </connor>
<connor> the main like the main the original four </connor>
<connor> people it just became harder and harder </connor>
<connor> for us to schedule </connor>
<connor> um schedule schedule with the original </connor>
<connor> pataku </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah podcast um and i think that's </connor>
<connor> kind of </connor>
<connor> that's that's kind of what brought like </connor>
<connor> helped </connor>
<connor> bring portugal to an end because i i </connor>
<connor> feel like </connor>
<connor> i feel like that era of anitube is </connor>
<connor> defined by the start of potaku and the </connor>
<connor> end of pataku because i think the other </connor>
<connor> thing </connor>
<connor> the end of potaku really it </connor>
<connor> coincidentally coincided with a lot of </connor>
<connor> the times when </connor>
<connor> you know joey really rose and people </connor>
<connor> realized they could do anime content for </connor>
<connor> money as well yeah </connor>
<connor> which just wasn't an idea before then </connor>
<connor> and </connor>
<connor> i remember i mean should i talk about </connor>
<garnt> the end of photography </garnt>
<joey> go ahead if you want man we could edit </joey>
<garnt> it are we about to do this now </garnt>
<connor> am i gonna am i really gonna bring this </connor>
<connor> up but it's up to you bro </connor>
<connor> okay so i guess i've never i've never </connor>
<connor> talked about this but we've </connor>
<connor> we've obviously gotten a lot of comments </connor>
<connor> about potako on this podcast </connor>
<connor> on this podcast and uh it was we i don't </connor>
<connor> think anyone's really publicly talked </connor>
<connor> about it </connor>
<connor> and to preface this still love still </connor>
<connor> love everyone on the podcast i'm not </connor>
<connor> about to talk </connor>
<connor> mad [ __ ] or anything like that and the </connor>
<connor> long in the story the long and the short </connor>
<connor> of it </connor>
<connor> is that we came into some creative </connor>
<connor> differences </connor>
<connor> about which way the podcast could go </connor>
<connor> because </connor>
<connor> to me potaku was the defining podcast of </connor>
<connor> the anitu community as </connor>
<connor> as i have just said and i really wanted </connor>
<connor> to push that further i want i wanted to </connor>
<connor> i wanted it to i wanted portugal to like </connor>
<connor> evolve more yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> because i saw the potential in how </connor>
<connor> big the podcast could be because um the </connor>
<connor> problem was that </connor>
<connor> we had trouble keeping up with our </connor>
<connor> schedule and then we took like a </connor>
<connor> seven month break or something like that </connor>
<connor> it was very long i think it was it was a </connor>
<connor> very long </connor>
<connor> long day yeah yeah yeah and the reason </connor>
<connor> for that was </connor>
<connor> basically the podcast didn't really have </connor>
<connor> a like a designated leader right leading </connor>
<connor> in right now so </connor>
<connor> i've been like at the beginning of the </connor>
<connor> podcast it was mainly </connor>
<connor> me and tristan who were getting things </connor>
<connor> like getting getting things done </connor>
<connor> chasing up yeah i mean jean loved gene </connor>
<connor> she was she was like the mother of the </connor>
<connor> group but she was like she would like </connor>
<connor> come in and out </connor>
<connor> because she was very busy with her real </connor>
<connor> life holden [ __ ] talented as </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] talented guy but it was you know </connor>
<connor> i i know i've told this told him before </connor>
<connor> you know it's it's </connor>
<connor> unless you unless you tell if you tell </connor>
<connor> holden to do something </connor>
<connor> he'll [ __ ] do it if you don't he </connor>
<connor> won't do it if you don't he's not the </connor>
<connor> type of </connor>
<connor> he wasn't the type of person that would </connor>
<connor> like push people to do it you know </connor>
<connor> and you know i think he's changed now </connor>
<connor> for the better and i think potaka was </connor>
<connor> definitely a big learning experience for </connor>
<connor> him as well so i think </connor>
<connor> he's definitely grown as a person but </connor>
<connor> back then it was mainly </connor>
<connor> it was mainly me and tristan who was </connor>
<connor> pushing stuff to get done on the podcast </connor>
<connor> and </connor>
<connor> tristan started to get less and less </connor>
<connor> involved because </connor>
<connor> he started to transition doing </connor>
<connor> anime reviews as a hobby to actually </connor>
<connor> finally getting paid for it because he </connor>
<connor> had opened his patreon he was the only </connor>
<garnt> one that was actively doing vid </garnt>
<joey> videos companies that was at the time </joey>
<connor> when tristan was like really at his peak </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah he was like really growing at </garnt>
<joey> that time exactly i remember his patreon </joey>
<connor> was a big deal yeah yeah yeah exactly </connor>
<joey> because </joey>
<joey> he was the only one who was who had </joey>
<connor> other commitments for his own youtube </connor>
<connor> channel </connor>
<connor> so he just had less time than all of us </connor>
<joey> and then </joey>
<joey> for me that was also the time when i got </joey>
<joey> my job at the bbc </joey>
<joey> right right so you saw you see all these </joey>
<joey> factors coming into play where </joey>
<joey> the driving force of the podcasts just </joey>
<joey> had </joey>
<joey> less time to really make episodes and </joey>
<joey> people in jaitarki we were all good </joey>
<joey> friends </joey>
<joey> but they were you know they weren't the </joey>
<joey> original four they </joey>
<joey> were they weren't the og4 they didn't </joey>
<garnt> really have the i'd say authority to </garnt>
<garnt> really take over </garnt>
<connor> yeah you can't really step in and be </connor>
<garnt> like this is mine yeah yeah yeah exactly </garnt>
<garnt> so we basically took a seven seven month </garnt>
<connor> hiatus or it's it's it's a hiatus but it </connor>
<connor> was more of not nothing was getting done </connor>
<connor> yeah i i won't said anything nothing was </connor>
<connor> really happening </connor>
<connor> they left you on red </connor>
<garnt> and it was basically because we just </garnt>
<garnt> didn't have the time </garnt>
<garnt> and what what was the driving force for </garnt>
<garnt> it to be revamped was i that was the </garnt>
<garnt> point when i </garnt>
<garnt> wanted to return to youtube i was </garnt>
<garnt> getting bored of my job </garnt>
<garnt> and i was like okay first step i want to </garnt>
<connor> put all my hard work into potaku and </connor>
<connor> really revamping this because </connor>
<connor> tristan's doing really well with </connor>
<connor> whatever he's doing </connor>
<connor> with this patreon and i saw potential </connor>
<connor> for not only </connor>
<connor> me coming back but also pushing poor </connor>
<connor> taku into something even bigger and </connor>
<connor> better than what it was yeah </connor>
<connor> with help formerly you know trying to </connor>
<connor> monetize it and they just </connor>
<connor> basically making it have an incentive </connor>
<connor> for everyone to turn up every week </connor>
<connor> exactly right </connor>
<connor> exactly and so it ended up being i was </connor>
<connor> the </connor>
<connor> big driving force to getting potaki back </connor>
<connor> on his feet and that's why i got </connor>
<connor> super super invested in it because i was </connor>
<connor> the one who was </connor>
<connor> getting trying to get episodes done i </connor>
<connor> was editing a lot of them </connor>
<connor> not because i wanted to be paid or </connor>
<connor> anything but i just wanted </connor>
<connor> this to you what you wanted your passion </connor>
<connor> to be i wanted i wanted my passion to be </connor>
<joey> back on the ground yeah </joey>
<joey> and as as soon as </joey>
<joey> i felt it was kind of getting back off </joey>
<joey> the ground </joey>
<joey> i remember tristan coming coming to me </joey>
<connor> and he was like i </connor>
<connor> i want it to end you know what i mean </connor>
<connor> right yeah and </connor>
<connor> um i looking back now i totally </connor>
<connor> understand </connor>
<connor> why he did right because this this is </connor>
<connor> where this is where i </connor>
<connor> i put it back to creative differences </connor>
<connor> because </connor>
<connor> he saw that we weren't getting as many </connor>
<connor> views as we used to before the hiatus </connor>
<connor> right and also the dynamic of the group </connor>
<connor> was </connor>
<connor> very different than when than when we </connor>
<connor> started </connor>
<connor> you know some people weren't getting </connor>
<connor> along as well as </connor>
<connor> as as uh as they were </connor>
<connor> they were at the beginning so he wanted </connor>
<connor> potaku to just end there you know yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> he he wanted to be like okay instead of </connor>
<connor> just fizzling fizzling out </connor>
<connor> um i wanted to end here and i really </connor>
<connor> really tried to convince him to be like </connor>
<connor> look i know we're going through some </connor>
<connor> very big issues now </connor>
<connor> but i see potential in this yeah there </connor>
<connor> was there was a lot of there was a lot </connor>
<connor> of factors </connor>
<connor> that i saw that could potentially have </connor>
<connor> driven </connor>
<connor> a lot of hype back into botaku um before </connor>
<connor> we ended that we had um </connor>
<connor> jean had just left yeah right but she </connor>
<connor> was she was going to come back we had </connor>
<connor> scheduled that </connor>
<connor> we had also scheduled mintaku too which </connor>
<connor> is the hentai episode which was like our </connor>
<garnt> most </garnt>
<connor> popular one right so i was like look </connor>
<connor> it's we can do it we can do the combo </connor>
<connor> plea i like i i i really really tried to </connor>
<connor> convince him that it was too early to </connor>
<connor> end yeah because i </connor>
<connor> i totally agree with all the problems </connor>
<connor> that the podcast had </connor>
<garnt> if in order to survive and to go further </garnt>
<garnt> we would have had to </garnt>
<garnt> make a lot of big changes and they could </garnt>
<garnt> have very easily blown up in our face i </garnt>
<connor> guess it's one of those things where </connor>
<connor> it's like </connor>
<connor> you could try but you could very easily </connor>
<connor> fail so it's one of those things where </connor>
<joey> you're like do i want to put in this </joey>
<joey> work and i can get the guaranteed pages </joey>
<joey> yeah why really yeah </joey>
<joey> right like i kind of get it but at the </joey>
<joey> same time i i'm like </joey>
<joey> as a viewer i knew how like big it could </joey>
<connor> have been as well yeah looking in my </connor>
<garnt> position now and i understand how it all </garnt>
<garnt> works like </garnt>
<garnt> yeah it could have been i think it could </garnt>
<garnt> have been certainly yeah definitely it </garnt>
<garnt> would have needed a lot of work and it </garnt>
<garnt> would have take we would have taken a </garnt>
<connor> big risk and we could have failed </connor>
<connor> massively but for me as a person i would </connor>
<connor> rather </connor>
<connor> give that a go right right right one </connor>
<connor> yeah then wonder </connor>
<connor> and it got to the point when it was just </connor>
<connor> it was just like it was just this one </connor>
<connor> clash </connor>
<connor> right of just i wanted i i thought it </connor>
<connor> was too early to end it </connor>
<connor> and tristan wanted to wanted to end it </connor>
<connor> yeah and it was it was unfortunate </connor>
<joey> that you know you know i i i say </joey>
<joey> unfortunately i didn't i didn't get my </joey>
<joey> way </joey>
<joey> he didn't listen to me i tried i tried </joey>
<garnt> so hard there was a video that you guys </garnt>
<joey> all made when it ended right and i </joey>
<connor> remember watching this and it was like </connor>
<connor> one of those moments you're like please </connor>
<joey> say psych </joey>
<connor> please say sorry jk lol but i remember </connor>
<joey> watching that video and it like </joey>
<connor> because i remember the order was like </connor>
<connor> you first and it was like tristan was </connor>
<connor> last </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah and i i tristan i love tristan </connor>
<connor> by the way just saying </connor>
<connor> but i remember watching and i was </connor>
<connor> thinking like man it kind of seems like </connor>
<connor> everyone was like really wanting to keep </connor>
<connor> doing this but then </connor>
<garnt> tristan didn't almost as a viewer it </garnt>
<garnt> wasn't like that it was </garnt>
<garnt> at the end as a viewer i think that's </garnt>
<connor> the impression yeah like it could be </connor>
<garnt> totally wrong just an impression i mean </garnt>
<garnt> there was definitely a faction that </garnt>
<connor> supported </connor>
<garnt> my stance right there was the faction </garnt>
<connor> that supported tristan's stance i mean </connor>
<connor> look like as someone who creates now i </connor>
<connor> can understand both yeah </connor>
<joey> i don't care about either i mean it's </joey>
<connor> definitely a tough decision right now oh </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah anybody in that position would have </connor>
<joey> been like ah [ __ ] do i take the risk or </joey>
<connor> not at the end of the day if his heart's </connor>
<joey> not in it his heart's not in it right </joey>
<joey> yeah exactly </joey>
<joey> if you're going to like drag someone </joey>
<joey> along he doesn't want to do it yeah you </joey>
<joey> can't like </joey>
<joey> so was there no option to just do it </joey>
<garnt> without tristan </garnt>
<garnt> i mean we we we wanted to respect </garnt>
<connor> tristan's wishes because we there was </connor>
<connor> there was the conversation of like </connor>
<joey> um should we do this without tristan you </joey>
<joey> know but </joey>
<joey> it just it just felt wrong yeah just </joey>
<joey> understandable </joey>
<joey> because i i wanted to leave the option i </joey>
<joey> asked tristan would it be okay </joey>
<connor> if we continued and then you know </connor>
<connor> at any point if forever for whatever </connor>
<connor> whatever reason you want to return the </connor>
<connor> doors are </connor>
<connor> always open yeah and tristan was like </connor>
<connor> elements no i don't </connor>
<joey> and i understand because this was his </joey>
<joey> baby </joey>
<joey> no i don't feel comfortable letting my </joey>
<connor> baby go and just seeing what happens </connor>
<connor> yeah so that's that's that's kind of </connor>
<connor> that </connor>
<connor> that was kind of like the the last draw </connor>
<connor> you know </connor>
<connor> there was no there was no going back </connor>
<connor> from that and yeah that's </connor>
<connor> basically how it ended and it was after </connor>
<connor> that </connor>
<connor> that um i i kind of lost a lot of </connor>
<connor> motivation because i put </connor>
<connor> so much of myself into getting this </connor>
<connor> revamped </connor>
<joey> and it just felt like it was just all </joey>
<joey> taken away and it was out of my control </joey>
<joey> and it i learned a lot from potaku with </joey>
<joey> like learning working on group projects </joey>
<joey> and everything like that </joey>
<joey> and i should probably and i want to say </joey>
<joey> i'm not throwing shade at tristan at all </joey>
<joey> we still get along great </joey>
<joey> yeah we all get electricity yeah yeah i </joey>
<connor> i i love tristan </connor>
<joey> it was just it was just a point where we </joey>
<connor> just had creative differences </connor>
<connor> and it happens i feel that's a very </connor>
<garnt> normal thing </garnt>
<connor> people i've what i'm trying to say is </connor>
<connor> i've really got to demonize and like </connor>
<garnt> don't </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah yeah i'm i'm not demonizing </garnt>
<connor> tristan i </connor>
<connor> like we just had a different way of </connor>
<connor> approaching things i </connor>
<connor> you know i still think back to portugal </connor>
<connor> and i still think hey </connor>
<connor> i think it ended too early and he </connor>
<connor> obviously thinks the other way and he </connor>
<connor> thought the other way back then and </connor>
<joey> that's </joey>
<garnt> basically what it was how it is man yeah </garnt>
<connor> that's just how it is yes </connor>
<joey> obviously we don't want anyone going and </joey>
<joey> being like what the [ __ ] man why don't </joey>
<joey> you why don't you not believe in it man </joey>
<joey> i mean like </joey>
<joey> like like i said earlier like if your </joey>
<connor> heart's on it your heart's not in it </connor>
<joey> right yeah it's not gonna happen i mean </joey>
<joey> can anyone like really blame tristan </joey>
<joey> like again it's it's a [ __ ] like i </joey>
<joey> would have </joey>
<connor> really if it's liberating as well right </connor>
<connor> if i didn't believe in it i'm normally </connor>
<connor> someone who's like adamant about [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> right so i would be like no </connor>
<joey> no yeah i don't believe in this yeah </joey>
<connor> like i would be like that yeah </connor>
<joey> exactly so it's you know it's just how </joey>
<garnt> it is right yeah yeah yeah and i mean </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i mean i always look back to think </garnt>
<connor> you know what </connor>
<connor> what could what could it be what could </connor>
<connor> be but that was that was just the end of </connor>
<connor> an era </connor>
<connor> and now we're in a new era and i'm you </connor>
<connor> know everyone's gone down the different </connor>
<connor> paths i </connor>
<connor> i'm really amazed to see what people are </connor>
<connor> getting onto nowadays and it's it's </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] great and i'm still </joey>
<joey> you know i still speak to all the cast </joey>
<garnt> members every now and again especially </garnt>
<garnt> when we get to meet at conventions </garnt>
<joey> hey bottom line is that at least there </joey>
<joey> isn't a single member of paul tucker </joey>
<connor> that went and killed their family </connor>
<connor> well that's a taker </connor>
<connor> they didn't they didn't go down to mr </connor>
<connor> anime around all right let's just </connor>
<connor> that's the silver lining </connor>
<connor> 80s outro where it tells you what we've </connor>
<joey> all been up to </joey>
<joey> the [ __ ] snapshot it's like yeah </joey>
<joey> joey didn't kill his family jesus christ </joey>
<connor> oh my god that's a [ __ ] tape oh my </connor>
<connor> god </connor>
<connor> okay okay before we end it right like i </connor>
<connor> guess </connor>
<garnt> the way i see it right is if you were </garnt>
<garnt> still doing you know potaku trash taste </garnt>
<garnt> probably wouldn't exist </garnt>
<garnt> yeah that's that's true that's what i'm </garnt>
<garnt> saying i'm not trying to say you know </garnt>
<connor> that it's it's you know i'm i'm glad </connor>
<connor> that your passion project [ __ ] died </connor>
<garnt> but i'm glad that we have this you know </garnt>
<garnt> no i'm i'm very glad as well please </garnt>
<connor> don't kill your families </connor>
<connor> [Music] </connor>
<garnt> just just gonna throw that out there you </garnt>
<connor> know </connor>
<joey> i'm british how do i get a gun i don't </joey>
<connor> even know how to get it right how do you </connor>
<joey> do that </joey>
<connor> walmart i don't want to have to make a </connor>
<joey> twit longer that's like </joey>
<joey> so about connor oh no </joey>
<joey> my thoughts on sea dog vp </joey>
<connor> oh this is going to be real ironic if </connor>
<connor> you kill your family jerry in the wake </connor>
<joey> up </joey>
<joey> we should have seen the signs all along </joey>
<joey> it was in the name </joey>
<connor> oh my god it it kind of felt that when </connor>
<connor> potaku ended that it kind of like </connor>
<connor> it's like tearing down the berlin wall </connor>
<connor> right yeah just letting everyone [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> loose right because i feel like </connor>
<connor> when a big pillar and a community kind </connor>
<connor> of you know kind of falls right it's </connor>
<connor> just like </connor>
<joey> just a ton of people come free for all </joey>
<connor> right basically yeah like it's kind of </connor>
<connor> like everyone's looking for the new like </connor>
<joey> all right who's the person i'm gonna </joey>
<connor> listen to </connor>
<connor> yeah like we don't really have that at </connor>
<connor> the moment i don't feel </connor>
<connor> anything we have a few big people but i </connor>
<connor> feel that that's when </connor>
<connor> definitely you said the new era just was </connor>
<garnt> like all right yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> hi because back then it was all about </garnt>
<garnt> doing anime reviews </garnt>
<garnt> and then it i i would say the content </garnt>
<connor> started to </connor>
<connor> really like it kind of like opened the </connor>
<connor> doors to all different kind of content </connor>
<connor> like you're doing </connor>
<connor> more vloggy videos and analytical </connor>
<connor> channels start to come along </connor>
<connor> so i i feel you know it was it was a </connor>
<connor> coincidence that it happened during the </connor>
<connor> end of partaku but i feel like </connor>
<connor> for our community that was that was a </connor>
<connor> big turning point </connor>
<connor> oh definitely yeah absolutely because i </connor>
<connor> remember that was when demos </connor>
<connor> demo came along as well i think so </connor>
<connor> nearly enough back then when you were </connor>
<garnt> saying and he [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> changed the game as well oh no </garnt>
<joey> definitely like there is i don't think </joey>
<joey> there's a single lander tube </joey>
<connor> that's on the platform right now and no </connor>
<connor> longer on the platform who </connor>
<connor> didn't look up the demo yeah in any if </connor>
<connor> you do stuff yeah </connor>
<connor> if you did anime stuff like demo was </connor>
<connor> just a name that came back right he's </connor>
<connor> like the dad that went to go buy </connor>
<connor> cigarettes and just never came back </connor>
<connor> right </connor>
<connor> i'm glad i i came into it when i did </connor>
<connor> right i feel like i came into it at the </connor>
<connor> time where </connor>
<connor> it's perfect because it was where i </connor>
<connor> wanted to make the content i wanted to </connor>
<joey> make right yeah </joey>
<joey> i think you came at a perfect time </joey>
<joey> because it was around the time when the </joey>
<joey> whole anime youtube thing </joey>
<connor> really diversified itself in terms of </connor>
<connor> its content so </connor>
<connor> people like you who did very </connor>
<joey> unconventional anime content it was very </joey>
<connor> easy to like just slip in </connor>
<connor> yeah it's great i mean i'm glad that </connor>
<joey> it's gotten to the point where we can </joey>
<joey> you know make a set like this </joey>
<joey> right because like in my mind i didn't </joey>
<garnt> want to do a podcast unless it was </garnt>
<connor> this good yeah right like i just i've no </connor>
<garnt> interest in it like i don't want to do </garnt>
<garnt> audio yeah this everyone has an audio </garnt>
<garnt> podcast yeah like this this is what i </garnt>
<connor> kind of wanted to push potaku to the </connor>
<connor> direction of </connor>
<connor> going like me like we obviously didn't </connor>
<connor> live in the same place but my idea </connor>
<connor> was hey what if what what if we all flew </connor>
<connor> to a place </connor>
<connor> recorded recorded a ton of episodes yeah </connor>
<connor> and released it </connor>
<connor> on a schedule yeah and we could do that </connor>
<connor> on a periodic basis based on like </connor>
<connor> whatever funding we </connor>
<connor> we could have gotten yeah um but i'm </connor>
<joey> glad that </joey>
<joey> i have you guys now who yeah </joey>
<joey> it's taking me how long portuguese 4.0 </joey>
<joey> hey i'm not the one saying that all </joey>
<joey> right the [ __ ] ton of people in that </joey>
<joey> first episode were like </joey>
<joey> this is just toku 2.0 no </joey>
<garnt> i'm hosting next i'm just going to do </garnt>
<garnt> that that intro </garnt>
<connor> you have to do it you have to do it </connor>
<connor> i mean it's it's great man i mean like </connor>
<connor> you said earlier about the like ambition </connor>
<connor> of it i think us three really have like </connor>
<connor> really great ideas of ways that you want </connor>
<garnt> to make this not just a podcast right it </garnt>
<connor> sounds really crazy like the </connor>
<connor> like the akiba video was just like just </connor>
<garnt> the step in the stuff </garnt>
