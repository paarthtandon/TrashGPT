<connor> - At about like 2:00 A.M. one night, </connor>
<connor> I'm like basically naked. </connor>
<connor> I open the door and there's
just two girls sitting there, </connor>
<connor> opposite my door. </connor>
<connor> SpongeBob has been on like
full volume in my room, </connor>
<joey> it was like, what are you-- </joey>
<joey> - And you're naked. </joey>
<joey> (upbeat music) </joey>
<joey> Welcome back to another
episode of Trash Taste podcast. </joey>
<joey> I'm your host Joey and
with me are the boys, </joey>
<joey> the British boys, the BBs. </joey>
<connor> - I thought you only have like
a Neanderthal or something-- </connor>
<garnt> - Oh, okay.
- Come Joey anyway. </garnt>
<joey> - What's up residents of cuckfield. </joey>
<garnt> Welcome to another
episode of Trash Taste-- </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, I'll take it. </garnt>
<garnt> - I didn't expect that. </garnt>
<joey> - If you're actually from cuckfield, </joey>
<joey> then there you go there's your shout out. </joey>
<connor> - Today I found out that I was
on a Samsung ad by accident. </connor>
<garnt> I didn't know.
- Oh, yeah, I saw that. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh, yeah, I saw it, you sent
the clip to Sydney, right? </joey>
<garnt> - No, no, I didn't, no, I didn't. </garnt>
<garnt> I--
- I saw you re-tweeting </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm pretty sure, oh, like-- </garnt>
<garnt> - Did I say something, I
don't think I said something. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't know. </connor>
<connor> - I, I-- </connor>
<joey> - That was for your Fivver thing, right? </joey>
<connor> - So I did a Fivver video </connor>
<connor> where I became a Fivver
seller and normally, right? </connor>
<connor> Fivver you get like vastly under charge </connor>
<connor> that's kinda how basically
this website works. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - But I got contacted
by someone who was like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, let's do an actual ad." </connor>
<connor> I thought great this is
amazing content for the video </connor>
<connor> because I can actually show
people like how to do it. </connor>
<joey> - My skills. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, right, I was like, "I'm flexible." </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And I asked him a few questions </joey>
<joey> 'cause normally when you do a
commercial with voice acting, </joey>
<joey> you need to figure out
like the buyout fees. </joey>
<joey> And depending on basically
how much the ad is gonna play </joey>
<joey> and how many countries it's gonna play in, </joey>
<joey> is like how do you calculate a buyout fee. </joey>
<garnt> So this is the normal studio fee, </garnt>
<garnt> which is like the doing the work </garnt>
<garnt> and then there's the fee </garnt>
<garnt> for essentially using
your voice worldwide. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And, you know, it
varies a lot like you can, </garnt>
<connor> I know dudes who've gotten
like 50K of one hour. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I mean, you were talking about </joey>
<joey> like in a previous podcast
episode about the guy </joey>
<connor> who does the ads for McDonald's. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, he lives off just that. </connor>
<joey> And like, I did a commercial one time </joey>
<garnt> where I got like $8,000
for just one hour of work. </garnt>
<joey> - Was that the boats one? </joey>
<joey> - Which one was that? </joey>
<connor> It was a car one, I'll have to find it. </connor>
<connor> I can get the link. </connor>
<joey> - No, you said that you did like </joey>
<joey> a shaving one as well, right? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I've done shaving
one in the past as well. </connor>
<joey> - Or whatever the fuck it was. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, ages ago, ages ago.
- Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And basically, you get paid </garnt>
<connor> like quite a lot for doing these. </connor>
<connor> And it's like, okay, cool, right? </connor>
<garnt> Nice, nice and I thought, </garnt>
<garnt> okay, this commercial seems
kind of small, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> It's like this guy just-- </garnt>
<joey> - So how much did he pay you? </joey>
<garnt> - I asked 'cause I thought this
ad was like pathetic, right? </garnt>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> I asked for $300.
- Oh! </joey>
<garnt> - 'Cause I was like it's only
gonna take like 30 minutes. </garnt>
<garnt> - You were thinking of the content. </garnt>
<garnt> That was what on your mind, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - I didn't wanna be too greedy </garnt>
<garnt> and I really wanted to get it, </garnt>
<garnt> so I thought 300 is a
normal like studio rate fee. </garnt>
<garnt> Plus like whatever, it's
gonna play on the internet, </garnt>
<connor> it's not a big deal. </connor>
<connor> And then I actually
had to do like dubbing, </connor>
<connor> like actual mouth dubbing. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, so you actually had
to dub out the entire scene. </garnt>
<connor> - Yes, so I dubbed over the dudes mouth. </connor>
<joey> - I didn't actually see the ad, </joey>
<joey> I just saw you like retweeting
it or tweeting about it. </joey>
<connor> - It's weird, I don't think my voice fits </connor>
<connor> the dude that well. </connor>
<garnt> - It was so weird watching it
'cause I was watching the ad </garnt>
<garnt> and I didn't know what the process was, </garnt>
<garnt> but what it felt like was, </garnt>
<garnt> remember watching like
those old Hong Kong movies </garnt>
<joey> where it was like badly dubbed
lip flaps like over the film. </joey>
<joey> - It's like some cow shit. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly, that's what it was. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, it's not bad, I mean-- </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, he was still
saying what you were saying. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, it just I think
the problem is, is that like, </connor>
<connor> especially 'cause everyone knows my voice. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - The problem is that like,
everyone knows my voice </connor>
<connor> and that's not what you
hear when you hear my voice. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Normally if, you know, you
don't really know the person, </joey>
<garnt> you know, 90% people are gonna
hit the ad aren't gonna be </garnt>
<garnt> like, "Oh, yeah, yeah,
that's normal ad, no biggie." </garnt>
<connor> But people know me are
like, "What the fuck! </connor>
<garnt> Like what the fuck!" </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause it was so weird we're
hearing your voice come out </garnt>
<garnt> of like a really old man
or something like that. </garnt>
<connor> - I've done that before though. </connor>
<connor> Like that's really like nothing. </connor>
<joey> - So it was like legit Samsung? </joey>
<connor> - It's like a Samsung ad, yeah. </connor>
<connor> I don't know what it's for, but- </connor>
<joey> - Then they got like
the deal of the century. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I was fucking ripped off. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, I mean, I priced what
I thought was fair based on </joey>
<joey> what the seller had told me. </joey>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - And if I knew it was gonna be Samsung </connor>
<connor> and it's gonna be like
worldwide like that, </connor>
<garnt> I mean we all would've had (indistinct) </garnt>
<garnt> - You thought you were playing them, </garnt>
<joey> but in the end they were playing you man. </joey>
<joey> - I was getting played, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - They played you. </garnt>
<connor> - I said, "Why the fuck is
Samsung hiring five voice actors? </connor>
<connor> What the fuck!" </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, you think that they'd
got to like professional-- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it's a little </joey>
<joey> - Not to say that, you know, </joey>
<joey> some voice actors aren't professional. </joey>
<joey> - Hearing more stories makes me wonder </joey>
<connor> how many big industry companies </connor>
<connor> are like going on these small sites, </connor>
<connor> you know, like hiring Fiverr voice actors, </connor>
<joey> going like putting job ads
on Craigslist whatever. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I think what's happening-- </joey>
<joey> - Right Raelynn? </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> - That hurts, what I do
you think happens is that, </joey>
<joey> okay, so Samsung is there
like, "Listen, guys, </joey>
<joey> we have a genius advertisement here. </joey>
<joey> We want a company to handle it." </joey>
<garnt> They go and find and ad agency
and then that agency is like, </garnt>
<garnt> "We know just the guy." </garnt>
<garnt> They pretty hire another agency </garnt>
<garnt> who then pretty hires the final agency </garnt>
<garnt> that actually makes it and then
they've got like no budget. </garnt>
<garnt> So they're like get the
Fivver voice actors. </garnt>
<joey> Because I'm not gonna lie a
lot of Fivver voice actors </joey>
<joey> are really fucking good and
getting charged like nothing. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I mean, I would argue
that like almost everyone </joey>
<joey> on that website is probably
a little too overqualified </joey>
<garnt> for what you're paying for. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, that's how that website works. </joey>
<joey> - I mean they're either overly qualified </joey>
<joey> or they're heavily under qualified. </joey>
<joey> - That's true.
- There's no in between. </joey>
<connor> - They'll be people like
a Blue Yeti that are like, </connor>
<joey> "Yeah, I guess I can give you
the commercial rights to it, </joey>
<joey> and, you know, 50 more
words are gonna run, </joey>
<joey> ah, Jesus, 400 bucks man." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - It's like, "Bro what the fuck!" </connor>
<joey> - I've had that with like artists as well </joey>
<joey> where some of them are
just like fucking goatee </joey>
<joey> where it's like you
should make an art book </joey>
<joey> and then other people are like, </joey>
<joey> "Just started a Deviant
Art two days ago let's go." </joey>
<joey> - $100 per commission, let's go. </joey>
<joey> And it's such a coin flip because </joey>
<joey> even if they have like
a good portfolio, right? </joey>
<joey> I've had experiences where
I've hired like artists </joey>
<connor> to produce like an artwork
or music or something </connor>
<connor> and it is not up to the level
they put on their portfolio </connor>
<connor> or their public portfolio.
- Yeah, yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> - You can tell he was
like, here's my A list work </connor>
<garnt> and you're just getting
the D list work on Fiverr, </garnt>
<joey> you know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause you're not paying me
like $500 or some bullshit. </joey>
<connor> - Same with the voice acting as well </connor>
<connor> 'cause a lot of people get
their demos done in a studio </connor>
<joey> like formally like mixed,
produced professionally </joey>
<garnt> and that kind--
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> But then when they do it at home, </garnt>
<garnt> they're just like (indistinct) </garnt>
<connor> - They get their fucking Blue
Yeti set up in a hotel room </connor>
<connor> and it's like, "All right." </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - They're just like this is shit. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know if this is
what I paid for, you know, </connor>
<joey> say that's how I got fucking scammed. </joey>
<joey> I don't know, I mean, I got
paid, hey, I didn't get scammed. </joey>
<garnt> It's my bad like--
- Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Well played Samsung in advertisement. </connor>
<garnt> - Did you record this commercial shoot </garnt>
<garnt> or was the commercial
recording in your own room? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, in my own room.
- Okay. </connor>
<connor> - And I did it like I, </connor>
<connor> I didn't do any of the trimming actually </connor>
<connor> 'cause they wanted to do it
so it was pretty painless. </connor>
<connor> The only thing was is that like, </connor>
<connor> because the lip flaps
they had like fucking, </connor>
<joey> of course they zoomed in
on this man's fucking face, </joey>
<joey> so the lip flaps was so pronounced </joey>
<joey> so you can see exactly which syllable </joey>
<joey> in which letter he was on so. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And there was one where they
sent me where they were like, </joey>
<joey> "Hey, can you change the
script on this one line?" </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "No, the man's
lips say this thing. </joey>
<joey> What do you mean can I change the script? </joey>
<joey> I can't fucking change it to what you, </joey>
<joey> you've added in like three more words. </joey>
<joey> How do you think I'm gonna do that?" </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, you should have
done it just to really </joey>
<joey> like drive on to like home
the Kong power of it, right? </joey>
<joey> It's like--
- I should have just sent </joey>
<joey> to them been like this is what you wanted, </joey>
<connor> this is what you asked for, </connor>
<connor> this just 300 bucks by
the way, this is what you. </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - That would have been hilarious. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's like the lip
flaps clearly say like, </joey>
<joey> "I love Samsung." </joey>
<joey> But you just can't change
it to like, "Buy Apple." </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause it's like the next
level from anime dubbing, right? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause with anime dubbing-- </joey>
<joey> - It's so much harder than anime dubbing. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, with anime dubbing
you have to match all like </connor>
<joey> the lip flaps of the syllables. </joey>
<joey> - So it's two frames, right? </joey>
<joey> It's open mouth with close mouth, right? </joey>
<joey> - No, three frames actually. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, I know this </joey>
<joey> because I have to edit
lip flaps in a bridging </joey>
<joey> 'cause in a bridging it's easy </joey>
<joey> 'cause you take you take your script </joey>
<joey> and you just fucking edit
these three frames of mouth. </joey>
<joey> There's closed mouth, half
opened and fully opened. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - But with dubbing you obviously
can't edit the lip flaps </connor>
<connor> or anything like that so you just, </connor>
<joey> sometimes you hear some lines </joey>
<joey> and it's really, it's a really
unnatural line, you know, </joey>
<garnt> but you just gotta match
what the animation is. </garnt>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it's really like makes you, </connor>
<connor> as if you trying to do it, </connor>
<connor> it really makes you fucking
appreciate these like, </connor>
<connor> in the countries where they
mainly dub a lot of the imagery </connor>
<connor> that they import like how
fucking insane that is </connor>
<connor> that they managed to do
like full seasons of shows </connor>
<joey> and like it's not terrible. </joey>
<joey> It's so hard because you're so constrained </joey>
<garnt> with other mouth shapes because, you know, </garnt>
<connor> I mean, you have to exactly copy. </connor>
<connor> And luckily this was English, </connor>
<connor> but like, oh my god, another language. </connor>
<joey> - Meanwhile you have countries like Japan </joey>
<connor> that it just like fuck that. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I have noticed Japan </joey>
<connor> is just like fuck the lip
flaps, let's just talk over it. </connor>
<joey> - That's what makes it like a
million times more hilarious. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah, I know, right? </joey>
<joey> - The change in the voices
is already hilarious </joey>
<connor> but then seeing them like
say something that just </connor>
<joey> not a single mouth movement is correct. </joey>
<joey> - You almost like don't mind it though </joey>
<joey> 'cause you realize they're
just like they're not, </joey>
<joey> they're not trying to do that. </joey>
<joey> It's like, yeah, whatever
man, I don't give a shit. </joey>
<connor> I'm supposed to be sent
like fucking, some fucking </connor>
<connor> like History Channel Car
restoration show on TV. </connor>
<garnt> And they had like, </garnt>
<garnt> it was like a really like old British guy </garnt>
<garnt> and they had like the proper
like Samurai sounding old dude. </garnt>
<garnt> (indistinct) </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, "Wow, okay, geez." </garnt>
<garnt> That's not what he, I mean,
that's what he sounds like, </garnt>
<connor> but I don't know, I'm like, cool. </connor>
<connor> (indistinct) </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - That was kind inappropriate. </garnt>
<connor> - That's how the old dude
sound like a Japanese </connor>
<garnt> like Munna, Munna, Munna, Munna. </garnt>
<garnt> Like I don't even know what to say. </garnt>
<garnt> - Did you say Munna Munna? </garnt>
<garnt> - I think he just did. </garnt>
<garnt> - Munna Munna Munna. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Oh my God. </garnt>
<connor> - Fuck it no, they don't
do that, total shit. </connor>
<garnt> - Speaking of Munna, did we
talk about that time we went </garnt>
<joey> to a Jojo bar last week or? </joey>
<joey> - I don't think we did so. </joey>
<connor> - So, yeah, 'cause I wanted
to talk about the Jojo bar so. </connor>
<connor> - Okay.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, to explain like two weeks ago, </connor>
<connor> we went to the same Jojo bar
that Joey made a video on. </connor>
<connor> And it was fucking, </connor>
<connor> I don't know what it is about Japan </connor>
<connor> that has so many of like these small bars </connor>
<connor> that are like, themed, </connor>
<connor> but they're like way cooler
than any of like the, </connor>
<connor> like the big bars that
you go to in the West </connor>
<connor> or that I've been to like in
England that tried to make </connor>
<connor> like this themed bar, you what I mean? </connor>
<connor> 'Cause it was so small
and it was so intimate </connor>
<connor> and it was run by a guy </connor>
<connor> who clearly really fucking love Jojo. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Oh, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And I think the thing what
impressed me the most was </connor>
<joey> the fucking drink list. </joey>
<joey> - Oh my god, it's gigantic. </joey>
<garnt> - Holy fuck! </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, like the, because
in my video as well </joey>
<joey> and when we got there they
say that you can film anything </joey>
<garnt> and you can take photos and videos </garnt>
<joey> of like any of the merch
or anything like that, </joey>
<joey> but you can't take a picture
or video of the menu. </joey>
<joey> For the longest time I
never understood why? </joey>
<joey> Like why only the menu? </joey>
<joey> But then when you actually
flip through this menu </joey>
<joey> and you realize there's like, </joey>
<joey> almost like 1000 fucking drinks. </joey>
<connor> - I think there's like, there's gotta be, </connor>
<connor> I'm counting my head like maybe like </connor>
<joey> around 300 drinks I think. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- I'd say so. </joey>
<connor> But it's like more than
like your conventional </connor>
<joey> like bar thing.
- [Connor] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And out of those like three 400 drinks, </joey>
<garnt> half of them are originals. </garnt>
<garnt> It just says original. </garnt>
<garnt> And they're all like named
after, you know, characters </garnt>
<garnt> and phrases and whatnot. </garnt>
<joey> And you have to fucking like
perform the phrase as well </joey>
<joey> to the bartender. </joey>
<joey> And it's so like embarrassing
when like you say </joey>
<joey> like lines like, "Excuse me,
can I get the (indistinct)." </joey>
<joey> And then she's like,
"Okay, one (indistinct)." </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Coming right up. </connor>
<connor> - Coming right up. </connor>
<joey> - It's so cool. </joey>
<garnt> - Here's your (indistinct). </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, because to explain
how the menu works, </garnt>
<garnt> basically the menu works
like, like a fucking, </garnt>
<garnt> the menu is the Jojo reference, right? </garnt>
<garnt> So it goes by parts. </garnt>
<garnt> So every drink is either named
after a character or a stand </garnt>
<garnt> or just a random reference. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like, you know, you have like </garnt>
<garnt> a random catchphrase or something. </garnt>
<connor> Was there like a drink in
part four that was like, </connor>
<connor> let's kill da ho or something like that. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Let's kill the hoe.
- Let's kill the hoe, bitch. </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - There was like a reference to like </garnt>
<garnt> the dead dog in part one </garnt>
<connor> and one of them was Wells
or was it something-- </connor>
<joey> - Oh, yeah, it was like
Danny or something. </joey>
<garnt> - That was his name, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah or something like that. </garnt>
<connor> - Something like that
and then that was like, </connor>
<connor> Oh my god, there was just
so many funny sounding ones </connor>
<connor> like I just loved those
one Bohemian Rhapsody. </connor>
<connor> I mean, that's a stand. </connor>
<connor> I just loved that I could
order a drink called </connor>
<connor> a Bohemian Rhapsody. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I just found it
super cool that I was just </garnt>
<garnt> basically ordering a fucking, </garnt>
<joey> you know, Kira Yoshikage
or something like that. </joey>
<joey> You know, you just basically
ordering Jojo references </joey>
<garnt> and I thought that was fucking brilliant. </garnt>
<joey> - Although there was one thing </joey>
<joey> that I was like kind of upset about </joey>
<joey> and I don't know if this
is gonna be a spoiler </joey>
<joey> for part seven, but I was very upset </joey>
<joey> that I couldn't order a Jesus Christ. </joey>
<connor> - Oh yeah, I would have
liked the Jesus Christ. </connor>
<joey> - I was looking through part seven, </joey>
<joey> I'm like please say
there's a drink I'll try. </joey>
<connor> - Was there a President of
the United States as well? </connor>
<connor> I don't think there was either. </connor>
<joey> - I don't know, no, though I
think there was a, was there? </joey>
<connor> - I mean, there was Funny Valentine. </connor>
<joey> - There was Funny Valentine. </joey>
<joey> Was there another George Bush? </joey>
<joey> - George Bush. </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Right, 'cause he's a
Canon character, right? </joey>
<garnt> That he appears. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know, I probably don't remember. </garnt>
<garnt> - Or it's like a character
that's mortal or something, </garnt>
<joey> I don't fucking know but-- </joey>
<garnt> - See what I love about being a Jojo fan </garnt>
<garnt> is you only watch the anime
hanging out with you two. </garnt>
<garnt> We have like red way further in the manga, </garnt>
<joey> is that I was hanging out to this bar </joey>
<joey> and you were just like straight
up putting out spoilers </joey>
<joey> of part six and part seven. </joey>
<joey> And the great thing about Jojo </joey>
<garnt> is that I was listening to these
spoilers and I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "I don't think I've actually
been spoiled at all honestly." </garnt>
<joey> - It is just the only
show that you can spoil </joey>
<connor> without actually giving anything away. </connor>
<joey> - It makes so little sense
that when you hear it, </joey>
<connor> it's like you just
don't see it ever coming </connor>
<joey> when you're reading it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, so in part seven
Dio turns into a dinosaur </joey>
<joey> because he's going off to Jesus Christ arm </joey>
<joey> and you're just like, "I
guess that's what happens." </joey>
<joey> - I mean, that was my
exact same like reaction. </joey>
<joey> - I knew that happened but I didn't, </joey>
<joey> like when I was reading
it I was like, "Oh!" </joey>
<connor> And I only realized it when
it was happening I was like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, that's what everyone meant." </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause out of context it's like, </joey>
<joey> how is this plot point supposed to fit </joey>
<garnt> into this story in any sense. </garnt>
<garnt> - Hearing it out of context it's just, </garnt>
<joey> it doesn't hinder your enjoyment </joey>
<joey> when you're actually
experiencing the entire thing, </joey>
<connor> which is why I'm fucking
looking forward to when, </connor>
<connor> I'm hoping when part six,
part seven has animated. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Although hearing you guys
talk about it in the bar, </connor>
<connor> I might just like go out
and read it honestly. </connor>
<joey> - It's so good dude, it's so good. </joey>
<joey> - Part six to seven manga
is fairly incredible. </joey>
<connor> - I'm a Jojo like cock JoJo
or cock sucker whatever, </connor>
<connor> so it's like I mean, I've (indistinct). </connor>
<garnt> - That was Jojo fan basis
comment, JoJo cock suckers. </garnt>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - That's basically what they are. </garnt>
<garnt> What is it with all the memes
where it's like a Jojo fans </garnt>
<garnt> when they see it on the
site cock or whatever </garnt>
<joey> is what it is, is fucking memes. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like the best part is though is it like, </joey>
<joey> you don't know if the drink, </joey>
<joey> like this is just like original, right? </joey>
<garnt> So you have no idea what it
is, but you kinda gotta guess </garnt>
<garnt> is it gonna be like a
fruity easy to drink drink </garnt>
<garnt> or is it gonna be like
just fucking alcohol </garnt>
<garnt> like straight liquor, </garnt>
<joey> unlike Joey just somehow kept ordering </joey>
<joey> like just he was like, "I'll have the Ri </joey>
<joey> and the Ora Ora Ora and
they were all just like </joey>
<joey> basically straight spirits. </joey>
<joey> I kept ordering stuff </joey>
<garnt> that was all like Malibu's
fruity drinks, I was like-- </garnt>
<garnt> - I actually think he has a kind of like </garnt>
<garnt> a power leveling system
going on with the drinks </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause anytime you'd ordered
like a main character </garnt>
<garnt> or like a JoJo, it was always
a super powerful drink. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, I know like out of
all the powerful drinks I had, </joey>
<connor> I think the most powerful one I had was-- </connor>
<connor> - Stroheim. </connor>
<joey> - No, it was part three Dio. </joey>
<connor> - Wasn't it really the Ri was
like really straight vodka? </connor>
<connor> - Ri as well was fucking
bad and I'm like-- </connor>
<connor> - You had to actually
order a drink by going, </connor>
<connor> "Ri toxic on this house."- </connor>
<joey> - And then this cute
bartender girl was like, </joey>
<joey> "Okay, Ri that's toxic." </joey>
<garnt> - But here's the thing, do you
think he actually remembers </garnt>
<connor> every drink that he made 'cause
most of them are originals? </connor>
<connor> - I think so. </connor>
<joey> - I mean he has to, right? </joey>
<joey> - Oh wait, when you order
the Yoshikage Kira as well, </joey>
<joey> it comes with a separate hand. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, it came with a separate hand, </garnt>
<garnt> which I thought was fucking brilliant. </garnt>
<joey> - And the Sex Pistols. </joey>
<joey> Sex Pistols comes on like a
roulette like style table thing </joey>
<joey> with a gun in the middle
and that's actually cool. </joey>
<garnt> - And it's like just different shots. </garnt>
<connor> - It's just basically six shots. </connor>
<garnt> - Which is perfect about shoots shot. </garnt>
<garnt> - So you go to the menu you one, </garnt>
<joey> you don't know how strong
the drink is gonna be </joey>
<joey> and like two, you don't
know what the drink </joey>
<joey> is gonna be either so it
was just a fun experience </joey>
<joey> just working your way through the menu </joey>
<garnt> and just being like, hey, this is a Kira </garnt>
<garnt> or this is like Sex Pistols </garnt>
<garnt> and just being surprised
at what you got basically. </garnt>
<joey> - But I think as well
that's such an awesome </joey>
<joey> like marketing move as well </joey>
<joey> because that just incentivizes
you to go back to it. </joey>
<joey> I was being like, "All
right, I finished all </joey>
<garnt> the part one drinks this time round, </garnt>
<garnt> next week I'm gonna go back </garnt>
<joey> and finish all the part
two drinks all right. </joey>
<garnt> - It's basically like
watching Jojo itself. </garnt>
<garnt> You walk through each part </garnt>
<joey> until you get through every part. </joey>
<joey> - You can't skip any of the parts, </joey>
<joey> you have to like complete it. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I had like five Rohan Kishibe. </connor>
<garnt> It was like Rohan Kishibe at the store, </garnt>
<joey> Rohan Kishibe at the Lourve. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, no, it was like Rohan
Kishibe goes to Gucci, right? </garnt>
<joey> That's was one of the drinks. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I was like how many
Rohan Kishibes are there? </joey>
<connor> What the fuck! </connor>
<connor> - You know what, my favorite
one was when you ordered </connor>
<joey> like a Jotaro and you have to like specify </joey>
<joey> which parts are, which part
Jotaro are you ordering? </joey>
<garnt> - That's was awesome, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like I don't know, </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like those kinds of establishments </garnt>
<connor> are just the most perfect place </connor>
<connor> to just weeb the fuck out, right? </connor>
<connor> Because it's like if forgives
you for weebing out, right? </connor>
<connor> - You get so drunk as
well 'cause you're like, </connor>
<joey> you just wanna keep fucking drinking </joey>
<joey> and it's like reasonably priced, </joey>
<connor> it's like I don't know like $7 a drink. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, and all the cocktails
are delicious as well, </joey>
<garnt> you know, they taste really,
really good even though, </garnt>
<garnt> you know, half of them fucked me up </garnt>
<connor> because they were so fucking strong. </connor>
<joey> - You just kept getting the straight shot </joey>
<connor> and I kept getting the nice ones </connor>
<joey> and I was like, "Oh, yeah." </joey>
<joey> - I was like, "I want
something nice to just </joey>
<joey> like sooth my throat off
all these fucking shots </joey>
<joey> you know what I'm saying? </joey>
<joey> - I kept ordering these fucking Sex Pistol </joey>
<garnt> and it just gets, it's
just straight up six shots, </garnt>
<garnt> it's not even a cocktail. </garnt>
<garnt> - I love it. </garnt>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - That was good. </garnt>
<joey> - But yeah go check it out
if you guys are at Nakano. </joey>
<garnt> - What was it called again? </garnt>
<joey> - It's called a- </joey>
<garnt> - Dio, right? </garnt>
<joey> - It called Dio, yeah, in Tokyo. </joey>
<garnt> - So when the country opens
up, gonna pay them a visit. </garnt>
<connor> They have a Twitter as well, like Dio bar. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, they have a Twitter. </connor>
<garnt> - Yes, right now in Nakano Broadway, </garnt>
<garnt> which if you're gonna come to Japan, </garnt>
<garnt> I reckon like a lot of weebs
come to Japan and they're like, </garnt>
<joey> "We need to go to Akihabara,
we need to Akihabara." </joey>
<joey> But I reckon like Nakano Broadway </joey>
<joey> is also a very, very much
- It's fun and awesome, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's kind of like the
underground version of Akihabara. </joey>
<joey> - It's like a condensed Akihabara. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly 'cause
everything you can get. </joey>
<joey> Most of the things you get in Akihabara </joey>
<garnt> just condensed down into one building </garnt>
<garnt> and you can basically walk
around it for a lot less time </garnt>
<garnt> than you would Akihabara. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, there's just, I don't know, </joey>
<joey> there's just like in Nakano Broadway. </joey>
<joey> I feel there's just a lot
more like interesting, </joey>
<connor> like old Tokyo stores like
very, very niche stuff </connor>
<connor> that like you might not
necessarily be into it, </connor>
<garnt> but it's just really
fucking interesting to see. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because the thing
about Akihabara is that, </garnt>
<garnt> once you've been once you
see what the former is, </garnt>
<garnt> you know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> You see what shows get on display, </garnt>
<garnt> it's all like the Moe stuff normally </garnt>
<garnt> and, you know, it's a lot
more difficult to find </garnt>
<garnt> a lot of the nicher shows </garnt>
<garnt> and kind of like figurines or merchandise </garnt>
<garnt> that are like less mainstream. </garnt>
<garnt> But in Nakano Broadway, </garnt>
<garnt> you find a lot of like untapped gems, </garnt>
<joey> unlike, there's really good store there. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> There's this fucking
store in Nakano Broadway </joey>
<connor> that's like right at the
entrance of Nakano Broadway </connor>
<connor> that sell Gengars from the anime. </connor>
<connor> And like they sell like Cels from anime. </connor>
<joey> - Right, oh, I saw that one, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I'm like what the fuck, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, like some of
these Cels are quite cheap </garnt>
<garnt> because they're probably like
mass produced the one that, </garnt>
<garnt> which is just based on shows
that no one really cares about, </garnt>
<joey> but some of the more expensive ones </joey>
<joey> are just like holy shit. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I remember there was a Cel from </garnt>
<garnt> The End of Evangelion that I saw from the, </garnt>
<garnt> it's in the top floor of Nakano Broadway, </garnt>
<garnt> if I remember correctly,
and it's right at the back. </garnt>
<joey> But they have some like
really classic Cels. </joey>
<joey> The most impressive one
I saw was one from like, </joey>
<joey> The End of Evangelion, </joey>
<joey> and it was the Asuka's flight as well. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, shit. </joey>
<joey> - And it was an expensive boy. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I get it. </garnt>
<garnt> - How much was it? </garnt>
<garnt> It was like, I think it was like $10,000. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh! </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that sounds about right. </joey>
<joey> - For a piece of paper. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, at that point is
basically like a museum-- </joey>
<connor> - Oh, no, that's true, that's true. </connor>
<connor> - How can you put a price? </connor>
<connor> - How do they get that? </connor>
<joey> - That's what I wanna know, right? </joey>
<joey> - How does that like get
in the hands of someone? </joey>
<joey> - It's just like maybe
they'd like sell those often </joey>
<joey> like auctions or-- </joey>
<connor> - Maybe some staff member takes it </connor>
<connor> and then they sell it on-- </connor>
<joey> - It's like, "It's only one
Cel they wouldn't know." </joey>
<connor> - Like, "Hey man, this
Crunch is brutal man, </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna take a little something home, </connor>
<connor> make a little bit of cash
on the side, you know?" </connor>
<connor> - There's a snitch in the studio, </connor>
<connor> we'll take it out ourselves. </connor>
<joey> - I think they're only just
gonna get more expensive because </joey>
<joey> now animation studios don't
use Cel animation anymore. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right, right. </joey>
<joey> - So at this point it just becomes like </joey>
<joey> a memorabilia, right? </joey>
<joey> Of our history because you can't, </joey>
<joey> I mean, you can get like Gengars
and everything like that, </joey>
<garnt> but having a good old fashioned
Cel is just not a flex. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, because you can't
like, unlike a Gengar, </joey>
<joey> you can't like, you know,
photocopy a Cel, right? </joey>
<joey> Because it's based off
like a plastic sheet. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<joey> - It's much easier to tell
when a cell is completely fake </joey>
<garnt> 'cause I've seen some
fucking completely fake Cels </garnt>
<garnt> and it's just like all these
like flimsy pieces of paper </garnt>
<garnt> and people paying stupid
amounts of money for it </garnt>
<garnt> because they don't know any better, right? </garnt>
<joey> I'm just like, "No,
don't, what are you doing? </joey>
<joey> It's just a fucking drawing." </joey>
<garnt> - Do you guys miss the old
like Cel animation aesthetic </garnt>
<connor> compared to like much cleaner
digital aesthetic of today? </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<garnt> - It's been bittersweet
for me I think like, </garnt>
<garnt> obviously like, you know,
the digital stuff now </garnt>
<connor> is like so much better
choreographed unlike the later ends. </connor>
<connor> Like you can tell that </connor>
<joey> like all these camera movements were done </joey>
<joey> through a computer. </joey>
<joey> But I don't know there's
something really charming </joey>
<joey> about like, you know, a
manual like camera shake </joey>
<connor> in terms of making a Cel. </connor>
<garnt> - Ed, Edd n Eddy great animation. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Old Cels. </garnt>
<garnt> - Dude man I love that,
I love the bubbly lines, </garnt>
<garnt> you know, I mean, it's great. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's comfy, it's comfy. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, like Redline was all- </garnt>
<garnt> - That was great, that was- </garnt>
<connor> - That's fucking, oh my God. </connor>
<garnt> - And that took like what 10 years? </garnt>
<garnt> - Seven years.
- Seven years, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - It took a little while,
it took a little while. </joey>
<joey> - But yet no one fucking watched it. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, I will say
that I think, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> on average animation is better quality now </garnt>
<garnt> because digital animation has made things, </garnt>
<garnt> has made it easier to get
a higher level quality </garnt>
<garnt> of animation for like most animes. </garnt>
<garnt> But yeah, I think you're right, </garnt>
<garnt> there is like a definite charm </garnt>
<garnt> about watching good old
fashioned Cel animation. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, I definitely
wouldn't want all my anime </joey>
<garnt> to be based off Cels, but--
- No. </garnt>
<garnt> - There were some like,
especially like when you go back </garnt>
<joey> to like, you know, the whole like '80s </joey>
<joey> just like general anime
aesthetic, that like the, </joey>
<connor> "Oh yeah, this is an '80s
anime goal aesthetic." </connor>
<joey> Like that on Cel animation is just- </joey>
<connor> - It's like a bowl of like Rice Krispies. </connor>
<garnt> Like, I never eat a fucking
bowl of Rice Krispies </garnt>
<connor> when I do I'm like,
all right, okay, yeah-- </connor>
<garnt> - It's not bad.
- Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - Not bad. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - But then the next day, you're like, </garnt>
<joey> "I don't even think about Rice Krispies." </joey>
<joey> That's how I see it, do
you know what I mean? </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - I don't but I'll just nod. </garnt>
<joey> - I don't give a fuck about it. </joey>
<joey> - I'll just nod and agree. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> I know literally zero things about cereal. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't eat cereal. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, me neither. </connor>
<connor> That's why it's like, it just
kind of reminds you being </connor>
<connor> a kid again, you know what I mean? </connor>
<joey> - I don't fully agree with you. </joey>
<connor> I'll just use analogies all right. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> I'll just assume that like your fucking-- </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - That's what old Cel
animation reminds me of like </connor>
<joey> a bowl of cereal, right? </joey>
<garnt> I don't eat cereal 'cause--
- [Joey] Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - Frankly, I don't care for it. </garnt>
<garnt> There I said it, okay? </garnt>
<garnt> Controversial pitch. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, it's not controversial. </garnt>
<connor> - [Joey] It's not controversial. </connor>
<connor> - Here's a controversial
thing when I do eat cereal, </connor>
<joey> I don't eat it without milk,
I'd eat it without milk. </joey>
<joey> - That's what I'm saying, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - I want my cereal dry, I
think the milk ruins it. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's better than folk
people who say like, </garnt>
<joey> fucking monsters who say like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh yeah, I use water in mine." </joey>
<garnt> - Okay, that is a level
even I was duped too. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm pretty sure that's like how you end </connor>
<garnt> like Jiva convention that
have to do that, right? </garnt>
<connor> And that's like fucked up like-- </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Because it's basic human rights. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Like what? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I do, I knew a guy in-- </joey>
<joey> - That's bullshit. </joey>
<joey> - I knew a guy my uni, no,
I saw him fucking do it too. </joey>
<joey> I knew a guy my uni who-- </joey>
<joey> - Did you call the police? </joey>
<joey> - Dead ass, yeah, I was about to. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> I think I'm being assaulted right now. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> My eyes are being assaulted. </joey>
<joey> No, it was fucking disgusting you-- </joey>
<garnt> - I never condole like
spitting in someone's food, </garnt>
<joey> but I think that's an
exception to be made. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, he was eating like just, </joey>
<joey> and it was like basic
ass cornflakes as well. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like it's already
a human rights crime </joey>
<joey> to just eat cornflakes with nothing in it, </joey>
<garnt> let alone with water. </garnt>
<joey> - Actually I could eat
cornflakes with nothing in it. </joey>
<garnt> - No, it depends on the cornflakes. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, but like eating
with water is like- </joey>
<connor> - That's a, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - It's like here let me top
my water with more water. </joey>
<joey> - Who likes cereal when
it's the soggiest, right? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause that's all you're doing, </joey>
<garnt> you're just making your cereal soggy. </garnt>
<garnt> - Exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like were you that
desperate for hydration </garnt>
<garnt> that you needed to go for
your fucking cornflakes, </garnt>
<connor> like what the fuck! </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, that's why whenever
I used to eat cereal </joey>
<joey> in high school, I would eat
that shit so fucking fast. </joey>
<joey> - Did he make it through high school </joey>
<connor> or did he like just not make it? </connor>
<joey> - I mean, he was in my
uni so I guess he did. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, shit, okay, wow.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - The university took him in? </connor>
<joey> - I'm like, "Man, like you
can't even afford milk at uni?" </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> Like are you that much of a-- </joey>
<joey> - I smell broke. </joey>
<joey> - Are you that much of a broke uni student </joey>
<joey> that he can't even afford milk? </joey>
<joey> - You just go to the tap and you're like, </joey>
<connor> "Here we go again another day." </connor>
<connor> - I don't know what it is about uni </connor>
<connor> and like communal kitchens </connor>
<joey> and the one thing that always gets taken </joey>
<joey> in the communal kitchens is the milk. </joey>
<joey> It's always the milk. </joey>
<joey> I don't know why, everything else-- </joey>
<garnt> - Is just because you can just take it </garnt>
<garnt> and you think they
won't notice that's why, </garnt>
<connor> but everyone does it. </connor>
<connor> - Like you can label your cutlery, </connor>
<connor> you can label your food to be like, </connor>
<connor> don't touch this, don't touch this. </connor>
<garnt> You can label your milk
but it never works. </garnt>
<garnt> Your milk will inevitably
disappear like a day or two, </garnt>
<garnt> they'll touch it. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, because it's like
a lost currency, right? </joey>
<joey> It's like water but with calories. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - I remember when I-- </joey>
<joey> - It's water with attitude. </joey>
<joey> - It's water with attitude. </joey>
<joey> - I had a friend who was
in my dorm and I liked him </joey>
<joey> and then one time, yeah, I
did like him but now I don't. </joey>
<connor> - You did.
- I liked him. </connor>
<joey> - Emphasize the did. </joey>
<connor> - You know, he was really
high and then I came in-- </connor>
<connor> - Like stoned. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, stoned, he was really stoned. </connor>
<connor> And then I walk in and I see
him eating cookies and cream, </connor>
<garnt> Ben & Jerry's, and I'm
like, "Where's my, is that, </garnt>
<garnt> that's not, I could use some
cream and Jerry's is it?" </garnt>
<joey> And he's like, "Oh, sorry.
I'll buy you one tomorrow." </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, I was
gonna eat that tonight. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> I've planned a great
evening watching anime, </joey>
<joey> I was gonna eat that. </joey>
<joey> I don't want your shitty
Tesco's one pound, </joey>
<connor> four kilograms of vanilla
that looks brighter </connor>
<connor> than like yellow on the
like hexadecimal thing. </connor>
<connor> I don't want that ice cream
that tastes like shit. </connor>
<connor> Why would you, that pissed me off so much. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, like vanilla ice cream
that's like way too yellow </joey>
<connor> for its own good scares me. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, yeah, that aint- </joey>
<connor> - That's like a fear I have. </connor>
<joey> I have a fear of heights </joey>
<connor> and way too yellow vanilla ice cream. </connor>
<joey> - It doesn't even tastes like ice cream, </joey>
<joey> it tastes like something, </joey>
<connor> I don't know what it is like that's-- </connor>
<garnt> - It's like I don't wanna eat something-- </garnt>
<joey> - What's even worse than that is </joey>
<joey> when you get the soft serve </joey>
<garnt> and the soft serve isn't
white and it's yellow, </garnt>
<garnt> have you ever had that? </garnt>
<garnt> - No.
- [Joey] I know I have. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause at that point-- </garnt>
<garnt> - Wait, where did you get that from? </garnt>
<joey> - Okay, it's not like the,
it's it's always just in like </joey>
<joey> the fucking ice cream vans that
only come out in the summer. </joey>
<joey> - Oh. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, I thought you were
talking about in Japan. </joey>
<joey> - Not in Japan. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, okay I got it, I was gonna say-- </connor>
<garnt> - We get the top tier sheer here in Japan. </garnt>
<joey> - They wouldn't morph it here in Japan </joey>
<joey> that's a British move. </joey>

<joey> you start thinking about
what to eat for dinner </joey>
<joey> while you're eating lunch. </joey>
<joey> I love food, but sometimes
getting into my kitchen </joey>
<joey> and cooking something delicious to eat </joey>
<joey> just doesn't make it on my to do list </joey>
<joey> that's why I definitely use Postmates. </joey>
<joey> - But Connor we live in Japan. </joey>

<garnt> - Thank you for sponsoring
this episode back to the video. </garnt>
<garnt> - In England, sometimes they have </garnt>
<garnt> these ice cream vans, right? </garnt>
<connor> That only come out that
one day that it's summer </connor>
<connor> or that it's sunny and-- </connor>
<connor> - I've never seen them do that though. </connor>
<connor> - Have you, have you never,
have you ever had the soft serve </connor>
<garnt> from one of those ice cream vans before? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, you see it from coming out </connor>
<connor> of like the machine right? </connor>
<garnt> The flake, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's 99 flake. </garnt>
<garnt> And some of them they do come out white, </garnt>
<garnt> some of them they come out yellow, right? </garnt>
<garnt> And you always know it's
like the shittiest ice cream </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause it's not even ice cream. </garnt>
<garnt> Okay, ice, there's the ice and
the cream and the soft serve. </garnt>
<garnt> With this, it's like 70%
cream and like 30% ice. </garnt>
<garnt> So it's like, it's not even filling. </garnt>
<garnt> - But was it you who said </garnt>
<joey> that you're not a fan of soft serves? </joey>
<connor> - I think soft serves
tastes too milky, it's like- </connor>
<joey> - But that's the best bit. </joey>
<joey> - Nah, dude-- </joey>
<joey> - It is the fact that it's milky. </joey>
<joey> - It feels like I'm eating
milk, I don't wanna eat milk, </joey>
<garnt> I wanna eat ice cream. </garnt>
<connor> - No, yeah, soft serve
is the best ice cream. </connor>
<garnt> - Gelato, gelato is the best--
- Get the fuck outta here. </garnt>
<garnt> Gelato is like eating a three course meal </garnt>
<garnt> while eat like in one soft serve. </garnt>
<connor> - I like how gelato can
like crush everything else </connor>
<connor> in my stomach down to make room. </connor>
<joey> - Wait, wait so you've never
had like a creamy a premium? </joey>
<connor> - No, I have, I have. </connor>
<connor> - Do you like it?
- I think it's too milky. </connor>
<garnt> - You like it, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, it's good
because it's a soft serve, </garnt>
<connor> but I do agree that it's a bit too milky. </connor>
<connor> I think, I think-- </connor>
<connor> - Japan are obsessed with
milk, I don't know what it is. </connor>
<connor> - I think humanity peaked in soft serves </connor>
<connor> and in ice cream in
general with the McFlurry. </connor>
<connor> I don't know what it is about McFlurry, </connor>
<joey> but I can eat that shit like for eternity. </joey>
<connor> - Is the McFlurry a self serve? </connor>
<connor> - I mean, technically-- </connor>
<joey> - I feel like it's in
its own category of ice. </joey>
<joey> Like it's not even-- </joey>
<joey> - I mean, out of us three, </joey>
<joey> you're the only one who
ever worked in McDonald's </joey>
<garnt> that's like unfortunately it's you. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - So it comes out of a machine, right? </garnt>
<garnt> That kind of looks like a soft serve. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Am I correct? </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean-- </garnt>
<garnt> - Is it soft serve? </garnt>
<joey> - I don't know. </joey>
<joey> - It's the same ice cream
that they put in the cone </joey>
<connor> for like McDonald's ice cream. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, like the 20 cents ice cream. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know what it is
about putting a soft serve </joey>
<garnt> in a cup and then putting
some toppings on it </garnt>
<garnt> and then fucking spinning it. </garnt>
<joey> I called it spinning, what, mixing it. </joey>
<joey> I don't know why that's
just the magical formula, </joey>
<joey> but I remember the first
time I've tasted a McFlurry, </joey>
<joey> I'm like, I like all these
ingredients individually, </joey>
<joey> but put them together </joey>
<joey> and mix them in a separate way and you-- </joey>
<joey> - You McFlurrried in your pants. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I McFlurried in my pants </joey>
<joey> - Basically. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> - I can't even remember this,
but is the milkshake machine </connor>
<garnt> and the ice cream machine the same? </garnt>
<garnt> Do they--
- No, no. </garnt>
<joey> - Is it not?
- It's not. </joey>
<joey> - But it's the same machine, right? </joey>
<connor> It's like two different settings though. </connor>
<joey> - I think I've had like three
McFlurries in my life so. </joey>
<joey> - What?
- Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - No, because the McFlurry the ice cream, </garnt>
<garnt> the ice cream machine in
McDonald's actually works, </garnt>
<garnt> the milkshake it's like 70%
of the time, it's not working. </garnt>
<connor> - 'Cause I remember when
I worked at McDonald's, </connor>
<connor> I'd like refill the milkshake machine </connor>
<joey> and it was like, it's just like a sack. </joey>
<connor> Like it's just a sack of fluid, right? </connor>
<connor> And to fill this up, right? </connor>
<connor> You have to like hold up
this bag and loosen the cap </connor>
<connor> and then like pour it in the bag. </connor>
<connor> Have you ever tried to
pull a string out of a bag? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- It's like the fucking worst. </connor>
<connor> Like there's no like faucet or anything, </connor>
<connor> not faucet, fucking like lid
or anything to direct it, </connor>
<connor> it's just a fucking hole. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And so I'm pouring this thing </garnt>
<joey> and then a little bit obviously
like started splashing off, </joey>
<joey> and so it started splashing
me like fucking whatever </joey>
<joey> and I put it all over my fucking
self in front of everyone </joey>
<joey> and the machine was broken. </joey>
<joey> - And then everybody came around and-- </joey>
<garnt> - The machine was broken for another hour </garnt>
<joey> 'cause we had to clean everything up </joey>
<joey> that I fucking spilled everywhere. </joey>
<garnt> - What was inside the bag? </garnt>
<garnt> - It's just like milkshake mix. </garnt>
<garnt> It's just like mix. </garnt>
<garnt> - So why is the milkshake
machine always breaking? </garnt>
<garnt> - They have to clean it constantly. </garnt>
<garnt> Like that's when I was there. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, they would fucking clean
it every few hours 'cause </garnt>
<garnt> apparently, obviously the milk
can get stale really fast. </garnt>
<connor> so they clean it.
- In an hour though? </connor>
<connor> - No, but it's like they
have to clean it I think </connor>
<connor> like two times a day at least, </connor>
<connor> I can't remember 'cause like-- </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, I wouldn't be surprised </garnt>
<garnt> if the milkshake machine
was basically the same </garnt>
<garnt> as the ice cream machine. </garnt>
<garnt> And that's because a McDonald's milkshake </garnt>
<garnt> is basically a fucking soft serve-- </garnt>
<garnt> - I agree, yeah , yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - But you have to drink
it through a straw. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, it's a melted soft soft serve. </joey>
<joey> - So like every time I get
a McDonald's milkshake, </joey>
<connor> you have this like five
minute grace periods </connor>
<connor> where it's impossible to
drink the fucking milkshake. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, true, true. </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause you eat- </garnt>
<connor> - That's great 'cause you eat the food </connor>
<connor> and then you can drink the milkshake. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, 'cause you try sucking in it </garnt>
<connor> and the straw just fucking collapses in, </connor>
<connor> and it's like wait, you know what I mean? </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> That's like the McDonald's milkshake-- </connor>
<connor> - You create a mini
black hole inside of it. </connor>
<joey> It's like everything gets crushed. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> - Like my brother worked for McDonald's </joey>
<joey> and when I turned 16 I really
wanted the fucking Xbox One, </joey>
<garnt> so I was like, "I'm gonna
get a job at McDonald's." </garnt>
<joey> You're paid like £4.10
an hour, which is like $5 </joey>
<garnt> that was like maybe $5.50. </garnt>
<garnt> And, yeah, I fucking hated it. </garnt>
<garnt> And I remember my brother
telling me he was like, </garnt>
<joey> "Yeah, you can get sick of
McDonald's food really fast." </joey>
<joey> And I was like six months in I'm like, </joey>
<joey> I fucking love this food stuff still like, </joey>
<joey> you'd get to make your own
like, you weren't supposed to, </joey>
<joey> but like the managers were
like, "You could have this." </joey>
<joey> Like you can basically
make your own burger. </joey>
<connor> So I used to just make like the, </connor>
<connor> like in the UK we have like
fried chicken sandwiches, </connor>
<connor> like they're like fancy ones. </connor>
<joey> They used like the, like
they're like the better meat. </joey>
<joey> I mean, it still little fucking awful, </joey>
<joey> but I would just fucking put
like a handful of fucking bacon </joey>
<joey> and just shove it on and
that was like the best part. </joey>
<joey> And then you could get like
meals like half priced, </joey>
<joey> but everything else is
fucking awful at McDonald's. </joey>
<connor> Everything was awful. </connor>
<connor> Like, the people were the worst part man. </connor>
<connor> They were just like-- </connor>
<joey> - More like the workers or the customers? </joey>
<connor> - Workers, the workers. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, really, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause I just didn't
get along with any of them </joey>
<joey> and they will all, you
know, like not to be mean, </joey>
<garnt> but a lot of the ones that I
worked with were like people </garnt>
<garnt> that like, I wouldn't be friends with. </garnt>
<garnt> - Whenever I go to a McDonald's </garnt>
<joey> and I see like an employee
smiling, I'm like, "He's Cersei." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I'm like who is he murder today? </joey>
<garnt> So some are just like
orange Cersei right now. </garnt>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - I remember, I legitimately
got like, I got like put, </joey>
<joey> had to come sit in the, like
fucking put on like detention </joey>
<joey> for like 20 minutes 'cause-- </joey>
<joey> - At the McDonald's? </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause I was working on the fucking, </joey>
<joey> like making the chicken
burgers and the burgers, </joey>
<joey> I was making the burgers </joey>
<joey> and they took me off for not smiling. </joey>
<joey> And I said, I said, I said, </joey>
<connor> "Why do I have to smile
when making burgers?" </connor>
<connor> And they looked at me like,
"Why did you ask that question?" </connor>
<connor> And they told me to go and
take a break for 20 minutes. </connor>
<joey> - It was like George Orwell, wasn't it? </joey>
<connor> - I was like what do you mean? </connor>
<connor> - Dystopia, everyone has to smile. </connor>
<joey> - I was like, </joey>
<joey> "What do you mean I'm
not fucking smiling mate, </joey>
<connor> I'm making a fucking
burger, what do you mean?" </connor>
<connor> I couldn't believe it, I was furious. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, it's like they're at home, </joey>
<joey> they make their own
sandwiches they're like, </joey>
<joey> "Shit, I forgot to smile." </joey>
<connor> - I couldn't believe it. </connor>
<connor> And so I was like 16 one time </connor>
<connor> and the one time when I was like, </connor>
<connor> I fucking hate it here, was
when they were talking to me </connor>
<joey> and these dudes were like 25
and they were bragging to me, </joey>
<joey> like both of them were
bragging to me about </joey>
<joey> how they were going to a
party in the school next to me </joey>
<joey> of like 16 year olds. </joey>
<joey> And I was like, "So you went to a party </joey>
<joey> full of 16 year olds?" </joey>
<joey> And they were like, "Yeah, it was sick." </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, "Why? </joey>
<joey> Why did you go to a party full
of 16 year old, you're 25?" </joey>
<joey> And they were like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, shit, I wanted to
get with the girls." </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "What?" </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> - Yikes. </joey>
<connor> - In the UK it's legal, 16,
but I was still like what? </connor>
<connor> What the fuck! </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, but still. </joey>
<connor> - And the only nice people
there were the ones above 40, </connor>
<joey> but at everyone near my age
was just the fucking worst. </joey>
<joey> And every time I had to
go and train someone, </joey>
<joey> so I was there for like three
months and after three months, </joey>
<joey> you're ready to train people, </joey>
<joey> you're a fucking McDonald's
veteran because you've lasted </joey>
<joey> more than 90% of the fucking
employees no joke because-- </joey>
<joey> - I believe that. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I believe that but it hilarious. </joey>
<joey> - Because they hire so
much, they over hire </joey>
<joey> because they know that
people are gonna like leave. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - Okay, so I was teaching this one guy </joey>
<joey> and he was clearly like,
just like not getting it, </joey>
<joey> you know, didn't wanna get it. </joey>
<joey> And I could tell he was
like, "Yeah, I'm not gonna, </joey>
<joey> I'm not gonna listen to this." </joey>
<joey> So about two hours into his
shift of me teaching him, </joey>
<joey> he goes, "I'm gonna get a smoke break." </joey>
<joey> He never came back, he just left. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> He just straight up left. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, he never came back. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> And then I had to do the
whole shift on my own, </garnt>
<garnt> then doing all this shit and
I was like, I went to my boss </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm like, "So, yeah,
he didn't come back." </garnt>
<garnt> - He just went for a smoke break and-- </garnt>
<connor> - He just went for a smoke
break about two hours ago. </connor>
<joey> - Dude he just pulled like </joey>
<joey> the dad leaving for a smoke thing. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that's what I was thinking. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> - He went to buy cigarettes
he never came back. </connor>
<joey> - He never came back and I was
like, "So what should I do?" </joey>
<joey> And they're like, "Oh, you're
just gonna work on your own." </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, "What? </joey>
<joey> What do you mean? </joey>
<joey> Like what do you mean?" </joey>
<joey> And this another time I was making, </joey>
<connor> it was the same guy actually, </connor>
<connor> it was the first hour of teaching him </connor>
<connor> and when you're-- </connor>
<garnt> - So what was the entire timeline? </garnt>
<garnt> How long did he work here
that you had to teach him for? </garnt>
<connor> - Three hours and a half
and he went for smoke break. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> But I had to keep working
because, and then I asked, </connor>
<joey> and this is really pretty bad, </joey>
<joey> I honestly, I could have fucking
sued McDonald's for this, </joey>
<joey> so when we were, this
really fucking hot oil, </joey>
<joey> it's like 400 degrees of ridiculous. </joey>
<joey> - Fry oil?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> It's ridiculously hot and
this asshole next to me, </joey>
<joey> I was like, "Yeah, just
gently put it in, you know?" </joey>
<joey> Next to me while showing him I'm like, </joey>
<joey> "So put the chicken nuggets in here." </joey>
<joey> And he fucking slams them in, right? </joey>
<joey> The oil went all over my hand, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yikes. </joey>
<garnt> - And then I asked could I go
and put it on the cold water </garnt>
<connor> to my boss and they were like,
"No, you gotta keep working." </connor>
<garnt> And I'm like, "What?" </garnt>
<connor> So I'm here fucking like crying in pain, </connor>
<connor> making these fucking burgers, right? </connor>
<garnt> And then-- </garnt>
<garnt> - And don't forget to smile. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah, don't forget to smile. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right, "Don't forget to smile." </garnt>
<joey> - I have a third degree burn. </joey>
<connor> - And so, about an hour later, </connor>
<garnt> it's finally my time
to get a break, right? </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm eating my burger
and you can see my hand </garnt>
<joey> is bright pink and like blistered. </joey>
<joey> And the other manager because of course, </joey>
<joey> there's multiple managers
in just one McDonald's. </joey>
<joey> The other manager comes
in and is mortified. </joey>
<joey> He's like, "What the fuck is that?" </joey>
<joey> He's like, "What happened?" </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, "Oh, I spilled oil on it." </joey>
<joey> And he's like, "Why didn't you
put your hand in the water?" </joey>
<joey> I was like, "Oh, because the
other manager said I couldn't." </joey>
<connor> And bear in mind I was
like 16, so yeah, you know, </connor>
<connor> I should have known that
I could have been like, </connor>
<garnt> "No, fuck you, I'm putting
my hand in the water." </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Again, when you're 16, if
the boss tells you to do- </garnt>
<garnt> - You do what you're told to do, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - You do what you do, right, of course. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And then he was mortified </garnt>
<connor> and the other boss got in so much shit </connor>
<connor> and they apologized to me profusely. </connor>
<joey> And then they like were
like, "Yeah, it's okay, </joey>
<joey> you don't have to come to
work tomorrow, it's all paid." </joey>
<joey> And I was like, "Wow,
that's so nice of them." </joey>
<joey> But I realized at the time they were just </joey>
<joey> like hoping I wouldn't
fucking try and sue them </joey>
<joey> 'cause I could have like-- </joey>
<joey> - You could have easily. </joey>
<connor> - I should have honestly. </connor>
<joey> - Honestly, it's some serious H&S problem. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, and then finally when I quit, </connor>
<connor> I quit prematurely
because I was just done. </connor>
<connor> My manager was a total bitch, </connor>
<connor> the store owner was
horrible, she hated dudes. </connor>
<connor> Like she would always
be so nice to the women </connor>
<connor> that are working there and, you know, </connor>
<connor> and whenever a guy did anything wrong, </connor>
<connor> she would absolutely like shit on you. </connor>
<connor> I know I'm talking so much sorry, </connor>
<connor> this is the last story I promise. </connor>
<joey> - I just can't get rid off
the fact that dude left off-- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, he fucking left. </joey>
<joey> - My mind was speed running McDonald's. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - It took me like eight months to realize, </joey>
<garnt> what he realized in two hours, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Like that's what I would be glad-- </garnt>
<connor> - That seemed disrespectful
at that point, right? </connor>
<joey> It's just like all
right, this isn't for me. </joey>
<joey> - Right, right. </joey>
<garnt> - I'ma head out, I'm out. </garnt>
<joey> - He just walked out of McDonald's place. </joey>
<joey> - He was like, you know
what, the reduced money </joey>
<joey> on the meals is just
isn't worth it, right? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause okay, you gotta admit, right? </joey>
<joey> I was the fucking king
when in school I was like, </joey>
<joey> "You on a lunch break? </joey>
<connor> I get half price off McDonald's
meals who wants to come?" </connor>
<connor> - I remember the cool
kids in school worked, </connor>
<garnt> whoever worked at the coolest place </garnt>
<garnt> and could get like the best
discount, the discount, </garnt>
<garnt> so whoever works in the
fucking gaming store, </garnt>
<garnt> they were the king. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, so I could be my
mate and in lunch I'm like, </connor>
<connor> "We can get a whole McDonald's
meal for two pounds, </connor>
<connor> wholemeal, any size you
want, treat yourself." </connor>
<joey> It was great, yeah, I
could have gotten fat. </joey>
<joey> So anyway, I'm working
like a shift, right? </joey>
<joey> And then I'd actually been
training to be a lifeguard, </joey>
<joey> I did all the stuff and I
applied to be a lifeguard </joey>
<joey> and, you know, when you work some place, </joey>
<joey> you put on a reference. </joey>
<garnt> I never, have you ever had this </garnt>
<garnt> where they actually contact the reference? </garnt>
<garnt> - No.
- [Joey] No. </garnt>
<connor> - I've never had that. </connor>
<joey> So I just thought it was like a myth. </joey>
<joey> I thought it was a bluff is like, </joey>
<joey> "Go on name someone, name someone." </joey>
<connor> - Fucking day to call me. </connor>
<connor> Name someone who we will
interrogate, I dare you. </connor>
<joey> So they actually fucking
called my McDonald's </joey>
<joey> whilst I was working my shift. </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> - So they do it and they come in like, </joey>
<joey> "So Connor are you looking
for other employment?" </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, "Why, what do you mean?" </joey>
<connor> "Because we just got a
call from their council </connor>
<connor> asking for reference you to be a lifeguard </connor>
<connor> what's up with that, you didn't tell us." </connor>
<connor> And I was like, in my head I'm like, </connor>
<connor> "Why do I have to tell you?" </connor>
<connor> Like fuck you, you pay me $4 an hour, </connor>
<connor> like what do I owe you? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, what are they gonna be, </joey>
<joey> like you can check out
but you can never leave. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, and I was like, "Oh, well, yeah. </connor>
<connor> I mean, I was looking for a better job." </connor>
<joey> And they fucking like flipped a switch </joey>
<joey> when I said a better job. </joey>
<joey> They were like, "What do
you mean a better job? </joey>
<connor> You think McDonald's is a bad job?" </connor>
<connor> And I was like, "Well, mean-- </connor>
<connor> - Yes. </connor>
<joey> - I'm looking around and I'm like, "Look." </joey>
<connor> - What surprised me is like </connor>
<garnt> how little self awareness they seem </garnt>
<garnt> to have over there, right? </garnt>
<connor> - 'Cause the thing is Garnt, </connor>
<connor> I don't wanna shit on some of these guys </connor>
<garnt> 'cause I know that I've met some managers </garnt>
<garnt> at McDonald's who are
genuinely like super nice guy, </garnt>
<garnt> they have such like, you know, </garnt>
<connor> they understand like it's a McDonald's. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But the managers at my
McDonald's they were like, </connor>
<connor> "What are you trying to say mate? </connor>
<connor> You trying to say my
managerial job is like a joke?" </connor>
<joey> And in my head I'm kind of
like, "Yeah, yeah, kinda." </joey>
<joey> - Yes, actually. </joey>
<joey> - Did you see the food safety thing, </joey>
<joey> we had to fill out a line
that was a joke come on." </joey>
<garnt> It's like, "Don't shit on the lettuce." </garnt>
<garnt> Obviously don't shit on the lettuce. </garnt>
<garnt> So the manager is really
pissed off, right? </garnt>
<garnt> The store owner is coming
in 10 minutes and he's like, </garnt>
<joey> "I want you to talk to the
store and explain yourself </joey>
<joey> when he comes in." </joey>
<joey> I'm like, are you serious, </joey>
<connor> I'm 16, so. </connor>
<joey> - They really didn't not
wanna make you leave at all. </joey>
<joey> - They really like fucking put
me through the wringer dude </joey>
<joey> for $4 an hour dude like
can you believe that? </joey>
<joey> So my mom wondered why I
fucking hated working here </joey>
<joey> and she was like, "No, you're just </joey>
<joey> over exaggerating Connor?" </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "No, it was awful." </joey>
<joey> So the manager, the store
owner comes in, right? </joey>
<joey> And they made me go and talk
to her in front of customers. </joey>
<connor> And she's rinsing me in
front of these customers </connor>
<connor> like shouting at me in
front of these customers. </connor>
<connor> And I thought that was like weird. </connor>
<connor> And then I was like about
to cry and I'm like, </connor>
<connor> "You know what, I quit." </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> I quit. </connor>
<garnt> - He said it, he said it. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm going for a smoke break. </garnt>
<connor> I'm gonna take my smoke break. </connor>
<connor> - My mom was so pissed off at me. </connor>
<joey> She was like you have like, </joey>
<joey> 'cause I'd actually been
accepted for the other job. </joey>
<joey> I had to be home like
a month and a half left </joey>
<garnt> before I start the
other job, she was like, </garnt>
<garnt> "I can't believe you
quit a month and a half </garnt>
<garnt> before your next job Connor </garnt>
<garnt> that's really like, what the fuck!" </garnt>
<joey> And I was like, "Mom, you don't understand </joey>
<joey> how awful this was." </joey>
<joey> - It's McDonald's. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, and like she
was just chewing me out </joey>
<joey> in front of these customers. </joey>
<joey> And like I was just like, </joey>
<joey> I'm not being paid enough to be humiliated </joey>
<joey> in front of these random people, right? </joey>
<joey> Like I don't, come on man. </joey>
<joey> Like I'm so fucking young. </joey>
<joey> - Did you smile the entire time? </joey>
<joey> - Yo, I was like, </joey>
<joey> I was just sitting down
like, "Okay, okay." </joey>
<joey> - Show a smile as you're
getting rinsed still, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, and as she was
just doing it, I go, </connor>
<connor> "All right, you know
what, fuck it, I quit. </connor>
<connor> Like I quit, I'm done, I'm
done, I'm not doing this. </connor>
<connor> I'll finish this shift
but I'm done after this. </connor>
<connor> I'm not doing this." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I never heard from them again. </connor>
<connor> And then yeah, I went there
like three years later </connor>
<garnt> after I'd like been killing it on YouTube </garnt>
<garnt> and then the manager, the one
who was a dick head was like, </garnt>
<garnt> "What are you doing now Connor?" </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, "Well, I'm kinda-- </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, what did you want to know? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, you know, I just got back from LA, </garnt>
<garnt> you know, I went to visit
my friends in Japan, </garnt>
<garnt> you know, I was just making, you know, </garnt>
<connor> I work when I want make my own hours, </connor>
<connor> you know, it's great, you know?" </connor>
<joey> - You should have just been like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, I eat at Burger
King pretty regularly." </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I just feel my tax rates is intense. </connor>
<joey> Damn, did you know that
tax rates is so high </joey>
<joey> when earn so much money. </joey>
<joey> Dude damn, that shit damn hurts man. </joey>
<joey> - Anyway I'm kinda moving forward. </joey>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, some of them were nice, </garnt>
<connor> but, yeah, everyone was an asshole. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, like
working in retail is like, </garnt>
<garnt> this isn't dissing anyone
who works in retail-- </garnt>
<garnt> - But it is hard. </garnt>
<garnt> - As someone who has
worked in retail before, </garnt>
<connor> you know, a lot of people in college </connor>
<garnt> or in high school they get
the first job normally works </garnt>
<garnt> in retail and it's normally just to fuel </garnt>
<garnt> whatever hobby they have or, you know-- </garnt>
<garnt> - Just look out for yourself man. </garnt>
<garnt> That's like this thing that I wish I did. </garnt>
<connor> Like, I wish I like just didn't roll over </connor>
<joey> because I was very obedient as a kid </joey>
<joey> and I didn't really like, </joey>
<joey> I was always just taught
like whatever the elders </joey>
<joey> or you know, the person
in charge says just do it. </joey>
<joey> They know best, right? </joey>
<joey> I don't know what the fuck
I was doing at McDonald's. </joey>
<joey> Like what the fuck was I doing there? </joey>
<joey> I had no idea what I
was doing half the time, </joey>
<joey> I just did shit. </joey>
<joey> And I, dude, oh my God. </joey>
<joey> I used to spend like, when they were like, </joey>
<garnt> "Go and get some fries
out of the freezer." </garnt>
<garnt> I used to spend like 10
minutes just sitting in there </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I was like, "Fuck,
dude, what am I doing, man?" </garnt>
<garnt> And it's so hot in the kitchen </garnt>
<connor> that when you get to the
freezer they're like, </connor>
<connor> "Who's near the fries?" </connor>
<connor> "Me, me, me." </connor>
<garnt> - You just had a fucking
existential crisis </garnt>
<joey> just getting fries. </joey>
<joey> - The McDonald's freezers
has become like a panic room. </joey>
<connor> - Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> - I would literally just go
there for like five, 10 minutes </connor>
<joey> as long as I can get away
with it and just sit there </joey>
<joey> and be like, "Fuck, fuck!" </joey>
<joey> - Imagine if you open up a freezer </joey>
<joey> and there's like three
other employees in there. </joey>
<joey> It's like everyone is just
trying to get to the freezer. </joey>
<joey> - I was so jealous there was this one dude </joey>
<joey> in this whole job was
just moving the crates </joey>
<connor> into the like freezer and
that was his whole job </connor>
<connor> and I'm like, "I want that guy's job. </connor>
<connor> Fuck being in front of a deep fryer man." </connor>
<garnt> That made my acne so bad. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh, fuck yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - I remember when I
was working at a Co-Op, </garnt>
<garnt> there would be all these
odd jobs I wish I could get. </garnt>
<garnt> Like there would be one guy's job was just </garnt>
<garnt> to fucking go outside and
collect all the trolleys </garnt>
<garnt> that people have taken to their cars. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh my God, I want that. </joey>
<garnt> - That's so nice because you just like, </garnt>
<joey> you don't have to interact
with anybody, right? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- That's the best job. </garnt>
<joey> - 'Cause I was always on the table, right? </joey>
<joey> And my least favorite part of the job was </joey>
<joey> when anyone would like
try to make small talk. </joey>
<joey> I was like, "Look, I'm just
here to fucking stand here </joey>
<joey> and take your money, why are
you trying to talk to me? </joey>
<garnt> I don't give a shit
about how your day is." </garnt>
<garnt> - Just talk to, beep, beep, nope. </garnt>
<garnt> - I got that smile talk as well </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause like when they talk
to you, you gotta smile </garnt>
<garnt> and you gotta be having a good day </garnt>
<connor> no matter what's going on. </connor>
<garnt> And I just be like, I don't know, I would, </garnt>
<garnt> I didn't have like any bad
experiences with the customers, </garnt>
<garnt> but I mean, yeah, I had some
like fucking awful managers. </garnt>
<connor> - What's up with those cashiers, right? </connor>
<connor> Where they would like take
fucking joy out of idying you. </connor>
<joey> What's up with that, you know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> Like if you just give your ID-- </joey>
<joey> - I'm violating my power. </joey>
<joey> - It's like literally
like I'm being pulled over </joey>
<joey> by the cops and the ID
you for like a beer. </joey>
<joey> It's like, "ID please." </joey>
<connor> (police sirens wailing) </connor>
<joey> - 'Cause that moment in time,
they have all the power. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, they look at the ID
like, "Hmm, nice address. </connor>
<connor> That's a nice area to live in." </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> - Like I hate that, like every time, </joey>
<joey> like 'cause in Australia, right? </joey>
<joey> Like whenever you go to a bar </joey>
<connor> or when you're going to the liquor store, </connor>
<connor> they have to ID like everybody </connor>
<garnt> even if you clearly look like-- </garnt>
<garnt> - You have to at least reached
age 25 I think is legal. </garnt>
<joey> - I remember like, I went
to a bar with my dad once </joey>
<joey> and my dad got IDed. </joey>
<joey> And I remember he was
like, obviously the IDed me </joey>
<joey> 'cause I was like 22
or whatever obviously, </joey>
<joey> but then guy looked at my dad
and was like, "ID please." </joey>
<connor> My dad straight up said,
"Are you fucking kidding me? </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> Do you know how many gray
hairs I have on my face. </connor>
<connor> Of course, I'm not fucking 20 years old." </connor>
<connor> And I think he was like,
"All right, fair enough." </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> I hate that though. </connor>
<joey> Like it's the movement of
looking down at your ID </joey>
<joey> and then just looking at you
with their eyes like this, </joey>
<joey> it's that movement, I'm like, </joey>
<joey> "What, is this fucking L.A Noire? </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - I would hate the process </garnt>
<garnt> whenever I was working Co-Op
and I had to ask for ID </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I was 16 at the time as well. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> For me, it just felt wrong
asking someone for ID </garnt>
<connor> when I was obviously
like younger than them. </connor>
<connor> So anytime I'd have to
ask for ID there'd be like </connor>
<connor> most nervous stutter
like it would be like, </connor>
<connor> it would be like as if
like the power dynamic </connor>
<connor> is like the other way around. </connor>
<connor> So I'd be like, "Okay, can, can, can, </connor>
<garnt> can I have, have, have your ID please?" </garnt>
<garnt> And honestly, like, if
they gave him their ID, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just like, "Okay,
they probably over age." </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - You didn't even check it, yeah? </garnt>
<garnt> Oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> - I didn't have the
balls to ask my manager </garnt>
<garnt> to come check this man. </garnt>
<joey> - Can you check this guy's ID please? </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - If they've gone through the
trouble of getting the fake ID </connor>
<connor> just give it them the
fucking beer, why not. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, no, it was like, remember
your 18th birthday though? </garnt>
<garnt> The first time you go to buy
like a fucking bottle of beer. </garnt>
<joey> - I admittedly, I don't
remember my 18th birthday </joey>
<connor> for numerous reasons. </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> - I don't remember what I did,
but I do remember being like, </connor>
<connor> yeah, being able to finally buy a bottle. </connor>
<garnt> - I remember that first
point or that first beer </garnt>
<connor> as an adult and I was like, </connor>
<joey> it was like the biggest
fucking empowering power trip </joey>
<joey> that I've liked, </joey>
<garnt> that I had felt in my 18
years of living until then. </garnt>
<connor> - I was living life on the
edge before that, you know? </connor>
<joey> - Hey there boys and
girls, it's me, Mr. Titi. </joey>

hold myself last time. </joey>

<joey> Back to the video, wee. </joey>
<connor> - So anyway, let's move
on to the actual topic </connor>
<connor> of this episode. </connor>
<joey> - That was a very long tangent. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, 50 minutes tale
only on Trash Taste. </garnt>
<joey> - I've seen the sub-Reddit,
people are like, </joey>
<garnt> "Just make a whole episode of tangents." </garnt>
<connor> So, I don't know. </connor>
<garnt> - That's kind of what
just happened, right? </garnt>
<connor> We went from anime Cels to
McFlurries to McDonald's. </connor>
<joey> - One can argue like, </joey>
<joey> "What is even the tangent anymore, right?" </joey>
<connor> - I was going through my bag, </connor>
<connor> do you have stuff like
fucking papers in your bag </connor>
<joey> that just crushed down that you're like, </joey>
<joey> "What the fuck is in this shit?" </joey>
<joey> Then you finally like claw
it out and you're like, </joey>
<garnt> "God, that's disgusting." </garnt>
<garnt> But I pulled one out and it
was like an Anime Expo pamphlet </garnt>
<joey> from when I went to Anime Expo. </joey>
<joey> - Really? </joey>
<joey> - And I was like </joey>
<joey> (growling) </joey>
<connor> I miss Anime Expo so much. </connor>
<garnt> - I missed anime conventions. </garnt>
<garnt> - So much man. </garnt>
<garnt> - I miss large crowds. </garnt>
<garnt> - I miss getting sick from all
the people fucking coughing </garnt>
<garnt> and sneezing on me. </garnt>
<garnt> - I never thought I'd miss Kahn flu. </garnt>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I just wanna be sneezed on
and don't worry about dying. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I just wanna handshake with like </connor>
<garnt> the sweatiest weebs at the time. </garnt>
<garnt> - I wanna hug that's a little
too damn for my life in there </garnt>
<garnt> and just like, you
know, I miss it all man. </garnt>
<connor> - I wanna to put my hand on a shoulder </connor>
<joey> and the shoulder is really
wet for some reason. </joey>
<joey> - I miss going into the gaming room </joey>
<garnt> and just feeling like the
dampness of the atmosphere. </garnt>
<joey> Like the fucking, I don't know what it is </joey>
<joey> about the gaming room and-- </joey>
<garnt> - 'Cause everyone is
sweating in there that's why. </garnt>
<connor> - It's all the men from all
the players accumulating. </connor>
<connor> - It's all the game of you. </connor>
<garnt> - Like the fucking room
needs its own weather report, </garnt>
<connor> you know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> Like a humidity report. </connor>
<garnt> - There's mushroom, cloudy. </garnt>
<joey> - There's always mushrooms growing </joey>
<joey> in that room by the way. </joey>
<connor> - 92% humidity. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, but let's talk
about the actual topic </joey>
<connor> of this episode, which is
funny or weird conventional. </connor>
<garnt> - Just conventions period. </garnt>
<garnt> - Just conventions, just conventions. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because like I've been
seriously craving conventions. </garnt>
<connor> - Honestly, I never thought
I would miss conventions. </connor>
<connor> - I need it.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, like I think I hit
a new low the other day guys </connor>
<connor> 'cause being stuck in
the country, you know, </connor>
<connor> I'm very used to, you know, flying out </connor>
<joey> and going to conventions and stuff, </joey>
<joey> so like Casey Neistat video
started getting recommended </joey>
<joey> to me of like him sitting
in like First Class seats-- </joey>
<joey> - Oh, I've watched them all. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, and then I watched one </connor>
<joey> and then I watched the entire
series because I just missed </joey>
<joey> the feeling of being in an airplane, </joey>
<garnt> so I'm just like, "God, I
wish that was me right now." </garnt>
<connor> - I think Garnt is like
in his chair reclining. </connor>
<connor> Oh, gosh, it so uncomfortable, I miss it, </connor>
<joey> I miss it so much. </joey>
<connor> - And every time Sydney
comes in you be like, </connor>
<joey> "Oh, beef please." </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> Just creating your own turbulence. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> It's like this is fun. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, so--
- I remember, I think it was, </joey>
<joey> I don't remember whether
it was last episode </joey>
<joey> or the episode before, but
you were talking about like, </joey>
<joey> this is the longest period
I've ever been like, </joey>
<joey> that I've spent not being on a plane. </joey>
<joey> And so many comments on the
sub-Reddit are being like, </joey>
<joey> "Wow, that was the most
privileged Connor has ever said." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it's true, I did dig that. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> - But it's true like-- </joey>
<joey> - No, because, you know, even, you know, </joey>
<joey> I didn't come from a very
privileged background, </joey>
<joey> but it's just part of coming from </joey>
<joey> an international background,
I would say because, </joey>
<joey> I mean, you know, I'm full of
like, my full blood is Tai, </joey>
<joey> but I was raised in England. </joey>
<connor> So any chance we could get
to fly back home to Thailand, </connor>
<joey> we did and that was just part of my life. </joey>
<joey> You know, every year I'd
go back and visit grandma </joey>
<joey> and visit my family there. </joey>
<joey> - Of course, Sydney is
from America, right? </joey>
<garnt> - Sydney is from America as well. </garnt>
<connor> - America as well, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Good privilege reflect Garnt. </joey>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - I'm not privileged, I'm blessed. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> Yeah, but like, I don't know, like, just, </joey>
<joey> it made me miss, like this year, </joey>
<joey> which is the lack of conventions
because I thought at least </joey>
<joey> that like maybe there might be
like some smaller conventions </joey>
<joey> that we could go to hear. </joey>
<joey> Because in the back of my head </joey>
<joey> like just the other day, I was like-- </joey>
<joey> - Is it same though in Japan? </joey>
<connor> Like I miss the kind of
scummy atmosphere in America-- </connor>
<joey> - Oh, no, no, of course, but I
mean, like, yeah, I get that. </joey>
<connor> But I mean, I've been to a
few conventions in Japan, </connor>
<connor> it's still pretty
fucking fun because like, </connor>
<connor> just the other day in the
back of my head I was like, </connor>
<garnt> "Well, I'm probably stuck
in Japan until what? </garnt>
<garnt> At least the end of April I think </garnt>
<garnt> the Japanese government said. </garnt>
<garnt> So in my head I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh, that means I can go to
winter Comic Con finally." </garnt>
<joey> But then I was like, "Wait,
can I just like go away?" </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "Fuck!" </joey>
<joey> The one time I can go to winter Comic Con </joey>
<joey> and winter Comic Con it's not happening. </joey>
<garnt> - Exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - That fucking sucks, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - What about all the stories
I heard about Comic Con </garnt>
<garnt> is just basically it's you go
in and you buy the merchandise </garnt>
<garnt> or buy the Doujinshi or whatever </garnt>
<garnt> and then you leave, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> - That's what I heard, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, it's not like
the convention experience </garnt>
<joey> that we have in America. </joey>
<joey> - Think of Anime Expo or any convention, </joey>
<joey> but the entire convention
is the artist alley </joey>
<connor> that's what Comic Con is. </connor>
<connor> It's just a stupid amount
of just tables and desks </connor>
<garnt> where Doujin artists are
selling their Doujins </garnt>
<garnt> or other similar art.
- Honestly though, </garnt>
<garnt> honestly, I remember when, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> when you first go to conventions, right? </garnt>
<joey> I remember like the first
conventions you go to </joey>
<joey> I tried to go to every panel, </joey>
<joey> I have a fucking full on
schedule where I'm gonna be like, </joey>
<joey> "Okay, this is the time
going to the panel, </joey>
<joey> this is the time I'm gonna
hit like the artists alley, </joey>
<joey> this is gonna be the
time where hit up like </joey>
<joey> the convention floor and everything." </joey>
<joey> And now you go to enough conventions </joey>
<joey> and you're just like whatever man. </joey>
<garnt> - And then your occupation is just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Let's go to Chick-fil-A." </garnt>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I've never been to a
panel that isn't my friends </connor>
<joey> or my own. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah , me neither. </connor>
<connor> - I've never liked just
seen a panel and be like, </connor>
<connor> "That looks fun, I'll go." </connor>
<connor> Like I just don't like I'd rather eat. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> Eating is great, but-- </garnt>
<joey> - I probably go hang out with people. </joey>
<joey> - Now my favorite place to
go in the actual convention </joey>
<joey> is probably the artist alley
because the artist alley, </joey>
<joey> when I first started going was the place </joey>
<joey> that I never hit up. </joey>
<joey> And then now you go to enough conventions, </joey>
<joey> and you live in Japan as
well, and you go to like the, </joey>
<joey> the main hall and most
of the stuff you can find </joey>
<joey> in the main hallways is like synonymous </joey>
<connor> across all conventions, but
I feel like artists alley </connor>
<joey> is where you find all
the actual cool shit. </joey>
<garnt> - That's the thing, right? </garnt>
<joey> It's like the only,
usually with conventions </joey>
<joey> the only thing about a
convention a lot of the times </joey>
<joey> that's completely different
to any other convention </joey>
<joey> is the artist alley
because you'll always find </joey>
<garnt> some fucking artists or
whatever where you say, </garnt>
<connor> "Oh shit, I've never seen that before." </connor>
<joey> Because you go down like
to the regular thing </joey>
<joey> and as you said, it's like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, I could just fucking buy this Oikawa </joey>
<garnt> for like a third of the price, </garnt>
<garnt> so it's just like what's the point? </garnt>
<garnt> - And the thing is especially
being with Trash Taste, </garnt>
<joey> I've realized how limited my wardrobe is, </joey>
<joey> like cycling through
all the T-shirts I have </joey>
<joey> because most of the time, </joey>
<joey> every time I go to an anime convention, </joey>
<joey> I buy like two or three
T-shirts from the artists alley. </joey>
<joey> So just just because I haven't gone </joey>
<joey> to any convention this year, </joey>
<joey> I haven't been able to
recycle any of my new clothes </joey>
<garnt> or anything like that. </garnt>
<garnt> - I saw a comment that
was like, "Oh my God, </garnt>
<connor> Connor is wearing the
same shirt that he wore </connor>
<connor> in episode like two." </connor>
<connor> And it's like Episode 19 I'm like, </connor>
<connor> "How many fucking shirts do you own? </connor>
<connor> Do you expect me to throw
them away when I'm done? </connor>
<connor> - I still haven't worn the same shirt yet. </connor>
<connor> - What? </connor>
<connor> - Because now that it's getting cold, </connor>
<connor> I can finally bust out my long sleeves. </connor>
<connor> So I'm like, "Thank God I was about </connor>
<joey> to run out of my short sleeved T-shirts. </joey>
<joey> - I wore one shirt like a lot recently </joey>
<connor> and I got a fucking comment that was like, </connor>
<connor> "Why are you always wearing that shirt?" </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "You never heard
of a fucking laundry machine </connor>
<connor> or washing machine, like what
the fuck, what do you mean? </connor>
<connor> Like why am I always
wearing the same shirt?" </connor>
<connor> - It's like what do you wear a shirt once </connor>
<joey> then you throw it away? </joey>
<connor> - Like you don't wash
your shirts, I'm confused, </connor>
<connor> why is this weird, I don't understand. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, but I mean, like
that's all they see, right? </joey>
<connor> - True, true, true. </connor>
<connor> - A week span on Trash Taste might as well </connor>
<joey> just be a day to them. </joey>
<joey> - It's made me self conscious about </joey>
<garnt> just how many clothes
I have in my wardrobe </garnt>
<garnt> and how many shirts I can get away with </garnt>
<garnt> without recycling the
same thing too many times </garnt>
<joey> that people can notice, but-- </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, especially with you
because you very rarely, </garnt>
<joey> like actually make a physical appearance </joey>
<garnt> in your videos, right?
- Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - So you don't have to care about it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Normally, I don't care about this shit. </garnt>
<joey> Normally, I'm just a
fucking disembodied voice. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, who knows,
Garnt might be butt naked </joey>
<joey> when he's filming the
audio form you never know. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> - I'd like to hope so anyway,
anyway back to convention. </connor>
<joey> - Yes, this ends with by the way. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> Back to conventions. </joey>
<joey> All right. I mean, fuck, what should we, </joey>
<connor> we should talk about
questions, funny stories. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, like just, I
guess, memorable story. </connor>
<joey> It doesn't necessarily have to be funny, </joey>
<garnt> but just like some memorable stories. </garnt>
<garnt> - Would like a convention survival guide. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean we could do that.
- Sure, sure. </joey>
<joey> - I'm sure we'll keep
working up stories that way. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know, I feel like, you know, </joey>
<joey> here's the real privilege lads, </joey>
<joey> I have never, I've only
gone to like one convention </joey>
<joey> like not as like a guest or like, </joey>
<joey> before I was a YouTuber essentially. </joey>
<joey> So I feel like my experience
of Connor is like, </joey>
<garnt> vastly different from other people's like, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause like I feel like as
an attendee AX is like-- </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Here he goes, here he goes. </garnt>
<garnt> - I guess, okay, when you hear the lines </garnt>
<garnt> are like five hours to get in, </garnt>
<garnt> and I mean, let's be honest,
we can apply for the badge </garnt>
<garnt> that just lets us like walk in, right? </garnt>
<connor> We can just walk right in. </connor>
<connor> - Or we can just jump right into it. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, we can jump right into the pit. </garnt>
<joey> - I'm not gonna lie, </joey>
<joey> if you told me I had a line
of five hours to get to AX, </joey>
<connor> I'd be like, "Nah, I'm going home." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- I'm going home. </connor>
<garnt> - What I don't understand
about some people in AX </garnt>
<garnt> is the people who are
willingly waiting three hours </garnt>
<garnt> to get to a panel.
- Oh, fuck that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, like a premiere
or something like that. </garnt>
<connor> And I'm just thinking,
you know, I like anime, </connor>
<joey> but that shit is gonna be
on Crunchyroll like a month. </joey>
<joey> I can wait a month, you know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> I don't need to be at the
premiere, unless it's like, </joey>
<garnt> you know, I get a pass or something. </garnt>
<garnt> - What was it the My Hero
Academia movie last year </garnt>
<joey> or the year before had like a
four hour line or something? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Something ridiculous
like that, I'm like, </garnt>
<connor> "Guys, it's gonna it's
gonna be on Crunchyroll </connor>
<connor> in like two weeks. </connor>
<connor> - The only reason I watched
the Promare movie was </connor>
<joey> because someone from GKIDS
and Trigger got me in. </joey>
<joey> I was like, I'm not queuing four hours. </joey>
<connor> Are you kidding me, no, way." </connor>
<connor> I don't care you could be like
the second coming of Christ </connor>
<connor> and I'll be like, "Five hour
long, nah, get outta here man." </connor>
<connor> - Do you know how many Chick-fil-A's
I can get in that time? </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Do you know how many beers
I can drink in five hours? </connor>
<connor> Like come on, man. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - I gotta have a good time and five hours. </connor>
<connor> - You could just go down
to the fucking bar or park, </connor>
<connor> which is what I spend most my
time doing now at conventions. </connor>
<joey> Just like talking to different people </joey>
<connor> and catching up with different people </connor>
<connor> 'cause that to me is the real
conventionalizing experience. </connor>
<connor> There's the convention itself, </connor>
<connor> but after I'd say about
two conventions I was like, </connor>
<garnt> "I just rather just talk to people </garnt>
<garnt> or I just talk to other animators </garnt>
<garnt> rather than going to the
actual convention itself. </garnt>
<connor> - Do you ever try and get
people in to staff with you </connor>
<connor> if they don't have like the badge? </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah, all the time. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, I love like
seeing like right, bullshit, </connor>
<connor> all right, he rides with me, he's with me. </connor>
<connor> He just got back pass. </connor>
<connor> - Like VIP access. </connor>
<garnt> Yeah, you with me. </garnt>
<joey> - You wanna like-- </joey>
<connor> - He's like, "My friend and
what's your name again?" </connor>
<connor> - John.
- Yeah, John. </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - "I thought you were like four friends?" </joey>
<joey> You're like, fuck here
we go I got Trump balls, </joey>
<connor> "Yeah, they're all part of the Japanese-- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, security guards. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, you like think of
some bullshit on the thing </connor>
<connor> and then like- </connor>
<joey> - I have four managers. </joey>
<joey> - You gotta hope, like I think the problem </joey>
<joey> is with some conventions
like AX that problem is, </joey>
<joey> not my problem good thing for me, </joey>
<connor> they've so many volunteers,
the volunteers don't know shit. </connor>
<connor> So you can just bullshit to them like, </connor>
<connor> "You're in line, you're
with me, it's cool, cool. </connor>
<joey> Get her in, get her in." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, if anything at Anime Expo, </joey>
<joey> I've found that there's
always at least one volunteer </joey>
<joey> who knows who I am. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, they'll let you in.
- They just let me in. </joey>
<joey> They're like, "Oh, Anime Man I follow you, </joey>
<joey> come in bro, come in. </joey>
<joey> Oh, yeah, you have five
other people behind you, </joey>
<joey> come in fuck it, you're probably
friends with them, right? </joey>
<joey> - And they'll ask you to take a picture </joey>
<connor> and while you're like
smuggling your friend in. </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> I feel bad, you know, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - But I think one thing to </garnt>
<garnt> like nail down is the
difference between Anime Expo </garnt>
<garnt> and basically every other convention. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I feel like Anime Expo
exists in its own bubble. </garnt>
<connor> And I think like everyone
should experience Anime Expo </connor>
<garnt> for like once 'cause it's, </garnt>
<garnt> it's kinda like not even a
convention at this point, </garnt>
<garnt> it's kinda like a convention
and a business expo </garnt>
<garnt> all at once, you know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> So you kinda get a
little bit of everything </garnt>
<garnt> and a little bit of nothing as well </garnt>
<garnt> because if you don't
plan yourself correctly, </garnt>
<garnt> then you just end up experiencing lines. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's a cluster fuck in every
sense of the worst, right? </garnt>
<connor> - Especially for like
some people who are like, </connor>
<connor> "Yeah, this is AX, good
I'm planning to go alone." </connor>
<joey> I'm like, "Do not go to AX alone." </joey>
<joey> I was like--
- Define good? </joey>
<joey> - I'm like, "You could
probably go to Comic Con alone </joey>
<joey> and probably make something out of it, </joey>
<garnt> but in AX everyone already
has that group with them, </garnt>
<garnt> so it's like-- </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like you don't have
enough time to hang out </garnt>
<garnt> with the group that you have already, </garnt>
<garnt> let alone hanging out
with like random ones, </garnt>
<garnt> you know what I mean?
- Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> Fuck, I just had like so many flashbacks </connor>
<garnt> of who I was hanging
out with random people </garnt>
<garnt> that went terribly wrong. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause okay, you've all been there, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Everyone goes to convention, right? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You know, you've gotta decide, </connor>
<connor> I really wanna go to this convention, </connor>
<connor> but fuck hotel rooms are expensive, </connor>
<connor> so it's like how many people
can I fit in this hotel room </connor>
<connor> to reduce it to a point
where I'm comfortable, right? </connor>
<joey> And we said this on my podcast where like, </joey>
<joey> if you're in charge the booking, </joey>
<joey> you get dibs on the bed, right? </joey>
<joey> So that's why I used to be
in charge of the bookings, </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "I'm getting the
bed, I'm getting the best bed. </joey>
<joey> I'm getting the key." </joey>
<joey> - All you guys are getting the floor. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause oh my God, if
the hotel doesn't ask you </joey>
<joey> how many keys you want, </joey>
<joey> it's like there's two
keys between six of you. </joey>
<joey> And it's like how do we-- </joey>
<joey> - How do we distribute? </joey>
<joey> - How do we decide who gets a key? </joey>
<joey> Like I book it, I book it. </joey>
<garnt> - The person with the key has the power. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<joey> - Because you can come and go as you want, </joey>
<joey> because there's nothing
worse than just sitting there </joey>
<joey> with all your bags being
like calling up your mate, </joey>
<joey> not fucking picking up and you're, </joey>
<connor> "I wanna go back to the hotel
room answer me you cunt." </connor>
<connor> - Like mobile service in the
conventional it's fucking-- </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God, awful.
- It's non existent. </connor>
<joey> - It's non existent.
- Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - You just basically gotta
pretend you're back into like </connor>
<joey> the fucking 18th century. </joey>
<joey> Like how do I contact Joey, </joey>
<joey> especially when you're in America, </joey>
<joey> we don't have American phones either. </joey>
<joey> Like I have a contract on my British phone </joey>
<joey> that gives me American
service which is usable </joey>
<garnt> in most places, but in like a convention, </garnt>
<garnt> you are getting like zero fucking service. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like a fucking
Greek marathon, right? </garnt>
<joey> You have to ask someone
to like can you run </joey>
<joey> to the outside of the convention </joey>
<connor> and tell Joey that I'm here. </connor>
<joey> It's like, "All right, I'll see you soon." </joey>
<joey> - Have you ever stayed in a room </joey>
<connor> with people who you're like, </connor>
<connor> "Fuck, I regret staying
in a room with them." </connor>
<joey> - Yes. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I'm not gonna name names. </connor>
<joey> - Can I name your name, all right fuck! </joey>
<joey> - I can't name my names, </joey>
<connor> but I mean, you stayed with
some Discord people, right? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, started with a
bunch of people on Discord </garnt>
<connor> and that was fucking nightmare. </connor>
<garnt> - That sounds like a nightmare. </garnt>
<joey> - It was fucking, I was like
the pseudo leader of the group. </joey>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - And there's just so
many fucking problems </connor>
<connor> and this is also when
I just started YouTube </connor>
<joey> and I hadn't formally met, I met you, </joey>
<joey> no, I met Sydney, I didn't get to see you, </joey>
<joey> but we were gonna hang
out we had planned to </joey>
<joey> and I hadn't met you yet, had I? </joey>
<joey> - I don't think so. </joey>
<joey> - So, this was kinda like, </joey>
<connor> I don't know how I was
like gonna make mates. </connor>
<connor> You know, I was planning
to hang out with you guys </connor>
<connor> for the majority of it. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, was this the first AX then? </connor>
<garnt> - The first AX I went to. </garnt>
<connor> - You spend most of your time with us. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- I remember that. </connor>
<connor> - So I told the people
I was staying with like, </connor>
<connor> "Hey, this is like straight
up just like a room thing. </connor>
<joey> I'm gonna be hanging out with other people </joey>
<joey> like for like 99% of this." </joey>
<joey> Told them that like many times. </joey>
<joey> I think like one of them
didn't quite get the memo </joey>
<joey> and he was like really hoping
that I would introduce him </joey>
<joey> to like everyone and be like, </joey>
<joey> "Yo, he's my best mate, he's heeeey." </joey>
<joey> And the more nos, he was a fucking creep. </joey>
<joey> So like, I didn't even
wanna hang out with him. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And it wasn't like, at
first he was a little strange, </joey>
<garnt> you know, he was an American </garnt>
<garnt> and he was like a military dude. </garnt>
<garnt> And in my experience
military dudes are like 50/50 </garnt>
<garnt> on whether they're like totally chilled </garnt>
<connor> or fucking psychotic. </connor>
<connor> - I actually totally agree. </connor>
<garnt> I've met so many military dudes
and there is no in between. </garnt>
<connor> - There's no in between. </connor>
<connor> - Either they're a fucking psycho </connor>
<connor> or they're the most chillest
dude you can ever imagine. </connor>
<garnt> - Everywhere I've met
it's always like that. </garnt>
<connor> It's like they're no chill.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So he's like kinda nice,
you know, he's a little weird. </connor>
<connor> And like one time I remember
I met you at a party </connor>
<joey> and then like he was
texting me the whole time </joey>
<joey> and I think I mentioned where </joey>
<joey> and I was actually leaving this party. </joey>
<joey> Do you remember this?
- Yeah, I remember this. </joey>
<joey> - We go outside and he's
waiting there at like 1:00 a.m., </joey>
<joey> he's like, "Hey, Connor how
are you doing man, can I join?" </joey>
<joey> And we're like getting
an Uber and I'm like, </joey>
<joey> "No, man, we gotta Uber somewhere else. </joey>
<joey> I'm really sorry, man." </joey>
<joey> 'Cause it's like how do you introduce, </joey>
<joey> it's like kinda creepy 'cause
everyone has already seen </joey>
<joey> that he's waiting outside, it's
really creepy and it like-- </joey>
<connor> - It's the over enthusiasm, right? </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause the thing about anime conventions </garnt>
<garnt> that's so difficult for a lot of people </garnt>
<garnt> to like wrap their heads
around is just like, </garnt>
<joey> what is socially accepted,
you know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> - Social rules are thrown
out the window definitely. </joey>
<joey> - When you don't know someone, </joey>
<connor> I think it's like a social rule </connor>
<joey> when you shouldn't be
bringing your friends in, </joey>
<joey> unless you have like a reason to. </joey>
<joey> But if you don't, like okay, </joey>
<joey> if you bring someone into a friend group </joey>
<joey> and that guy is an asshole
or a creep that's on me. </joey>
<garnt> - That's on you.
- That's on me. </garnt>
<garnt> I brought him in.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I didn't know him </garnt>
<joey> and I got kind of signs
that he was a creep. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So I didn't wanna bring
him in 'cause I was like, </joey>
<joey> if I bring him to this party </joey>
<joey> and he starts like fucking
chatting up Gigguk all night </joey>
<joey> like, "Hey, man, I love your
videos can we take a pic </joey>
<joey> and can I smell your penis?" </joey>
<joey> Like, you know what I mean? </joey>
<garnt> It's like kinda looks terrible
on me, so I was like nah. </garnt>
<connor> - And the party was at my house or- </connor>
<connor> - Your Airbnb and there's like 10 of us, </connor>
<garnt> so it's really intimate. </garnt>
<garnt> So I told him I was like, "Listen, man, </garnt>
<connor> I'm really sorry dude, but I
don't really know like Garnt </connor>
<joey> or anyone in this group pretty
well, I would invite you, </joey>
<connor> I just don't feel comfortable doing it. </connor>
<connor> I explained to him and
he was so pissed off. </connor>
<connor> - He was pissed off? </connor>
<connor> - He was so pissed off. </connor>
<garnt> So then I came back at like
5:00 a.m. to my shitty hotel </garnt>
<garnt> and like, it's the suburbs
of LA and like it was-- </garnt>
<garnt> - It was like the Korea town, wasn't it? </garnt>
<garnt> - No, it's further away. </garnt>
<joey> It's like, even like further
out, it was really far out </joey>
<joey> and it was really sketchy, it was like a, </joey>
<connor> what is it called, it
wasn't even like a holiday, </connor>
<connor> it was one of the even
the more budget chains. </connor>
<connor> It was bad, it was really bad. </connor>
<connor> And at this hotel for
some reason at midnight </connor>
<connor> all the cards reset. </connor>
<connor> So if you came back after midnight, </connor>
<connor> you'd go to the front desk. </connor>
<connor> But the front desk wasn't open. </connor>
<connor> - All right, right. </connor>
<connor> - So if you came back after midnight, </connor>
<connor> you'd hope someone else
is already in the room </connor>
<connor> or just wait out your door till 6:00 a.m. </connor>
<joey> till someone comes.
- What? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it's stupid. </joey>
<joey> So he was in the room </joey>
<joey> and he'd been like
drinking alone in his room </joey>
<joey> and I felt really bad, but so I'm like, </joey>
<joey> "Hey, man, let me in, let me in." </joey>
<joey> Whatever, you know, it's
like 5:00 a.m. like, </joey>
<joey> "Dude I really wanna fucking sleep." </joey>
<joey> So he opens the door and
comes out block, oh shit, </joey>
<joey> blocking the door so I couldn't get in. </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> - I'm like, "Yo, what the
fuck man like, let me in. </joey>
<joey> I wanna sleep it's 5:00 a.m. </joey>
<joey> and he's like absolutely hammered. </joey>
<joey> He's like, "Listen Connor,
I saw your call man. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> Why didn't let me in the party?" </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "Dude I'm so sorry
but not now man it's 5:00 a.m. </joey>
<joey> let me sleep."
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - We can talk about in the morning. </joey>
<joey> Dude, please let me
sleep and then whatever. </joey>
<joey> So then we slept whatever
finally he let me in, </joey>
<joey> but I thought it's weird that he was like, </joey>
<joey> I was ignoring him, I'm
trying to open the door, </joey>
<connor> he's blocking me and I'm
like, "What the fuck man? </connor>
<connor> Let me in, it's fine man, </connor>
<connor> I paid for this room let me sleep." </connor>
<joey> And like near the end one of
the other peoples in my room, </joey>
<joey> who was like a lot smaller and like, </joey>
<joey> I guess he thought they were cute </joey>
<garnt> and then they called me up and he's like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Hey, he just tried to
pay me to suck his dick." </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm like, "What the fuck!" </garnt>
<garnt> What the fuck! </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, "What is happening
in this hotel room?" </garnt>
<joey> - What?
- Yikes. </joey>
<joey> - And then I was like, </joey>
<garnt> "I'm so fucking glad
I didn't introduce you </garnt>
<garnt> to any of my friends if you
turn around asking people </garnt>
<garnt> to suck your dick for
money are you kidding me?" </garnt>
<garnt> So, needless to say I went to
the hotel room just explained </garnt>
<joey> to him like, "Hey, what the fuck man? </joey>
<joey> Don't do that you asshole? </joey>
<joey> Like this is my friend don't
make them uncomfortable." </joey>
<connor> And then he didn't do anything </connor>
<connor> and he went stayed somewhere
else like the last night </connor>
<joey> 'cause I was like, </joey>
<joey> "Dude, don't stay in this room with them." </joey>
<joey> And so, I've never stayed with
any random people on Discord </joey>
<garnt> that I've never met before ever again. </garnt>
<garnt> - I've heard so many horror
stories from Discord. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know what it is about Discord. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm gonna call it
like the Discord hotel. </garnt>
<garnt> Those never ever go right. </garnt>
<garnt> Like I've, 'cause even
like the best you can do </garnt>
<garnt> is have like a little bit of drama, </garnt>
<garnt> but there's never zero drama. </garnt>
<garnt> Nobody ever comes out
there with just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Yeah, everyone was just chilled, </garnt>
<garnt> we had the most chillest time, </garnt>
<garnt> everyone was understanding,
you know what I'm saying?" </garnt>
<garnt> - What is about everything
that's planned on Discord </garnt>
<joey> just ends up horrible? </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> What is it about? </connor>
<connor> - Because you can't like really
know who's weird on Discord. </connor>
<connor> Like the problem is, </connor>
<joey> is that you don't really
know how weird people are </joey>
<joey> until you meet them. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah.
- Exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> You also, it's doubly
true on Discord as well </garnt>
<connor> where you're here for this like, </connor>
<garnt> you're here for this
server, which is like solely </garnt>
<joey> where you talk about this one, </joey>
<joey> you know, common interests or whatever </joey>
<joey> and you you rarely talk
about your own personality-- </joey>
<garnt> - I just don't understand
the mentality though of like, </garnt>
<garnt> looking at a Discord group and being like, </garnt>
<joey> "Okay, there's three other people in here, </joey>
<connor> never seen their faces-- </connor>
<connor> - I didn't care 'cause I-- </connor>
<connor> - Never met them before, </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna stay in a room with
them over night, it's like-- </connor>
<joey> - 'Cause I was broke Joey
what do you want from me? </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Like at least like, you know,
hang out with them outside. </joey>
<connor> - I understand to all the
conventioner out there </connor>
<connor> who've done the same thing as me </connor>
<connor> 'cause you're broke as fuck! </connor>
<connor> Like you gotta do what you gotta do. </connor>
<connor> And plus, I knew I could
take care of myself. </connor>
<connor> Like I don't have time,
like I didn't worry, but I, </connor>
<connor> you know, if I hear like 18
year old girls that do it </connor>
<connor> and I'm like, whoa, with dudes, I'm whoa. </connor>
<connor> - I mean that's just
calling for a disaster. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, like it's a
recipe for disaster, right? </garnt>
<connor> Because I've only stayed in,
I've only gone to conventions </connor>
<connor> after I had like a full time job. </connor>
<connor> - Right, right. </connor>
<joey> - So even if it wasn't
like a great paying job </joey>
<joey> at least I could just
afford my own hotel room </joey>
<garnt> and stuff like that or like
just a really cheap motel room, </garnt>
<garnt> you know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> But if I had gotten before
I was like say 21, 22 </garnt>
<joey> when I was just a broke uni
student or just God, forbid, </joey>
<joey> like before even uni, </joey>
<joey> I can imagine so many horrible situations </joey>
<joey> that could have arose of this. </joey>
<joey> - Right, right. </joey>
<garnt> - Which kinda like there's no
real way to protect yourself </garnt>
<garnt> around that especially
if you're just roaming </garnt>
<garnt> with random people on Discord, </garnt>
<garnt> which is such a coin flip, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yes.
- And I would argue like, </garnt>
<joey> is the anime con really that worth it? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, it is.
- Honestly? </garnt>
<garnt> - Honestly, you know
what, all that weird shit </garnt>
<garnt> that happened to side that I
don't think I told you guys </garnt>
<joey> that whatever, but, yeah, I
mean, all of that weird shit </joey>
<joey> the side that I had to deal with, </joey>
<garnt> I'll fucking do it again easy. </garnt>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - But you'll fucking do anything. </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> - I mean, that was fun. </connor>
<connor> I mean, like the convention was fun. </connor>
<joey> That was a nuisance, but, you know, </joey>
<garnt> I mean, it's nice exercise
knowing that I can tell someone </garnt>
<garnt> to fuck off, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know, what, I
mean, it is what it is. </garnt>
<joey> I knew that when I did
that there was a chance </joey>
<joey> that it could go horribly wrong. </joey>
<joey> And it did go horribly wrong
and I learned my lesson, </joey>
<joey> but I'm not doing that again. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - But you said you would
if you have the chance? </joey>
<connor> - No, I mean, I said I
understand if, you know, </connor>
<connor> when you're like 18, </connor>
<connor> you got like 200 bucks max to your name. </connor>
<connor> The fare ticket is 50
bucks, you've gotta get </connor>
<connor> that hotel room down to 100 bucks somehow. </connor>
<connor> It doesn't matter how many
people are gonna go in that room. </connor>
<garnt> - You gotta divide the room
with the amount of bodies </garnt>
<connor> that will fit in it, you know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> If you need to sleep on the
floor, you sleep on the floor. </connor>
<joey> People who sleep on the
bed they pay a premium. </joey>
<joey> - Most of the time. </joey>
<joey> - Mostly it's like a fucking
human trafficking lodge. </joey>
<garnt> - Have you ever been to a
fucking convention room Joey? </garnt>
<garnt> Jesus Christ, like a fucking
bomb could go off in there, </garnt>
<garnt> it would be less messy. </garnt>
<garnt> Just like the amount of like, </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, if you've got
a cos player in there, </garnt>
<garnt> say goodbye to floor space, </garnt>
<connor> say goodbye to fucking floor space. </connor>
<garnt> - The same reason they are allergic </garnt>
<garnt> to closing their fucking suitcase </garnt>
<connor> 'cause it has to be wide
open the whole fucking time, </connor>
<connor> can't close it, okay, fine. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, I don't know, I mean, it's whatever. </connor>
<joey> You should try it some time. </joey>
<connor> - No, thank you, I can
afford my own hotel room. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> I good dude. </joey>
<joey> - For the frills, do you
fucking roll that dice </joey>
<joey> or do you just roll with it? </joey>
<joey> Who knows what story you'll get. </joey>
<garnt> - You gonna get through somehow, right? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, okay, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> I like I know this sounds like super, </connor>
<connor> I guess it sounds weird or
dangerous to some people, </connor>
<connor> I love just meeting new
people in that kind of way. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, look I don't mind
meeting new people either, but-- </connor>
<joey> - I don't mind meeting a new
person for the first time </joey>
<joey> in my hotel room. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I don't wanna pull a gotcha role </connor>
<connor> where I might end up, you know, </connor>
<connor> sleeping with a fucking
murderer, you know? </connor>
<joey> - I don't mind, I'll take that odd. </joey>
<connor> You might get the fucking
coolest friend for life </connor>
<connor> by doing that, you know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> - There's other ways to meet
cool friends for life man. </connor>
<joey> - But you get that fucking story </joey>
<connor> of we met at anime convention, right? </connor>
<connor> - That's what I'm saying. </connor>
<joey> You'll do anything to content. </joey>
<joey> - I love a-
- Spoken like a true YouTuber. </joey>
<connor> - I just know, I don't even
think of it as content, </connor>
<connor> I just love like the idea
of like making a friend </connor>
<joey> through such a weird
and unconventional way </joey>
<joey> where I feel like it makes
such a good friendship, </joey>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<joey> - I get that, but that's
another coin for me. </joey>
<joey> - I feel like I'm somewhere
in the middle of both of you </joey>
<joey> 'cause I do like meeting new people </joey>
<joey> and everything like that. </joey>
<joey> I used to be that guy who
was just like up for anything </joey>
<joey> and be like, "Yeah,
I'll go meet Donald like </joey>
<joey> in a dark alleyway whatever." </joey>
<joey> But like, I've had like enough
bad experiences to be like, </joey>
<connor> you know what, maybe I'll do
like a just a little bit of </connor>
<garnt> a background check before I
jump right into it, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, oh my God, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Met several people on
Discord who turned out </garnt>
<garnt> to be really sketchy.
- Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - I just gotta, there's
a lot of dudes on Discord </joey>
<joey> who like underage girls </joey>
<joey> and you just gotta call that shit out </joey>
<connor> when you see any signs of it, man. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I feel like a lot of, </connor>
<garnt> especially in anime conventions, </garnt>
<garnt> a lot of people especially
obviously like anime, </garnt>
<garnt> you know, anime fans and
weebs and everything, </garnt>
<connor> they don't have the
confidence to confront people </connor>
<connor> when they see some shit happening. </connor>
<connor> So I feel like with a
lot of convention stories </connor>
<connor> that I've heard, it's it's
mostly bogged down to people, </connor>
<connor> just people just didn't know
how to handle the situation </connor>
<connor> 'cause they've never seen
it happen in front of them. </connor>
<connor> And so the first time you experienced it, </connor>
<connor> you just kinda just freeze up to be like, </connor>
<joey> what is this happening
now, is this happening now? </joey>
<joey> You know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> And no matter what you tell yourself, </joey>
<joey> you're going to do at that moment, </joey>
<garnt> you're totally unprepared for that moment. </garnt>
<garnt> So I would say like, the
best advice I could give is, </garnt>
<garnt> if you see anything bad happening, </garnt>
<garnt> like don't let that shit lie, call it out. </garnt>
<garnt> - Also, especially if
they're your friends. </garnt>
<connor> Like I know a lot of people
who are like it's hard to like, </connor>
<joey> you know, call out your
friend and be like, </joey>
<joey> "Dude, what the fuck!" </joey>
<joey> You gotta call that shit out. </joey>
<joey> It's like if you let it slide,
they'll just keep doing it. </joey>
<garnt> - A good friend will call. </garnt>
<connor> - We gotta stop this shit out of community </connor>
<garnt> because we saw what happened
to this slash community, right? </garnt>
<garnt> And I don't know what's
happened behind the scene </garnt>
<garnt> of the anime community. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, yeah, I don't wanna imagine. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't wanna imagine it </garnt>
<garnt> because I wasn't part of the community </garnt>
<garnt> when some of the worst stories </garnt>
<garnt> that happened behind the scenes. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, yeah, we'd
like to see a YouTuber </garnt>
<connor> that I used to do stuff with </connor>
<joey> and I've had people on Discord
who I considered friends </joey>
<joey> who later on found out
that they'd like did </joey>
<joey> some fucking horrible stuff. </joey>
<joey> And like, honestly, there
were like, you know, </joey>
<joey> there were signs and I just ignored it </joey>
<garnt> 'cause I was like, "Oh, well,
I mean, I think, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> they're just quirky, they're
not gonna hurt anyone." </garnt>
<garnt> You just gotta call that shit out </garnt>
<garnt> when you see it unfortunately. </garnt>
<garnt> So even if it's your friend,
please call them out, </garnt>
<garnt> and bring them out. </garnt>
<garnt> - Especially if it's a friend, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> only through the internet
'cause, you know, we, </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, we all met through
the internet, right? </garnt>
<garnt> But I mean, we've also met in real life </garnt>
<garnt> and we've hang out so many times </garnt>
<garnt> before I've really knew
your guys' real personality </garnt>
<garnt> and everything like that, right? </garnt>
<garnt> So if it's some guy or some
girl you've met through </garnt>
<garnt> the internet, especially if
it's Discord or something </garnt>
<garnt> and you've only talked to
them through the internet, </garnt>
<garnt> meeting friends, making
friends on the internet </garnt>
<garnt> is completely fine, </garnt>
<garnt> but understand that
that's totally different </garnt>
<garnt> from being at friend Irl. </garnt>
<garnt> And until you've hang out Irl a few times, </garnt>
<garnt> you really can't have a true
grasp of their personality </garnt>
<garnt> and what they might be like. </garnt>
<garnt> - And that's why it's
always such a gamble, right? </garnt>
<joey> Like when you meet, </joey>
<joey> again, like when you meet
that person on Discord </joey>
<connor> and then you be like, </connor>
<connor> "All right, let's go to
a convention together." </connor>
<connor> And you'll be hanging out </connor>
<connor> with a completely different person. </connor>
<connor> You know, this is like,
"Oh, you weren't like this </connor>
<connor> when we were chatting on
Discord what the fuck!" </connor>
<garnt> And I've had a lot of
experiences like that </garnt>
<garnt> where I would be talking to someone online </garnt>
<garnt> and then I'd be like,
"Oh, you're going to AX, </garnt>
<garnt> oh, I'm going to AX as well,
let's meet up and hang out. </garnt>
<joey> And then I talked to them I'm like, "Wow!" </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - You aren't what I expected at all? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, you are not the same
person I texted two days ago." </joey>
<connor> Yeah.
- Man, fuck! </connor>
<connor> - For better or worse, right? </connor>
<connor> Sometimes they're way cooler in real life, </connor>
<joey> sometimes they're just
like, oof in real life. </joey>
<garnt> - And there's so many
social norms that you, </garnt>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> I don't know why, I get like-- </connor>
<connor> - Tell the all of the
dumb shit that's happened. </connor>
<garnt> - Common sense just doesn't
seem to like make sense. </garnt>
<garnt> Like common sense just isn't common </garnt>
<garnt> in anime conventions, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Especially when it comes to
like meeting people and stuff </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause you talked about, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> the introducing the one friend </garnt>
<garnt> to like your friend group or something. </garnt>
<garnt> What will happen if you're like, </garnt>
<joey> you're going to this party, right? </joey>
<joey> And you can be like, okay, </joey>
<joey> you can bring like this one friends </joey>
<joey> that you might wanna
kinda wanna introduce, </joey>
<joey> but they're with a group
of like five, six people. </joey>
<joey> And they're like, </joey>
<joey> "Can you like get all
these people in as well?" </joey>
<joey> And you're like, "Ugh!" </joey>
<joey> - What is it about these
people who are like, </joey>
<garnt> "Oh, plus one, also plus
one group of friends, right? </garnt>
<joey> That's what it means,
yeah, all right, cool. </joey>
<joey> I got like seven people back there." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it's hard 'cause
obviously I don't wanna be like, </joey>
<connor> yeah, you know, only
one person can come in, </connor>
<connor> but I also gonna have the
balls to do something like, </connor>
<connor> I'd be like, "All right mates, </connor>
<connor> I've got a sick invitation from a guy, </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna go to that, I
hope you'll understand." </connor>
<connor> Like that's what I would do. </connor>
<joey> I'll be like, "Hey, man,
I got an opportunity </joey>
<joey> that I don't really get come
across often, can I take it? </joey>
<garnt> Please, don't be mad at me." </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, I think
it's just understanding </connor>
<garnt> that it's a convention. </garnt>
<garnt> People, you know, you're
not always gonna hang out </garnt>
<garnt> with the same friend group all the time, </garnt>
<garnt> so I feel like if you, </garnt>
<garnt> if you have like some other
people you wanna meet, </garnt>
<garnt> then I feel like you just let them go. </garnt>
<garnt> Don't feel betrayed by
your friend hang out </garnt>
<garnt> with other people whatever. </garnt>

<garnt> So--

<connor> Speaking of inappropriate, </connor>
<connor> like the most inappropriate
thing happened to me </connor>
<connor> at a UK convention surprisingly. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, okay. </connor>
<connor> - I think I've told this
story like a million times, </connor>
<garnt> but fuck it we'll say it here again. </garnt>
<garnt> It's the one where like, </garnt>
<garnt> all right, I think I should
tell the story as it happened. </garnt>
<garnt> In order, naturally. </garnt>
<garnt> So I'm just finished with a panel, right? </garnt>
<garnt> You know, killed it, </garnt>
<garnt> answered all these questions like a boss, </garnt>
<garnt> I haven't heard that phrase in a while. </garnt>
<garnt> - Wow, was this 2004?
- Yeah, right. </garnt>
<connor> So and then when you're done
with the panel, you know, </connor>
<joey> I'm like, all right, I'll
take pictures outside, </joey>
<joey> you know, in the line. </joey>
<joey> So I'm taking pitches and
the first one comes up, </joey>
<joey> first girl, she's like 14, 13. </joey>
<joey> And I'm taking a picture
and she's like smiling like, </joey>
<garnt> "Hey, by the way, can I grab your ass?" </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm like-- </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, this one? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, I'm like, I'm like, "What? </joey>
<joey> What do you mean? </joey>
<connor> Do you know what you
just said little girl?" </connor>
<connor> And she was like, I was
like, "No, I think, no, no. </connor>
<joey> Why would you ask that? </joey>
<joey> Yeah, well, okay, whatever." </joey>
<garnt> So and then, you know, next picture, fine, </garnt>
<garnt> next picture fine and as I'm
taking this next picture, </garnt>
<garnt> I feel this like grip, like
a tightening on my ass, </garnt>
<garnt> but like, and its getting-- </garnt>
<garnt> - Alien space. </garnt>
<joey> - This grip, this grip,
gets like fucking iron clad </joey>
<joey> on my ass and then I'm like
turning around I was like, </joey>
<joey> "Hey, what the fuck!" </joey>
<joey> And then I said, oh,
because I turned around </joey>
<connor> and she's just like, like this. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> And I'm like what are
you doing in my head. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, ah, 'cause I'm like, </connor>
<connor> "How the fuck do I react to this?" </connor>
<joey> I don't wanna swat her away like a fly. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, begone.
- Don't. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> And so I was like, what the? </joey>
<connor> So she grabbed it and
then when I turned around, </connor>
<connor> she fucking ran off. </connor>
<connor> I was like, "What the fuck!" </connor>
<connor> And I'm looking at the
guy who's helping me out </connor>
<connor> and I'm like "Yo, what the fuck was that?" </connor>
<connor> He's like, "What the fuck!" </connor>
<connor> And he went to look after, like, go after, </connor>
<garnt> and to like toddle her off, but she went. </garnt>
<garnt> - How many years ago was this? </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like three or four. </garnt>
<garnt> - Is this like MCMs? </garnt>
<garnt> - No, this is like a
really small London one, </garnt>
<connor> the tiny one. </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause like a similar
thing happened to me at, </garnt>
<joey> it was some of the, one
of the early MCMs, okay? </joey>
<joey> - Right, right. </joey>
<joey> - And I was, so I was having a meetup. </joey>
<joey> And it was like, </joey>
<joey> it was like one of one
of my very first meetups </joey>
<joey> and it was just as I like, </joey>
<joey> just after I started dating Syd, </joey>
<joey> so it was like Sydney's first
UK anime convention as well. </joey>
<joey> And so I was having this meetup </joey>
<joey> and we were taking
pictures and everything. </joey>
<joey> And then this girl comes take a picture </joey>
<joey> and you can immediately
you can immediately tell </joey>
<joey> that she was not respecting
my personal boundaries, </joey>
<connor> she was very, very touchy feely-- </connor>
<connor> - They're the worst. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, and Sydney is
like raised her eyes, </connor>
<connor> lasered in on it immediately, right? </connor>
<connor> Immediately, I could feel
like the death Claire </connor>
<connor> on this girl without having
to look at Sydney, right? </connor>
<garnt> - Like in the middle of the fucking </garnt>
<connor> like Harry Potter Voldemort
like, "You wanna battle?" </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - So I know that Sydney
is watching everything </garnt>
<joey> and she's like being really
touchy feely and I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> I'm trying to just be like, </joey>
<joey> "Okay, you know, I have
my personal boundaries. </joey>
<joey> I'll take a picture and everything." </joey>
<joey> And so, we go in for the picture </joey>
<joey> and she like goes on
for like a full on hug. </joey>
<joey> It's like, I'm just there being like, hey, </joey>
<joey> and she just grabs me like
that and just hugs me. </joey>
<connor> And then I didn't need to
see where Sydney's face was, </connor>
<connor> but I could feel it, I could feel it. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> And then afterwards I'm like, </connor>
<garnt> "Oh, yeah, thank you for
coming to my meetup." </garnt>
<garnt> And she goes in for a fucking kiss </garnt>
<connor> and I had to like turn my cheek. </connor>
<connor> And I turn my cheek in time,
but she goes for my mouth </connor>
<joey> and then I turns-- </joey>
<joey> - She goes for your mouth? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, and she hits my cheek. </connor>
<connor> And then I just hear Sydney, </connor>
<connor> like I've never heard Sydney
make this noise ever again, </connor>
<garnt> but she fucking hissed. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - She's a fucking snake. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, she's like, "Ssssss!" </joey>
<joey> - What does it do? </joey>
<garnt> - I don't know and then
same, same as your girl, </garnt>
<garnt> she just fucking runs off
before I could say anything. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm just like, "What just happened? </garnt>
<garnt> What am I supposed to
do in this situation?" </garnt>
<garnt> - You know what the worse part was, </garnt>
<connor> when I got home that day,
I go on fucking Twitter </connor>
<connor> and she replied to my tweet being like, </connor>
<connor> "Hi, I'm the girl who grabbed
your ass, it felt good." </connor>
<joey> And I was like, "First of all, thank you. </joey>
<joey> Second of all, what the fuck! </joey>
<joey> What the fuck!" </joey>
<joey> I was like, you know that's,
I reply, like be like, </joey>
<joey> "Dude, that was super
fucking inappropriate. </joey>
<joey> You shouldn't do that." </joey>
<garnt> And she was like, "Oh, I didn't realize." </garnt>
<connor> I'm like--
- I didn't realize? </connor>
<joey> - What the fuck you didn't realize, what? </joey>
<connor> - Like what kind of
family were you raised in </connor>
<connor> where it's like, oh, yes, hello, sir? </connor>
<joey> - What are you really doing </joey>
<joey> like fucking measuring your
foam every fucking day? </joey>
<joey> Why are you--
- Which year was this? </joey>
<garnt> - Oh shit, this must have
been like 2000, fuck, 16, 17. </garnt>
<connor> - That's the thing, right? </connor>
<joey> It's like, I feel like
'cause I have a similar story </joey>
<joey> that happened around that time. </joey>
<garnt> - You do?
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - What the fuck! </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, well, my mine was in about 2016. </joey>
<joey> - We all fucking survived
something here, God damn. </joey>
<joey> - Mine was around like 2017, it was at AX. </joey>
<joey> And this is, I had just like,
started going out with Aki, </joey>
<joey> but this is before we went public. </joey>
<joey> So this is like the
convention that I met Aki </joey>
<joey> and that was like two days,
like literally two days </joey>
<joey> after we decided like, "Okay,
let's start going out." </joey>
<joey> And we were doing a signing together. </joey>
<joey> This fucking girl comes up to
me and she's dressed in like, </joey>
<joey> I think it was like Monica
Michael* or something, </joey>
<joey> but she had like a giant wand, right? </joey>
<joey> Like a massive like stuff
and she puts it down </joey>
<connor> and she's like, "Hi, Joey." </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "Oh, no, it's
one of these kinds of girls." </connor>
<joey> All right, "Hey, what's up?" </joey>
<joey> And she's like, "Can you sign the stuff?" </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "Yeah, sure." </joey>
<joey> I start signing it and then she's like, </joey>
<joey> "Also here's a question but
can I be an Anime Expo Waifu?" </joey>
<joey> And I just kind of stopped and-- </joey>
<joey> - How to trigger a flight
of anime, Jesus Christ! </joey>
<connor> - And the moment she said that, </connor>
<joey> I just kind of stopped
and looked up I was like, </joey>
<joey> "Could you say that again please?" </joey>
<joey> 'Cause in my head I'm starting to panic </joey>
<joey> and same with Sydney, right? </joey>
<joey> I could feel the fucking
glare of Aki right </joey>
<joey> on my fucking neck. </joey>
<joey> Like I didn't even have to look over, </joey>
<joey> like I know you're staring at me. </joey>
<connor> And of course right, I
have the pressure from here </connor>
<connor> and the pressure right
in front of me, right? </connor>
<connor> There's two women staring at me </connor>
<connor> for totally different reasons. </connor>
<joey> And I just fucking panic, all right? </joey>
<joey> I couldn't like, 'cause
at that point I was like, </joey>
<joey> I couldn't say like yeah sure jokingly </joey>
<joey> because my woman is fucking glaring at me. </joey>
<garnt> - The no right answer in that situation. </garnt>
<garnt> - But I also couldn't say no right </garnt>
<garnt> because I don't wanna hurt her feelings </garnt>
<garnt> and she lined up, you know,
all this time to like meet me. </garnt>
<joey> And so I just fucking panicked </joey>
<joey> and I said I don't know I got ranks. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Oh my God, Joey. </joey>
<connor> You didn't have to murder her like that. </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - I got ranks. </joey>
<joey> And then she replied back being like, </joey>
<joey> "Then can I come to the
top of the ranking?" </joey>
<joey> And then I said-- </joey>
<joey> - Girl you gotta learn to give up, man. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, and I was like,
"Ah, I don't know, man. </connor>
<joey> Like it takes time. </joey>
<joey> I was just bullshitting this entire time </joey>
<joey> and the moment she's like,
"Oh, okay no worries." </joey>
<joey> Again, tried to go in for a kiss </joey>
<joey> and I just fucking like dogged that shit, </joey>
<joey> so she only got me on the
chick and then she walked off. </joey>
<joey> And then Aki under her breath was like, </joey>
<joey> "What did you mean by ranks?" </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> I was like I'm sorry, I paniced. </joey>
<joey> What are you supposed to
say in that situation? </joey>
<joey> - There is no right answer, but-- </joey>
<garnt> - There was no right answer, </garnt>
<joey> but I definitely said the
most incorrect answer. </joey>
<joey> - That was definitely the wrong answer. </joey>
<garnt> - I felt so bad, I was like-- </garnt>
<joey> - Just politely decline and be
like, "Oh, thank you but no." </joey>
<connor> - I know, but like I was at that stage </connor>
<joey> where I like I really couldn't say no. </joey>
<joey> Like it was at that point </joey>
<joey> where I didn't know any better, right? </joey>
<joey> That was like probably like my
second signing session ever. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, you mean like the
story I told was Sydney </garnt>
<joey> where you don't know how
to react in the situation. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, you don't know how to react </joey>
<garnt> and because you don't wanna
like make them upset, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Because they've lined up all this time, </garnt>
<joey> you're like, "You fucking lined up for me? </joey>
<joey> Like I'm not anything special." </joey>
<joey> So like that was at the
point as well where like, </joey>
<joey> any absurd thing that they would request, </joey>
<joey> I would just fucking do it
just to make them happy. </joey>
<connor> So I remember like at this
like Canada convention, </connor>
<connor> the first dude that
came up to me was like, </connor>
<joey> "Can you sign my ass?" </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "Oh, okay." </joey>
<joey> And like I thought it was
like just his pants, right? </joey>
<garnt> This guy fully fucking
ducks like his pants off. </garnt>
<joey> Shows his-- </joey>
<joey> - In the middle of the
convention fucking booth? </joey>
<joey> - First dude in the line
plants his bear us on the table </joey>
<joey> and was like, "Sign here." </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - Did you fucking wipe
down this table afterwards? </garnt>
<garnt> Oh my God. </garnt>
<joey> - You gonna need some mad sanitation. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I mean, you know, there's
a bottle of hand sanitizer </joey>
<joey> in case of anything, </joey>
<joey> I just fucking emptied
this shit, sanitize. </joey>
<connor> - That's so disgusting.
- I know. </connor>
<joey> - I think I would vomit on his ass. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, so like I signed him making sure </connor>
<joey> not to actually touch his
ass like with my hand. </joey>
<connor> I did it and I was like-- </connor>
<connor> - I need one of those like
garbage picking up things </connor>
<joey> and just like fucking-- </joey>
<joey> - It's just the tongs. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, the tongs
like from far away. </garnt>
<joey> Wear like a radioactive
suit on, Jesus Christ! </joey>
<joey> - Like, you know, that again, </joey>
<joey> like that was the point where-- </joey>
<joey> - What is wrong with anime fans? </joey>
<joey> - I don't know.
- What the fuck! </joey>
<joey> - Like, I didn't know
any, and same convention </joey>
<joey> as the guy who planted his ass, </joey>
<connor> there was another girl who came up </connor>
<connor> and she looked really fucking-- </connor>
<connor> - Just what fucking convention was this? </connor>
<connor> - I think this was OtaKuthon in Montreal. </connor>
<connor> And then this girl came up, </connor>
<connor> looked and sounded really
fucking normal, right? </connor>
<connor> Until she said, "Can you sign my arm?" </connor>
<connor> And she had like, drawn out like a box </connor>
<connor> for me to sign on the arm. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, oh, that's kind of weird. </connor>
<garnt> I'm like, "I have a piece of paper." </garnt>
<garnt> And she's like, "No, no, I
want you to sign my arm." </garnt>
<garnt> So I was like, all right. </garnt>
<garnt> I just had a lot of people
to go through, right? </garnt>
<garnt> So I just fucking signed it for her. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm like, "Oh, do you
want like a piece of paper </garnt>
<garnt> for me to sign it on?" </garnt>
<garnt> She's like, "Oh, no, no, it's okay. </garnt>
<connor> I'm getting this tattooed." </connor>
<joey> And I was like, "Oh, no, no, no, no, no." </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> I did a really shitty job ass well. </joey>
<joey> This was like the most messed
up signature I've ever done. </joey>
<joey> I'm like "No, no, no, no, no, no. </joey>
<joey> Please don't do that, I'm begging you." </joey>
<joey> I actually said like, "I'm
begging you don't fucking do it." </joey>
<joey> And she's like, "Okay,
I'll think about it." </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "No, no, no,
no, don't think about it. </joey>
<joey> Just fucking, I don't know." </joey>
<joey> - Just don't do it. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know what it, like,
but that's the thing, right? </joey>
<joey> It's like, I don't know, if it's because </joey>
<joey> of my lack of experience of
being in situations like that </joey>
<joey> or just the fact that
conventions have gotten </joey>
<joey> so much more calm in
the last like five years </joey>
<joey> or it's a combination of both </joey>
<joey> because you don't hear that kind of shit </joey>
<joey> like last year, right? </joey>
<joey> - I mean, I feel like things are way </joey>
<garnt> more regulated now honestly. </garnt>
<joey> Because I remember first
time going to conventions, </joey>
<joey> like some of my first signings, </joey>
<joey> it was kind of like anything
goes, you know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> And like last year, they
had like a ticketing system </joey>
<joey> or maybe it was a year before that, </joey>
<joey> where they had like a
proper ticketing system </joey>
<garnt> 'cause I remember I'd be booked out </garnt>
<garnt> to do signings for like an hour </garnt>
<garnt> and then it would end up going </garnt>
<garnt> for like two hours and a half. </garnt>
<garnt> And there was nothing that
like regulated what was okay </garnt>
<joey> and what wasn't okay,
you know what I mean? </joey>
<garnt> - I guess that's like the benefit </garnt>
<joey> of the big conventions, right? </joey>
<garnt> Is that because there are so many people </garnt>
<garnt> and they probably know
how popular you are. </garnt>
<connor> Then they're like if you're
signing session is one hour, </connor>
<connor> then it's fucking one hour </connor>
<joey> and they'll be cutting off the line. </joey>
<garnt> - And I think also, I think people, </garnt>
<garnt> it's gotten more in people's
ideas or in people's heads now </garnt>
<garnt> that just because you're
at an anime convention, </garnt>
<garnt> social norms still do exist </garnt>
<joey> 'cause I remember in the before time </joey>
<garnt> and I can't imagine what it was </garnt>
<garnt> like even before I started
going to conventions, </garnt>
<garnt> but it seemed like going
to an anime conventions, </garnt>
<garnt> just like all rules fell out the window. </garnt>
<joey> You could get away with anything. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, I watched
footage of like Anime Expo </joey>
<joey> and like fucking 2005, right? </joey>
<joey> And like, you know, that was during like </joey>
<joey> the whole like, glomp and like, yaoi, </joey>
<connor> like, you know, yaoi pad
thing and I'm just like, </connor>
<joey> I can't imagine fucking being
there and like staying sane. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, I don't wanna like walk through </joey>
<joey> the convention hall with the
fear that a random person </joey>
<joey> is gonna jump dive at me. </joey>
<joey> Because it's like, "Well, AX glomp." </joey>
<joey> - It sounds like an anime convention </joey>
<garnt> to like a survival horror. </garnt>
<joey> Who's gonna invade my personal space now? </joey>
<joey> - I'm like personally actually
drown on everyone now. </joey>
<joey> It's like who's next? </joey>
<joey> - I feel like it's pretty
came from a place of like, </joey>
<connor> I mean, I assumed that it
was the one time of the year </connor>
<joey> where they would get to meet anime fans. </joey>
<joey> - Right, right. </joey>
<joey> - Unlike outside of that you
didn't get to see them, right? </joey>
<joey> - Like--
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But now I mean, everyone's
a fucking anime fan. </joey>
<joey> - Right, I think that's what it is. </joey>
<joey> - It's mainstream now. </joey>
<joey> - All now is everyone goes
to a place to buy anime merch </joey>
<garnt> and get drunk together. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah.
- Pretty much, pretty much. </garnt>
<garnt> - So it's like, I
understand that back then </garnt>
<garnt> probably was a little over the top </garnt>
<garnt> because this is the only fucking chance </garnt>
<connor> you get to be a fucking weeb. </connor>
<connor> Like every other day of the
year you can't be a weeb, </connor>
<connor> otherwise you gonna get bullied. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I feel like the
golden period for me </garnt>
<garnt> for anime conventions where it was like, </garnt>
<garnt> you could get away with
things that were like fun, </garnt>
<garnt> but I feel like the point where it starts </garnt>
<garnt> to get really, really regulated
was around 2016 onwards ish. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, as it should 'cause there was </connor>
<garnt> so much sketchy shit
happening in the background. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, there was a little
sketchy shit happening around. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, that was around the time </joey>
<garnt> when the whole like cosplay
isn't consent with anime, </garnt>
<garnt> which came out right. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, why would you
even need to write that out? </garnt>
<connor> - That like is a failure on
humanity that was a rule. </connor>
<garnt> - Which we need to see
implement this rule that's-- </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, is like, oh, yes, I
need something written down </garnt>
<joey> on paper to know that being
overly sexual towards cosplays </joey>
<garnt> is a bad thing. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah exactly, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Like fucking. </garnt>
<garnt> - But I remember like,
'cause I've been going </garnt>
<connor> to London MCM Expo for
like a fair few years now. </connor>
<connor> I remember when, so to
explain the London MCM Expo </connor>
<connor> is like the biggest kind of-- </connor>
<connor> - Kind of pretty fucking
terrible convention. </connor>
<connor> - It's a convention inverted commas </connor>
<connor> 'cause it's more like an, it is an expo. </connor>
<garnt> - Just anime stuff and
there's not really anything </garnt>
<garnt> to do there if you're like a fan, </garnt>
<joey> it's kind of like you can buy stuff </joey>
<joey> and pretty much all anyone does </joey>
<garnt> is just hang out with their friends. </garnt>
<garnt> - Exactly.
- [Joey] Right, right. </garnt>
<garnt> - So there's this grass beds in MCM, </garnt>
<garnt> outside of the convention
center, which everywhere used to, </garnt>
<garnt> where everyone used to hang
out and I was closed off, </garnt>
<garnt> but I feel like some of
my best memories were </garnt>
<garnt> when people were just doing like </garnt>
<garnt> the most random shit on that grass. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, the alcohol bottles--
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Were you there that year
where there was the, </garnt>
<garnt> they did that that Fight Club? </garnt>
<garnt> - No. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, okay.
- They did a Fight Club? </garnt>
<connor> - Yes, so-- </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> - I don't know why I
have a mental image of </joey>
<garnt> a bunch of weebs beating
each other up is hilarious. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like retro music blasting like-- </garnt>
<garnt> - It was a fight club, but
it was like a fight club. </garnt>
<joey> So, it was like the
equivalent of a mosh pit </joey>
<joey> or something like that. </joey>
<joey> But I remember there was like, </joey>
<joey> you know, there was obviously the usual, </joey>
<joey> you know, you got the fucking
Jedis drooling itself. </joey>
<joey> But I remember the funniest one I saw was, </joey>
<joey> there was these two anime fans </joey>
<joey> and one was like the
scrawniest short anime fan </joey>
<joey> who was like vitamin D deficient. </joey>
<joey> You know, that stereotype. </joey>
<joey> - That really sick dude, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Skeletal. </joey>
<joey> - It's skeletal and then
on the other side was </joey>
<joey> the fucking biggest, </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> he wasn't like obese, but
let's say he was a big lad. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah.
- He was a big lad. </connor>
<connor> - Hefty fella.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> And this was like the most
uneven fight I've ever seen. </connor>
<garnt> Like forget about weight
classes here, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - Wait, till they started
punching each other. </connor>
<garnt> - So, I guess they just tried </garnt>
<garnt> to like make each other fall over, right? </garnt>
<connor> So this the scrawny skinny
dude fucking full on sprints </connor>
<connor> into this guy tried to like push him </connor>
<connor> and he just fucking bounces
off him like he's in like, </connor>
<connor> like he's playing four
guys or something, right? </connor>
<connor> And the guy just sits on him. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> And that's was the end of the fight. </connor>
<connor> - Were they all drunk? </connor>
<connor> - Yes, everyone was drunk. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, okay, okay. </joey>
<joey> - Just crushes the poor guy. </joey>
<joey> - So the convention ends at like 6:00, </joey>
<connor> but that area is still
full of people drinking, </connor>
<joey> like they're just outside
just getting drunk. </joey>
<connor> - It sounds awesome. </connor>
<joey> I would love to be there
just like a spectator. </joey>
<connor> - It's kind of fiesta, it's kind of-- </connor>
<connor> - It's kind of fiesta,
but now it's like a little </connor>
<garnt> more controlled version
you can get away with which </garnt>
<garnt> is a bit of a shame because I liked, </garnt>
<connor> I liked that kind of thing. </connor>
<garnt> - It was literally like
an off licence in a Tesco </garnt>
<connor> within like 100 meters of it so-- </connor>
<garnt> - Oh, that's not good. </garnt>
<garnt> - People are just buying,
buying, buying drinks, </garnt>
<connor> drinks, drinks and it's like it's, </connor>
<joey> and I think the hotel hated it </joey>
<joey> 'cause there's literally
a hotel right outside </joey>
<connor> that are like what are you doing? </connor>
<connor> Why are you fucking getting drunk? </connor>
<joey> - Why is this dude sitting
on this scrawny kid? </joey>
<connor> - Why is there a fight club? </connor>
<garnt> - Why are people cheering? </garnt>
<garnt> - I think it was that fight
club that made the convention </garnt>
<garnt> actually called off
thinking of the grass area. </garnt>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> It was worth it. </garnt>
<garnt> Anyone who was on that
MCM convention knows that </garnt>
<garnt> that fight club was hilarious as fuck. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, that sounds fucking awesome. </connor>
<garnt> - Health and safety issues aside. </garnt>
<connor> - It is fun when you
walk to MCM convention, </connor>
<connor> you see something that
clearly will get shut down </connor>
<joey> within an hour, you're like, </joey>
<joey> "I'm just gonna sit and watch this. </joey>
<joey> If this shit go down, this
shit is gonna be funny." </joey>
<connor> - I see that shit even
regularly at Anime Expo still </connor>
<joey> to this day, like
outside of the West Wing, </joey>
<connor> you know, where all the cosplay are, </connor>
<connor> I see some shit there where
I'm just like, "Why, why? </connor>
<joey> Where are the staff,
who's regulating this? </joey>
<joey> - Can we talk about
how fucking crazy it is </joey>
<joey> like meeting people who watch your videos, </joey>
<garnt> it's so fucking surreal. </garnt>
<garnt> How fucking weird is that? </garnt>
<garnt> - I never get used to it. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm like, now I have
like a conditioned response </connor>
<connor> that I could be like, </connor>
<joey> okay, this is how I should
respond to like fans. </joey>
<joey> - Activating execution 101. </joey>
<joey> - But that's why--
- Activating McDonald's smile. </joey>
<joey> - But that's why getting
recognized anywhere, </joey>
<connor> but conventions you're
so unprepared for it </connor>
<connor> because you just never
get used to that fear </connor>
<connor> 'cause I'm just like, "Man,
I'm just a fucking dude </connor>
<connor> who talks about anime online." </connor>
<joey> - I mean, it's already surprising
when people at conventions </joey>
<joey> like come up to you and recognize you. </joey>
<joey> But what's weird is where
you're like nowhere near </joey>
<joey> a fucking convention and it's
just like a random like guy </joey>
<joey> or girl who's just sees, </joey>
<joey> like that fucking dude in Singapore. </joey>
<joey> - Oh my God, oh my God. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> Can I tell that story? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, you can tell it. </joey>
<joey> - Go ahead, go ahead. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, so we were at
Singapore convention. </joey>
<joey> I think it was anime, what was it called? </joey>
<connor> Anime Festival of Asia
or something like that. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, AFA, AFA. </connor>
<connor> - We're at AFA, Singapore. </connor>
<joey> And we were in this, we were
outside the convention working, </joey>
<joey> we were getting lunch or something. </joey>
<joey> It was me Sydney and Joey I believe. </joey>
<joey> - And Alan I think. </joey>
<joey> - And Alan, and Alan, yes. </joey>
<joey> So there are four of us there
and we were just walking </joey>
<garnt> in one of the, in just like
this random shopping mall. </garnt>
<garnt> And then we just hear this screech. </garnt>
<joey> This is like, this is like, </joey>
<garnt> this is like the loudest screech
I've ever heard in my life. </garnt>
<joey> - It was like a banshee screech. </joey>
<garnt> Like you would have thought
like someone came through </garnt>
<garnt> with like a truck and was
like running people over. </garnt>
<garnt> It was that loud.
- Exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> And it immediately
triggered my flight of fight </garnt>
<garnt> like instincts, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Everybody turned around
like what the fuck! </garnt>
<joey> - What the fuck is going on? </joey>
<garnt> And all we see is this
fucking kid bolting it </garnt>
<garnt> towards Joey, right? </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm like, like time just
fucking stopped at that moment. </garnt>
<joey> I'm like, "Am I about to
witness my fucking friend dying </joey>
<joey> in front of my eyes, </joey>
<joey> is he about to get stabbed or something?" </joey>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - It's like the dude was full
on like assassins creeding me. </joey>
<joey> Like just fucking like lows fuck like this </joey>
<joey> just like running towards
me through this giant crowd. </joey>
<joey> And as the crowd is parting
you can see this kid </joey>
<joey> just coming straight. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "Oh, he's coming
for me, I'm gonna die." </joey>
<joey> And because he's like
Naruto running almost, </joey>
<garnt> I can't see his hands right, so I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> "This guy is probably got a knife. </garnt>
<garnt> Like he's about to stab me." </garnt>
<garnt> So I'm just prepared to die. </garnt>
<garnt> He stops like right here. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<joey> He screeches to a halt and
he says, "I love you Joey." </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> And like, meanwhile, poop is
falling out of my pants, right? </joey>
<garnt> - Meanwhile, we're just like, </garnt>
<joey> "Ah, okay, Joey is not dead, okay. </joey>
<joey> Ah, hold on." </joey>
<joey> - That sounds terrifying. </joey>
<joey> - Of course, he was terrifying. </joey>
<joey> - And he's like, "Can
you take a photo of me?" </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "Yeah." </joey>
<connor> - Did like Felix say one time
like Southeast Asian fans </connor>
<joey> are like the craziest--
- Yeah, they are. </joey>
<joey> - In public they just scream?
- Absolutely. </joey>
<joey> - Shout out to the Southeast Asian fans. </joey>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - Everything was great. </connor>
<garnt> It's only like a whole
different level from like, </garnt>
<joey> like any convention
we've been to in America. </joey>
<joey> Like I remember watching Joey walk </joey>
<joey> from one panel to
another, it was basically </joey>
<garnt> like watching Justin Bieber
walk through like, like a pre-- </garnt>
<connor> - That's gonna be an ego booster. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, it felt pretty
good, I don't know why. </connor>
<joey> - I love it when you're just like chilling </joey>
<joey> and then like someone
in the line she's like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, you Joey?" </joey>
<connor> "Yeah, yeah, I am." </connor>
<joey> - I think as well like it
might have been because like </joey>
<joey> that Singapore AFA was, </joey>
<connor> it was a first for that
convention for a lot of reasons </connor>
<connor> because I think I was
like the first YouTuber </connor>
<connor> that had ever been invited. </connor>
<joey> And also, I was the first
ever guest at that convention </joey>
<joey> that didn't charge for signatures. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Oh, wow. </joey>
<joey> - And like, 'cause like I
remember when I was sitting there </joey>
<joey> like waiting, the staff was
like, "All right, so tell me, </joey>
<joey> how much do the signings cost?" </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "What are you talking about?" </joey>
<joey> He's like, "How much does it cost? </joey>
<joey> Like five dollars, $10 how much is it? </joey>
<joey> So that I can tell people in the line?" </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "It's free." </joey>
<connor> And like--
- What do you mean is free? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, he was like,
"What, what do you mean? </connor>
<joey> What mean its free." </joey>
<garnt> - They couldn't process that.
- They couldn't process it. </garnt>
<garnt> He was like, "What do you mean it's free?" </garnt>
<joey> I'm like, "It's fucking free." </joey>
<connor> - I felt like some
other guests get annoyed </connor>
<connor> when YouTubers turn up and don't charge </connor>
<joey> 'cause they're like, "Why
are you just devaluing, </joey>
<joey> you're making us look like ripoffs." </joey>
<garnt> And I'm like, "Well, </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] I mean, yeah,
I guess I understand. </garnt>
<connor> Because it's just like-- </connor>
<connor> - If I'm selling something
like a print or something, </connor>
<joey> I'm like I brought an art. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, but that's the
thing, I was selling prints </joey>
<joey> 'cause I was doing a collab
with like three studios, right? </joey>
<connor> So it's like, people can
just fucking buy this. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I feel like if they, </joey>
<connor> I shouldn't charge
someone to sign something, </connor>
<connor> they've already paid the
entrance fee to get in. </connor>
<joey> - Right, yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<connor> - And then they're like
already buying like </connor>
<connor> the merch that I came up with, right? </connor>
<connor> So it's like, I'm not gonna
charge them anymore, fuck that. </connor>
<connor> - It's like the guy who sneezed on set </connor>
<joey> on Star Wars charged $50 for a shot. </joey>
<joey> It's like what, what do you mean? </joey>
<joey> - I was following trouper number 1200. </joey>
<joey> - It's like who the fuck are you? </joey>
<joey> I just I really disagree
with them doing that </joey>
<joey> and they charge so much, I really hate it. </joey>
<joey> I think it's so conceded-- </joey>
<joey> - Like give them
something physical, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> - Like this should be like an item, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - My signature should not be worth money. </connor>
<connor> - No, no, no. </connor>
<connor> - It should be like a
nice little memorabilia, </connor>
<joey> but I don't know anyone who fucking-- </joey>
<joey> - I think it completely destroys </joey>
<joey> the meaning of a signature, right? </joey>
<joey> Like from a famous person, in my opinion. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know, I would just
I just feel bad charging. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, me too even if I'm like
the greatest fucking anime, </garnt>
<joey> I don't know. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Like the worst like I
would get away with is, </joey>
<joey> you know, charging, I haven't
even like charged for prints </joey>
<connor> or anything like that 'cause
I've never done prints, </connor>
<connor> but, or like-
- Print it's sold out. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, so print is sold out, </connor>
<connor> but at least give them something physical </connor>
<joey> that's what I would say.
- [Joey] Exactly. </joey>
<joey> - If, you know, we need
to do something like that. </joey>
<garnt> - Right, right, but again, like, </garnt>
<joey> we're doing well enough for ourselves. </joey>
<joey> Like I'm not that fucking
desperate to be like, </joey>
<joey> "I have 500 prints, they all need to go." </joey>
<connor> - And I guess sometimes the
conventions can't really like, </connor>
<joey> like pay you much for your
time, so it's like I get it </joey>
<connor> that some people wanna like
get some prints in there, </connor>
<joey> you know, to get them going. </joey>
<connor> - But, you know, that's not really </connor>
<connor> the reason I go to conventions-- </connor>
<connor> - No, no, no, I know what you're-- </connor>
<connor> - I just wanna fucking meet my fans. </connor>
<joey> - Anyway, any conventions in
Southeast Asia wanna invite us, </joey>
<garnt> we are all--
- Any conventions in general. </garnt>
<joey> - Any conventions in
general, we are always open. </joey>
<garnt> We miss it so much. </garnt>
<joey> - After this fucking
drought of conventions, </joey>
<joey> we really need to fucking go to some. </joey>
<connor> - I mean, like crazy people
and inappropriate people aside </connor>
<connor> like my God, I think that
thing is like anything better </connor>
<joey> than meeting someone who is
just like nice and just like, </joey>
<joey> "Hey, I watch your videos." </joey>
<joey> 'Cause it's so crazy, 'cause
you don't really get to ever, </joey>
<joey> I know you two usually
say this all the time, </joey>
<garnt> you don't get to see people
who watch our videos. </garnt>
<garnt> - No.
- [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because when I see a video
that gets like 300,000 views, </garnt>
<connor> I'm like, yeah, cool,
but then when you see-- </connor>
<garnt> - Whenever you see 300
people in your panel-- </garnt>
<garnt> - Like that's crazy with
300 people in one room </garnt>
<joey> who would wanna meet you
that like blows my mind. </joey>
<joey> And then like most of them
are so fucking sweet, so nice. </joey>
<joey> It's like, "Man, I can't help
but just like you want a hug? </joey>
<connor> You wanna hug?" </connor>
<joey> - It's also just feel so nice, </joey>
<joey> especially when it's like
a small convention as well, </joey>
<connor> where it's like the
ratio of like attendees </connor>
<connor> to people who know you is like staggering. </connor>
<garnt> - And it's so hard to try
to voice your gratitude </garnt>
<garnt> without sounding like that
typical corny YouTuber, </garnt>
<joey> but that's just that's-- </joey>
<joey> - I appreciate you guys so much. </joey>
<garnt> - You wanna hug, ask me I'll give you one, </garnt>
<connor> probably even if you're sweaty,
I'll give you a fat hug. </connor>
<connor> - I will give you a hug too. </connor>
<connor> - I just, pressured Garnt to saying that, </connor>
<connor> Garnt doesn't do that. </connor>
<connor> Garnt wasn't gonna give you
a hug until I said it first, </connor>
<connor> just wanna make that clear. </connor>
<connor> - I'm not gonna give you a hug. </connor>
<connor> I'm kidding, I'm kidding. </connor>
<connor> - You know, they're not ranked
enough for Joey size, sorry. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I have ranks. </joey>
<connor> - Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. </connor>
<joey> - But like, you know, that's
like the other thing as well, </joey>
<joey> like, I don't wanna
like dwell on the whole </joey>
<joey> like cosplays consent thing, right? </joey>
<connor> But like, I feel that-- </connor>
<connor> - You can ask me for a
hug, I don't give a shit. </connor>
<connor> - Right, but like I feel that like now, </connor>
<connor> like at least with me, my
general rule of thumb is like, </connor>
<connor> especially if it's of the female, right? </connor>
<connor> Like, 'cause I know like,
dudes don't give a shit </connor>
<connor> if I hug them, right? </connor>
<connor> Because it's just the fucking-- </connor>
<connor> - Oh, yeah, let me cup your dick. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> - Let me hold your balls.
- I'm joking don't do that. </joey>
<joey> Please don't do that that's a joke. </joey>
<connor> - Your balls are heavy too. </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> I feel that like because
of the whole thing with, </joey>
<joey> especially recently like convs have become </joey>
<joey> a little bit more sensitive like, </joey>
<joey> at least my general rule of thumb is </joey>
<joey> if you're a female or
you're not like a dude </joey>
<garnt> who comes up to me and
like wants to take a photo, </garnt>
<garnt> I always ask like, is it
all right if I put my hand </garnt>
<joey> on you right shoulder, you know, </joey>
<joey> or like I wait for them to
be like, "Can I hug you?" </joey>
<joey> - I do that but like sometimes
I forget and then I'm like, </joey>
<joey> fuck, I just did it without asking. </joey>
<joey> Am I a horrible person, like
are they gonna go online </joey>
<joey> and say if I can get killed. </joey>
<connor> - It's only until the last AX </connor>
<joey> where I like physically
told myself I need to get </joey>
<garnt> into the habit of doing that. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, same with me. </joey>
<joey> Like before I was like, </joey>
<joey> I was just like trying to read the air, </joey>
<connor> but now I just straight up
ask, you know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it used to just be like-- </connor>
<garnt> - Jesus! </garnt>
<garnt> - I used to just be like,
okay, I kind of get the vibe </garnt>
<joey> that you're okay with it. </joey>
<joey> Like that's just risky,
I don't know, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Because a lot of them are like, </joey>
<connor> "Of course you can, why
is that even a question?" </connor>
<garnt> I'm like, "No, you don't
understand, I have to ask." </garnt>
<joey> - 'Cause it's weird, right? </joey>
<joey> Because now, because, you
know, when we started off, </joey>
<connor> I don't think any YouTuber
ever thinks they're gonna get, </connor>
<connor> you know, any kind of attention
or any kind of success. </connor>
<connor> So, you kind of come into it like </connor>
<joey> the small person mentality. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, sometimes you just gotta realize </joey>
<joey> that you can't get away with that anymore. </joey>
<joey> Unfortunately, even though
you still see yourself </joey>
<garnt> as that same person who started off doing </garnt>
<garnt> like YouTube videos in your
mom's basement or whatever. </garnt>
<garnt> - I still feel like that. </garnt>
<connor> - I still feel like
that now, but you know-- </connor>
<joey> - Your numbers don't lie, right? </joey>
<connor> - You gotta adapt eventually. </connor>
<garnt> - It's sad, I mean, I
feel like I have to like, </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, in some aspects it makes you </garnt>
<joey> like be a better person, right? </joey>
<joey> In general, like I've got an asshole </joey>
<joey> 'cause I will get called out for it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Which is good, but
then also, I feel like, </joey>
<joey> I have to make sure everything in my life </joey>
<joey> is completely 100% like
there's no doubt in my mind, </joey>
<connor> in anyone's mind that I'm
totally like in the clear. </connor>
<connor> Whereas most people it's like, okay, 90%, </connor>
<connor> 70% I'm not an asshole. </connor>
<joey> It's like all right, that's enough, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah.
- But, you know, it's kind of, </joey>
<joey> and also, like I feel as
well when you meet fans </joey>
<joey> sometimes they're really
nervous because obviously, </joey>
<joey> they don't know you. </joey>
<joey> I feel like they're more nervous </joey>
<joey> to put their arm around you. </joey>
<joey> And so, I feel like that
like waiting for you </joey>
<joey> to take the lead, which
is, you know, again, </joey>
<joey> like it makes it harder 'cause
like, I used to just be like, </joey>
<joey> all right, I guess if they
seem like they want it like, </joey>
<joey> oh, where they stand for
the photo because sometimes, </joey>
<joey> you know, they'll just literally
just stand in position puff </joey>
<joey> like touching you basically,
okay, then you put your arm. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah.
- But yeah, some people-- </connor>
<joey> - And I think that's
like another good reason </joey>
<connor> why like--
- You should ask. </connor>
<joey> I need to get the habit, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Some of them are like,
"Oh, yeah, of course." </joey>
<joey> Like they weren't expecting that. </joey>
<connor> - I mean, I'm sure I'll come
on to this pandemic being like. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - I'm sure the pandemic would
change a lot of the behavior </garnt>
<connor> about what's allowed and
everything like that. </connor>
<connor> - A million hold a hand photo. </connor>
<joey> - Although I do love to
have the hold a hand photo. </joey>
<connor> There's something about that, I don't-- </connor>
<joey> - 'Cause the best part is when they ask </joey>
<garnt> for a hold hand photo I'm just like, </garnt>
<joey> "You get it, you get it." </joey>
<garnt> - Whenever I get someone ask me like, </garnt>
<joey> "Can you do a hold the hand?" </joey>
<connor> I'm like, "I can one* off
that let's do a hold a hug." </connor>
<connor> You're just like doing this,
but you're not touching at all, </connor>
<connor> It's fucking great. </connor>
<joey> - I wonder if all conventions
will everyone be required </joey>
<connor> to wear a mask when they finally-- </connor>
<joey> - Probably the first two years. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, that depends on when </joey>
<connor> the conventions are gonna open. </connor>
<garnt> - Exactly.
- True, true. </garnt>
<garnt> - I doubt that there will be
any conventions open next year. </garnt>
<joey> Yeah, I just don't think,
I don't think the wall-- </joey>
<connor> - Didn't they hold on like
fucking Idaho or some shit? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, but I mean-- </connor>
<joey> - Like in the middle of November. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly, but, you know, </joey>
<joey> they're gonna fucking
slammed for that, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like, I don't think there'll be </joey>
<garnt> any big profile convention
happening to at least </garnt>
<connor> the second half the year that's like-- </connor>
<garnt> - And the whole conventions are like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Get that out of here, get that out. </garnt>
<joey> I don't wanna do an E-convention </joey>
<joey> are you kidding me, what's that? </joey>
<connor> - I mean, I did a couple
of E-conventions this year. </connor>
<connor> - Did you actually?
- Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> I did one for, </connor>
<connor> I did one for anime con South Africa. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, yeah, I saw that, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I did like a pre-recorded
interview for that. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, sick. </joey>
<joey> - And I'm like, I wanted to, </joey>
<joey> the only reason why I wanted
to do that was because </joey>
<joey> when the pandemic is over, </joey>
<joey> I really wanna fucking go to South Africa. </joey>
<joey> So it's just like, it's
just connection building, </joey>
<joey> so it's like--. </joey>
<joey> - Joey should play with five head here. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I don't know. </connor>
<garnt> Like I can't get myself to like attend. </garnt>
<connor> Because like attending
conventions is like, </connor>
<connor> it's kind of like the equivalent of </connor>
<connor> when you're like watching
a food video or something </connor>
<joey> and you're watching this like
these three star Michelin chef </joey>
<joey> like produce this like
gorgeous looking food </joey>
<joey> and then you're sitting there
with like your combini meal </joey>
<joey> and you're like, "This is just the same." </joey>
<joey> - This is almost the same.
- This is almost the same. </joey>
<joey> Do you know what I mean? </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - You're like tear open the
paper salt like, yeah, I'm good. </garnt>
<garnt> - My three star MSG. </garnt>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> - Do you hate it when you
make a fucking great meal, </connor>
<connor> you got a great or maybe
you order new breeds </connor>
<connor> and you fucking edit all
before like full minutes </connor>
<connor> into the like one hour
movie you gonna watch? </connor>
<joey> I'm like, fuck I'm gotta
put this plate away </joey>
<joey> or it's gonna get dirty in my sink. </joey>
<joey> I shouldn't been, I
fucking hate that so much. </joey>
<connor> - I don't know how to
pace myself with food. </connor>
<connor> - I don't it, it's like the movies, </connor>
<connor> my popcorn eaten before we even we-- </connor>
<connor> - That's why I don't even
order the popcorn, all right. </connor>
<joey> - What do you mean? </joey>
<joey> Why don't you do that? </joey>
<connor> You fucking animal
- I don't order popcorn, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - It's so good here, why
would you not want it? </joey>
<connor> - 'Cause its fucking awful. </connor>
<garnt> - Popcorn is that thing
that I never get myself, </garnt>
<joey> but whenever someone
else's offers I'll do this. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> It's like have you guys
had any creepy experiences </garnt>
<garnt> with people or fans? </garnt>
<connor> - Absolutely, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, keep saying. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - Because I'd say like this,
the moment when I stopped like </garnt>
<garnt> where I had to like really pay attention </garnt>
<garnt> to who I always hang out with was </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause of this one convention I went to. </garnt>
<joey> The thing was like three, four years ago, </joey>
<joey> I can't remember exactly
how many years it's been, </joey>
<joey> but it was like my first proper,
creepy stalker experience. </joey>
<joey> - Sounds like a YouTube title. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - I feel like that your
story animation title. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly so-- </joey>
<joey> - Why are you wasting
us at the podcast, man. </joey>
<garnt> Make your story a little bit later. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - I just feel like I
can draw my life, right? </connor>
<connor> But yeah, I was at this convention </connor>
<connor> and there was like a communal area. </connor>
<garnt> And, you know, at conventions, </garnt>
<garnt> what I like doing at conventions
is meeting random people. </garnt>
<connor> Meeting fans, talking with people. </connor>
<connor> And the thing is I've met, like
a lot of my closest friends, </connor>
<connor> I've met through conventions. </connor>
<connor> Like our friend group in England, </connor>
<connor> 90% of those people were
people who I met at conventions </connor>
<connor> and were fans of me. </connor>
<connor> So that's why I had always tried to like, </connor>
<connor> you know, be as open as
possible no matter who it was. </connor>
<connor> And I feel like this was
the point when I realized, </connor>
<connor> "Hey, maybe my reach is a
little bigger than, you know, </connor>
<connor> what I'm comfortable with." </connor>
<connor> Because I was with, you know, hanging out </connor>
<connor> with just this random group of people. </connor>
<connor> And it was me and Sydney. </connor>
<connor> And we were, you know, we
were having a great time, </connor>
<garnt> we were just chatting shit
about anime and other shit </garnt>
<garnt> and like, in this middle
of this convention hall </garnt>
<garnt> and then it was like, you know,
it was time to just disperse </garnt>
<garnt> and go in own ways.
- [Joey] Right, right. </garnt>
<garnt> - So me and Sydney start
walking back to our hotel rooms </garnt>
<garnt> and everyone else goes their own ways. </garnt>
<garnt> And then this one kid starts, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> starts walking the same
direction with with us, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Is it the same guy from Akihabara? </garnt>
<connor> - No, no, no, it's not the same guy. </connor>
<connor> Compared to the guy in Akihabara, </connor>
<garnt> the guy in Akihabara was like
a fucking saint, you know? </garnt>
<connor> - Yikes. </connor>
<garnt> - So this kid follows us and I asked, </garnt>
<connor> and so I was trying to
be polite to be like, </connor>
<garnt> "Oh, well, you know,
where are you staying?" </garnt>
<connor> And he was like, "Oh, I'm staying </connor>
<garnt> in the same hotel as you guys." </garnt>
<garnt> Now, keep in mind, you
know, I talked with the kid, </garnt>
<connor> you know, quite a bit, you know, </connor>
<garnt> when we're hanging out in a group. </garnt>
<connor> - All right, so you
thought it was plausible </connor>
<garnt> that you told him your hotel. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, it's, and I was,
you know, I wasn't wasted, </connor>
<joey> but I was, you know, I
had a few drinks in me </joey>
<joey> and I was feeling friendly,
so I was like, whatever, </joey>
<joey> just making casual chitchat
and he seemed normal enough. </joey>
<joey> You know, he didn't seem like
a creep or anything like that. </joey>
<joey> And so, we go back, we go to our hotel, </joey>
<joey> and then we get in the lift </joey>
<joey> and then he goes in the lift with us. </joey>
<joey> And we're like, "Oh, what floor are you?" </joey>
<joey> No, no, sorry, so we get we
get in lift and I hit my floor </joey>
<joey> and I ask, "Oh, what floor are you?" </joey>
<joey> And he goes, "Oh, it's
the same floor as you." </joey>
<joey> - Oh, no. </joey>
<joey> - And at this point nothing
clicked in my mind, right? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I was so innocent
at that point I was-- </joey>
<joey> - Oh, there's lots of
rooms in that floor too. </joey>
<joey> - I know, and both me
and Sydney were like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, what a coincidence, you
know, we're on the same floor." </joey>
<connor> Well, that's a huge
coincidence and at this point, </connor>
<connor> I'm just like, no, I just
wanna go to my bed and sleep. </connor>
<connor> I'm way too tired, so I'm like, </connor>
<connor> "Yeah, cool, that's a huge coincidence." </connor>
<connor> So we go up to the floor and then, </connor>
<connor> so I go in first, I go to my room first </connor>
<connor> and Sydney is just right bit behind me </connor>
<connor> because I'm tired as fuck, </connor>
<connor> I just wanna get into my hotel room. </connor>
<connor> And so, I go to the door
put my key in, I turn around </connor>
<connor> and the kid is still
there and I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> "What are you doing?" </connor>
<connor> And he straight up tells me, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, no, I just completely lied, </connor>
<garnt> I just wanted to see
where you were saying." </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm like, "What the
fuck do I say to this?" </garnt>
<garnt> And then apparently, </garnt>
<garnt> when I wasn't looking </garnt>
<garnt> before I had asked that he tried to go in </garnt>
<garnt> for a kiss with Sydney
and Sydney told me this </garnt>
<garnt> after we'd got in our hotel room. </garnt>
<garnt> And then after he said,
"Oh, no, I'm lying. </garnt>
<garnt> I just wanted to see where
you guys are living, bye." </garnt>
<garnt> And he just fucks off. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, what, do I call security. </garnt>
<garnt> What the fuck! </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I didn't even get his name, </garnt>
<connor> so I didn't know who this kid was, </connor>
<connor> it was just this random kid that I'd met, </connor>
<connor> he knew who I was obviously, </connor>
<connor> but it was this random kid who I had met </connor>
<connor> just like on the convention floor. </connor>
<joey> And so, this was the
first time I'd had like, </joey>
<joey> a fucking freak out of
my hotel room to be like, </joey>
<joey> "Yo, shit, we gotta call security." </joey>
<joey> Would it be like, "Can
we get like Chris Jones </joey>
<joey> to stand outside this door,
do we change hotel rooms, </joey>
<joey> what the fuck do we do?" </joey>
<joey> And that was the exact
moment when I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> "Okay, I gotta be fucking careful </joey>
<joey> about who I hang out with at conventions." </joey>
<connor> So if I'm a bit standoffish </connor>
<connor> when I meet someone new at conventions, </connor>
<joey> blame that guy, okay? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that's what the PTSD comes from. </joey>
<garnt> - That's where the PTSD comes from. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, shit, what the fuck, that's creepy. </garnt>
<garnt> - I had something kind of similar to that. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, I've had multiple
experiences similar to that, </garnt>
<joey> but I think the creepiest
one that I ever had was, </joey>
<joey> it wasn't even in a hotel
room, you know, I was staying, </joey>
<joey> it was like the first time, </joey>
<joey> so I've been to Otakuthon in
Montreal a couple of times. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, everything is fucking
weird out there, God, damn. </joey>
<joey> - I got nothing against Montreal, </joey>
<connor> Montreal is a beautiful city, </connor>
<joey> but all the weeb shit
happened to me there. </joey>
<connor> So I was staying at my
friend's place at the time </connor>
<connor> 'cause he lived like five minutes
train from the convention, </connor>
<garnt> so I'm like fuck it, I'll stay at his. </garnt>
<garnt> And we were staying with like
a couple of other friends. </garnt>
<garnt> And this is before the convention
had even started, right? </garnt>
<joey> But I was a guest at that convention, </joey>
<joey> so people around Montreal knew </joey>
<joey> that I was gonna be at that convention. </joey>
<joey> And it was like midnight, right? </joey>
<joey> Like 12:00 a.m. and I
was just fucking around </joey>
<garnt> with my friends and we
get a knock on the door </garnt>
<garnt> and there's like, and I was like, "Okay." </garnt>
<garnt> I open the door and there's
just the box sitting there, </garnt>
<joey> like not even a package, like
not even mail, just a box. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, "Is this a bomb? </joey>
<joey> What is this?" </joey>
<joey> And I told my like the friend
who, you know, the place, </joey>
<garnt> I was like, "Did you get a package?" </garnt>
<garnt> And he's like, "No." </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, "Did anyone here get a package?" </garnt>
<garnt> He's like, "No." </garnt>
<garnt> - What's in the box? </garnt>
<joey> - And then I flipped the box
over and it says to Joey. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I was like, "Oh my!" </garnt>
<joey> I fucking like looked around was like, </joey>
<joey> "There's no one around." </joey>
<joey> So I took the box in, </joey>
<joey> I don't know why the
fuck I took the box in. </joey>
<joey> I took the box and close the
door and I slowly opened it </joey>
<joey> and it was a Tupperware container of, </joey>
<joey> you know what poutine is? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - No. </joey>
<garnt> - Poutine it's this like dish in-- </garnt>
<connor> - It's cheese in chips. </connor>
<connor> - It's cheese in chips
basically with gravy. </connor>
<connor> It's like a French Canadian thing. </connor>
<connor> - I fucking love cheese in chips gravy. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, Poutine is
fucking delicious, right? </connor>
<joey> But there was a Tupperware full of poutine </joey>
<joey> and on top of the Tupperware it said, </joey>
<joey> "I'm a huge fan of you Joey,
I made some poutine for you." </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Was it still hot? </joey>
<joey> - It was still hot. </joey>
<joey> - How did she know where you're staying? </joey>
<garnt> - That's exactly what I wanna know. </garnt>
<joey> That's why I was shitting my pants. </joey>
<joey> - Wait, wait, wait was it good? </joey>
<connor> - I didn't eat it. </connor>
<joey> - What the fuck, I would eat that. </joey>
<connor> - No.
- Dude, okay, one time-- </connor>
<joey> - I've seen Higurashi
dude, I've seen the scenes </joey>
<joey> where you eat the fucking ohagi </joey>
<joey> and there's a giant
needle inside, all right? </joey>
<joey> I wasn't gonna have that shit. </joey>
<connor> - All right, one time, right? </connor>
<connor> I got gifted like a whole as bento box, </connor>
<joey> like a legit like big ass bento box. </joey>
<joey> It's sort of had curry in
it, like a little curry. </joey>
<joey> And I wasn't gonna eat it,
but I was in the hotel room, </joey>
<joey> it was like 12:00 a.m.
I was fucking starving. </joey>
<joey> So I remember I had the
bento box in my room </joey>
<joey> and I take this curry and I
didn't have like a knife or fork </joey>
<joey> so I'm like, I'm in a fucking hotel room, </joey>
<joey> but I have like the ice
pick thing like knife. </joey>
<joey> It was like a fork like two prongs, </joey>
<connor> so I'm just fucking scooping up this curry </connor>
<connor> and I was eating it and it
was fucking tasted so good. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> It was such a good curry. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, no, I fucking remembered it like-- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I was like so fucking
ghetto eating that with </joey>
<connor> like my fucking ice pig. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I wouldn't do that. </joey>
<joey> I just remembered though
with the poutine thing. </joey>
<garnt> I didn't eat it because I
was too fucking scared to, </garnt>
<joey> but my friend was like
fuck it I will eat it, </joey>
<connor> it's still warm. </connor>
<connor> But then he ate it and the
first bite he took he was like, </connor>
<garnt> "Why is there a giant hair in this?" </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - There's none of that in the curry, </connor>
<joey> the curry was clean good. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, and I'm like, </joey>
<joey> they could be two options
here either one she </joey>
<joey> or I'm assuming it's a girl
she accidentally like drop </joey>
<garnt> the hair in or she was like, </garnt>
<garnt> "I'm gonna get Joey to
eat some of my hair." </garnt>
<garnt> - My DNA. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, my name is inside Joey. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, oh, just thinking about it, </garnt>
<joey> shit was just so fucking creepy. </joey>
<joey> - I'm gonna be an STO Joey. </joey>
<garnt> - I'm gonna be at the top of his ranks </garnt>
<joey> when a part of me is inside his stomach. </joey>
<joey> But yeah, just a fair warning for anyone </joey>
<joey> who wants to like gift us
anything, don't gift us food. </joey>
<connor> like especially if it's hand made. </connor>
<connor> - Unless it's real bomb, then
I'll still eat it, but no. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I mean, I'm
not gonna eat something </connor>
<joey> unless it's like packaged. </joey>
<joey> - I'm fine with food as long
as it just doesn't appear </joey>
<garnt> in front of my hotel room </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause the weirdest thing I would say is </garnt>
<garnt> when people know where
you're staying in the hotel </garnt>
<garnt> and regardless of whether
you're a fucking famous YouTuber </garnt>
<connor> or not that shits weird,
you know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> - I mean, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, it was the
creepiest Uber Eats delivery. </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> - I wouldn't eat that
man, I was just playing. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, I just ate. </joey>
<connor> Like I literally just eaten </connor>
<connor> like stall bought poutine before hand. </connor>
<connor> - Always the one for more man, always-- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, that shit fills you up by the way. </connor>
<joey> - I know, but--
- Plus it's fucking delicious. </joey>
<connor> - I haven't had anything like that, </connor>
<garnt> I've been lucky enough to like not be-- </garnt>
<garnt> - Really?
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm surprised you haven't had this-- </garnt>
<joey> - If anyone was that must
have creepy fans its you. </joey>
<joey> - Come on, guys step up, come
on I need more story up here. </joey>
<joey> I mean, sort of, I guess kind of. </joey>
<joey> Okay, one time in this convention, </joey>
<connor> so typically, they don't
put you on the first floor </connor>
<connor> like they're not supposed
to because obviously </connor>
<connor> that's where all the elevators are </connor>
<connor> and everyone's, all the people are there, </connor>
<joey> so typically they're actually
put guests on the first floor </joey>
<joey> and they normally have a floor </joey>
<joey> that's specifically for staff and guests, </joey>
<joey> it's like separate so
that no attendee should be </joey>
<garnt> on the same floor as a guest or a staff. </garnt>
<garnt> That's what they're supposed to do, </garnt>
<garnt> but sometimes the Cons don't do that. </garnt>
<garnt> So I'm in one of them, I
was on the first floor. </garnt>
<garnt> I was kind of annoyed
'cause I was literally </garnt>
<joey> about 15 meters from the elevator. </joey>
<joey> So everyone knows where I come from. </joey>
<joey> - A great placement. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, right next to it. </garnt>
<garnt> - I come from where do I go? </garnt>
<garnt> - Exactly, call Nigel. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> So it was just like asking someone to see </garnt>
<joey> where I was staying, I'm sure
most people saw where I was. </joey>
<joey> Luckily, I took advantage of that, </joey>
<joey> but at about like 2:00 a.m. one night, </joey>
<joey> I'm like basically naked,
but I really wanted ice </joey>
<garnt> and the ice thing was
right next to the, my room. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> And thought mission impossible, right? </garnt>
<garnt> It's 10 seconds in and out no problem. </garnt>
<joey> I'm in my boxes only, right? </joey>
<joey> I'm still gonna fucking
do it, like I don't care. </joey>
<connor> It's only me, who cares? </connor>
<connor> I'm like building myself up confidence. </connor>
<connor> I could just put a T-shirt on,
no, I'm building myself up. </connor>
<connor> I opened the door and there's
just two kills sitting there </connor>
<joey> opposite my door. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, what the fuck, </joey>
<joey> I've been like, fucking
SpongeBob has been on </joey>
<joey> like full volume in my room
dude like what do you-- </joey>
<joey> - And you're naked? </joey>
<joey> - I'm like basically naked,
I'm like, go to the ice machine </joey>
<connor> and I get it and I go
back in and I'm like, </connor>
<connor> as I'm closing my door I'm
like, "What are you doing?" </connor>
<connor> Like nothing, I'm like, "All right then." </connor>
<connor> - Did they know you? </connor>
<connor> - I didn't even ask. </connor>
<connor> I had to close the door and
they said nothing, I'm like, </connor>
<connor> "All right, I'm going back to bed." </connor>
<connor> - Meanwhile, they were like huge fans </connor>
<joey> and they just creaming themselves. </joey>
<connor> - Maybe, maybe, I mean, </connor>
<joey> based on watching one
of my cosplay videos, </joey>
<joey> so it's not really like a big deal. </joey>
<joey> - I saw Sidova's nipples. </joey>
<connor> He came out watching sponge bob-- </connor>
<joey> - They're not on YouTube,
so it's not a big deal. </joey>
<joey> - For some reason he came out </joey>
<connor> of his hotel room butt
naked watching SpongeBob. </connor>
<connor> I didn't even wanna ask
why he was doing that. </connor>
<joey> - I just wanted ice, you know. </joey>
<connor> And one time I was on
like the seventh floor </connor>
<connor> in like Minneapolis and I went to my room, </connor>
<connor> no one else on this floor, </connor>
<joey> there's just this like
seven foot white dude, </joey>
<joey> just sitting in front of my door. </joey>
<joey> Just sitting in front of
it, literally blocking it. </joey>
<joey> I was like, "Hey, can I get into my room?" </joey>
<connor> He's like, "Oh, yeah, sure." </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I've had that plenty of times too. </joey>
<connor> Like people, random people
sitting in front of my door. </connor>
<connor> And it's almost always people
who don't know who I am. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, because like, "Why are you here?" </garnt>
<garnt> Because it's like at conventions, </garnt>
<garnt> hotel rooms just become a fucking zoo. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, you know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> - I was just so confused. </garnt>
<connor> I'm like, Okay, like,
he was literally like, </connor>
<joey> not even like next to it,
like in front of my door. </joey>
<joey> And I like kind of like, I'm
like, "Hey, can you move? </joey>
<joey> I'm gonna get into my room." </joey>
<joey> - Like why do these like
attendees think that are </joey>
<connor> like hotel hallways are the
same as convention hallways, </connor>
<connor> you can't just sit in my hallway. </connor>
<connor> - And I didn't say
anything 'cause I was like, </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna hope that when I
leave this room in 20 minutes </connor>
<connor> after I've had my shower,
he will not be there. </connor>
<connor> Luckily he wasn't. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - But I was like, that was just so weird. </joey>
<joey> - You've never had like the
getting of letters slipped </joey>
<joey> under your hotel door
and stories like that? </joey>
<joey> - Or people still get back to your room? </joey>
<connor> - No, they always like give
it to my face, which is like-- </connor>
<connor> - That's so much nice, I wish I had that. </connor>
<joey> - I had someone who's like this is for you </joey>
<connor> and it was an envelope. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I thought like that's nice, </joey>
<joey> maybe he could be a little cunt. </joey>
<joey> I noticed like it's a little light. </joey>
<connor> And the helper next to me is
like, oh, you should open it. </connor>
<joey> I was like, I was gonna leave it, </joey>
<garnt> something like leave it till I get back </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause people are still
coming and I opened it up </garnt>
<garnt> and it's a hotel key card. </garnt>
<garnt> And on the envelope, they've
written their room number. </garnt>
<garnt> And I was like damn. </garnt>
<connor> - Damn son. </connor>
<connor> - And then the handler-- </connor>
<connor> - Did you go? </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<joey> - Maybe straight, any dude
watching this is like, </joey>
<connor> it's free invitation. </connor>
<joey> - It's like a fairy tale
cosplays, so I was like, </joey>
<connor> "No, thank you." </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> I'm kidding, I just thought this is not </joey>
<connor> the kind of Chris Hansen
trap I need to walk into. </connor>
<joey> I'm like this is, "No, no, no, no." </joey>
<joey> This is like a James Bond
plot, but no, thank you. </joey>
<connor> And like the handler next
to me was like, "Damn." </connor>
<connor> - He was like, "Can I have that?" </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I was like, "Do you want it?" </connor>
<connor> I asked him to give it back to the hotel. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, people did give me
like numbers or something. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I mean, like-- </joey>
<joey> - It's just flattering,
I'm like, "Thank you. </joey>
<joey> Babe, you think I'm the one
texting, you are the one, </joey>
<garnt> God, get outta, get outta here you." </garnt>
<garnt> I like it, I don't know, it's nice. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I think the
nicest gift I've ever got </connor>
<garnt> from a fan was, it was at AX where-- </garnt>
<garnt> - A lot of my enemies. </garnt>
<connor> - So someone had given me
also like handwritten letter, </connor>
<garnt> but with the letter was
like, it came in a box </garnt>
<garnt> and in the box was like
a lot of origami cranes </garnt>
<garnt> that she was like fold it herself. </garnt>
<joey> And I'm like, "Did you
do this all by hand?" </joey>
<joey> And she's like, "Yeah,
you know, I was just bored </joey>
<joey> and I just wanted to give you
something that was memorable." </joey>
<joey> And it was definitely
memorable because it was like, </joey>
<joey> you know, I was like-- </joey>
<joey> - I mean, you're telling the
story of her right now, man. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly, I still
remember her to this day, </joey>
<joey> I still have it. </joey>
<joey> Fucking, it was the
first time I felt like, </joey>
<garnt> maybe I'm doing some
good in this world man. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm so happy, thank you so much. </garnt>
<garnt> But yeah, it was just-- </garnt>
<garnt> - I was talking about animated titties </garnt>
<connor> and I get this beautiful gifts. </connor>
<joey> - Have you seen like the vine or whatever, </joey>
<garnt> where the guy is making
a sandwich with crisps. </garnt>
<garnt> He's like, "You made this for me? </garnt>
<joey> Bro, you made this for me? </joey>
<connor> I love you, bro." </connor>
<joey> That's how I fell in
that exact moment, right? </joey>
<joey> - Do you remember that like
really creepy statue I had </joey>
<connor> at my house?
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I love this, I loved it. </connor>
<joey> A fan had made me the statue </joey>
<joey> and it was like a proper clay statue. </joey>
<connor> And it was like, you know, </connor>
<joey> I don't think they were
like amazing in it, </joey>
<connor> but it was so fucking sweet, </connor>
<connor> but it was so cursed and
creepy at the same time. </connor>
<connor> But it was such, so I
just couldn't imagine </connor>
<joey> the amount of thought they put into this </joey>
<joey> that I fucking loved it so
much so I kept it in my house. </joey>
<joey> So whenever anybody came
to my house, they're like, </joey>
<joey> "What the fuck is that? </joey>
<joey> What is that?" </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "Oh, it's a statue of me." </joey>
<joey> They're like, "You, that's you?" </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "It's not the most flattering, </joey>
<joey> but a fan gave it to me." </joey>
<joey> They're like, "Oh, that's nice." </joey>
<joey> Yeah, blah, blah, blah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, probably because when
you say it's a statue of you </joey>
<connor> is like did you make that? </connor>
<joey> - The thing was as well as </joey>
<joey> is that it kinda looked really beat up </joey>
<connor> because it like went
through the mail as well </connor>
<joey> and I had to like, I thought
this thing was so cool, </joey>
<joey> they done it that I spent
like an hour and a half </joey>
<connor> super gluing it all back together </connor>
<connor> just so I could display it in my house </connor>
<joey> and creep everyone out
I guess by accident, </joey>
<joey> but I thought like,
"Oh, this is so sweet." </joey>
<joey> And now that's in my parents
house creeping them out. </joey>
<joey> Thank you that one fan who
sent me that statue of me </joey>
<joey> in like an owl pose. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, we appreciate that
shit so much honestly. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - We don't do anything that amazing </connor>
<joey> to be able to get gifts like that so. </joey>
<connor> - Like being given anything
it just feels really weird </connor>
<connor> that you would, you know, </connor>
<connor> want to give something to us anyway. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> - And not weird in a bad
way, just weird for us </connor>
<connor> because we're just like, we
don't do anything special. </connor>
<connor> We just fucking talk about-- </connor>
<connor> - Fucking make videos. </connor>
<connor> - Comment on anime titties and whatever. </connor>
<garnt> - It's very humbling 'cause I again, </garnt>
<joey> I feel like I make the
videos just for myself and, </joey>
<joey> you know, just to pay the bills </joey>
<joey> that's kind of like the main reasons, </joey>
<joey> you know what that like, </joey>
<garnt> I make the videos first
and foremost for me </garnt>
<garnt> and then it's just like,
I constantly forget </garnt>
<garnt> how much people enjoy them. </garnt>
<joey> And it's really just like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, shit, these mean things to people?" </joey>
<garnt> Not that my videos are like
worth meaning anything, </garnt>
<joey> I don't mean that, I'm not
considered at all to think that, </joey>
<joey> but other people were
like, "Oh, you know-- </joey>
<joey> - My videos are deep. </joey>
<joey> - Right, like you may say issues like, </joey>
<joey> "You know, I'm doing this
'cause it keeps people happy </joey>
<joey> without me to pressure you to go up 10%." </joey>
<connor> - I'm changing the world,
you might react that way. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, it's like, you know, I get it. </joey>
<joey> Some people it's like that routine </joey>
<joey> because I thought that if someone's video </joey>
<garnt> even though it's dumb is like,
you know, maybe help me out. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - So I've just come to, I don't know, man. </garnt>
<connor> It's hard to explain.
- It's always nice, </connor>
<garnt> it's always humbling because
what we see on our side </garnt>
<garnt> is just a number.
- It's so, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - A number means nothing, but
when we go to a convention </joey>
<joey> and we see a room full of people </joey>
<garnt> and it's like putting of
like actual people and faces </garnt>
<garnt> and interactions to
those numbers it's like, </garnt>
<garnt> unless you've experienced that
you can't really describe it, </garnt>
<garnt> you know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> It's very humbling and
it's very flattering </garnt>
<garnt> and you don't quite
know what the right way </garnt>
<connor> to react to it is. </connor>
<garnt> So we just hope that we
react in a way that one, </garnt>
<garnt> doesn't make you feel bad
and two, doesn't make us seem </garnt>
<connor> like conceited ourselves in anime as well. </connor>
<connor> - I just want you if you know
me and you come up to me, </connor>
<garnt> just have like, go away from
that interaction thing of, </garnt>
<joey> damn, always everything
I wanted them to be. </joey>
<connor> That's all I want and it's so hard </connor>
<connor> because sometimes I'm like,
did I say the right thing, </connor>
<garnt> should I have squeezed them
a little harder with the hug, </garnt>
<garnt> should I have shaken their hand longer? </garnt>
<garnt> - Like sometimes every
time after convention, </garnt>
<garnt> like I wake up in a cold sweat to be like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Man was I an asshole to that one person." </garnt>
<joey> Like I was just trying to get food, like-- </joey>
<joey> - Like we gonna get canceled,
we gonna get canceled. </joey>
<garnt> - And it's also like, you know, </garnt>
<joey> 'cause some people they
always like want a little more </joey>
<garnt> and it's hard 'cause you like, </garnt>
<garnt> especially if you're
going out for like dinner </garnt>
<garnt> with your anime friends, it's like, </garnt>
<garnt> oh, man, I really don't
want them to be like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Damn, Connor is an asshole, </garnt>
<joey> he wouldn't let me eat with him." </joey>
<garnt> And it's like, "Well, I mean-- </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, for some reason,
I don't give a shit about </connor>
<garnt> the one hate comment or like the haters-- </garnt>
<garnt> - I know, right, right. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, you see on a YouTube comment, </garnt>
<garnt> but the thoughts of this guy
trashing me to his friends, </garnt>
<garnt> just fucking keeps me up, </garnt>
<joey> that fucking keeps me up at night, man. </joey>
<garnt> - It's so real, right? </garnt>
<garnt> It's so real. </garnt>
<joey> - I could be totally in the
right and being fuck off, </joey>
<joey> but I can't do it because I'm like, </joey>
<joey> "Man, this guy respect me so much </joey>
<joey> and I really don't wanna be mean. </joey>
<joey> And I'm trying to explain it so nicely, </joey>
<joey> but he's just not getting it sometimes. </joey>
<connor> - Because, you know, there's
a little part of you where </connor>
<joey> if the roles were reversed, you'd be like, </joey>
<joey> "Man, I think I was a fucking asshole." </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Which, by the way, </garnt>
<garnt> shout out to that guy I met in Akihabara, </garnt>
<garnt> who I told the story about for
being a good sport about it, </garnt>
<garnt> you know, it was an awkward interaction, </garnt>
<garnt> but thank you for being
good sport about it. </garnt>
<garnt> You know, I saw your
comments and everything. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So, yeah, I mean-- </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, bottom line, we
appreciate every single person </garnt>
<garnt> that comes up to us. </garnt>
<joey> It's just that sometimes every
now and then there's just </joey>
<joey> that one really weird person. </joey>
<joey> - Just like, you know, social-- </joey>
<joey> - Just be a norm, just be you. </joey>
<connor> - Just be you. </connor>
<connor> Understand that social norms
do exist in anime conventions-- </connor>
<connor> - Basically, you know, pretty
now, you're trash taster, </connor>
<connor> you're my dude now, come on. </connor>
<joey> - Just okay, I think
the best way to what is, </joey>
<joey> treat us no differently how
you would just treat a stranger </joey>
<joey> 'cause, you know, it's </joey>
<joey> how I would explain my past relationships </joey>
<joey> where I've watched people,
you know, on YouTube </joey>
<joey> that, you know, you do
feel like a connection with </joey>
<joey> because you feel like you do know them, </joey>
<joey> but you have to understand that
that's a one way connection. </joey>
<joey> You wouldn't go up to a
random stranger and be like, </joey>
<joey> "Yo, bro I know everything
you've done, you know, </joey>
<joey> I know your entire life
story, let's be friends." </joey>
<joey> You know, there are
several steps for both ends </joey>
<joey> when it comes to making friends </joey>
<garnt> whether you know the person or not. </garnt>
<garnt> And our perspective is, we don't know you, </garnt>
<garnt> you know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> So as long as you just come
in with that perspective-- </garnt>
<garnt> - That is the worst
question I hated the most, </garnt>
<connor> "Can we be friends?" </connor>
<connor> It's the worst question. </connor>
<joey> Because is like-- </joey>
<joey> - It's so loaded. </joey>
<joey> - Like how on earth do you
expect like me to answer that? </joey>
<joey> Like, "Yo, we're best friends, </joey>
<joey> here's my fucking phone number. </joey>
<joey> We're going on vacation next week, </joey>
<joey> why don't you come join us?" </joey>
<joey> - By the way, what's your name? </joey>
<joey> - It's so--
- You don't make friends </joey>
<garnt> by asking someone, "Can we be friends?" </garnt>
<garnt> - Right, like, I feel
like asking that question, </garnt>
<connor> you never win as the person
asking that question, </connor>
<joey> you're gonna get what you
want and you all you're doing </joey>
<joey> is making the situation
awkward for everyone involved. </joey>
<joey> I have to explain to you be
like, "So, I don't know you. </joey>
<connor> I would like to, you know,
I'm happy to talk to you </connor>
<connor> and get to know you a little better. </connor>
<joey> - And I hate that talk too </joey>
<connor> because it makes you sound
like an asshole, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I don't wanna,
'cause it makes me feel </connor>
<connor> like I'm like putting them below me. </connor>
<joey> Yeah, you don't have
the right to be friends. </joey>
<joey> It's not like that. </joey>
<joey> - You don't have enough subs to be like-- </joey>
<joey> - Right, but it's so difficult </joey>
<joey> because there's no way
of really explaining that </joey>
<joey> without making it sound like
you're in the better position </joey>
<garnt> with like, "Hey, no, no." </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Well, the way I would think about it is, </connor>
<connor> I mean, like I said, "You
wouldn't ask a person that you, </connor>
<garnt> whether they're famous or
not you've just met kinda, </garnt>
<garnt> "Hey, can we be friends?" </garnt>
<garnt> - True, true, true.
- Like 90% of the time, </garnt>
<garnt> they're gonna be like,
"I mean, I don't know you </garnt>
<garnt> and you don't know me."
- Who are you? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, like can we get
to know each other first-- </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah, exactly.
- And then we can decide. </garnt>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But not through asking that question. </joey>
<joey> - True. </joey>
<joey> - Now I'm actually just curious, </joey>
<joey> like once conventions do
start to open up again, </joey>
<connor> I wonder how many people are
gonna come up to us being like, </connor>
<connor> "Yo, Joey from Trash Tastes, right?" </connor>
<connor> - Oh, Trash Taste as opposed to channel? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, as opposed to like the Anime Man. </connor>
<joey> I'm genuinely curious. </joey>
<joey> - Who knows man, who knows? </joey>
<connor> - Because I'm sure there's
like some Trash Taste viewers </connor>
<joey> who don't watch like
our individual channels. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, for sure, for sure. </connor>
<connor> - Or probably don't, never knew us </connor>
<joey> before Trash Taste, right? </joey>
<connor> So I'm just curious like who's
gonna be the first person </connor>
<joey> to be like, "Yo, it's Joey,
Garnt, Connor from Trash Taste." </joey>
<joey> - I've gotta love that. </joey>
<garnt> - That's gotta be fucking cool. </garnt>
<joey> - I just miss, I just miss all like </joey>
<joey> all the mispronunciation of my username. </joey>
<joey> I have like a fucking list of
all the missed pronunciations </joey>
<joey> of like everyone who's
tried to pronounce Gigguk. </joey>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - Dude I get that too and I'm like, </joey>
<joey> I remember I had one guy
at Anime Expo being like, </joey>
<joey> "Yo, are you Josh the Anime Man?" </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "What, it's not even close." </joey>
<joey> - Wasn't that that one
guy who like, who like-- </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, in Singapore, right?
- Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - Who was like, "Are you Gigguk?" </joey>
<joey> Meanwhile, Garnt is
standing right next to me. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "Ah, no,
that's Gigguk actually." </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Oh my God!
- He was my fucking favorite. </joey>
<joey> - How do you do that? </joey>
<joey> - I don't know, like,
oh, yeah, it's hilarious. </joey>
<joey> Well, either way we
fucking miss conventions. </joey>
<connor> I'm sure if you're a convention goer, </connor>
<connor> you probably miss convention. </connor>
<connor> - We would go to any
conventions invite us please. </connor>
<joey> - Just invite us.
- And honestly-- </joey>
<joey> - I'm sure we have some other
stories that we've forgotten </joey>
<garnt> or something that we can tell. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, let's be more in future, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause we'll just tell them. </garnt>
<garnt> Also if you want us to go
to a convention with you, </garnt>
<garnt> when they eventually open
up, the best way to do it </garnt>
<connor> is to like email the convention yourself </connor>
<connor> and tell them you want to see us </connor>
<garnt> that is by far the best
way to get us going </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause the owners don't know who you want, </garnt>
<garnt> so you have to actually tell them. </garnt>
<joey> Don't tell us, we can't
do shit just saying. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, don't like, </connor>
<joey> we get so many like
emails and tweets coming </joey>
<garnt> like, "Hey, can you come
to this conventions?" </garnt>
<garnt> Is like we- </garnt>
<garnt> - We don't make that decision. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, we don't make that decisions. </garnt>
<connor> - We get the invites from a convention, </connor>
<connor> so if there's enough interest
for your local convention-- </connor>
<garnt> - That's like saying like, </garnt>
<joey> "Hey, can you go to this
random person's wedding?" </joey>
<garnt> It's like, "I didn't get the
invite dude, I can't go." </garnt>
<joey> - It's like bro you're playing
at this concert, right? </joey>
<joey> Like you're playing this gig. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, can you go to the gig? </joey>
<joey> - It's like, "No, I can't, no." </joey>
<joey> Yeah, so let your like,
you know, local convention </joey>
<joey> or whatever know who you want. </joey>
<connor> - I wanna go anywhere in the
world even after the virus. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, honestly, like conventions, </connor>
<joey> I fucking love conventions
because it gives me the-- </joey>
<garnt> - And whatever travel, </garnt>
<connor> and whatever conventions
