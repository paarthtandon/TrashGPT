<garnt> - Who left this dent on the table? </garnt>
<garnt> I would like to know this.
It's been here a while. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm going to say Chris. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - And who was the last person
sitting in this point point? </garnt>
<garnt> Chris. </garnt>
<joey> - Well, technically it was me. </joey>
<joey> - We're blaming on Chris.
- I don't know. </joey>
<joey> - Must have been Chris. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> (upbeat music) </garnt>
<garnt> - Hello and welcome back to Trash Taste. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm your host for today, Garnt. </garnt>
<garnt> And once again with me are the boys. </garnt>
<joey> - That's me. </joey>
<joey> - This is technically our first </joey>
<joey> Trash Taste recording
of 2021, even though. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, you just stated it. </joey>
<joey> - I know (laughs) I know, I know. </joey>
<garnt> - The matter is ruined. </garnt>
<garnt> - The immersion, Gar. </garnt>
<connor> The immersion is ruined. </connor>
<connor> - People can tell, like, </connor>
<garnt> I like how people are
able to tell the time line </garnt>
<garnt> of when Trash Taste recordings happen now </garnt>
<garnt> based on Joey's hair. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - Like, because it's
like one week I was like, </garnt>
<joey> oh, he has a lot of hair. </joey>
<joey> And then the next week is
like, oh, he has no hair. </joey>
<joey> - It's your hair and my beard. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause like one week I just
decided I'm gonna grow a beard. </joey>
<garnt> And then-- </garnt>
<joey> - We are the sun dale of
Trash Taste basically. </joey>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </joey>
<joey> It's like I'm calculating
the shading of Garnt's face. </joey>
<joey> And I can definitely guess
its sometime around January. </joey>
<connor> - I like the beard on you,
Garnt. I think it suits you. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I think it looks good. </joey>
<garnt> - I think I did it literally
after a Trash Taste recording. </garnt>
<joey> When I went back after that recording </joey>
<garnt> where we talked about beards and I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Sydney, should I grow a beard?" </garnt>
<garnt> And Sydney is like, "Just do it, why not?" </garnt>
<garnt> And yeah, I kinda like it
now. It's a grown on me. </garnt>
<garnt> Pun intended. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm already getting the dad jokes now. </garnt>
<garnt> - Shave it off right now. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> Jesus. </garnt>
<garnt> - But yeah, we've just come back </garnt>
<garnt> from our Christmas holidays, which is, </garnt>
<garnt> I think this was one of the
first Christmas holidays </garnt>
<garnt> that actually felt like
Christmas holiday for me. </garnt>
<garnt> Because normally Christmas holidays </garnt>
<garnt> are the busiest time of the year for me </garnt>
<garnt> because I'm trying to get
like my end of year video out. </garnt>
<garnt> And then I don't know
what switched in my mind </garnt>
<garnt> to make me realize </garnt>
<garnt> what if I just don't do that
and give myself some time off. </garnt>
<garnt> But then I put the video
out sometime next month. </garnt>
<joey> - Garnt discovers the word no. </joey>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </joey>
<joey> For the first time, he's like-- </joey>
<joey> - Taking a break. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. I can say that now. </garnt>
<joey> - Wait a minute. </joey>
<garnt> You mean the expectations
were just all in my head </garnt>
<garnt> and no one really cares if
I just delayed the video </garnt>
<garnt> for like a few weeks? </garnt>
<garnt> - Never trust anyone. Not even yourself. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </garnt>
<garnt> - You mean I was my own worst enemy? </garnt>
<connor> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </connor>
<connor> - I feel I, one, I'm just
recover from being sick. </connor>
<garnt> So if I'm a little quiet-- </garnt>
<garnt> - He doesn't have Covid, don't worry guys. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. I'm negative boys. </joey>
<connor> I'm also negative in
life. I'm always negative. </connor>
<garnt> - You just described yourself. </garnt>
<joey> - I'm a negative person. </joey>
<garnt> - I'm just negative. </garnt>
<garnt> - What happened? </garnt>
<joey> Like you had like a sore
throat or something? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. I had like a
really bad sore throat </connor>
<connor> and then it just kinda went
and now I'm in the last days </connor>
<joey> where I still sound sick,
but I feel totally fine. </joey>
<connor> But just-- </connor>
<joey> - You, you were sipping that
Manuka honey over there though. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Do Manuka honey is opious fine. </connor>
<connor> - It is, it is. </connor>
<garnt> - It just costs an arm and a leg. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> That's the problem, I
remember I saw the other day, </garnt>
<garnt> it was like a jar, this
big, of Manuka honey, </garnt>
<garnt> maybe like that, it was like 60 bucks. </garnt>
<garnt> - What is Manuka honey? </garnt>
<garnt> - It's this-- </garnt>
<garnt> - From a plant, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - No, it's a type of
honey made from a certain, </garnt>
<connor> I think species of bee that's
only found in New Zealand. </connor>
<connor> - I know it's New Zealand. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. It's like a Kiwi bee basically. </connor>
<garnt> And it's like halfway between, </garnt>
<connor> I remember 'cause I saw a
whole business insider video </connor>
<connor> on this. </connor>
<joey> It's like, yeah, 'cause
they did like a, you know-- </joey>
<connor> - I thought they pollinated
something really specific </connor>
<joey> like this is the-- </joey>
<joey> - It's probably. </joey>
<joey> - This is the honey
that it spanked on this. </joey>
<joey> - I'm sure it's something
like the bee takes the pollen </joey>
<connor> from a specific plant and
only makes honey out of that </connor>
<connor> or something like that. But yeah. </connor>
<connor> I know it's like a Kiwi thing </connor>
<connor> and the reason is because like
just the whole process of it </connor>
<connor> is really long and arduous. </connor>
<connor> And also it's halfway between
Royal jelly and honey, I think </connor>
<connor> that's how it kind of works. I
don't know. I don't remember. </connor>
<connor> - I always recommend it. </connor>
<connor> It's really hard to recommend
'cause people are like, </connor>
<connor> "You're paying how much
for a jar of honey?" </connor>
<garnt> - Can I not just buy honey? </garnt>
<connor> - No, no, no. </connor>
<connor> - Just normal honey. </connor>
<joey> - It doesn't do the same thing. </joey>
<joey> - Normal peasant, honey bee, honey. </joey>
<garnt> - Peasant like peasant bee. </garnt>
<joey> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </joey>
<joey> - When you pour honey, it pours. </joey>
<joey> The like Manuka honey stuff doesn't pour. </joey>
<joey> - It's like molasses. </joey>
<joey> - It literally is like a block. </joey>
<garnt> And I normally like if I scream a bunch </garnt>
<garnt> or I'm doing a lot of voice acting, </garnt>
<garnt> I'll normally just take
like a little teaspoon. </garnt>
<garnt> Not fill it up just like a
little bit. I'll just eat it-- </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. I don't know why, </garnt>
<garnt> because there are a lot of
products that are very expensive, </garnt>
<garnt> and I'd say that they're
not that much different </garnt>
<connor> from the base product. </connor>
<connor> Like Manuka, honey versus normal honey. </connor>
<connor> But Manuka, honey. </connor>
<connor> I don't know what it is. I
don't know if it is a placebo, </connor>
<connor> - but--
- It could be placebo. </connor>
<connor> - It could be a placebo, but
every time I've taken some </connor>
<garnt> it's like my sore throat
just immediately goes away. </garnt>
<joey> - It's that whole thing of like, </joey>
<joey> are you wearing a product
or are you wearing a brand? </joey>
<joey> Kind of thing. </joey>
<joey> When it comes to like
clothes, for example. </joey>
<garnt> - Yo, these bees like
minted by Louis Vulton </garnt>
<garnt> like, what's going on there? </garnt>
<joey> - If you look really close
on the side of the body, </joey>
<joey> it says LV. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </joey>
<joey> - They're like branded with LV. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </joey>
<garnt> - Then the bees coming in
with like the drip jacket, </garnt>
<joey> like hello. </joey>
<joey> - They come to the flower like, </joey>
<garnt> "Hello, I'm here to pollinate you." </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </garnt>
<joey> - Correction, Manuka honey
is not from a specific bee </joey>
<garnt> it's from the Manuka flower. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, it is a flower. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. So it's a specific
plant they pollinate. </connor>
<joey> - You confused me, I said plant-- </joey>
<joey> - Sorry, sorry. </joey>
<joey> - Then Joey came in like
a wrecking ball with bees </joey>
<garnt> and I'm like, hold on. I'm
pretty sure it's a plant. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay. It's the plant
wearing the drip jackets then. </garnt>
<connor> - Should have been more aggressive. </connor>
<garnt> I know Joey, it's a plant. </garnt>
<joey> - I disagree. </joey>
<joey> - Half this podcast is
that doesn't sound right. </joey>
<joey> But my, Manuka honey knowledge, </joey>
<joey> isn't enough to dispute you on that. </joey>
<joey> - People have Google. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. 'Cause I've
tried a bunch of things. </joey>
<garnt> I've tried that really
expensive pink Himalayan salt. </garnt>
<joey> That is the, most of the cost
goes in into mining this salt. </joey>
<garnt> 'Cause it's like one of the rarest salts, </garnt>
<garnt> one of the hardest salts to mine. </garnt>
<connor> - True, they sell at my supermarket. </connor>
<garnt> They sell at my supermarket. </garnt>
<garnt> - Do they actually? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I've got some. </garnt>
<connor> It's probably not real
from it is two bucks. </connor>
<connor> - It's definitely not
sea with pink dye on it. </connor>
<connor> - It's probably sea pink diet, </connor>
<connor> but it says Himalayan salt on it. </connor>
<joey> Got it for like 150 Yen. </joey>
<joey> - That ain't right. </joey>
<connor> (Connor and Joey laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - I actually tried the
second, most expensive, </garnt>
<garnt> I think it's the second most, </garnt>
<garnt> but it's one of the most
expensive coffee beans </garnt>
<joey> in the world. </joey>
<joey> Which is how they harvest this coffee bean </joey>
<connor> is I believe it's like this, the cat poop. </connor>
<garnt> - We've seen the bucket list, Garnt. </garnt>
<garnt> We've seen the movie. We know. </garnt>
<garnt> - Wait what? </garnt>
<garnt> - That's why it became really popular </garnt>
<connor> 'cause in the bucket list,
there was this whole big joke </connor>
<connor> in the movie was the
fact that he didn't know </connor>
<connor> this expensive coffee
this rich guy was buying </connor>
<garnt> was from pooped out cat. </garnt>
<connor> - Which film was this? </connor>
<joey> - "The Bucket List" with Morgan
Freeman and Jack Nicholson. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh that one. Okay. I
haven't seen that one. </garnt>
<joey> - I don't know why. I know
that movie, I've never seen it. </joey>
<garnt> - I just know it's that like-- </garnt>
<joey> - I thought you were just
talking about a bucket list, </joey>
<joey> a default bucket list that everyone has. </joey>
<garnt> - "The Bucket List". </garnt>
<joey> - This is why that coffee
became so well known. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, I've never known that. </garnt>
<joey> Well it was obviously
it was a thing before. </joey>
<joey> It was a massive part of
the movie was a big joke </joey>
<joey> that this guy was like, he was like, </joey>
<garnt> "I have to have this coffee." </garnt>
<garnt> And he didn't know this whole
time that he was eating like, </garnt>
<garnt> cat that was pooping it out. </garnt>
<connor> - It's not actually cats.
It's a kind of like--- </connor>
<connor> - It's like a mountain. </connor>
<garnt> - Like a mountain, </garnt>
<garnt> Like a big joke in the movie </garnt>
<garnt> is that he's eating the poop beans. </garnt>
<garnt> And he's like, and then yeah-- </garnt>
<garnt> - And Hillarian shoes. </garnt>
<joey> - That's why it became so well known. </joey>
<connor> That's why everyone knows it, Garnt. </connor>
<connor> - What I'm more surprised of the fact that </connor>
<joey> they talk about that in "The Bucket List" </joey>
<joey> is the fact that you've
seen "The Bucket List". </joey>
<connor> - What do you mean? It's
it's an amazing fit. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't know, you're the
only one I know who's seen it. </garnt>
<connor> - Jack Dickson and Morgan Freeman. </connor>
<connor> And you're gonna sit and tell
me you don't wanna watch it. </connor>
<joey> - It was one of those movies
that I saw like in my, </joey>
<joey> oh, I'm dating myself here. </joey>
<joey> I saw at my local
blockbuster back in the day. </joey>
<joey> - Oh my God, Joey. </joey>
<joey> - I would say, it was one of those ones </joey>
<connor> that was always on that
highlighted shelf of like, </connor>
<joey> these are the talked about movies. </joey>
<joey> It was always smack bang in the middle. </joey>
<joey> It was fucking Jack Nicholson,
Morgan Freeman doing that, </joey>
<joey> like that kind of face. </joey>
<joey> It just says "The Bucket List". </joey>
<connor> That looks boring. </connor>
<connor> - Why did you not watch "The Bucket List"? </connor>
<joey> - I don't know. It's
just never interested me. </joey>
<joey> - I didn't even know about it until now. </joey>
<connor> - It's very good. </connor>
<garnt> - How did they react to it in the movie? </garnt>
<connor> - He was like shocked obviously. </connor>
<connor> And distraught that he'd
been eating the beans. </connor>
<garnt> - Did he enjoy the coffee? </garnt>
<connor> Was it good coffee? </connor>
<garnt> - No, so he was obsessed with this coffee, </garnt>
<garnt> but he didn't know where it was from. </garnt>
<garnt> And because Jack Nicholson in the movie </garnt>
<garnt> plays a very wealthy man, </garnt>
<garnt> he has all the money in the world. </garnt>
<garnt> And Morgan Freeman is in the
same hospital room as him </garnt>
<garnt> and his has no money. </garnt>
<garnt> It's this whole joke of
Morgan Freeman's like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh, by the way, I found
out about those beans </garnt>
<garnt> "that you like so much,
the cats poop them out." </garnt>
<garnt> And then it's like, "Haha,
rich man eats poop." </garnt>
<connor> That was it. </connor>
<connor> - It was the tagline for
the movie, "The Bucket List" </connor>
<joey> - "Rich man eats poop."
- "Rich man eats poop." </joey>
<joey> - It's very good. </joey>
<joey> It it's a very good movie.
I'm not selling you on. </joey>
<connor> It's really good. It's really good. </connor>
<garnt> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </garnt>
<joey> - Man, "Rich man eats
poop." That's selling me on. </joey>
<garnt> - Connor sells a movie. </garnt>
<joey> So this rich guy eats shit. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Oh, my God. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I tried it and
it was just, it was-- </garnt>
<connor> - Because Sydney gave it to me </connor>
<connor> and Sydney was making
this massive ceremony </connor>
<connor> about how it's the biggest
fucking deal on earth. </connor>
<garnt> - I've had it before as well.
And it's a good up of coffee. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] It's a good cup of coffee. </garnt>
<connor> - But is it like to die for? No. </connor>
<connor> - I'll be honest. I can tell-- </connor>
<garnt> - Would I put it on my bucket list? </garnt>
<connor> Probably not. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know how much Sydney grinded </connor>
<connor> when she made our cups of coffee. </connor>
<connor> Because when she made our cups of coffee, </connor>
<connor> it was like I had three, a
triple espresso or something. </connor>
<garnt> Me and Sydney were just
sitting in our chairs, </garnt>
<garnt> being like, "Honey, I know it's Christmas, </garnt>
<garnt> "but I think I need to
go out and go for a run. </garnt>
<garnt> "I just had so much energy </garnt>
<garnt> "that I couldn't even think straight." </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] Oh my God.
- [Connor] It's poop man. </joey>
<garnt> - It's the poop. It's the poop. </garnt>
<joey> - It's the poop poop. </joey>
<garnt> - It it's the poop. It's the poop poop. </garnt>
<connor> What is it about poop? </connor>
<garnt> Because I was actually
researching this right. </garnt>
<connor> - Well we just to not talk about poop. </connor>
<connor> Of course Scott somehow brought it up. </connor>
<connor> - It's Trash Taste. </connor>
<garnt> - It's trash Taste. Of course. </garnt>
<connor> - You were researching poop. Okay. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, cause after that I
was researching the coffee. </garnt>
<garnt> And that used to be the most
expensive coffee in the world, </garnt>
<garnt> I assume because of "The Bucket List". </garnt>
<garnt> But now there's a more expensive coffee, </garnt>
<garnt> which is based on elephant
poop and it comes from Thailand </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm just like, what is it? </garnt>
<garnt> What is up with-- </garnt>
<connor> - What's stopping me from
ingesting coffee beans, </connor>
<connor> pooping them out and then just
putting the highest price tag </connor>
<garnt> on it and labeling it. </garnt>
<garnt> - The Sea Dog VA espresso. </garnt>
<connor> - The Sea Dog VA expressway. </connor>
<joey> - I've actually seen
a Japanese YouTube do. </joey>
<joey> - No. </joey>
<joey> - Actually no way. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. They did it. </joey>
<joey> - No way. </joey>
<garnt> - It was absolutely disgusting. </garnt>
<joey> No, I'm not gonna describe
the video obviously. </joey>
<joey> But just, you get a sense of the idea. </joey>
<joey> - Why? Did he sell it? </joey>
<connor> - No, you didn't sell it.
He got friends to drink it. </connor>
<garnt> - Got it. Trying to drink it. </garnt>
<joey> You are eating, you're drinking my shit. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] You're drinking my shit. </joey>
<joey> - Your trash tastes special. </joey>
<garnt> - I don't know how that's
on YouTube. It's disgusting. </garnt>
<garnt> - Why does YouTube play for different-- </garnt>
<garnt> - That reminds me of the story I saw </garnt>
<garnt> about the reality TV star </garnt>
<garnt> that started selling their fats. </garnt>
<garnt> (joey laughs) </garnt>
<joey> Did you hear about this? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And then she got a heart
attack because of that. </joey>
<joey> - And then she farted so much </joey>
<joey> that it gave her gastritis
or stomach problems </joey>
<joey> that she thought she had a heart attack </joey>
<joey> and had to go an A$E. </joey>
<joey> And so-- </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] What an amazing story? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. And so after that,
she's just like, you know what? </joey>
<connor> I should stop selling farts. </connor>
<connor> So what does she do? She
starts selling farts as NFTs. </connor>
<connor> - Are you serious? </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] I am deadly serious. </connor>
<connor> - This is a month old news by
the time you're watching this, </connor>
<connor> but it was very dumb. It was so stupid. </connor>
<connor> - I'm seeing this and I'm
just like, you know what? </connor>
<connor> Can we go back to black mirror? </connor>
<garnt> Can we please go back to black mirror? </garnt>
<garnt> That is the future that I want. </garnt>
<connor> - All these game companies
as well being like NFTs, </connor>
<garnt> we like them. And it's like, yeah, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause you can make money from them. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause you can rip us off. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. So sometimes you
just sigh at the future. </garnt>
<garnt> Sometimes you-- </garnt>
<joey> - Wait, wait. Hold on, hold on. Back up. </joey>
<joey> How do you, she's selling
her farts as an NFT? </joey>
<connor> - I don't know how that works. </connor>
<connor> I don't, you know, I maybe-- </connor>
<joey> - Is she's selling a picture
of her farting into a jar </joey>
<joey> as an NFT. </joey>
<connor> - Maybe she farts on the
keyboard and then there's some-- </connor>
<joey> - The fart infuse letter E-- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, you know how like in the movies, </joey>
<connor> when there's, someone's typed
in their code on the PC, </connor>
<connor> you blow the dust on it. </connor>
<joey> - You see the fingerprint. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. Basically what
happens is that she just farts </connor>
<connor> on the keyboard and whenever
the fart is like traced </connor>
<connor> on the board, she types out the numbers. </connor>
<garnt> - Maybe she has a fart scanner
where digitizes her farts </garnt>
<garnt> into bits and that gets
converted to an NFT, </garnt>
<garnt> which can put on the blockchain. </garnt>
<joey> - Here's my fart binary. </joey>
<garnt> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </garnt>
<connor> - God, I hate the internet
so much right now. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, they recently,
Japan just made a screen </garnt>
<joey> that you could taste. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah. The likable screen. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. The likable screen. </garnt>
<garnt> - So it's all concepts.
Mayland's like salivating, </garnt>
<connor> which you like saw that. </connor>
<connor> - I never wanna lick a screen. </connor>
<connor> It's like half the good foods
because of the textures. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. What I wanna
know is like this screen, </garnt>
<garnt> like the screens are like
dirty enough as it is. </garnt>
<garnt> And you're telling me that
there's gonna be people </garnt>
<garnt> constantly licking the screen. </garnt>
<garnt> Are you gonna have to clean
it every time you have </garnt>
<garnt> a single leak? </garnt>
<joey> - Have we not learned
anything from this pandemic? </joey>
<joey> - That is literally the
worst idea in the world. </joey>
<connor> - Why did you have to announce it now? </connor>
<connor> - No, I bet George, your
fans would be happy. </connor>
<joey> - Like, oh my God, I can (laughs) </joey>
<garnt> Finally, I can leave out
my dream of liking sweat. </garnt>
<joey> Jesus Christ. </joey>
<joey> Oh my God. I, I just can't
get over the fart NFT. </joey>
<connor> It's pretty bad. </connor>
<connor> - I wonder, I just wanna
know how it works now. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know. I thought we had kids. </garnt>
<garnt> - Can you Google this actually for us? </garnt>
<joey> - Can you Google fart NFT? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - How this works please. </connor>
<garnt> - I thought humanity had hit its low </garnt>
<joey> when Belle Delphine was
selling her bath water. </joey>
<joey> Who knew that that was just the beginning? </joey>
<garnt> She was trying to warn us of the future. </garnt>
<joey> - I think a lot of people
sell their bath water now. </joey>
<joey> - That was but the Genesis </joey>
<joey> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </joey>
<joey> of the apocalypse. </joey>
<joey> Oh my God. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. I'm sure a lot of
people sell bath water now. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm sure a lot people-- </garnt>
<connor> - Oh yeah, sure. </connor>
<garnt> - No one buys it. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'll be honest. I don't
browse only fans so much, so-- </garnt>
<connor> - So much (laughs) you
proud as only fans at all. </connor>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. I don't browse only fans. </garnt>
<garnt> So I don't know. </garnt>
<joey> - Garnt has a secret only fans
account but We don't know. </joey>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> Just comes out. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. I don't know what
people are selling on only fans. </garnt>
<joey> I don't know if I wanna
know what people are selling </joey>
<joey> on only fans, if this is the
kind of that gets leaked out </joey>
<garnt> to the mainstream media. </garnt>
<joey> - I thought that when I
saw the bath water thing, </joey>
<garnt> I already thought that was ridiculous. </garnt>
<joey> But like, even before that,
there was those places </joey>
<joey> that were selling, you
ever see those like places </joey>
<joey> that were selling cans filled with air? </joey>
<joey> Yeah. Like the, this is a
can filled with Hawaiian air. </joey>
<garnt> And I'm like, really? </garnt>
<joey> How did you get that air? </joey>
<joey> Did you just go to
Hawaii? Go like that or? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, just open the jar. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. Just open the jar. </joey>
<garnt> - Well, I guess how is that
different from spring water? </garnt>
<garnt> - Spring water makes more sense. </garnt>
<connor> - I can understand why someone
might make an argument. </connor>
<garnt> I don't give a fuck. I'll drink. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't give a fuck. </garnt>
<joey> - I'll put my mouth over the whole tap. </joey>
<joey> - Get the full essence. </joey>
<joey> - I want the lime scale of norm. </joey>
<joey> But I guess some people are
picky. They don't want it, </joey>
<garnt> but normally the whole bottled
water is just like tap water. </garnt>
<garnt> They just add like a bunch of
minerals. Yeah. Just add shit. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, you mean minerals? </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean minerals. </garnt>
<garnt> - Elements. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - Elements. </connor>
<connor> - I mean elements. </connor>
<connor> - Not incorrect. Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Two shots of lead. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, it's like beauty products. </garnt>
<garnt> Where beauty products, like
they market the story to you </garnt>
<garnt> as like, oh, we got this. </garnt>
<garnt> We got this product from the
mountains of the Himalayas </garnt>
<garnt> where the only freshest tree
grows or something like that. </garnt>
<garnt> But it's just someone
in a lab that made it. </garnt>
<garnt> And they put, they stuck
a label on it. It's-- </garnt>
<connor> - [Joey] Pretty much. </connor>
<connor> - It's no different. </connor>
<connor> I haven't done it up my
research on where spring, </connor>
<connor> where bottled war actually comes from. </connor>
<connor> - Do you care? </connor>
<connor> - No, I don't care. </connor>
<garnt> That was a very, noest of nos </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm like men, I'm like I will say-- </garnt>
<joey> - You can not dismiss
that argument any faster. </joey>
<joey> Do you care? No. </joey>
<joey> - I just wanna know.
Did you actually care? </joey>
<garnt> - No. </garnt>
<garnt> - Before go down this argument
and start talking about this. </garnt>
<garnt> - I Don't care. I'm like. </garnt>
<garnt> - I saw those documentaries
where it's like Nestle. </garnt>
<garnt> Where they just go into like
towns of America and just take </garnt>
<garnt> all their drinking water
and then just sell it </garnt>
<garnt> as bottled water. 'cause they
add ,I don't know, like-- </garnt>
<connor> - A label to it. </connor>
<connor> - They add like a one, zero milligram </connor>
<connor> of chlorine or something. </connor>
<connor> And then they're like,
now it's treated water. </connor>
<connor> It's no longer tap water. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. But wasn't like a
massive controversy in England </garnt>
<garnt> at least was the fact that Dasani. </garnt>
<garnt> So Dasani is still in America.
If I remember correctly, </garnt>
<garnt> Dasani still in America, </garnt>
<garnt> but the reason Dasani is
not sold in England anymore </garnt>
<garnt> is 'cause there was
this massive controversy </garnt>
<garnt> where Dasani marketed it
as fresh spring water. </garnt>
<garnt> But it got found out that
they were just selling bottled </garnt>
<garnt> tap water. </garnt>
<garnt> - But the tap was coming from
a spring or something anyway. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah. But obviously the
people in the UK are very, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know how to explain it. </garnt>
<garnt> Stuff like that really
piss British people off. </garnt>
<connor> The fact that you would
try and sell us something </connor>
<connor> that is just so basic is
something so much more. </connor>
<joey> - I'm just wondering if it's spring water, </joey>
<joey> but it's connected to a
tap and that spring water </joey>
<joey> is coming out of a tap. Is it spring water </joey>
<joey> or is it tap water? </joey>
<connor> - It's a spring, tap water. </connor>
<connor> It's just taped spring water.
It's whatever you want. </connor>
<joey> - We've entered the water matter. Right? </joey>
<garnt> - Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm gonna bring you a step
deeper in the water matter. </garnt>
<garnt> So onsen culture in Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> Are you gonna tell me that
every single onsen water, </garnt>
<garnt> is every single onsen we go
to just fresh from the earth </garnt>
<garnt> or is it just like, where
does that water come from? </garnt>
<joey> - It's from the ground,
but it's through a tap. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah it's through a tap. </garnt>
<joey> - So is it hot springs-- </joey>
<garnt> - Why are you bringing this up? </garnt>
<joey> or is it just tap water? </joey>
<garnt> - Are you just taking a bath in tap water </garnt>
<garnt> like everyone else? </garnt>
<connor> - No, Joey, no. </connor>
<joey> - Because tap water has
to come from somewhere. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </joey>
<joey> A spring perhaps. </joey>
<connor> - I think tap water
implies that it's the grid, </connor>
<joey> the national system. </joey>
<connor> Not the thing you're
taking onset bath guys. </connor>
<garnt> - Because I see some onsens
have the water get delivered </garnt>
<garnt> to them by trucks. Not tap water. </garnt>
<garnt> They get it delivered by trucks. </garnt>
<garnt> And I think, well, is
it like, I don't know-- </garnt>
<connor> - The onset is, from what
I understand is like, </connor>
<connor> it's the stuff in the
water, like the minerals </connor>
<connor> from whatever they dig out of the-- </connor>
<joey> - So there's a clear
difference between an onsen </joey>
<connor> and a cental, which is a bathhouse. </connor>
<connor> A cental is just hot water. </connor>
<connor> There's no minerals in it. </connor>
<garnt> It doesn't have like any of like that, </garnt>
<garnt> natural stuff that makes it healthier. </garnt>
<garnt> And then an onsen is the
stuff that is mineralized </garnt>
<connor> from the ground, like onsen water. </connor>
<connor> But I think most people just assume that </connor>
<joey> oh, bathhouse equals
onsen, which it doesn't. </joey>
<garnt> It's two different things. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because I do notice,
depending on the onsen we go to, </garnt>
<garnt> the water is very different
depending on where you go. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh yeah. There's like 30 different types </connor>
<joey> sort of ridiculous onsens. </joey>
<joey> It's all just different makeup, right? </joey>
<connor> Like the acid one, I went
with Chris into an acid onsen </connor>
<connor> and then obviously-- </connor>
<connor> - The one we went to last week. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. We went to one last week. </garnt>
<joey> - It was very lovely. </joey>
<joey> - We could talk about that. </joey>
<joey> That's a, that's a good segue. </joey>
<joey> - Amazing segue, Joey. Thank you. </joey>
<joey> - To talk about the fact
that we just went on holiday. </joey>
<joey> On a ski trip, </joey>
<garnt> which we've revealed is
not going to be a special. </garnt>
<garnt> Unfortunately we do like
to hang out with each other </garnt>
<garnt> and not always have to pressure. </garnt>
<joey> - We hang out outside of content. </joey>
<garnt> - Outside of, even though Joey made-- </garnt>
<joey> - Made a long matter. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </joey>
<joey> - Which may or may not be out by now, </joey>
<joey> but they'll probably be out by now. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> But we went to, where
did we go again, Isekoi? </joey>
<joey> - Isekai. </joey>
<joey> - Isekai that's a Mongo. </joey>
<joey> - That's a Mongo. I completely
just, Isekai, that's it. </joey>
<garnt> - Isekai, Yeah in Hokkaido. </garnt>
<garnt> - Hokkaido. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like the, one of the
most famously resort in Japan. </garnt>
<connor> Probably like top two. </connor>
<connor> - Is it the most famous? </connor>
<connor> Ohakabank and Isekai, the two famous ones. </connor>
<joey> - Oh yeah. That's true. </joey>
<connor> - They're two big boys. </connor>
<joey> - There's Zao in Yamagata. </joey>
<connor> - That's not that famous though. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. Zao is famous in Japan. </joey>
<connor> - I've also been there and
is like very, very old. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. It's not as great. </joey>
<connor> - Every ski lift is like a plank. </connor>
<garnt> It just like took you. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. I mean-- </garnt>
<connor> - Hand cranked. </connor>
<garnt> - I would say that this is
my first proper ski trip </garnt>
<connor> because unlike before
I only went for a day </connor>
<connor> and then I was out of commission
for like every other day. </connor>
<connor> So I had like day of snowboarding
this time I had basically </connor>
<garnt> like four days of snowboarding, </garnt>
<joey> two like full hard days and
two like kind of like softer </joey>
<garnt> take it easy days, </garnt>
<connor> but still four days of
snowboarding and yeah, </connor>
<garnt> it was a lot of fun. </garnt>
<garnt> But my God did my body
hurt the day after. Holy-- </garnt>
<connor> - Did your mom ask you how
the white person sport was? </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> Is that what she asked you
last time or something? </connor>
<garnt> (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, she asked me last time. </connor>
<joey> - How are the white people there? </joey>
<joey> I will say it was so weird
going into that skier zone. </joey>
<garnt> Just going to that town and
just seeing more people speaking </garnt>
<garnt> English than they were Japanese. </garnt>
<connor> - I think I heard less Japanese. </connor>
<connor> Like I heard more Chinese and
English that I did Japanese. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah. </connor>
<joey> And that's only gonna increase
once the borders open up. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. Yeah. Because like
every single staff member, </garnt>
<connor> not just in the hotel we stayed at, </connor>
<joey> but just in town for
some reason spoke English </joey>
<joey> and there are a lot of Aussies there. </joey>
<joey> - A lot of Aussies. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And if they and speaking English, </joey>
<joey> then they were basically
speaking Mandarin or Cantonese. </joey>
<joey> And then you had the very few
people just speaking Japanese, </joey>
<garnt> the Japanese people were
literally in the minority. </garnt>
<garnt> From what I could see and
the country's closed off. </garnt>
<garnt> So how bad is it gonna be when
the country actually opens up </garnt>
<garnt> and tourism comes back in? </garnt>
<joey> - 'Cause I remember
when I worked in HakoBA, </joey>
<joey> which is the other famous
one in Niigata that is like, </joey>
<joey> it's like almost 99%-- </joey>
<garnt> - Nagano, you mean, Sorry. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm sorry. Nagano, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Sorry. It's like 99% Australians. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's actually scary. </garnt>
<garnt> Like I remember some days being there, </garnt>
<garnt> like going around to like
restaurants and stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> And I would step outside after
restaurant and I'd be like, </garnt>
<connor> oh yeah, I'm in Japan. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause when you're inside the restaurant, </connor>
<connor> everyone's Australian. </connor>
<joey> So it feels like I'm
back home in Australia. </joey>
<connor> - Feels like every country
has their national pests. </connor>
<garnt> Australia has the cane
toads, Japan has Australians. </garnt>
<joey> - Japan has Australians. </joey>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Localized in the ski resorts. </garnt>
<garnt> - Just go. And you're
like, oh yes I can see you. </garnt>
<joey> - So when you're at home-- </joey>
<garnt> - Oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> - No. 'cause yeah, it
was super surreal for me </garnt>
<garnt> being in a place which
was very clearly Japan, </garnt>
<connor> but all the signs were in English. </connor>
<connor> The menus were in English
and all the staff members </connor>
<connor> spoke English as well. </connor>
<connor> - It was weird, man. It was weird. </connor>
<connor> - I tried my best speak
Japanese to like anyone I met, </connor>
<garnt> whenever I went to a cashier
or something and anytime I did, </garnt>
<garnt> they would just always reply
back in perfect English. </garnt>
<connor> - That's funny. 'Cause when
I was booking the hotel, </connor>
<connor> I booked the hotel for
Zoe, but I booked it. </connor>
<connor> I asked like for like a
shuttle service to pick us up. </connor>
<joey> 'Cause it's like two
hours, two hours and a half </joey>
<joey> from the airport. </joey>
<joey> - From the airport. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And I was like, well, booking.com says </joey>
<joey> they have a shuttle service,
I was like, oh great, great. </joey>
<garnt> So I clicked it two days
before they messaged me. </garnt>
<garnt> They're like, by the way, we
don't have a shuttle service. </garnt>
<garnt> And I like, like what? </garnt>
<garnt> What do you mean you don't
have a shuttle service? </garnt>
<joey> They're like, we don't, but
we can help you get one, </joey>
<garnt> just go to these links and get the bus. </garnt>
<garnt> And so I go and look for the bus. </garnt>
<garnt> There's no seats left on the bus. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, oh, what do we do?
He's like call up the hotel. </garnt>
<garnt> And then I remember, so this
is where I talked the guy </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm like oh, is
English okay? In Japanese. </garnt>
<garnt> And he's like, in English
he goes, "Oh thank God." </garnt>
<garnt> (all laugh) </garnt>
<garnt> He was like, "Yeah, that's
great. That's perfect." </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, "Yeah, I don't
really like speaking Japanese." </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, "Oh great. All right." </garnt>
<garnt> He's from the Philippines or something. </garnt>
<garnt> And I was like, all right, sick. </garnt>
<garnt> And he was like super chill.
He was like, "Yeah. Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> "We'll get you a taxi
mate. You'll be alright." </joey>
<joey> Very expensive taxi. Oh my God. </joey>
<joey> You fucked up. We didn't book beforehand. </joey>
<joey> Like normal people. 'Cause we
booked the trip pretty late </joey>
<garnt> as well. Right? Like two weeks before? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. It was something like that. </joey>
<connor> It was like quite expensive,
but it was good though. </connor>
<connor> - It was smack bang in the
middle of the season as well. </connor>
<connor> So it's probably like the
most amount of people, </connor>
<garnt> but it was really good. </garnt>
<garnt> - I will say this was like
probably the coldest weather </garnt>
<garnt> I've consistently been in because
throughout my entire life, </garnt>
<garnt> the coldest weather I've
really had to deal with is </garnt>
<garnt> like minus five, minus six. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh God. Oh God. How did you manage? </joey>
<joey> - Huh? </joey>
<joey> - How did you manage? </joey>
<garnt> In my mind when you guys
were telling me to pack </garnt>
<garnt> winter clothes, pack
all these different kind </garnt>
<garnt> of thermal gear and everything like that. </garnt>
<joey> I'm just like, it's cold. </joey>
<garnt> I get it. I know it's going to be cold. </garnt>
<joey> Nothing in my mind could process
really just how cold it is </joey>
<joey> up there and just how cold
it feels. Cause to me, </joey>
<joey> like it gets to minus five
and anything below minus five, </joey>
<joey> I'm just like, it's cold. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, that's I know , it is cold. </joey>
<joey> That's how my mind processes it. </joey>
<joey> But my body wasn't prepared
for just the different types </joey>
<joey> of coldness because it
just never had experienced </joey>
<joey> that before. </joey>
<joey> At least not to such a big degree </joey>
<joey> 'cause I've been in Wisconsin in winter </joey>
<joey> and it gets cold in there, </joey>
<joey> but we just stay inside all the time. </joey>
<joey> We're not out there
snowboarding skiing and all. </joey>
<garnt> - So point in perspective, </garnt>
<joey> I think every day on Ridge
was like minus like 10 or 11. </joey>
<connor> - It was yeah. It was minus
like 16 at the top as well. </connor>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. Yeah. It was minus 16. </joey>
<joey> - At night it shot down even lower. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. 'Cause you'd wear like this, </connor>
<connor> I don't know what you call
it. Not a battle Claver, </connor>
<joey> but like just like a cloth. </joey>
<joey> - Like a face mask. </joey>
<joey> - Well, it's like a piece of cloth </joey>
<garnt> that you put underneath your mask </garnt>
<joey> that blocks here so that
you freeze your face off. </joey>
<joey> But one of the days it was so cold </joey>
<joey> that after one run of going down, </joey>
<garnt> like one of the things I tried to touch it </garnt>
<garnt> and it was rock solid. It was frozen over. </garnt>
<garnt> It was crazy. It was so cool though, man. </garnt>
<connor> It was such a cool ski resort. </connor>
<garnt> - It was, I guess, being in
that kind of cold weather </garnt>
<garnt> or being in that kind of cold place, </garnt>
<garnt> kind of put things into
perspective for me with, </garnt>
<garnt> if you are ill-equipped just
to go outside for a quick walk </garnt>
<garnt> or something. You'll probably die. </garnt>
<garnt> And I guess I've never
been in an environment </garnt>
<garnt> where I've needed to worry
about just having basic gear </garnt>
<garnt> to protect myself from the weather. </garnt>
<garnt> Otherwise my life would be in danger. </garnt>
<garnt> You know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, it gets cold, but it's bearable. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, it gets cold, but
just run to nearest combining </garnt>
<joey> or just run to nearest
tescos and just warm up. </joey>
<joey> You run a bit more, but like-- </joey>
<joey> - The nearest combining
was like 30 minutes. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
'Cause there was nothing. </joey>
<joey> And I remember when we
arrived to the hotel, </joey>
<joey> we got greeted by the receptionist
and everything like that. </joey>
<garnt> And he said, oh, you know,
if you want to go into town, </garnt>
<garnt> make sure you book a taxi
because if you don't book a taxi, </garnt>
<garnt> every taxi's going to
stop at about midnight. </garnt>
<garnt> And they've had some people
that have gone into town, </garnt>
<garnt> which is a bit further
away from the ski resorts </garnt>
<garnt> and had no way to get
back in like -10 weather. </garnt>
<joey> - It's like a 20 minute drive. </joey>
<garnt> - It's like a 20 minute drive. Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - It's like a two hour walk in-- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - The ski resort has a bunch
of different areas around it. </connor>
<connor> It has a lot of mountains. </connor>
<joey> We went to this village called Hirafu, </joey>
<garnt> which is technically on
the next mountain over. </garnt>
<joey> And that just puts in a
perspective how far away that is. </joey>
<garnt> - So it just made me think, man. </garnt>
<garnt> If we just forgot to call a taxi one day, </garnt>
<garnt> we'd just be fucked because
nowhere would be open. </garnt>
<garnt> We couldn't get home and we
just have to like survive </garnt>
<garnt> outside in the wilderness in
-10 degree weather Celsius, </garnt>
<garnt> by the way, Celsius. </garnt>
<garnt> - Went to that one bar. </garnt>
<connor> And was he Australian or south African? </connor>
<garnt> - I think it was Australian. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no, no, he was Dutch, I believe. </garnt>
<garnt> - Was he really? </garnt>
<connor> - I think his accent-- </connor>
<connor> - Was he Dutch? </connor>
<joey> - His accent sounded Dutch. </joey>
<joey> - I thought he had a nosy accent. </joey>
<joey> - This guy was just like, he
was just like, we were like, </joey>
<connor> what do we do if we missed the cabs? </connor>
<joey> - I would know if he was Aussie. </joey>
<connor> - Okay. </connor>
<joey> - He definitely wasn't
Aussie. He was European. </joey>
<connor> - We asked him, what do we
do if we missed the cabs </connor>
<connor> and the guy's like, ah, just walk come. </connor>
<joey> - No, no, no. He said, no. </joey>
<joey> He was like, where are you staying? </joey>
<joey> And I was like at the, at
XYZ hotel and he's like, </joey>
<joey> it's walkable. </joey>
<joey> And I looked at him with Google
maps it was like, walking-- </joey>
<joey> - An hour and 40 minutes. </joey>
<joey> - An hour and 40 minutes. I'm
like, it's certainly walkable. </joey>
<joey> Would I do it though? </joey>
<joey> - In -15 degree weather
is a different question. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, walk walkable is a technicality. </garnt>
<garnt> I can. Yeah. I'm sure
human would be able to walk </garnt>
<garnt> from one end to the other. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, Hokkaid to Tokyo is walkable. </garnt>
<garnt> Like you can walk it if you would want to. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean the south pole is walkable. </garnt>
<garnt> People have done it. </garnt>
<joey> - If you're Jesus, you can walk anywhere. </joey>
<joey> - The Pacific is all (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - It's all walkable. </joey>
<joey> - Like I have legs. </joey>
<garnt> - It's all about drive. </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - My God. </joey>

<joey> - Thank to Princess Connect
for sponsoring this episode </joey>
<joey> back to the show. </joey>
<connor> - This is so nice though. </connor>
<connor> It is so good. we had like a
really nice onsen in the hotel. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. It was one of the
best onsens I've been in. </joey>
<joey> - Being cold all day and
then just going in the onsen </joey>
<connor> and the onsen was outside as
well. Yeah, it was so good. </connor>
<joey> - So you kind of put
yourself in the water, </joey>
<joey> maybe up to your chest or
the bottom of your shoulders, </joey>
<connor> you get this perfect blend
of like your bottom half </connor>
<connor> is nice and warm and toasty
in this mineral water. </connor>
<connor> And then your top is
just getting covered-- </connor>
<garnt> - Such is anime. </garnt>
<joey> - It's so anime. </joey>
<garnt> - It's it's so anime, especially
going in an onsen is anime. </garnt>
<joey> Going in an onsen in snow
is just like, this is-- </joey>
<joey> - Anime a air. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </joey>
<connor> - It's pretty anime. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause you are literally sitting there </connor>
<connor> and you see the anime steam,
where you see the steam </connor>
<garnt> where there are sensors, everything. </garnt>
<connor> That's literally what it was like. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. You couldn't see anything. </connor>
<garnt> Like there was just so much steam. </garnt>
<joey> You couldn't see anything. </joey>
<joey> - Was amazing. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. So it's just
like a real life sensor. </garnt>
<garnt> And so this view we had
of just the snow as well, </garnt>
<joey> it looked so aesthetic.
It was just unfair. </joey>
<joey> It looked like a wallpaper. </joey>
<joey> - It looks like unreal engine fire. </joey>
<joey> - It literally looked like
an unreal engine test. </joey>
<garnt> - It's a rendering of not real life. </garnt>
<garnt> - It looks so good that
it looks unrealistic. </garnt>
<joey> - That's the only part I
regret not being able to walk. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause that was probably
like the most aesthetic part. </joey>
<connor> - You can't take a camera there. </connor>
<connor> I can't take a camera. </connor>
<joey> - It was good. Oh gosh. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, fucking dicks out boys. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. 'Cause it was
so cold on top there, </garnt>
<joey> as you were just staring at the landscape, </joey>
<joey> your hair would freeze. </joey>
<joey> So like our hair was frozen
solid while our bottom halves </joey>
<garnt> were like nice, nice and toasted. </garnt>
<joey> - But it was so weird
because even though your hair </joey>
<joey> is frozen and your shoulders
and head are just covered </joey>
<garnt> in snow, you're not cold </garnt>
<garnt> because you're sitting
in boiling hot water. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. You're
sitting in boiling hot water. </garnt>
<garnt> - So it's like this
perfect, weird balance. </garnt>
<joey> And it's just, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I don't know what
minerals they had going on </connor>
<connor> in that bath, but like every
day I felt like silky smooth. </connor>
<garnt> I felt amazing. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. It was probably just salty. </garnt>
<joey> - Like baby wash. </joey>
<joey> - Whatever that mineral was-- </joey>
<joey> - You don't drink it, Garnt. </joey>
<joey> - I know I don't drink it.
I didn't mean to drink it. </joey>
<connor> - Garnt gets in the onsen and
he's like, yeah, it's kinda. </connor>
<joey> - I gotta coat my stomach. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. He's like the
ice cream testing guy. </connor>
<connor> - That's a ten. </connor>
<joey> - He's like, chocolate, out of four. </joey>
<garnt> - Sometimes a bit of
bath water just slips in. </garnt>
<garnt> (Connor laughs) </garnt>
<connor> I sound like Mailin now. </connor>
<connor> Like you guys never
licked bath water before. </connor>
<connor> - I didn't get near the bath water. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't like how you
used the word slipped in </garnt>
<joey> that implies it's going somewhere else. </joey>
<garnt> - Sometimes you just like
watch your face or whatever. </garnt>
<garnt> And you just get a quick taste. </garnt>
<connor> - You don't wash your
face with the onsen water. </connor>
<garnt> - Well, so sometimes like my
face was like freezing cold. </garnt>
<garnt> I needed to warm it up. </garnt>
<connor> - No. No. That's what
the towel's for, Garnt. </connor>
<garnt> - Well you get the water
on the towel as well. </garnt>
<connor> - That's true. </connor>
<connor> - How was your snowboarding gone? </connor>
<garnt> How did-- </garnt>
<connor> - It was you. </connor>
<connor> - Do you think you improved a lot? </connor>
<joey> - I did think I improved a lot. </joey>
<joey> - I think Garnt improved. Definitely. </joey>
<joey> - Like I definitely, my
confidence went way up </joey>
<joey> from day one to day four. </joey>
<joey> Having said that, I think I
learned the most on day four. </joey>
<garnt> Because day one, two, and
three, I had one goal, survive. </garnt>
<connor> (Connor and Joey laugh) </connor>
<connor> - We're talking halo music starts. </connor>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<joey> - Objective, survive. </joey>
<garnt> - No, because you go
down some of these slopes </garnt>
<garnt> and I was having a chat with Connor </garnt>
<joey> about there are like green slopes, </joey>
<garnt> there are like red slopes, and
there are like black slopes. </garnt>
<garnt> But at the end of the
day, it's just a label. </garnt>
<garnt> God's not there creating mountains, </garnt>
<garnt> being like I'm going to
make this a green slope </garnt>
<garnt> and exactly these the
same angles throughout. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just like-- </garnt>
<joey> - And the map maker is like, "Yes my Lord, </joey>
<garnt> "I'll write that down." </garnt>
<garnt> - He's just like playing
like SimCity with the earth </garnt>
<connor> or whatever, God's not doing that. </connor>
<connor> You get what you're
given with the mountains </connor>
<connor> and not every mountain
and not every slope. </connor>
<garnt> Even if it's labeled a green slope, </garnt>
<garnt> there are different variations. </garnt>
<joey> There are different variables. </joey>
<joey> - Some of the red slopes
are actually easier </joey>
<joey> than the greens. </joey>
<joey> - I would say. So I would say so. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. So if you're not
familiar with snow sports at all </connor>
<joey> the slopes normally categorized
in colors or diamonds, </joey>
<joey> wherever you're from-- </joey>
<joey> - Shapes. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. Normally it's green is easiest </joey>
<joey> then some also use blue in Europe. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, okay. </joey>
<joey> Australia also has blues, I think. </joey>
<joey> - So in Europe you sometimes see green. </joey>
<joey> You sometimes don't it depends
on which country you're in. </joey>
<joey> But is normally blue, red, black, </joey>
<joey> and in America you have black diamond. </joey>
<connor> China also uses black diamond as well. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. It's red circle. </joey>
<joey> Sorry. Green circle. Red
square. Black diamond. </joey>
<connor> - Not that far. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Oh wow. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. 'Cause in Japan, there's like-- </joey>
<joey> - Green square, black
circle, green circle. </joey>
<garnt> - Green circle. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause cause normally the
biggest variation of difficulty </garnt>
<garnt> comes in black slopes. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah. 'Cause they're like, </garnt>
<joey> some of them are literally just like-- </joey>
<joey> - They're not treated at all. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. Some of them are just awful. </joey>
<garnt> And so that's why there's even
a, normally a bigger scale. </garnt>
<garnt> But in Europe it's just all black. </garnt>
<garnt> They're like, it's all hot. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. You've been skiing blue. </connor>
<joey> - So on the first day we
just stayed on literally </joey>
<joey> the baby beginner slope.
It was literally like-- </joey>
<joey> - Garnt did, I didn't. </joey>
<joey> - Me and Garnt did. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause it was like the warmup slope. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. Me, Joey, and Luke
stayed on the beginner slope, </joey>
<connor> the baby park slope of this ski resort. </connor>
<connor> And then the next day we're like, okay, </connor>
<connor> we we're feeling confident now. </connor>
<connor> We're feeling confident to
actually take the gongler up </connor>
<connor> to the top of the mountain </connor>
<connor> and ski down the green slopes. </connor>
<connor> So there was like no distinction for me </connor>
<joey> from what was the green slope
and what was a red slope. </joey>
<joey> We actually followed
Connor and we accidentally </joey>
<joey> took a red slope. </joey>
<joey> I couldn't tell the difference at all. </joey>
<joey> - It was exactly the same. </joey>
<joey> - Because they were just
like me, fine for my life </joey>
<garnt> to go down the tiniest little slope. </garnt>
<garnt> And that's that like, I
couldn't tell the difference </garnt>
<garnt> between a few degrees. </garnt>
<joey> - Not to mention, the
weather that day was so shit. </joey>
<joey> The visibility was like five meters, if-- </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. So this resort
had a beginner slope </connor>
<connor> and when I say beginner slope, </connor>
<joey> this is the most beginner
slope I've ever seen. </joey>
<joey> It is literally like a
flat surface that sometimes </joey>
<joey> goes to a 1%. </joey>
<joey> - It's like a one or 2%. </joey>
<joey> So really, amazing if you're
actually beginners beginner-- </joey>
<garnt> - Which Luke was. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. Like, so with a
friend who came with us, Luke, </garnt>
<joey> who had never skied in his life. </joey>
<joey> And it was a good start. </joey>
<joey> I think he got confident on that. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. He did. </joey>
<joey> - He was like, "Oh, I've
only fallen over once. </joey>
<joey> "I can go at the top now." </joey>
<garnt> - And so if you wanted
to go do any other slopes </garnt>
<garnt> that were kind of difficult, </garnt>
<garnt> we had to go all the way to the top. </garnt>
<garnt> And that's where it kind of gets, </garnt>
<joey> you don't really have a choice </joey>
<joey> if some of the difficult or not. </joey>
<garnt> But the day before we went up, </garnt>
<connor> we went up the day before and it was like, </connor>
<garnt> the visibility was awful. </garnt>
<garnt> You could maybe see like
five meters ahead of you. </garnt>
<garnt> And we go pretty fast
and it's like, just like, </garnt>
<garnt> I just hoping I don't find
someone. Cause if I do, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm gonna hit someone
and it's like, oh God. </garnt>
<joey> Oh God. It was really sketchy. </joey>
<joey> It really bad. And then-- </joey>
<joey> - But even the second day,
the visibility was quite shit. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. Yeah. So the
first day was a lot worse. </connor>
<joey> I literally couldn't, maybe I
couldn't see at that camera. </joey>
<joey> - Oh. Wow. </joey>
<joey> - Maybe, no, no. Maybe
Ashley, where Ashley is. </joey>
<garnt> That was about where
it starts to get blur. </garnt>
<garnt> I couldn't see anything. </garnt>
<garnt> But the next day was, it was still bad. </garnt>
<garnt> - But not as bad. </garnt>
<garnt> - So we went with another friend, </garnt>
<garnt> Ohara's a YouTuber who lives
here and then we were, he's-- </garnt>
<garnt> - And Chris as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. And Chris too,
Chris as well. All right. </garnt>
<garnt> So to give you a gauge
of the skill levels, </garnt>
<connor> I guess, what would you put yourself, </connor>
<joey> where would you put yourself? </joey>
<joey> - I Would say it's Ohara,
you, Chris, me, Garnt, Luke. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. I've no issue doing
black slopes or whatever. </connor>
<connor> So me and Ohara cause we were
like the most confident ones </connor>
<garnt> we were like, all right, </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, you go in the front, </garnt>
<garnt> you like direct them
and I'll go in the back. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'll, if they fall over,
I'll help them get back up. </garnt>
<garnt> Luckily I'm glad I was there
'cause Luke at one point </garnt>
<garnt> lost his ski in like really thick snow. </garnt>
<garnt> And when you're in ski boots, </garnt>
<garnt> you can't really go up the mountain </garnt>
<garnt> if you're not used to it. </garnt>
<garnt> If you're like a
beginner, it's really hard </garnt>
<garnt> to feel confident running
around in the ski boots. </garnt>
<garnt> And I was wearing snowboard
boots. So I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> "All right, just wait there, </garnt>
<garnt> "I'll go and dig through the snow." </garnt>
<garnt> And after like five minutes, </garnt>
<garnt> I managed to find this
ski buried in the snow. </garnt>
<garnt> It'd gone underneath the snow
slid. So you couldn't even, </garnt>
<garnt> there was no sign that
it was ship was there. </garnt>
<garnt> So I had to like rummage through
yeah. Eventually found it. </garnt>
<garnt> So we went down anyway, but like, </garnt>
<garnt> so we took these guys up
and it was just a mess. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause like none of them
could like stand up. </garnt>
<garnt> Chris is good at skiing,
but Chris is lazy. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - I did notice that. I did notice that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Chris, Ken, and I reckon
Chris could probably do </garnt>
<garnt> a black slope, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Maybe. If Chris really tried. </garnt>
<garnt> Problem is black slopes are really tiring </garnt>
<garnt> and take a lot of effort. </garnt>
<garnt> Chris doesn't wanna do that.
Like Chris also is like, </garnt>
<garnt> he'll do reds, but you
really have to convince him. </garnt>
<garnt> You're supposed to do greens. </garnt>
<joey> It's like Chris, you
could do reds so easily. </joey>
<joey> What are you doing? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. Because I remember
like the third or fourth day </connor>
<connor> he came with me, Garnt,
and Luke on a green slope </connor>
<connor> 'cause that's when we started
to get a little more confident </connor>
<connor> and he was like, "Yeah, I think
I'll stick on a green too." </connor>
<connor> And I'm like-- </connor>
<connor> - Fuck off here, get outta here, </connor>
<connor> you passed the exam go away. </connor>
<joey> - And he's like skiing past
us with no problem whatsoever </joey>
<connor> being like, "Come on,
boys, catch up boys." </connor>
<garnt> I'm like fuck off. </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Cause yeah. So, the second
day we tried to take them down </garnt>
<garnt> How long did it take us to get to them? </garnt>
<garnt> Okay. So if I went from top
to bottom without stopping </garnt>
<joey> and I went as fast as I could, </joey>
<joey> I could probably do it
in five minutes. Right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But that's like didn't
do initially fast-- </joey>
<joey> - Well, it probably took
us 30 to 45 Minutes. </joey>
<joey> - No, it took us like second hour. </joey>
<garnt> - Really? </garnt>
<connor> - It took like the two hours. </connor>
<garnt> - The first time at least. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh. The first time, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> Because after it I swear we
spent like 15 to 20 minutes </garnt>
<garnt> looking for, well you were
looking for Luke's skis. </garnt>
<garnt> And then before that as well, </garnt>
<garnt> because this was right at the start. </garnt>
<garnt> So the visibility was so poor. </garnt>
<garnt> I probably would have
a hard time seeing Joey </garnt>
<garnt> from where he is sitting. </garnt>
<garnt> That's how poor the visibility was. </garnt>
<garnt> And this was also
basically my only my second </garnt>
<garnt> four-day skiing. So snowboarding. </garnt>
<garnt> So I didn't know how to
properly control my board. </garnt>
<garnt> And I remember we were trying
to stick close to a group. </garnt>
<garnt> We were trying to stick close
to a group and I'm trying like </garnt>
<garnt> I'm fighting for life. Just
like see where the group was. </garnt>
<garnt> And so before every hill,
we all stop before a hill. </garnt>
<garnt> Unfortunately my control of
the board was not good enough </garnt>
<garnt> that I knew how to stop yet. </garnt>
<garnt> So these guys were stopped
waiting for me and Luke. </garnt>
<garnt> And so I come along and I
try to stop and I realized </garnt>
<garnt> that I am stopping too late
and I'm sliding down the slope. </garnt>
<garnt> So I start shouting out, "Oh
guys, oh, I'm going down. </garnt>
<connor> "I'm just gonna go ahead." </connor>
<connor> And nobody looked back </connor>
<connor> and I just start stumbling down
this hill, get halfway down. </connor>
<connor> And I turn around to see
if anyone's followed, </connor>
<connor> wait a minute, wait two
minutes, wait five minutes. </connor>
<connor> It's there's nobody. And I'm
just like, where is everybody? </connor>
<connor> I am on this slope at the top
of this mountain by myself </connor>
<garnt> and I can't even stop
correctly. So I had to like, </garnt>
<garnt> I was like messaging the lion group, </garnt>
<garnt> trying to get their attention. </garnt>
<garnt> Luckily, I waited long enough
for you guys to come down. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause these guys were waiting
for me this entire time. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. They thought
that Garnt was behind us. </connor>
<garnt> - That's how poor the visibility was. </garnt>
<garnt> So yeah, we wait just 20 minutes </garnt>
<garnt> where you were waiting
for me and I was waiting </garnt>
<garnt> for you just because we
couldn't see each other. </garnt>
<connor> - 'Cause I was really worried </connor>
<connor> 'cause the way that this
mountain was laid out </connor>
<connor> is that basically you
have to do really big Ss </connor>
<garnt> to stay on the easy ones. </garnt>
<garnt> And if they took any turn at any point, </garnt>
<garnt> they have to go down a black slope. </garnt>
<joey> - It's just a cliff. </joey>
<garnt> - And I was like, they're gonna die </garnt>
<joey> if they go down a black slope. </joey>
<garnt> So I was like, I gotta
do my best to make sure, </garnt>
<garnt> we got I'm like, like what
are they, what are they, </garnt>
<garnt> what are the sheep dogs like
turn around up all the sheep. </garnt>
<connor> I'm like, come on, boys,
let's stick together. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. It was kind of like that. </garnt>
<garnt> So which is why I think I
learned the most on the last day, </garnt>
<garnt> because on the last day we
just found like this one slope </garnt>
<garnt> that was perfect for beginners
and had like a ski lift, </garnt>
<joey> take us back up. </joey>
<garnt> And you just had like the
freedom to just do what you want </garnt>
<garnt> without worry about dying
or just breaking bones. </garnt>
<garnt> - Also the weather was
absolutely gorgeous. </garnt>
<connor> - [Garnt] And the weather was like-- </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. So we had three
days of God, awful weather. </joey>
<garnt> Really bad weather. </garnt>
<joey> And finally the last day we
were leaving, it was amazing. </joey>
<joey> And it was a shame really. </joey>
<garnt> 'Cause the next few days after
that were also really good. </garnt>
<garnt> So we kind of booked it the wrong time, </garnt>
<connor> but it was amazing
weather, really good stuff </connor>
<connor> on the last day. </connor>
<garnt> - I'm really, really impressed
that nobody got injured. </garnt>
<connor> 'Cause there's six of us. </connor>
<garnt> I mean, did you guys take
any bad tumbles during-- </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah.
- the ski trip? </joey>
<joey> I let's just say I'm really
glad I rented outta a helmet. </joey>
<garnt> 'Cause I think about 80%
of my falls involved me, </garnt>
<joey> just my head, just getting whiplash back. </joey>
<garnt> - Did you like kill a toddler Garnt? </garnt>
<connor> - I almost did. </connor>
<connor> Because like on the first
like two, three days, </connor>
<connor> I didn't know how to stop. </connor>
<garnt> So my technique for stopping
involved falling over </garnt>
<garnt> and if I didn't fall over, </garnt>
<garnt> I would just basically just take out </garnt>
<garnt> whoever like was in front of me. </garnt>
<joey> - There's this great photo that
Luke took of you just like, </joey>
<joey> there's this kid right here
and then there's just Garnt, </joey>
<joey> menacingly behind me. Like
I'm about to destroy you. </joey>
<garnt> - Move out of the way. </garnt>
<garnt> - So I must have decked
at least like three kids </garnt>
<connor> on the display from like
the past three days. </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God, Garnt the kid killer. </connor>
<joey> - Thank God no one got injured
except for those three kids. </joey>
<garnt> - None of us got injured. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause it was like a
competition because me and Luke </garnt>
<garnt> just kept crashing into each
other on the first two days. </garnt>
<connor> 'Cause we had zero control. </connor>
<connor> We didn't know how to control our boards. </connor>
<garnt> And I remember Luke decked Joey, once. </garnt>
<connor> - Luke legs kicked me. </connor>
<garnt> - I had a great POV of this. </garnt>
<joey> I was like leading everyone
down the right slopes. </joey>
<joey> And then I was waiting for
them bottom and I saw Joey </joey>
<joey> just slowly like going down like this. </joey>
<joey> And then out of nowhere, RKO, </joey>
<joey> I just see our friend Luke
who doesn't know how to stop. </joey>
<garnt> - He's coming, coming and I
see Jerry. So, and I'm like, </garnt>
<joey> I'm about getting my popcorn
now waiting for this to happen. </joey>
<joey> Joey's going, Joey's going,
doesn't move his head at all. </joey>
<joey> And then suddenly he just goes, boom. </joey>
<connor> Right in the back of his legs.
And Joey just flips over. </connor>
<joey> Like that was so funny. </joey>
<joey> - Because all I heard 'cause
I was slowly going down </joey>
<garnt> because it was kind of a narrow stretch. </garnt>
<garnt> And also I was waiting for Luke. </garnt>
<garnt> So I was slow going down
'cause I saw you guys there. </garnt>
<garnt> And I remember specifically behind me, </garnt>
<joey> I could hear Luke in the distance going, </joey>
<joey> "Sorry, sorry, sorry. Sorry." </joey>
<joey> It's just getting louder
and louder and louder. </joey>
<garnt> But I thought he was
saying that to other people </garnt>
<garnt> that were behind me. </garnt>
<joey> So I was like, oh Luke, silly him. </joey>
<joey> - Silly him. </joey>
<joey> - It gets louder. Sorry, sorry. Sorry. </joey>
<joey> And then just bam right
in the back of my knees. </joey>
<joey> - Let get fully over. </joey>
<connor> - I should have been more
concerned, but it was so funny. </connor>
<joey> - I wish you had filmed that. </joey>
<joey> - By the time I realized it was happening, </joey>
<joey> it was like five seconds. </joey>
<garnt> Couldn't have got my phone
out, but I wish I did. </garnt>
<garnt> - I wanted to see your POV of that. </garnt>
<connor> - I wish I had my GoPro on permanently. </connor>
<garnt> - I was too busy with falling
over myself to really see </garnt>
<garnt> what everyone else was falling over. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I remember I had a few bad tumbles </garnt>
<garnt> where actually some of the worst tumbles </garnt>
<garnt> was when I was just actually
not going the fastest. </garnt>
<garnt> It was like, cause when you go
fast, sometimes like you saw, </garnt>
<garnt> you guys saw me do have
some pretty big falls </garnt>
<connor> where I did a triple back
flip or whatever or whatever. </connor>
<connor> But to me, those falls are fine. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause you take the momentum </connor>
<connor> and then you just literally roll with it. </connor>
<connor> And you hardly feel it. </connor>
<connor> Some of the worst falls I had
was on like the second day. </connor>
<connor> - Think I saw this one. </connor>
<connor> - These guys were trying to
warn me not to stop myself </connor>
<connor> with my hands. </connor>
<joey> Because sometimes if you have a bad fall, </joey>
<joey> you stop yourself with your hands, you-- </joey>
<joey> - You snap your wrist. </joey>
<joey> you could snap your wrist
or break your or something. </joey>
<joey> So they were telling me,
you gotta fall on your arms. </joey>
<joey> You gotta do this. </joey>
<joey> Make sure you don't try to catch yourself. </joey>
<connor> You gotta do this. And
like, like this, right? </connor>
<connor> And I took that as I'm going to do this. </connor>
<connor> Not realizing the mistake
I was about to encounter </connor>
<connor> because what happened is I
was taking a bunch of tumbles. </connor>
<connor> I was like, this doesn't hurt. </connor>
<connor> I'm a pro at falling
over with a snowboard. </connor>
<connor> So this one time I was going
down, this really like this, </connor>
<connor> the slope wasn't steep at all.
I was going pretty slowly, </connor>
<connor> but I just catched the
edge and I'm about to fall </connor>
<connor> straight to my face. So
I do what they tell me. </connor>
<garnt> And I tuck my arms in. </garnt>
<garnt> Unfortunately my fists were
right front of my face. </garnt>
<garnt> So what happens is I fall on
my arm and I just deck myself </garnt>
<garnt> in the face. </garnt>
<garnt> I just go, which, and
I remember I fall over </garnt>
<garnt> and when you have a bad fall
and you just gotta lay there. </garnt>
<garnt> I just question life for a bit. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's when you know it's bad. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I remember I lay
there for a few seconds </garnt>
<garnt> and I just hear kind of
going, "All right, Garnt." </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause I just saw this, like, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause obviously it looks
like ants in the background. </garnt>
<garnt> I just saw Garnt just fall on his face. </garnt>
<garnt> And I was like, get back up, Garnt, </garnt>
<connor> get back up, get back up. </connor>
<connor> And then he didn't get
up and I'm like, oh no, </connor>
<connor> he hurt himself. </connor>
<joey> - There was a couple
times on the last day, </joey>
<joey> I think where you did that? </joey>
<joey> Like triple back flip, right? </joey>
<joey> I saw it in the distance and I was like, </joey>
<joey> oh, that looked like it hurt. </joey>
<joey> And then Garnt just didn't
move for about 20 seconds. </joey>
<joey> I was like, oh he's dead. </joey>
<joey> Oh he's straight up dead. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. I ever seen that one. </joey>
<connor> I just saw like someone doing like flips </connor>
<joey> but not the good type of flips. </joey>
<joey> - I could hear the SSX music playing </joey>
<joey> when that was happening.
It's like, let's drink. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - You took so many falls. </garnt>
<connor> - I Did. I did. </connor>
<garnt> I think that's when I
learned the most though. </garnt>
<connor> when you do take the falls. </connor>
<connor> - It's not about how many
times you get hit down. </connor>
<joey> It's how many times you get back out. </joey>
<joey> - It's that drive. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. It's about the drive. </connor>
<connor> - It's actually like the most embarrassing </connor>
<connor> fall I took wasn't even on the slopes. </connor>
<joey> It was on the ski lift. </joey>
<connor> Oh, oh yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, because, well, Joey
was there because me and Joey </joey>
<joey> were trying to get on
the ski lift together. </joey>
<joey> - Like two man ski lift. </joey>
<joey> - It was a two man ski lift. </joey>
<joey> So me and Joey line up together. </joey>
<joey> So we are just gonna have a nice chill </joey>
<joey> right up on the mountain.
And so I look back, </joey>
<joey> I've done the ski lift
for a bunch of times. </joey>
<joey> So I'm not even a beginner anymore. </joey>
<garnt> I like know how to get on the ski lift. </garnt>
<connor> - It is a lot hard on a
snowboard than a ski is. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Also I thought, because I just, </garnt>
<garnt> so I'm standing there
waiting for the ski lift </garnt>
<garnt> to come around. </garnt>
<garnt> I look back and in my
mind I take a mental note </garnt>
<garnt> of the momentum of this ski lift. </garnt>
<garnt> So I know how fast this thing's going. </garnt>
<garnt> And so right before it gets near us </garnt>
<garnt> I turn around thinking it's
gonna have the same momentum, </garnt>
<garnt> not thinking that they're
gonna slow it down for us. </garnt>
<garnt> So what I do is I turn
around and I just sit </garnt>
<garnt> and that feeling where you
take a step where you think </garnt>
<garnt> there's like a stare and
then there's just not? </garnt>
<garnt> So I had that feeling where I sit down </garnt>
<joey> and I just feel nothing. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, oh no. </joey>
<joey> And like, I just, I just collapsed. </joey>
<joey> And then the next thing I
notice is I feel like the bump </joey>
<joey> on the back of my helmet, </joey>
<joey> which thank God I was wearing
a helmet at this point. </joey>
<joey> And so I'm just like, they're
gonna stop the ski lift. </joey>
<joey> So my instinct is just to
adopt the fetal position </joey>
<joey> while they hopefully stop the ski lift. </joey>
<joey> Plot twist, they don't stop the ski lift. </joey>
<joey> And so the ski lift just
goes over me and Joey, </joey>
<joey> just like Joey, I guess
just snowboards over me. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I look up, </joey>
<joey> I look up thinking what has
happened and I just see Joey, </joey>
<joey> just looking back on the
ski lift and being like, </joey>
<joey> you're right, dick head? </joey>
<garnt> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </garnt>
<joey> - Well, no, it was, 'cause it was amazing. </joey>
<connor> 'Cause like-- </connor>
<connor> - I'm surprised they didn't stop it. </connor>
<connor> They should have stopped it. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause how I usually do it
with like skis or snowboards </connor>
<connor> is I wait for the chair to
physically hit me in the back </connor>
<connor> of the knees. </connor>
<connor> So that's where I know.
Oh it's right underneath. </connor>
<connor> - Kinda like bend over. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> Just get my butt ready. </connor>
<connor> - I was doing that. </connor>
<connor> I was looking back, just waiting, waiting, </connor>
<connor> waiting, waiting until
it hits me right here. </connor>
<joey> And then I look over, look up, sit down, </joey>
<joey> thinking it's all good. </joey>
<joey> And then I hear like this
horrible scraping sound </joey>
<joey> from somewhere. </joey>
<joey> I was like, what's what's going on? </joey>
<joey> I look over and Garnt is just
down there under the thing, </joey>
<joey> just like this and I was like,
oh, they're gonna stop it. </joey>
<joey> They don't stop it. </joey>
<joey> It goes right over Garnt. I was like-- </joey>
<connor> - That's cruel. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh yeah. And finally stop
it after it's gone past you. </garnt>
<garnt> And the woman comes over
being like, "You all right?" </garnt>
<joey> I'm like, what do you mean you all right? </joey>
<joey> You should have stopped it. </joey>
<joey> Why did you check up on him
after you let the chair go? </joey>
<joey> - It's like watching a
fight with the teachers. </joey>
<connor> Like watching the kids,
like when it's over like, </connor>
<joey> oh you guys are alright? </joey>
<connor> - It's like, I'll wait
for them to throw a few-- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. Break it up. Break it up. </connor>
<garnt> - And they break it up there. </garnt>
<garnt> - But no, that was the
most embarrassing one. </garnt>
<joey> 'Cause they were just like, </joey>
<joey> everyone was just obviously staring at me. </joey>
<joey> I stopped the entire ski
lift and yeah, that was just, </joey>
<joey> just like social anxiety
up through the roof. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I'm like-- </joey>
<joey> - It happens man. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. I know it happens. </joey>
<connor> - The can't see your face. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, that's true. </connor>
<connor> - You're completely covered up. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. Who cares? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. Aside from that,
I had a wonderful time. </connor>
<garnt> My body hurt a lot, but it was worth it. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just wearing, I'm raring
to go again. Honestly. </garnt>
<connor> - It's probably like some of
the best snow ever snowboarders </connor>
<connor> or skied on my life. It was amazing. </connor>
<garnt> How's it compared to like
European ski resorts? </garnt>
<connor> - I think I like European ones more. </connor>
<connor> There's normally they're normally bigger </connor>
<connor> way more like options, but I
mean it was the quality of snow </connor>
<connor> wasn't same. It was so good. </connor>
<joey> - It's powdered snowed like
so two meters and dales on it. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. So most of the black
slopes weren't like groomed. </connor>
<joey> So we went on one and it
was literally just like, </joey>
<joey> - it was like--
- Meters. </joey>
<joey> - on a cloud. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> And I fell over on one of them. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause it was just too deep
and it was so hard to turn </joey>
<garnt> and it was really bad cause
I basically just shoveled </garnt>
<garnt> a ton of no into my jacket and pants. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh. No.
- Oh. No. </garnt>
<joey> - And I was freezing and
I was like in the cold </joey>
<joey> with my hand trying to scoop this out. </joey>
<joey> Mine is 15 trying to get all the snow. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause if you just leave it in, </joey>
<garnt> it'll just melt and then it'll be wet. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's even worse. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's the worst. </garnt>
<garnt> - Trying to get it out. I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> and then I had to ski for another hour. </garnt>
<garnt> My ass was completely numb. </garnt>
<garnt> I couldn't feel anything. </garnt>
<garnt> It was so bad. And when
I got back to the room, </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, I can't feel my ass. </garnt>
<garnt> It's been numb for like a good two hours. </garnt>
<joey> If someone could have smacked
my ass I wouldn't have known. </joey>
<joey> - That clip is definitely
gonna be taken out. </joey>
<joey> - I can't feel my ass. </joey>
<joey> - I can't feel my ass.
- I can't feel my ass. </joey>
<joey> - I just took such a beating. </joey>
<joey> - It's so numb. </joey>
<garnt> - Doing too much riding on the board. </garnt>
<garnt> It's so good though. It was really cool. </garnt>
<garnt> It was really good ski. I wanna go back. </garnt>
<joey> - There was fantastic snow. </joey>
<joey> - Pain in the ass to get to, but good. </joey>
<joey> Yeah. I think if I go there again, </joey>
<connor> I'd probably wanna like go to
Sapora for a bit or something. </connor>
<connor> And then go there. </connor>
<joey> - I think that's what a lot of tourist do </joey>
<joey> is they're kind of maybe
dedicate like a week or two </joey>
<connor> for the whole thing, because
it is kind of out of the way, </connor>
<connor> especially if you're coming from Tokyo. </connor>
<connor> - Sapora is a really fun city. </connor>
<joey> - Yah, Sapora is great city. </joey>
<connor> - Sapora is a really chill city. </connor>
<garnt> - Like all I wanted to do
on the ski trip was just </garnt>
<garnt> get the basics down for my snowboarding. </garnt>
<garnt> And I think I managed to do that. </garnt>
<connor> So now I'm like more confident-- </connor>
<connor> - Proud of you, Garnt. </connor>
<connor> - Thank you. </connor>
<connor> - Came along very well. </connor>
<connor> - You improved a lot. </connor>
<joey> - But now I'm just ready to
tear it down with the boys </joey>
<joey> for real hopefully. </joey>
<joey> And try and keep up with them. </joey>
<joey> - The real SSX tricky. </joey>
<connor> - I want everyone to get better. </connor>
<garnt> So that then Chris feels
obliged to do well, </garnt>
<garnt> but he has no choice </garnt>
<connor> 'cause no one wants to do greens anymore. </connor>
<connor> - I Mean we accidentally went down a reds. </connor>
<connor> - On our second day like we just said. </connor>
<joey> - Didn't go amazing. But we made it down. </joey>
<garnt> Didn't go amazing. But we survived. </garnt>
<garnt> That's the important thing we-- </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, basically there was
this tiny and little sign </connor>
<connor> that was like, go this
way if you want to go back </connor>
<connor> to where you came from on a green. </connor>
<joey> And if you go down straight, </joey>
<joey> which is like the whole thing, </joey>
<joey> it's really hard to see this thing. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause it also goes back in on itself. </joey>
<joey> So the slope goes down this way </joey>
<joey> and there's a little cutoff
here where it goes down and back </joey>
<connor> around and then joins off
to like another mountain. </connor>
<joey> - It's impossible to see considering--. </joey>
<connor> - And the conditions, are really bad. </connor>
<joey> - Entire thing is white. </joey>
<joey> - The conditions are really bad. </joey>
<joey> - So just everything just blends in. </joey>
<joey> - And then I was last
'cause I was making sure </joey>
<joey> everyone was alright.
And then was like, oh no, </joey>
<connor> the Luke who I was with at the time. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I'm pretty sure he was last. </connor>
<connor> He went down the red
and I was like, oh shit. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<joey> - Moments before a disaster. </joey>
<connor> - He just like went down the red. </connor>
<garnt> And I was like, and then
I'm like, oh my God, </garnt>
<garnt> they've all gone down the green.
And then we're stuck here. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's like lunchtime. </garnt>
<garnt> And we was already at, it was like 1:30. </garnt>
<garnt> And I was like, oh, we probably
would be eating by now. </garnt>
<garnt> Like we're fucked 'cause we wanna go meet, </garnt>
<garnt> have lunch with them as
well. So how do we get back? </garnt>
<joey> Like, but then luckily </joey>
<connor> all these idiots went
down the red as well. </connor>
<joey> - Turns out we all missed it. </joey>
<joey> - So we all met up. </joey>
<joey> But then this scream was
really annoying as well. </joey>
<connor> 'Cause it was like a
flat, really, really flat. </connor>
<joey> And I told the guys, I was like, </joey>
<connor> "Guys, you gotta make sure you
get as much speed as you can </connor>
<connor> "on your snowboards. We're
not walking anywhere." </connor>
<joey> - We're like, got it. </joey>
<joey> Put snowboards on two seconds
later. Falls on our ass. </joey>
<joey> All right. Taking it off now
I'm walking the whole way. </joey>
<connor> - So I'm going as fast as I can. </connor>
<connor> I'm getting load to the
ground, get aerodynamics. </connor>
<joey> I get over there and I'm like, </joey>
<connor> "Oh my God, I made it all right. Nice." </connor>
<connor> I'm waiting. I'm like,
they'll come any second now. </connor>
<connor> Like 10 minutes later, they
come around the corner walking </connor>
<connor> and I was like, what is this? </connor>
<connor> - Okay. To be fair, we
did attempt to snowboard, </connor>
<garnt> to me it wasn't a case
of getting to the end. </garnt>
<garnt> To me it was a case of how far
can I get before I fall over? </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I knew once I
fell over, that was it. </garnt>
<garnt> Momentum was gone. I
gotta take off my boots. </garnt>
<connor> - It is hard to go fast on the snowboards. </connor>
<joey> - Much easier on skis. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know. I'm all
self-taught with it. </joey>
<joey> So I just kind get a
feeling for it I guess. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah. Sure. By the
end of the week we all, </joey>
<garnt> I think definitely got a feeling for it. </garnt>
<connor> - Go fast. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Go fast. </connor>
<garnt> We were going hell of a
lot fast on the last day </garnt>
<joey> compared to the first day. That's true. </joey>
<joey> - That's true. </joey>
<joey> Like Garnt was, can
blitzing down this mountain. </joey>
<connor> And I was like, oh God, he's
about to SSX tricky right now. </connor>
<connor> I could feel it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. Well we had to get
back to like our ski resort </connor>
<joey> and they closed the way of getting over. </joey>
<garnt> What would you call
the, what's the bridge? </garnt>
<garnt> - Ski lift-- </garnt>
<garnt> - What's the, it's like a pathway. </garnt>
<garnt> There's a word for this right? </garnt>
<garnt> - A pathway. </garnt>
<garnt> No, not a pathway. </garnt>
<garnt> - Slalom. </garnt>
<garnt> - There's a, oh, I forgot the word. </garnt>
<garnt> I forgot what it was. </garnt>
<garnt> - There's a word for like an entrance. </garnt>
<garnt> That is like a, I don't
know. I wish I had it. </garnt>
<joey> - An entry way. </joey>
<joey> - You're literally using
all the words I would use. </joey>
<garnt> - So there's a path and
it closes at like 3:30. </garnt>
<garnt> So I was like, okay. If you
don't go back over as well, </garnt>
<garnt> you have to get like a
30, 40 minute bus ride. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'd rather kill myself than get a bus. </garnt>
<garnt> It's just so depressing when
you got all your ski gear. </garnt>
<garnt> And you gotta sit on this bus. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, oh no, why would I
do that when I can ski back? </garnt>
<garnt> So me and Ohara were gonna go back over </garnt>
<garnt> and then we asked the guys
like, "Are you guys coming?" </garnt>
<garnt> And they were like,
"No, we'll get the bus." </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause it was like kind of tough. </garnt>
<garnt> We had to ski a bunch
quickly, get on a chairlift, </garnt>
<garnt> ski over, then walk over
and then ski back down. </garnt>
<joey> It is kind of difficult,
especially if you're tired. </joey>
<joey> And then they weren't doing
it. And I was like, no worries. </joey>
<joey> We'll do it. We'll do it. </joey>
<joey> So we were going and then right before </joey>
<garnt> we were about to cross it, they called us </garnt>
<garnt> and they were like, "Oh yeah,
actually we we'll do it. </garnt>
<garnt> "I think we can do it." </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm like, oh shit. It's
like mission impossible now. </garnt>
<garnt> Gotta get these boys back over safely. </garnt>
<garnt> Felt like Saving private
Ryan back to the hotel. </garnt>
<garnt> We gotta get them back over. </garnt>
<garnt> So we had to quickly like rush these guys. </garnt>
<garnt> And we were like, no fall,
like, just go don't don't stop. </garnt>
<joey> - Just be good. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. Cause they shut it
off at 3:30 for some reason. </garnt>
<connor> I don't know why. </connor>
<joey> - It's cause at 3:30, the sun sets. </joey>
<joey> So you just can't see
anything, especially up there. </joey>
<joey> Like even during the day,
the visibility was so bad. </joey>
<joey> - It was pretty bad. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. I definitely
understand why people wore snow </garnt>
<garnt> and ski board from this trip though. </garnt>
<garnt> Especially on the last day
where the visibility was clear </garnt>
<garnt> and I just kind of realized, oh, </garnt>
<connor> snowboarding and skiing is
just hiking, but the fun part. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause you don't--
- You're going down. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. you get like the amazing view, </connor>
<connor> but you don't have to put in the effort </connor>
<garnt> of getting that amazing view. </garnt>
<connor> - Isn't it crazy when you
like you're on the ground </connor>
<garnt> and you look up at the
mountain and you see as steep, </garnt>
<garnt> some of these things are. </garnt>
<connor> And you're like, I skied down there. </connor>
<garnt> I snowboard down there. It's crazy. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, 'cause I remember on the first day </garnt>
<garnt> when we stayed on the beginner slope. </garnt>
<garnt> So the beginner slope had
this ski lift to take us up </garnt>
<garnt> the beginner slope and taking
us up because it was so slow, </garnt>
<joey> It took us like what? 15 minutes I think. </joey>
<connor> 10, 15 minutes. </connor>
<garnt> So in my mind I'm like, oh, </garnt>
<garnt> we're going up like half
the mountain. Holy fuck. </garnt>
<garnt> And then I remember on the
second day when Connor was like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh yeah, we're gonna go to
the top of the mountain today." </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm like, cool. </garnt>
<garnt> Where was the beginner slope? </garnt>
<garnt> And he points this point,
which is like a 10th of the way </garnt>
<garnt> up the mountain. </garnt>
<joey> And you're like, what? </joey>
<joey> You mean we were this low. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] But the view was so good from-- </joey>
<garnt> - The view was already
amazing. What's going on? </garnt>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> 10 out of 10 would
recommend skiing to anyone </garnt>
<garnt> who like me as a kid,
weren't wasn't able to go. </garnt>
<garnt> And if especially you're from
a Southeast Asian country. </garnt>
<garnt> - Garnt is a white man. Now. </garnt>
<connor> - Unfortunately it just happens
to be the most expensive </connor>
<joey> vacation sport you can do, unfortunately. </joey>
<joey> But it is good. It is really good. </joey>
<garnt> You can do budget once. </garnt>
<garnt> There's plenty of budget
packages that I know </garnt>
<connor> that we used to do when I was like a kid. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. Japan definitely
has those as well, for sure. </joey>
<garnt> - We got like the all inclusive thing. </garnt>

<garnt> - Did you guys get up to
anything else on your holidays? </garnt>
<joey> How was your Christmas. </joey>
<garnt> - Christmas?
- How was your new years? </garnt>
<joey> - Well, it was supposed
to be in Australia. </joey>
<garnt> - Well, that's exactly why
we went on the ski trip. </garnt>
<joey> - Because of-- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that didn't happen. </joey>
<joey> - Like we've been trying to
plan a ski trip for two years </joey>
<joey> and what it took to take us
to finally plan the ski trip </joey>
<joey> was a global pandemic to
cancel all our plans once again </joey>
<joey> to be like, well guys,
I know you guys are free </joey>
<joey> this weekend. </joey>
<joey> Or I know you guys are
finally free this week. </joey>
<joey> Let's go on a ski trip. </joey>
<joey> Hopefully we'll go on another ski trip </joey>
<joey> that won't take as much
time or if we plan. </joey>
<joey> - Two years later. </joey>
<garnt> - Two years later. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. My Christmas
and news was very chill. </garnt>
<garnt> Just spent it with some mates,
played a lot of Mahjong. </garnt>
<connor> - Played a lot of Mahjong? </connor>
<joey> - I played a lot of Mahjong played. </joey>
<connor> - Played a lot of TFT. </connor>
<garnt> - Of course you did. Of course you did. </garnt>
<garnt> Is that your new apex? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. I played with
Darius and Emily a bunch. </connor>
<garnt> So I was like addicted to it. It's fun. </garnt>
<garnt> It's fun. I don't know. </garnt>
<joey> It's like NFTs, but you-- </joey>
<joey> - You can leave. </joey>
<connor> - I've never understood TFT. </connor>
<connor> - It's auto chess. Isn't it? </connor>
<connor> - What does that mean? </connor>
<connor> - I don't know. I it's hard to explain. </connor>
<joey> 'Cause like it doesn't-- </joey>
<joey> - Something like the blockchain? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. It's not the blockchain. </joey>
<joey> It's a game that you
can't easily describe. </joey>
<joey> I don't know how you describe it. </joey>
<joey> - Kinda like the blockchain. </joey>
<joey> - Maybe if Garnt played it, </joey>
<connor> Garnt's really good at giving
short descriptions to staff. </connor>
<connor> I've noticed. I am not. </connor>
<connor> - That's why it's my job. </connor>
<garnt> That's literally what I do for my channel. </garnt>
<joey> - He does that with animations. </joey>
<garnt> - I'm not, when I play
this game, it's like, well, </garnt>
<connor> it's like a battle
simulation, chess thing. </connor>
<connor> You buy units and then you place them. </connor>
<connor> And then it plays out
on its own the battle. </connor>
<connor> - So it's like tower defense, but chess. </connor>
<connor> - But it's one battle
and then you lose health </connor>
<joey> or health depend on
what happens. And then-- </joey>
<connor> - But Tower Defense is kinda like that. </connor>
<garnt> You buy units and then
it plays automatically. </garnt>
<garnt> - But you're playing
against another player. </garnt>
<garnt> So he's buying stuff
and you are buying stuff </garnt>
<garnt> and you're placing them on the board. </garnt>
<garnt> And then you go against each
other and then you have to, </garnt>
<garnt> you also get like stuff that comes up </garnt>
<garnt> and you it's like gambling, but like, </garnt>
<garnt> there's re-rolling for more
choices to it's gambling. </garnt>
<garnt> Do you call it management? </garnt>
<garnt> - Gotcha. </garnt>
<garnt> - It is a very board boring
game when you explain it, </garnt>
<connor> extremely so. </connor>
<garnt> - [Director] You have to
exactly play it to actually-- </garnt>
<garnt> - Right. </garnt>
<joey> - It's fun though. </joey>
<joey> - You say that about most things. </joey>
<joey> It's one of those games again, </joey>
<joey> I wouldn't recommend playing it alone. </joey>
<garnt> There's, with friends it's great. </garnt>
<garnt> I think with friends it's really fun. </garnt>
<garnt> There's a lot of way. It's like chill, </garnt>
<connor> 'cause it's not too intense. </connor>
<connor> Like you can talk, league
is too intense. I feel. </connor>
<garnt> - League, I've tried playing
league with mates before </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm just that silent guy </garnt>
<garnt> because I'm concentrating
too much on the gameplay </garnt>
<garnt> to be able to communicate with my friends </garnt>
<garnt> or like have a good time. </garnt>
<connor> - It's great. There's a
lot of downtime in the game </connor>
<garnt> where you are not doing
anything so you can just chat </garnt>
<garnt> and it's you can do it very
casually. It's really chill. </garnt>
<connor> It's fun game. Recommend it. </connor>
<garnt> - Okay. I also have been trying to game. </garnt>
<connor> I've been trying to, can I
sound anymore boomer, but no, </connor>
<connor> I've been trying to
find a game to get into </connor>
<joey> still kind of looking
started Pokemon recently, </joey>
<joey> the newest Pokemon and the switch. </joey>
<garnt> - Diamond and Pokemon. </garnt>
<garnt> - The first Pokemon ever, right? </garnt>
<connor> Is it your first Pokemon game ever? </connor>
<garnt> - It's not my first Pokemon game ever. </garnt>
<garnt> It's my first Pokemon. </garnt>
<joey> Since Pokemon Ruby. </joey>
<garnt> The original Pokemon Ruby on the-- </garnt>
<garnt> - Like it. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know. When
does Pokemon get good? </garnt>
<connor> I forgot to. </connor>
<garnt> - That means you're playing it wrong. </garnt>
<connor> - No, no, no. That means
he's not enjoying it. </connor>
<garnt> - I'm not really enjoying it. </garnt>
<garnt> I'll be honest because
I've done the first two, </garnt>
<connor> like gyms now for Pokemon
Diamond. And I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> I remember being, huh? </connor>
<joey> - That's it. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, well that's so far. </joey>
<joey> - To be fair. That's how far I got-- </joey>
<connor> - That's like 10 minutes. </connor>
<garnt> - It's like two hours. Two, three hours. </garnt>
<joey> - Two hours? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Is it really? </garnt>
<joey> - It's maybe like an hour. </joey>
<joey> There's a lot of dialogue
you have to sift through. </joey>
<joey> - There is a lot of dialogue,
a lot of like 'cause okay. </joey>
<garnt> Here's the thing. When
you go to a new town, </garnt>
<garnt> do you talk to everyone? </garnt>
<garnt> - No. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay. I talk to everyone. </garnt>
<joey> I'm like, okay, this-- </joey>
<joey> - He's a classic JRPG player right there. </joey>
<joey> - This is me. This is JRP training. </joey>
<joey> - Being like, I have to
talk to everyone and about-- </joey>
<joey> - You can't miss the items right. </joey>
<joey> - About an hour in I'm just
like, this is really boring. </joey>
<connor> - Why are you talking to everyone? </connor>
<connor> Every so often they give me an item. </connor>
<garnt> So I must talk to everyone. </garnt>
<garnt> Otherwise I'm not going
to get all the items. </garnt>
<garnt> - What do they give you? A portion? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Five, 500-- </connor>
<garnt> - Sometimes they give me a super potion. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh. - It's like 500 Pokemon. </joey>
<garnt> - How many super potions do you use? </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know. </garnt>
<connor> - 'Cause your Pokemon's so OP. </connor>
<connor> - That's not the point. </connor>
<connor> I've like not needed to
change my Pokemon once </connor>
<connor> since my main Pokemon. </connor>
<garnt> Yeah. I don't know maybe
my experience is different </garnt>
<garnt> from my experience as a
childhood, because as a child, </garnt>
<garnt> it was just so easy for me to
immerse myself into a game. </garnt>
<connor> - This is why Pokemon
challenges are so good </connor>
<joey> and they've gotten, that's why
people love them on YouTube. </joey>
<joey> It's a way to turn a Pokemon
game into a more challenging </joey>
<connor> and I suppose adult kind of challenge. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, it's way more fun. </joey>
<joey> I can't play Pokemon Vanilla anymore. </joey>
<joey> I have to make it a chance. </joey>
<connor> - That's lots of fun. Randomizes are fun. </connor>
<joey> - 'Cause I came into this thinking. </joey>
<joey> I haven't played Pokemon
since Pokemon Ruby. </joey>
<joey> I can just play this casually </joey>
<joey> and have kind of the same experience did </joey>
<joey> as I did as a kid. </joey>
<joey> And I don't know if I'm just
not far enough into the game </joey>
<garnt> yet, but I mean, to me like
two, three hours into a game </garnt>
<garnt> is like mostly of the time. </garnt>
<garnt> That's what I give a game
before I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> do I stick with this
game and fully commit? </garnt>
<garnt> Or do I try another game? </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't think you like the game, Garnt. </garnt>
<garnt> - Maybe, maybe I don't. Maybe I don't. </garnt>
<connor> - Maybe you should try
Nuzlocke version of it. </connor>
<connor> That'd be more fun. </connor>
<joey> - What's Nuzlocke again? </joey>
<connor> - Nuzlocke is like PERMA death basically. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, okay. </connor>
<connor> So if you Pokemon fate, you die, </connor>
<joey> it "dies" and you have to release it. </joey>
<connor> - And you can only catch
one Pokemon in one area. </connor>
<joey> - There's lots of different rules. </joey>
<connor> - It's really good. </connor>
<connor> - There's lots of local rules as well. </connor>
<joey> You can kind of mix it up with
like different other rules </joey>
<garnt> and stuff like. </garnt>
<garnt> - But why wouldn't you just,
if your Pokemon's gonna die, </garnt>
<garnt> why wouldn't you just
like grind like crazy? </garnt>
<joey> - Well, I mean some people do, </joey>
<joey> but then there's a
challenge element of like, </joey>
<connor> do I want to grind for 50 hours </connor>
<connor> or do I just wanna like
gamble and go for it? </connor>
<connor> - A lot of the time, people
aren't willing to grind </connor>
<connor> for 20 hours just to secure that Pokemon, </connor>
<connor> but it's more fun and on
stream it's very good. </connor>
<garnt> It's very good stream. </garnt>
<garnt> - It sounds like great stream content. </garnt>
<garnt> That just sounds stressful to me. </garnt>
<joey> - It is stressful. </joey>
<joey> - Nuzlocke is a hell stressful. </joey>
<connor> - I saw someone do a one PP challenge. </connor>
<connor> - What's that. </connor>
<connor> - This great name where every Pokemon </connor>
<connor> they're only allowed to use the move once. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, shit. </joey>
<connor> - In one battle I think. </connor>
<connor> - Unless it heals up again, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> There's there's some
pretty obscure challenges. </joey>
<connor> - Some pretty good ones. </connor>
<joey> And there's the soul link,
which looks really good. </joey>
<garnt> Especially like where you both
of you do a Nuzlocke together </garnt>
<garnt> and like if Joey's Pokemon dies, </garnt>
<connor> when we caught it at the same
time, my Pokemon dies too. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Do you think Pokemon should
have a difficulty setting? </garnt>
<connor> - I think they should just, well, </connor>
<garnt> I don't know why they haven't
had their own Nuzlocke </garnt>
<garnt> into the game. Just call it
whatever they wanna call it. </garnt>
<garnt> They'll remove the name
Nuzlocke 'cause it's Pokemon. </garnt>
<garnt> They won't give credit to anyone. </garnt>
<connor> But I don't know why they
haven't put it in the game. </connor>
<joey> People do it. </joey>
<joey> - Because it's at the end of the day, </joey>
<joey> it's still a children's game. </joey>
<connor> - But like people are doing
this to their games anyway. </connor>
<connor> And people are gonna do it.
Why not just add the option? </connor>
<connor> Like it's not that it's a
children's game, it's like, </connor>
<joey> but like surely adding like the, </joey>
<joey> especially like a randomizer. </joey>
<joey> Surely that's easy to add. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah. It's hell easy. </joey>
<joey> - Just go in the code. </joey>
<connor> Be like random all and
then it should work. </connor>
<garnt> - Super easy. </garnt>
<garnt> - I know 'cause like for me </garnt>
<garnt> I never got the Pokemon
conversation before. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I just hadn't played
a Pokemon in so long. </garnt>
<garnt> But now that I've started to play, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just like, when does this get fun? </garnt>
<connor> How long do I not need to be on autopilot </connor>
<connor> for before this gets-- </connor>
<connor> - It's 'cause you're playing normally. </connor>
<connor> I think if you tried a
Nuzlocke on a stream, </connor>
<connor> you'd enjoy it a lot. </connor>
<garnt> - But if I'm not supposed
to play it normally </garnt>
<garnt> as a casual play who
knows zero about Pokemon-- </garnt>
<garnt> - It's you're old for that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Am I too old for that, Connor? </garnt>
<garnt> - You've played too many
games. You know how to game. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm not even a gamer.
I'm not even a gamer. </garnt>
<garnt> - You've played JRPGs, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. I've played. </garnt>
<joey> - You still grinding for
like 15 hours to get one sash </joey>
<joey> or something. I don't know. </joey>
<joey> You're too good. </joey>
<joey> - Clearly, not a JRPG player. </joey>
<garnt> - You are too at grinding. </garnt>
<garnt> But, and Pokemon now actually
doesn't require any grinding. </garnt>
<connor> You can just do it. Like
you start Pokemon on stomps. </connor>
<connor> - When did that happen? </connor>
<connor> I remember in the
original Pokemon as a kid, </connor>
<joey> I had to like grind the
out of even just first two, </joey>
<joey> first few gym leaders. </joey>
<garnt> - It lets me share that's so broken. </garnt>
<connor> When did they add that? </connor>
<connor> - This is such like a funny conversation. </connor>
<joey> I think they added that
at like X and Y I think. </joey>
<joey> - No, it was before that. </joey>
<joey> - Really black and white. </joey>
<connor> No black and white. </connor>
<joey> They didn't have it. I
think it was X and Y. </joey>
<connor> - It was always an item, </connor>
<joey> but it always only gave it to one Pokemon. </joey>
<joey> And then now they just, they were like, </joey>
<connor> just turn it on for everyone. </connor>
<joey> - You get experience by
catching Pokemon as well. </joey>
<garnt> Which was never a thing. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. You get experience
by catching Pokemon. </garnt>
<garnt> When you catch a Pokemon, </garnt>
<garnt> all the Pokemon in your party
get experience from you. </garnt>
<garnt> - What? </garnt>
<joey> - As if you defeated it. </joey>
<joey> - They're just Oprah
Winfreying the experience. </joey>
<joey> They're just like you getting experience, </joey>
<joey> you getting the experience. </joey>
<joey> - That's sweet. </joey>
<garnt> - As a Gaer gamer, I'm disgusted
by the lack of grinding </garnt>
<garnt> I need to do in this game. </garnt>
<garnt> - As a gamer, I'm disgusted
by your Gaer game. </garnt>
<joey> - I have been thinking
to do maybe shiny runs </joey>
<garnt> or stuff like that where it's
a little more challenging. </garnt>
<garnt> A really fun one I did was,
I did a Pokemon Emerald mode </garnt>
<connor> where, and whenever you enter a building, </connor>
<connor> it teleports you to a
random part of the map. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah. I've seen that one. </connor>
<connor> - That one was really fun, </connor>
<joey> but 'cause it was so hard 'cause
you had to route everything </joey>
<joey> on your own. </joey>
<joey> So if you weren't familiar
with the map of the game, </joey>
<joey> you were just fucked. </joey>
<joey> - True. </joey>
<joey> - That was really fun
though. Because it's like, </joey>
<joey> it gives on a completely
different challenge to it </joey>
<joey> that it actually becomes like
really entertaining and fun. </joey>
<connor> - So are all new Pokemon games,
just this easy, unless you-- </connor>
<joey> - They all hold your hand, </joey>
<garnt> - artificially add
difficulty to your own run. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yes. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay. </garnt>
<joey> - I'd say ever since
Black and White or X and Y </joey>
<joey> is where it's really started
to like hold your hand. </joey>
<garnt> - I understand gamers now. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> I thought you guys were being babies </garnt>
<joey> complaining about this stuff. </joey>
<joey> - No. It actually holds
your hand now it's like, </joey>
<joey> especially if you've played Pokemon </joey>
<joey> ever since the beginning. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I go from that. </garnt>
<joey> Which is to like, if you catch a Pokemon, </joey>
<garnt> you need to commit to leveling it up. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh. Dude. Like kids, if
I wanna give a kid today </joey>
<joey> who grew up on like sword and shield. </joey>
<joey> Or like the new remains give
them like the original blue </joey>
<joey> or like red and be like play
this game and just watch them </joey>
<joey> have a mental breakdown
of how difficult it is </joey>
<joey> compared to what they get today. </joey>
<garnt> - Did you see the, what was it called. </garnt>
<garnt> I totally forgot now. Sorry. </garnt>
<joey> - Ah, great. </joey>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<garnt> No. Cause I remember
as a kid, I don't know, </garnt>
<garnt> some things just felt rewarding
that I don't feel rewarded </garnt>
<garnt> with this game. For example,
when you level up your Pokemon, </garnt>
<garnt> every Pokemon just
levels up automatically. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like an auto leveler. </garnt>
<joey> - It was the Pokemon
Let's Go EV and Pikachu. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - They gave your starter
Pokemon like increased stance. </joey>
<garnt> The EV or Pikachu and
it had its special move. </garnt>
<garnt> It just one shot everything. </garnt>
<connor> So they gave you the starter
that could just one shot. </connor>
<connor> - Now, the most bullshit part about EV, </connor>
<connor> I've really enjoyed EV to be fair, </connor>
<joey> but the most part about EV
was I did an EV only run </joey>
<joey> on stream ones because it's just so easy. </joey>
<joey> But in some of the Pokemons, you go to, </joey>
<connor> there's just this dude. Who's like, </connor>
<joey> I can teach your EV any move of any type. </joey>
<connor> - Oh my God. </connor>
<joey> - For free. Which one would you like? </joey>
<joey> It's like fire move. </joey>
<joey> And they're like really
powerful moves as well. </joey>
<joey> So it's like, what's the catch? </joey>
<joey> And it's like, no catch
it's because you talk to me, </joey>
<joey> it's like, Oh good. And I
think I did the EV only run </joey>
<joey> like four hours. </joey>
<joey> It was like one of the easiest games ever. </joey>
<joey> I only did it because I like EV. </joey>
<garnt> - Was it after Pokemon Ruby
that everything started </garnt>
<joey> to just get easy. </joey>
<joey> - I think the original Diamond and Pearl </joey>
<garnt> was still like in that
same difficulty range. </garnt>
<garnt> I think, I reckon it was
around like X and Y six gen </garnt>
<joey> where they introduced the
whole experience sharing </joey>
<joey> and the really holding your hand element </joey>
<garnt> 'cause Sun and Moon was
just so ridiculously easy. </garnt>
<garnt> And the same was Sword and Shield as well. </garnt>
<joey> And then every other remake since then, </joey>
<joey> it's just been like baby mode. </joey>
<connor> - I remember when I
was a kid in the games, </connor>
<garnt> this is like boomer. I
remember I was back in my day, </garnt>
<garnt> every game was just impossible. </garnt>
<connor> But now we've gone too far. </connor>
<joey> - I remember crying, trying
to beat the first stage </joey>
<joey> of Mega Man 2. </joey>
<joey> I ride a game one Game Boy. </joey>
<connor> It was damnations 101, hardest
game ever played in my life. </connor>
<joey> - The Disney games like Game
Boy advance was so hard. </joey>
<joey> - Not even Game Boy
advance, like Game Boy. </joey>
<joey> - Oh game boy game. </joey>
<joey> - This shit was impossible. </joey>
<joey> I don't even know what the I was doing. </joey>
<garnt> This is how games were back
then. Like I didn't even, </garnt>
<garnt> didn't even tell you the objective. </garnt>
<garnt> You just have to go around and figure out. </garnt>
<garnt> You know what kills you? I
don't know what is going on. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't even remember. </garnt>
<garnt> I didn't receive quality
feel once in that game, </garnt>
<garnt> I was just going around this thing. </garnt>
<garnt> It was like a construction site. </garnt>
<garnt> And I was one of the dogs
and I was like, what is this? </garnt>
<garnt> And I remember like
accordions were killing me. </garnt>
<connor> what is this game? I
just don't understand. </connor>
<connor> Back then they used to just put you in-- </connor>
<joey> - Was it one of those
unlicensed, Disney games or? </joey>
<connor> - No, no. It was an actual license. </connor>
<joey> - Oh my God. </joey>
<connor> - This is back when licensed
games were just put a platform </connor>
<connor> and just make it impossible. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, it was back then where I was like, </joey>
<joey> take the IP, put it
into the Mario universe. </joey>
<garnt> Change the design a little
bit. You have a game. </garnt>
<garnt> So that's what the Mick Mouse game was. </garnt>
<garnt> The one that I scammed
to my friend, basically. </garnt>
<garnt> It was like Stu it was basically
just a Mario platformer, </garnt>
<joey> but it was stupidly hard. </joey>
<connor> - I should remember I
had this like PS 1 game </connor>
<garnt> and it was a Shrek game. </garnt>
<garnt> It was a Shrek picnic game or something. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm sure Shrek enthusiast
can inform me about this game. </garnt>
<garnt> I remember the whole point
of this game was to like, </garnt>
<garnt> you were assembling, I
could be describing this </garnt>
<garnt> completely correctly. </garnt>
<joey> Like the parts to your picnic. </joey>
<joey> And you had to go and
like beat bosses and shit, </joey>
<joey> but like nothing worked
in the game, I remembered. </joey>
<joey> - I have to look this up. </joey>
<joey> - Okay. Can we give Shrek-- </joey>
<joey> - It doesn't sound like a real game. </joey>
<joey> - Shrek a PS 1 games. </joey>
<joey> - Okay. </joey>
<joey> - Google it right there. </joey>
<joey> - Let's go Shrek. </joey>
<joey> - I just remember it's like
a FIFA Dream this game, </joey>
<garnt> the polygons were so-- </garnt>
<garnt> - A Shrek Treasure Hunt. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's it, That's it. This game. </garnt>
<garnt> I remember I played this game. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh my God. </joey>
<joey> - There was like one
polygon in this whole game. </joey>
<joey> - That looks like asked, what is that? </joey>
<joey> What is that? </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - I wanna, what is it? </joey>
<garnt> There's three. I actually
has good ratings. </garnt>
<garnt> It's 78% like this video game. </garnt>
<garnt> What is it? </garnt>
<garnt> What's the synopsis? </garnt>
<joey> Could we read the synopsis at this case? </joey>
<joey> - Shrek Treasure Hunt. </joey>
<joey> - Gameplay. Oh, plot. </joey>
<joey> As Shrek is preparing a picnic with Fiona, </joey>
<joey> the three blind Mike, steal,
all the picnic equipment, </joey>
<joey> such as foods and drinks. </joey>
<connor> So Shrek must go on an
adventure doing mini games </connor>
<connor> to get the items back
before Fiona arrives. </connor>
<connor> But I remember it was like
a bunch of mini games. </connor>
<connor> And these mini games,
just were all broken, </connor>
<connor> they didn't work. </connor>
<joey> - I love games with these kinds of plots </joey>
<joey> because you can just
imagine it just being like, </joey>
<joey> Fiona have to go get-- </joey>
<connor> - I remember the camera was unusable </connor>
<garnt> and it kept breaking my PS one. </garnt>
<garnt> And then eventually it just broke. </garnt>
<garnt> And I was so close to
the end of this game. </garnt>
<garnt> I was distraught. </garnt>
<garnt> - What's the last picnic item? </garnt>
<garnt> - I couldn't believe it. </garnt>
<garnt> I remember you have to go to
like some castle or something </garnt>
<garnt> to fight these mice or
some nonsense like that. </garnt>
<connor> And I was just, I so angry
that I couldn't finish it. </connor>
<joey> - I have to find that and play it. </joey>
<connor> - You gotta play it, bro. </connor>
<connor> It sounds amazing. It's a great game. </connor>
<connor> You just stream it. </connor>
<connor> - I guess I should. Maybe I'll
stream it if you want me to. </connor>
<joey> - I wanna see it. </joey>
<garnt> - I actually have a game
recommendation though, </garnt>
<garnt> that I found, </garnt>
<garnt> It is a JLBG though. It
is called 13 Sentinels. </garnt>
<joey> - I think-- </joey>
<joey> - I've heard of that. </joey>
<garnt> - Have you heard of that? </garnt>
<garnt> So I found this by like complete accident. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I'm just like trying to
look through my game library </garnt>
<garnt> of like games. That sound interesting. </garnt>
<garnt> And I just kind of downloaded it on a whim </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I'm just like
anime game. Brilliant. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's not Pokemon anymore. </garnt>
<garnt> I say that Pokemon's an anime game. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's not typically. </garnt>
<garnt> - But yeah, I download it </garnt>
<garnt> and it is got a really
interesting concept. </garnt>
<garnt> So how I can best describe this. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like if you take Bokurano </garnt>
<garnt> and mix that with Steins;Gate. </garnt>
<garnt> So the reason it's called 13 sentinels </garnt>
<garnt> is because you have, basically
you have 13 main characters. </garnt>
<garnt> And so the way this story
unfolds is that you are able to </garnt>
<garnt> select a perspective of
part of this main character. </garnt>
<garnt> And the basis of this is at
some point in the future, </garnt>
<garnt> Kaiju come along and try
to destroy the world. </garnt>
<garnt> And so these 13 kids
have to save the world </garnt>
<garnt> from this Kajiu attack. </garnt>
<garnt> But I think they fail or something. </garnt>
<garnt> So time travel exists. </garnt>
<garnt> So you're watching, you're
playing this perspective, </garnt>
<garnt> this game from like 13
different perspectives. </garnt>
<garnt> And these perspectives jump
between timelines and universes, </garnt>
<garnt> depending on who you choose and
whose perspective you're on. </garnt>
<garnt> And you think this will
be a complete mess. </garnt>
<garnt> Like how can you tell a coherent
story when you can choose </garnt>
<garnt> between 30 different perspectives? </garnt>
<garnt> Well, how the game works is
that you can only progress </garnt>
<garnt> to a certain amount of point
in one person's per perspective </garnt>
<garnt> before you have to play
another person's perspective. </garnt>
<garnt> So one person's story route
is unlocked by playing </garnt>
<garnt> a certain part of another
person's story route. </garnt>
<garnt> So the way you get delivered, </garnt>
<garnt> the story is like little by
little and you get to piece </garnt>
<garnt> together what has happened
between this entire timeline. </garnt>
<joey> It's actually like insane. </joey>
<joey> - That sounds cool. </joey>
<joey> - I remember my Twitch chat,
telling me all about it </joey>
<garnt> being like, you'd love this game. </garnt>
<garnt> - Does it have good ratings? </garnt>
<garnt> - It does have good ratings.
That's kind of why I-- </garnt>
<joey> - Aegis Rim 13 Sentinels. </joey>
<garnt> - 13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh, it's an Atlas game. Of
course. That's why it's good. </joey>
<joey> Of course. </joey>
<garnt> - 94% Percent. </garnt>
<garnt> - So the gameplay is kind of
like a turn base strategy. </garnt>
<garnt> It's the best way I can describe is like-- </garnt>
<joey> - It looks gorgeous. </joey>
<joey> - That looks cute. </joey>
<joey> - It looks really cute. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. It is a very
Atlas game, I realized, </garnt>
<joey> 'cause it's basically a
mix between a visual novel, </joey>
<garnt> but with gameplay elements
to break up the story </garnt>
<garnt> of that visual novel. </garnt>
<joey> - Switch versions coming
out in April this year. </joey>
<garnt> - Ooh. Okay. But I highly recommend that. </garnt>
<garnt> That was just something
I played on the whim </garnt>
<garnt> because like I said, I give
everything like two hours </garnt>
<joey> or something to try and grab me. </joey>
<garnt> And this one like grabbed me immediately. </garnt>
<garnt> It has a very original storytelling method </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm about halfway through. </garnt>
<joey> And like they use like some
of the twists and turns </joey>
<joey> I've seen in the story are insane. </joey>
<joey> - Atlas, don't miss man. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - You really don't miss. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Except that new Catherine
game, that was shit. </garnt>
<garnt> - I know more about the
memes of the Catherine game, </garnt>
<garnt> than actual people that have
played the Catherine game. </garnt>
<joey> - I played the new Catherine
game and it was not that good. </joey>
<garnt> - 'Cause it's weird. 'Cause
like a lot of this games just, </garnt>
<garnt> I hear more about the Japanese
side talking about it, </garnt>
<connor> but like I hardly ever hear
anyone in the Western hemisphere </connor>
<connor> talking about it unless it's persona. </connor>
<connor> That's 'cause that's basically-- </connor>
<connor> - I know Western hemisphere. </connor>
<joey> - Or the Western. </joey>
<connor> - The Western world. </connor>
<connor> - Western. I don't know why
I said hemisphere there. </connor>
<connor> - Is Japan in the Western hemisphere? </connor>
<connor> - Technically, anywhere
can be western hemisphere. </connor>
<garnt> Depending on where you want. </garnt>
<garnt> - I Kinda realize that. </garnt>
<garnt> - I feel it's because in the
west it's a very core fan base </garnt>
<connor> for Atlas games. </connor>
<joey> Because they are like
the JRPG players, J RPG. </joey>
<connor> - I know people who are like,
anime game, no thank you. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> They take long-- </joey>
<garnt> - Thank you. Rightfully so. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. They take one, look
at the visuals or the concept </garnt>
<garnt> and they're just like, </garnt>
<garnt> Nope, I'd rather play bang, bang, bang. </garnt>
<joey> - Like this man for instance. </joey>
<connor> - I understand. There's a
certain kind of expectation </connor>
<garnt> that comes with anime
games. That in my experience </garnt>
<garnt> is always the same. </garnt>
<garnt> You always get that same feeling. </garnt>
<garnt> Even if the stories are different, </garnt>
<garnt> the game plays different,
something about it just always </garnt>
<joey> comes off as the same in
my mind. I don't know why. </joey>
<connor> - I don't fault people that
are thinking that though. </connor>
<connor> - That's what I like about it. </connor>
<garnt> - That's consistency. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't fault people
for thinking that though, </garnt>
<garnt> because that's exactly how I
feel with a lot of FBS games. </garnt>
<garnt> Where it's like, the concept is different, </garnt>
<garnt> but at the end of the day,
it's still bang, bang, bang. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's fine. </garnt>
<joey> - RPGs for me. </joey>
<joey> - Well like even like Western driven </joey>
<joey> story driven games as well.
It's just like, I don't know. </joey>
<garnt> I guess it's a same reason why
I'm into anime versus movies </garnt>
<garnt> and TV shows where, I will
always watch a movie and TV show, </garnt>
<garnt> but those aren't the core
pieces of entertainment </garnt>
<garnt> that I like. For example, I
remember playing The Last of Us </garnt>
<garnt> and it's a great game, </garnt>
<joey> but I just have like zero
emotional attachment to it. </joey>
<joey> I play it and I can
like objectively view-- </joey>
<garnt> - Is it because they are not anime? </garnt>
<garnt> - I guess I don't know. </garnt>
<connor> - If they were more anime,
you'd be like, I care. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't know why it was just </garnt>
<garnt> it's the way Western
storytelling works is that </garnt>
<garnt> it's got different tropes
and different method </garnt>
<garnt> of storytelling. But I don't
know of why I gravitate more </garnt>
<garnt> to like the anime style of storytelling </garnt>
<garnt> because I do think they
do have a different style. </garnt>
<garnt> - Definitely, definitely. </garnt>
<connor> - Most different cultures. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. Different cultures
and everything like that. </connor>
<connor> And the way Joel and Ellie
were written as characters </connor>
<connor> were great. </connor>
<connor> They were great characters. </connor>
<garnt> I just didn't emotionally
attach myself to either </garnt>
<garnt> of those characters, </garnt>
<garnt> even though I could tell that
they were great characters. </garnt>
<connor> - Why do you emotionally
touch yourself more </connor>
<connor> to anime characters then? </connor>
<joey> - 'Cause he's a whim. </joey>
<joey> - Well, there's gonna be a reason. </joey>
<garnt> What about the way that
they did do their characters </garnt>
<connor> is more appealing. </connor>
<garnt> - I think it's because
they're unrealistic. </garnt>
<connor> - I was gonna say, 'cause
that's what bothers me. </connor>
<garnt> - I like the fact that
with anime characters </garnt>
<garnt> there's like a clear distinction </garnt>
<garnt> between reality and fantasy. </garnt>
<garnt> And I like having that
easy separation in my mind </garnt>
<garnt> where you can have great
really well written anime </garnt>
<joey> characters that are still
clearly like really unrealistic. </joey>
<joey> Like just take any
Cinderella, for example, </joey>
<joey> you can have great written Cinderella, </joey>
<joey> but at the end of the day, </joey>
<joey> if you meet a real real life Cinderella, </joey>
<joey> you're just gonna think
that they're a bitch. </joey>
<garnt> And why are they doing
domestic violence on their farm </garnt>
<garnt> or whatever, right. </garnt>
<connor> - Do you think that the
authors who are writing these </connor>
<connor> are intentionally making
unrealistic characters </connor>
<connor> or they're intending
to do real characters, </connor>
<connor> but it just comes off
as unrealistic to us. </connor>
<joey> - I think it's all based on just </joey>
<joey> not only the cultural understanding
and norm of that author, </joey>
<connor> but it's also the fact
that a lot of these authors </connor>
<connor> are also hashing off
other Japanese creations </connor>
<connor> and other Japanese characters. Right. </connor>
<connor> So I don't really know of many
or any like Japanese author </connor>
<joey> who takes direct influence
from like Western stuff, </joey>
<garnt> for instance. </garnt>
<garnt> Like the only one I can
think of is like Iraqi. </garnt>
<garnt> Which is why his
characters are so different </garnt>
<garnt> compared to the traditional norm, </garnt>
<joey> like manga animated,
character style of character. </joey>
<joey> Not just visually, but
also as a characteristic </joey>
<joey> of that particular person. </joey>
<garnt> - Why is like so many
animes set in high school? </garnt>
<joey> Why is that like, is
that a cultural thing? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. It's a cultural thing. </joey>
<joey> - Why, why so? </joey>
<joey> - It's because it's, for a lot of people, </joey>
<joey> like high school is kind of
seen as like this basically </joey>
<connor> like golden time. </connor>
<connor> - It's depressing. </connor>
<connor> - It's like for a lot of
people, high school is like, </connor>
<connor> the whole thing of like in
the west of like high school </connor>
<garnt> is usually movies that are
based in high school in the west </garnt>
<garnt> are based off bad memories. </garnt>
<garnt> Being like, oh man, my high
school sucked, blah, blah, blah. </garnt>
<garnt> There were all these people,
the jocks, the bullies, </garnt>
<garnt> blah, blah, blah. </garnt>
<garnt> That's the norm in the west, in Japan, </garnt>
<connor> it's glorified because to a lot of people, </connor>
<connor> high school was really fun time </connor>
<connor> with friends they'll never get back </connor>
<connor> and because it's also the
last years of that person </connor>
<connor> being young and free. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, I liked high
school, but I wouldn't say-- </connor>
<connor> - I liked high school. </connor>
<garnt> - How my life. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think as well, in terms
of like a storytelling, </garnt>
<garnt> like standpoint as well, I
feel like kids in high school </garnt>
<garnt> or kids going through
puberty is just already </garnt>
<joey> a really interesting character dynamic. </joey>
<joey> You can get characters to
get away with a lot of shit </joey>
<joey> just because they're in puberty. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. But I feel like
there are so many shows </garnt>
<garnt> and so many anime where
you look at the characters </garnt>
<joey> and they could be in any setting. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause some of the shit
that these high schoolers </joey>
<joey> go through, they go
through two world wars. </joey>
<joey> They're like fighting
Avengers level threats </joey>
<joey> when they've reached the 13 years old. </joey>
<joey> - That's totally not a
well written character. </joey>
<joey> - That's not clearly just
an author of being like, </joey>
<joey> I like high school settings. </joey>
<joey> - Let's put them in a high school, </joey>
<joey> but don't actually take full
advantage of it, unfortunately. </joey>
<joey> But there's a lot of authors
that take full advantage </joey>
<joey> of the high school characters
and that whole setting </joey>
<garnt> and actually work it into
their characters and story. </garnt>
<connor> Mind you, that's the
minority. In my opinion, </connor>
<connor> a lot of them are just like
high school, realistic, </connor>
<joey> relatable with audience. Am I right? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Let's throw them in there. </connor>
<joey> - I watched Aggretsuko the
new season. That was good. </joey>
<joey> That was very refreshing. </joey>
<joey> Depressing is your always. </joey>
<joey> - Depressing is far. Yes. </joey>
<joey> - Which is great to see. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause it's like one of
the only anime out there </joey>
<connor> that will actually like
commentate on adult life in Japan </connor>
<joey> and be realistic about it. </joey>
<joey> But it also says a lot when it,
no one knows about in Japan. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Is that true? </garnt>
<garnt> - It is absolutely unknown in Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh. Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like it is not popular at all. </garnt>
<garnt> Probably because it's too real. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's been in Japan. </garnt>
<connor> - It's literal real in Japan. </connor>
<garnt> - Very Japanese things in it as well. </garnt>
<garnt> It's so Japanese, but
it's such a good take </garnt>
<garnt> on the Japanese work life. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. It's awesome. </garnt>
<connor> - How awful is. </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause it's ironic that this is coming </garnt>
<garnt> from the same company
that made Hello Kitty. </garnt>
<garnt> - Just to put it into perspective,
how deep they're going. </garnt>
<joey> So in Japan they have a thing
called say shine, right. </joey>
<joey> Which is like an employee for life. </joey>
<joey> You can never fire this employee. </joey>
<joey> They have to do something
like really fucked. </joey>
<joey> - Well they have to leave
on their own accord. </joey>
<joey> - But like even the only
way they can get fired </joey>
<joey> is if they actually do
something like illegal. </joey>
<joey> - The only way they
can leave the company-- </joey>
<joey> - You cannot be fired. </joey>
<joey> - Is by going to jail. </joey>
<joey> You could literally do the
shittiest job on earth. </joey>
<joey> Like you could like not turn
up and you cannot be fired. </joey>
<joey> So in Japan obviously,
'cause they decided-- </joey>
<joey> - Talk about job security. </joey>
<garnt> So obviously if you told that to anyone </garnt>
<garnt> in any Western country, they'd be like, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't think that sounds like a good idea </garnt>
<garnt> because it's not, let's just be honest. </garnt>
<garnt> Obviously job security
is good and that's good. </garnt>
<garnt> But it's a terrible idea for any business, </garnt>
<garnt> You need to be able to
get rid of employees. </garnt>
<garnt> But obviously in the west it's a little, </garnt>
<garnt> especially in some places
they're a little too happy </garnt>
<garnt> to fire employees. </garnt>
<garnt> So here has to be a balance. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's a balance, </garnt>
<garnt> There's a whole arc or like
story in the new season. </garnt>
<garnt> I won't spoil who it is or what it is, </garnt>
<garnt> but there's a character who,
because they can't fire him, </garnt>
<garnt> they just relocate him to some shit hole </garnt>
<garnt> and don't give him any work. </garnt>
<garnt> And they basically just like
morally make him want to quit. </garnt>
<joey> And they're , and it's a whole
thing and it's really dark. </joey>
<joey> - That's the only way
that SA Shane can quit. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. So that-- </garnt>
<garnt> - Basically just pressure them. </garnt>
<connor> - They bully you. </connor>
<joey> - They bully you to quitting. </joey>
<joey> So there's a whole thing where
they just make him fuck off </joey>
<garnt> and like make him, you know,
cause obviously people are, </garnt>
<garnt> people wanna be valued when they do work. </garnt>
<garnt> And if you are just not doing anything, </garnt>
<garnt> you're gonna be like, why am I here? </garnt>
<garnt> Obviously if I was there,
I'd be like, fantastic. </garnt>
<garnt> I can catch up-- </garnt>
<garnt> - Fantastic. Let's just play Apex. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's why it works in Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> It doesn't, I'm like you telling me, </garnt>
<joey> I can just do whatever I want </joey>
<joey> and you're gonna give me the salary. </joey>
<joey> - What's the latest,
the greatest ski season. </joey>
<garnt> - See you. I'm like,
Thanks for the paycheck. </garnt>
<garnt> This is why I'm never
gonna be hired full time. </garnt>
<garnt> Say Shannon. </garnt>
<garnt> No I've said that? This is bad. </garnt>
<garnt> Maybe that's for the better. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. True. True. </garnt>
<garnt> - But yeah, they go to
some really dark stuff. </garnt>
<joey> It's a shame that it's not being Japan. </joey>
<connor> I feel like a kid make
waves. Maybe it's too real. </connor>
<joey> - I think it is. </joey>
<joey> I think it's just purely the
fact that a Japanese person </joey>
<joey> will look at that and be like, </joey>
<joey> I don't want to see this because
it's just gonna remind me </joey>
<joey> of reality. And so a
lot of Japanese people, </joey>
<joey> that's not the reason
why they watch anime. </joey>
<connor> - That was a really one dark
bit. I mean I think sure. </connor>
<joey> You can remember it in
the new season. Right? </joey>
<joey> I spoil it. I won't say who it is. </joey>
<connor> I'll just say what happens. </connor>
<joey> - Oh no, no. I know what
you're talking about. </joey>
<connor> Maybe we shouldn't. </connor>
<connor> - You can't say that? </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<connor> - Really? Is it that bad? </connor>
<joey> - It's a bit of a twist. </joey>
<connor> - All right, all right. </connor>
<connor> Haven't watched the-- </connor>
<connor> - It's pretty bad. </connor>
<joey> - Just watch the whole
season. It's amazing. </joey>
<connor> - Honestly, regrets
carries is like killing it. </connor>
<garnt> - I've had mixed reviews about
the fourth season, actually. </garnt>
<connor> Some people have said that it feels like </connor>
<connor> it's said everything
it's needed to say now. </connor>
<connor> And it's like they're trying
a lot to bring something new </connor>
<connor> on the table. </connor>
<garnt> - First five episodes, really good. </garnt>
<garnt> Last first episodes, boring. </garnt>
<garnt> Like completely unnecessary.
I did not like it. </garnt>
<garnt> That's how I felt this. Right. </garnt>
<connor> I felt like they had a good
thing going and then they just-- </connor>
<joey> - It definitely, it
fizzles out at the end. </joey>
<joey> - It's still a salt season though. </joey>
<connor> - I also watched all of Mushoku Tensei. </connor>
<garnt> - Ooh. Look at you watching anime. </garnt>
<garnt> - I said I was gonna all of it. </garnt>
<garnt> All of it. One entered. </garnt>
<connor> - Round of applause. </connor>
<connor> - Round of applause. </connor>
<garnt> - Thank you. </garnt>
<garnt> After, I said I would
and everyone was like, </garnt>
<garnt> Connor's not gonna watch it. </garnt>
<garnt> And then there was a bunch
of comments that are like, </garnt>
<garnt> I hope Connor doesn't watch it. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I know he is gonna hate it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Did you hate it? </garnt>
<garnt> - No. </garnt>
<connor> - Wow. </connor>
<connor> - I liked it. </connor>
<connor> - Wow. </connor>
<connor> - I liked it. I thought
it was good, honestly. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, it was really good. </connor>
<connor> I can see why people
think I would hate it. </connor>
<connor> Because the first episode
I was like, all right. </connor>
<connor> We champ, all right. </connor>
<connor> I mean, listen, listen,
the way it starts is weird. </connor>
<garnt> 'Cause he gets Isekai as you do. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause it's the first Isekai.
That's all I knew about it. </garnt>
<garnt> Was, it was the only thing
I knew about the show </garnt>
<connor> is that it was the first-- </connor>
<garnt> - I feel like whenever Connor hears Isekai </garnt>
<connor> flashbacks of me talking like in-- </connor>
<garnt> - Basically, basically. </garnt>
<garnt> And so I went into this with an open mind. </garnt>
<garnt> I didn't read any reviews.
I didn't watch any videos. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know anything
about Mushoku Tensei. </garnt>
<garnt> All know is that everyone hypes it out. </garnt>
<connor> I was like, okay, I'll watch it. </connor>
<connor> Be me right, first
episode, Mushoku Tensei. </connor>
<connor> And he gets Isekai as a toddler. </connor>
<garnt> This thing he does is
starts like admiring, </garnt>
<garnt> like the woman's tits. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm like, oh this is the
show that everyone's hyping up. </garnt>
<connor> This is it, this, this is it. </connor>
<garnt> - He doesn't, he didn't
just admire the tits. </garnt>
<garnt> He like makes a shrine out
of like one of their panties. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. So the whole,
first like two episodes </garnt>
<garnt> was just him being like an imbecile. </garnt>
<joey> - I completely forgot about how -- </joey>
<connor> - That was the one episode
I have erased from my mind. </connor>
<joey> - He's like an imbecile, And I was like, </joey>
<joey> are we seriously just gonna watch a guy, </joey>
<joey> another show where an
indocile just gets rewarded </joey>
<joey> with a massive cock in the new universe, </joey>
<joey> bestowed confidence, magical
power is the most op guy. </joey>
<garnt> And never has to overcome
the fact that he has really </garnt>
<garnt> unhealthy views towards
women and sex and everything. </garnt>
<garnt> But this one was good,
'cause I felt like they, </garnt>
<garnt> he actually at least somewhat
learned that, Hey maybe, </garnt>
<garnt> maybe the way I viewed
women was kind of fucked up </garnt>
<garnt> in the past. </garnt>
<garnt> And I was like, it can
be done. Anime can do it. </garnt>
<joey> - Not only was this the first Isekai, </joey>
<joey> but it was the first self realized insult. </joey>
<connor> - On top of that it was a good show. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, this is
great. This is fantastic. </connor>
<connor> Because not only was the
world building amazing. </connor>
<connor> I was really like into the world. </connor>
<connor> I loved all the characters,
even the parents </connor>
<garnt> who they easily could have just been like, </garnt>
<garnt> oh it's just parents. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. I was really surprised. </garnt>
<connor> - They built everything up. </connor>
<connor> - I was really surprised when the parents </connor>
<joey> were just characters. Cause
normally you see anime parents </joey>
<joey> are just like half the time. </joey>
<joey> They're not even there. </joey>
<joey> And I remember watching. </joey>
<joey> - And when they are there,
you can't see their eyes. </joey>
<joey> - I was remember watching
because I'm so used to isekai </joey>
<joey> speed running this. </joey>
<joey> Which he gets transported, </joey>
<connor> starts like getting the girl,
starts beating up the dudes. </connor>
<connor> I'm five episodes into Mushoku Tensei. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, He's still with the parents? </connor>
<connor> What's what's going on. </connor>
<connor> And then I realized, wait a minute, </connor>
<garnt> I'm actually getting invested
in the family dynamic </garnt>
<garnt> and the family story and stuff like that. </garnt>
<garnt> - It really is like the
slow cooker of isekai </garnt>
<garnt> where everything else is
just like a microwave. </garnt>
<joey> - Can, I spoil one minor plot point. </joey>
<joey> It's not a big deal. It's
really not your bunch spoil-- </joey>
<joey> - Spoiler warning. </joey>
<joey> - Spoiler warning. </joey>
<joey> The moment I knew this show
was built different really? </joey>
<garnt> Was sitting there watching
episode six or seven. </garnt>
<garnt> It just starts. And the
first thing that happens </garnt>
<garnt> is it's like normal family life </garnt>
<garnt> is like, the husband has cheated
on the wife with the maid. </garnt>
<garnt> And she's pregnant. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like what the fuck is this show doing? </garnt>
<garnt> What the fuck is going on? </garnt>
<garnt> And there was like a
whole point where he like </garnt>
<garnt> our 10 year old protagonist was diffusing, </garnt>
<garnt> this Jerry Springer episode. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, what is happening in the show? </garnt>
<garnt> Is this an isekai or
Jerry Springer's like, </garnt>
<garnt> you are not the parent. And I
said, yeah, what's going on? </garnt>
<garnt> Like I was so like, I was like. </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, is this good? </garnt>
<garnt> This is good. Right. </garnt>
<connor> I think this is fun. This is great. </connor>
<connor> And then they actually get
into world building later on. </connor>
<connor> And it's amazing. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. I mean, what I like
about it is that it does take </garnt>
<garnt> that time to like build up shit </garnt>
<joey> with all this, Jerry Springer, </joey>
<joey> just to say like, Hey, dad's
kind of an ass hole as well. </joey>
<joey> He can do bad things. </joey>
<joey> He ain't the perfect human being. </joey>
<joey> And then like, it helps it just like, </joey>
<joey> it all plays part into
like his journey, I guess. </joey>
<garnt> And I think the biggest
down point was you finish </garnt>
<garnt> the first season. You're like
this story hasn't even begun. </garnt>
<garnt> - I thought I missed an episode
or something when it ended, </garnt>
<garnt> I was looking. 'Cause I
thought, oh my episode 11, </garnt>
<garnt> it must be 12. 'Cause
it ended so abruptly. </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, oh, where's the episode 12? </garnt>
<joey> And then I was start running
the new season I was sucked </joey>
<connor> I mean that I had one less episode. </connor>
<joey> - You wanna hear on me?
I've only seen first season. </joey>
<connor> - Second season's amazing. </connor>
<connor> The second season is really good. </connor>
<joey> - Second season is where you
get so much of the payoff? </joey>
<garnt> Of what was like the world
building that's built up </garnt>
<garnt> in the first season. </garnt>
<connor> I would be quite annoyed if I watched it </connor>
<garnt> and season 2 wasn't out. 'Cause
I think I feel blue ball. </garnt>
<garnt> But it was a great show.
Like again, I wanna, </garnt>
<garnt> I can't give credit enough, </garnt>
<joey> but the fact that they
actually like just-- </joey>
<joey> - Did something different? </joey>
<joey> - did something different and it worked. </joey>
<connor> And the fact that this
is the first Isekai. </connor>
<connor> Which makes me like really concerned. </connor>
<joey> - Why did they not take the
good parts of this show? </joey>
<connor> What I can't understand is
how they take this concept </connor>
<garnt> of the main guy being an indocile. </garnt>
<garnt> That's what he is. Right. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just gonna keep saying it. </garnt>
<joey> I absolutely hate these
characters as well. </joey>
<connor> Because what what's up. </connor>
<joey> - [Director] Correction. </joey>
<joey> Technically the light novels
were like ReZero and like-- </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I was okay. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah. I was going to
correct him afterwards. </garnt>
<garnt> So it's not the first isekai, </garnt>
<connor> but it's one of the most prominent isekais </connor>
<connor> that popularized-- </connor>
<connor> - The genre. </connor>
<garnt> - A Lot of the genre. Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> Okay, so let's say this is
like one of the first big ones, </connor>
<garnt> if everyone is trying to take from this, </garnt>
<garnt> why do they take all the worst aspects? </garnt>
<garnt> Because Isekai to me
is like I said earlier, </garnt>
<garnt> it's just dudes who don't
have to ever address </garnt>
<garnt> the fact that they were
shitty in the life before </garnt>
<garnt> and they just get a free Doover </garnt>
<connor> where they get everything done for them. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. I mean it's weird seeing, </garnt>
<garnt> because it was weird
watching this after watching </garnt>
<garnt> so many Isekai that have
been inspired by this show, </garnt>
<garnt> because with most genres you
have like the progenitor, </garnt>
<garnt> the thing that popularized
a lot of the tropes, </garnt>
<garnt> and by the time you watch it-- </garnt>
<garnt> - It's a nice word, progenitor. </garnt>
<joey> - Progenitor. </joey>
<joey> - Doesn't even sound any real word. </joey>
<joey> - Would you pull that one out, Garnt? </joey>
<joey> - By the time you watch that one, </joey>
<joey> you've already seen all the tropes before. </joey>
<joey> So you're like, well,
this just feels dated now. </joey>
<joey> I don't get why everyone
hyped this thing up </joey>
<joey> in the first place, because
by the time you see it, </joey>
<joey> everyone's already done
all the tropes differently </joey>
<joey> and better. Right? </joey>
<joey> But with Mushoku Tensei,
it's like so many stories </joey>
<joey> just missed the point of why
the Isekai is the way it is. </joey>
<joey> why is it an Isekai in the first place? </joey>
<joey> Well, it's because he's
transported to another world </joey>
<joey> to give himself another
chance at life and people. </joey>
<joey> And a lot of stories took that as just, </joey>
<joey> oh, let's just put this
kind in a fancy world </joey>
<joey> and just disregard the fact
that he had a previous life, </joey>
<joey> that's just, there's so many subtle things </joey>
<joey> about Mushoku Tensei as a
story that I feel just got lost </joey>
<joey> over time. </joey>
<joey> In the different iterations
of isekai that came after. </joey>
<joey> That's not to say there's
not other isekai shows </joey>
<joey> that come after it. </joey>
<joey> That haven't been good.
But like, it seems like-- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. There are a dime dozen. </joey>
<connor> - Like the fact that he
had to, sorry, go George </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. It just seems like
so many stories just took </garnt>
<garnt> the surface level elements of this story </garnt>
<garnt> without really thinking about
why those elements were there </garnt>
<garnt> in the first place. </garnt>
<connor> - This is like, maybe Rezi
did this a little bit, </connor>
<connor> but not to the same extent, but like, </connor>
<connor> this is the only other
Isekai guy that I've watched. </connor>
<garnt> I'm sure there are
others that have done it </garnt>
<garnt> where he actually had to deal
with the trauma and fears </garnt>
<garnt> that he had in his past life
carried over into this one. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause like, let's say you
come into this new life. </garnt>
<garnt> And you were scared of snakes. </garnt>
<garnt> You're not gonna be magically,
not scared of snakes. </garnt>
<garnt> You've got the same brain. </garnt>
<garnt> He's still scared of going outside. </garnt>
<garnt> And I liked that they
had to deal with that. </garnt>
<garnt> Like I love that he had to
work through all of his issues. </garnt>
<garnt> Of course I wanted the plot
to go ahead and I wanted him </garnt>
<garnt> to become op and kill everything
and become the giga chat. </garnt>
<garnt> But I also wanted to see
him actually have to work </garnt>
<joey> through the shit. </joey>
<joey> - You wanted it to be
believable when it happens. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And it's so much better
payoff when you get to see that. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, absolutely. </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause like I was also at
the point when I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> when's the, I'm enjoying this, </garnt>
<garnt> but when's the plot gonna happen? </garnt>
<garnt> And then I've slowly come to realize that </garnt>
<garnt> whenever an episode is
labeled turning point, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just like pack like
put your seatbelts on boys </garnt>
<joey> because some shit is gonna go down. </joey>
<joey> And I've heard from
like light novel readers </joey>
<joey> that they're just like,
oh, just wait till you get </joey>
<joey> to turning point 4 or 5 or something. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, there's turning
point 5? What is going on? </joey>
<connor> Basically just a drift course. </connor>
<garnt> - It's like, I love shows that
are confident in their world. </garnt>
<garnt> And they don't need the
characters to be the world. </garnt>
<joey> It's they are so comfortable. </joey>
<joey> - The world lives independently
from the characters. </joey>
<joey> - It's like, we just happen to
be following some characters </joey>
<joey> in this world. That's interesting. </joey>
<garnt> We could follow any of the characters </garnt>
<connor> and you still have a great time. </connor>
<connor> I honestly I'll give
it like a 9/10 so far. </connor>
<garnt> - I feel like a proud father. </garnt>
<connor> - I love it. I love it. </connor>
<garnt> It's a good show. Honestly, it's so good. </garnt>
<garnt> Like if you're like me and
you're so done with isekai, </garnt>
<connor> I'd give this one a shot.
It is genuinely worth it. </connor>
<garnt> - When's this episode coming out? </garnt>
<connor> - [Director] This one? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Hold on. </connor>
<joey> - Probably the end of the month. Right? </joey>
<garnt> End of the month. </garnt>
<garnt> - End of the month. February. </garnt>
<joey> - [Director] I think
first week of February. </joey>
<garnt> - First week of February. </garnt>
<garnt> - Wow. What's up? </garnt>
<garnt> - The first week of February. Yes. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's why I give Mushoku
Tensei anime of the year. </garnt>
<garnt> (all laugh) </garnt>
<garnt> I just didn't wanna spoil that. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, I mean, I understand. </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like, I haven't watched odd taxi </garnt>
<garnt> or anything like that yet, </garnt>
<garnt> but I mean, I was watching
it and I'm like, God, </garnt>
<garnt> they're just doing everything right. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know. I can't
complain about anything. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, the only thing I
put it above that was "Arcane" </garnt>
<connor> as the best show of this year, </connor>
<connor> it's been zero days literally. </connor>
<garnt> - Okay. Okay. </garnt>
<connor> - "Arcane" movie is better. </connor>
<garnt> "Arcane" is pretty good though. </garnt>
<garnt> - Arcane is pretty damn good. </garnt>
<garnt> But yeah, I mean that's
yeah. I'm so fucking happy. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm I'm so happy that-- </garnt>
<joey> - It's like, when your
son finally starts getting </joey>
<garnt> an interests in sports
like football or like-- </garnt>
<garnt> - Is this what gratification feels like? </garnt>
<connor> - You're gappy. I like,
what if I came in there </connor>
<garnt> guns blazing and shit. Can't say-- </garnt>
<garnt> - I honestly thought you
wouldn't like it. 'Cause-- </garnt>
<connor> - Why do you think that? </connor>
<connor> - Because a lot of the
characters, like I said before, </connor>
<connor> they are well written characters, </connor>
<connor> but a lot of them are
like very trophy, very-- </connor>
<connor> - There are some, there are some. </connor>
<connor> - Very trophy, but I still think </connor>
<connor> they're well written characters, </connor>
<connor> but I just thought you'd look at that. </connor>
<connor> And you'd just be like, not a
fucking Cray with red hair-- </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, she was annoying.
Don't get me wrong. </garnt>
<garnt> She's was probably my
least favorite character. </garnt>
<garnt> Out of all the characters. </garnt>
<garnt> I felt like-- </garnt>
<garnt> - It is hard to look
past the trops sometimes. </garnt>
<connor> Didn't really like the main
character much. Actually. </connor>
<garnt> - I didn't really like him as well. </garnt>
<garnt> Well, I kind of liked. </garnt>
<connor> - But I understand why he's not, </connor>
<connor> I don't think his intention
was to make him likable </connor>
<garnt> from an audience perspective. </garnt>
<garnt> - I actually think who's the character, </garnt>
<connor> the character I liked the
most actually was the spur. </connor>
<connor> I love the spur, the green
name, the green head guy. </connor>
<garnt> - Ruijerd. </garnt>
<garnt> He was sick. </garnt>
<garnt> Like you said, I like the languages </garnt>
<garnt> that they actually spoke languages. </garnt>
<garnt> - I know. Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - That was cool. </garnt>
<garnt> That was really refreshing
for once where you're like, </garnt>
<joey> are they speaking a foreign language? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause they're always
just speaking Japanese. </joey>
<joey> - Finally. </joey>
<connor> - 'Cause I remember
when they were speaking, </connor>
<connor> I'm just like, when are they
gonna switch to Japanese? </connor>
<connor> It's just like world building, man. </connor>
<garnt> Its just make sure like
invest in this place. </garnt>
<garnt> And then it pays off when
he learns how to speak </garnt>
<connor> these languages. Like, oh my God. </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God, this is what
is like to learn a language. </connor>
<joey> Oh my God. Speak it in a reasonable bound. </joey>
<joey> - It's like the real world. </joey>
<garnt> - It's like the real world. </garnt>
<joey> Holy shit. Who would've
thought I have so much </joey>
<garnt> of an appreciation for that. </garnt>
<connor> Knowing what he went through
to learn that language. </connor>
<garnt> - This is one of those shows
where I'm actually glad </garnt>
<garnt> it's a light novel before
it's an anime or anything. </garnt>
<joey> 'Cause I think that it's
really gonna benefit </joey>
<joey> from being in like a long form written. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. So you can cash out the details. </joey>
<joey> - They can really get like the world set. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause sometimes when shows come this big, </joey>
<garnt> they kind of get to the point
where like, oh we gotta, </garnt>
<garnt> we gotta get the seasons out, come up. </garnt>
<garnt> It's the hot shit. Come on. </garnt>
<garnt> We gotta finish it. So I'm
hoping that doesn't happen. </garnt>
<connor> I hope the anime 'cause I'm not
gonna read the light levels. </connor>
<garnt> 'Cause the anime's so
good. And why would I? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. I mean like the anime's so good. </garnt>
<garnt> The production values were like insane. </garnt>
<garnt> Like some of the animation-- </garnt>
<connor> - Season 2, the jump
from season one to two </connor>
<garnt> was definitely noticeable. </garnt>
<garnt> I noticed that it got better. </garnt>
<connor> Like it looked a lot crisper. </connor>
<connor> - I mean it's just an all
around amazing production. </connor>
<garnt> - Watch sugar. </garnt>
<joey> - I'll definitely have to watch season 2. </joey>
<garnt> - I've been talking about it for ever. </garnt>
<joey> And I'm like, so happy right now. </joey>
<connor> I'm happy. I'm happy. </connor>
<garnt> You know what Connor?
Maybe I'll play Apex. </garnt>
<connor> - When are you gonna play Apex? </connor>
<connor> Maybe I'll play Wins or Apex dream corner. </connor>
<connor> - How many hours-- </connor>
<joey> - You are like that dad that's like, son, </joey>
<connor> - Well, how many. </connor>
<joey> - I'll do something you like this time? </joey>
<connor> - Count the exact run
time of Mushoku Tensei </connor>
<joey> that's how many hours you play actually, </joey>
<garnt> that seems fair. That seems fair. </garnt>
<garnt> - When this episode ends
I'll play Apex with you. </garnt>
<connor> - There we go. There we go. </connor>
<joey> There we go. Content. </joey>
<joey> - The Titan has fallen. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause I've got a
second channel now guys </joey>
<garnt> and we we've all got a second
channel that we upload to. </garnt>
<joey> The Garnt channel is gonna
turn to an Apex channel. </joey>
<joey> I uploaded every other day
on that channel in January. </joey>
<garnt> - Every other day. </garnt>
<garnt> - How did you have that much content? </garnt>
<connor> - Stream. </connor>
<garnt> - Stream. </garnt>
<garnt> - Backlog. I have a
backlog as well on there. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. 'Cause I took all of January off. </garnt>
<garnt> I didn't upload any videos
in January. Or maybe one. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know. 'Cause this is
before the end of January. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm just like, how are you saying this? </garnt>
<joey> When, when we we're right
in January now I have to-- </joey>
<garnt> - All my plans always go
correctly without any backfire. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, definitely. </garnt>
<garnt> This might be a enthusiasm
moment, but yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> So yeah, I took a month off
and it's pretty chill ready? </garnt>
<garnt> Weird waking up and not
thinking about YouTube videos. </garnt>
<garnt> Kinda just thinking like,
oh my stream leader. </garnt>
<joey> I might play some games, go gym. </joey>
<garnt> - Live a life. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. Live a fucking life. </garnt>
<garnt> Have a life for once. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, because I noticed
that you haven't, I mean, </garnt>
<garnt> you two haven't really thought
so much about your upload </garnt>
<connor> schedule, which you did before. </connor>
<connor> Is that really. </connor>
<garnt> - Just for this month? </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, your main channel was least. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - I just wanna take a month off
and get some stuff in order. </joey>
<garnt> I've got a bunch of
videos that really are big </garnt>
<garnt> that I need to finish. </garnt>
<garnt> And I know that if I'm
trying to do them weekly, </garnt>
<garnt> it'll be a mess. So I just wanna get them. </garnt>
<garnt> I've got like three big videos
in the works at the moment. </garnt>
<garnt> So I'm trying to get them all done. </garnt>
<garnt> And then hopefully February
will be a nice roll in, </garnt>
<garnt> probably gonna do a bunch
of more back to normal. </garnt>
<garnt> - Do you feel like after
you do the big projects </garnt>
<garnt> that you're just gonna
go back to your normal </garnt>
<garnt> upload schedule or are
you gonna focus more </garnt>
<garnt> on streaming now? </garnt>
<connor> - Maybe I'll miss a week here
and there not feel too guilty </connor>
<garnt> about it. I'm probably
try and do three a month. </garnt>
<garnt> I think that'll be my soft target. </garnt>
<garnt> - Three a month. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. I'll probably try and
do once a week, but we'll see. </connor>
<garnt> - That's just above my
upload schedule actually. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, I feel like if I miss
a week, it's not a big deal. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like now right on my phone, I check, </garnt>
<garnt> I check the other day. 'Cause I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> I haven't uploaded in
like two and a half weeks. </garnt>
<garnt> I wonder if anyone's saying anything? </garnt>
<garnt> No, no, no one's commented anything. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, of course not. </garnt>
<connor> - So clearly nobody
misses that'd be right. </connor>
<garnt> - That's exactly what I
realized when I realized, oh, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't have to do an anime
of year video on the new year. </garnt>
<garnt> And I could just wait a few
weeks and people were just like, </garnt>
<garnt> great. I'll still watch your content. </garnt>
<joey> - Who would've thought
that the only ones who care </joey>
<joey> about our timetable is us. </joey>
<joey> And no one else. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, I feel like when you do weekly, </joey>
<connor> it just posture a bit
more. You do do good. </connor>
<joey> - Of course, but you also, I
feel it also limits yourself </joey>
<joey> to what you could actually be doing. </joey>
<joey> So which is why like this year for me, </joey>
<joey> I'm definitely gonna like slow
it down and just like really </joey>
<joey> focus on like making each
video as big as possible. </joey>
<joey> And then for everything
else, I got Trash Taste </joey>
<joey> and like my second channel
and stuff like that. </joey>
<garnt> - It's whatever. </garnt>
<garnt> So what is the main channel anymore? </garnt>
<joey> When Trash Taste is-- </joey>
<joey> - This is the main channel now . </joey>
<joey> - That be real, this is
the main channel now. </joey>
<joey> - This is where the big ideas are going. </joey>
<joey> - This is where it's all going. </joey>
<joey> - We're doing more specials this year. </joey>
<joey> We're gonna stream every week. </joey>
<joey> You heard here first. </joey>
<joey> - Well this February. </joey>
<joey> - I hope this doesn't
become Poliage thing. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. I read every
I'm saying it publicly. </joey>
<joey> - Obviously there will be breaks. </joey>
<joey> - Of course. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> But yeah, I think, I think
for all of us, like our, </joey>
<garnt> for this year, definitely Trash Taste </garnt>
<garnt> is slowly be coming
more over the priority. </garnt>
<garnt> I think when it comes to
just like making cool shit. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. 'Cause we enjoy
it, 'cause we enjoy it. </garnt>
<joey> And who knew that just having
a job of your best mates </joey>
<garnt> is fun. </garnt>
<garnt> - Pretty chill. </garnt>
<connor> - God forbid. </connor>
<connor> - Have a carry every week. That's life. </connor>
<garnt> - Speaking of watching anime, </garnt>
<garnt> I know a bunch of people who
have also been watching anime </garnt>
<garnt> very publicly. It's
probably very old news. </garnt>
<garnt> By the time this episode gets released. </garnt>
<connor> - It was the dumbest shit of 2022 so far. </connor>
<garnt> - 2022 has just begun.
We're already taking an L. </garnt>
<garnt> - But yeah, basically at
the time of recording, </garnt>
<garnt> Pokemon has been banned
for watching Avatar, </garnt>
<garnt> The Last Air Bender </garnt>
<garnt> and also Disguised Toast
has also been banned </garnt>
<garnt> for watching Death Notes. </garnt>
<garnt> I believe on their twist streams. </garnt>
<garnt> To their tens of thousands of viewers. </garnt>
<garnt> And by the time this gets released, </garnt>
<garnt> maybe more people will
be banned. Maybe not. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know. But it's
definitely sparked a discussion </garnt>
<garnt> about copyright and DMCA. </garnt>
<joey> - I think people online
are calling it the TV meta, </joey>
<joey> which I couldn't fucking
believe was a real thing. </joey>
<joey> Polygon wrote this
article that was like, oh, </joey>
<joey> this guy starts, he was just
testing out the TV meta. </joey>
<joey> And I think my favorite comment, I saw, </joey>
<joey> I wanna quote retweet </joey>
<joey> It was, "Calling it the TV
meta is like shooting yourself </joey>
<joey> "in the head and calling it the gun meta." </joey>
<joey> - Lime wire wasn't Paris. </joey>
<joey> It was just engaging in the music meta. </joey>
<garnt> - The TV meta strand is piratey. </garnt>
<joey> - Pirating doesn't do that. </joey>
<garnt> So dumb, it's so dumb. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's the dumbest argument. </garnt>
<joey> - It's crazy. Like watching
stuff like the Totally Not Mark, </joey>
<joey> With like torrent. </joey>
<joey> Just like nuking his channel. </joey>
<connor> For like talking about one piece. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. For not even breaking DMCA. </joey>
<connor> - And then the Twitch
streams just go and watch </connor>
<connor> the entirety of Hunter Hunter. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. Because I remember
like when I first heard </garnt>
<garnt> about this, I thought it was, </garnt>
<garnt> I thought it was actually
just like a joke. </garnt>
<garnt> I thought it as like a parody article, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just like, where's the onion article? </garnt>
<garnt> And then I log onto Twitch. </garnt>
<garnt> And then I see one of
like the biggest streamers </garnt>
<joey> on the, I'm just gonna, I saw
XQC streaming Hunter Hunter, </joey>
<joey> like in it like a hundred thousand people. </joey>
<joey> And I'm just like, I was
watching ,cause I was like, </joey>
<joey> is there a meme? </joey>
<joey> Like where's the meme come?
And then I, you realize, </joey>
<joey> oh they weren't joking. People
are actually doing this. </joey>
<joey> And then Connor informed me that Ludwig </joey>
<joey> had already made a video about it. </joey>
<joey> And I think what bothered
me was that people </joey>
<joey> were calling them out for
calling other people out </joey>
<joey> for being like, yeah. why
are you knocking on people </joey>
<garnt> or something like that? </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> imagine you are like
broadcasting a football match </garnt>
<garnt> in a football stadium that you don't own </garnt>
<garnt> because that's what the
equivalent of it is. Right. </garnt>
<connor> They're broadcasting this
to like 90,000 people. </connor>
<connor> And one guy like, "Is that allowed?" </connor>
<connor> And people are just actually
like, sh don't tell people </connor>
<connor> and it's just like, are you kidding me? </connor>
<garnt> There's 90,000 people
watching this right now. </garnt>
<garnt> How could you snitch on someone
when there's 90,000 people </garnt>
<garnt> watching this one thing. </garnt>
<connor> - It's so dumb. </connor>
<joey> And the fact that they're trying to argue </joey>
<joey> it's fair use or anything.
It's just so stupid. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, the fair argument's ridiculous. </joey>
<joey> - I understand. Right. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause a lot of the
viewers who watching this </joey>
<joey> probably enjoyed it. </joey>
<garnt> They probably loved watching
SQC watch "Hunt Hunter". </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, of course. </joey>
<joey> - I'm sure everyone would
love to watch us watch "Jojo". </joey>
<joey> Unfortunately, we can't do that. </joey>
<connor> 'Cause one we're not fucking
dumb. We don't watch shit. </connor>
<joey> - We'll literally be breaking the law. </joey>
<connor> - I did a watch along of Jojo on my stream </connor>
<garnt> the previous season, </garnt>
<garnt> but I didn't show the
visuals. I didn't show audio. </garnt>
<garnt> I show a time stamp. </garnt>
<garnt> You can go to your Netflix
and we can watch along. </garnt>
<garnt> It's not as good. Of course it sucks. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause you can't see it. </garnt>
<joey> But it's against the law to do that. </joey>
<joey> And also we live in Japan. </joey>
<joey> We probably actually be
thrown in jail if we did that. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. Oh yeah. No you will. You will. </joey>
<joey> - It's just like, what annoyed me the most </joey>
<joey> about it was again, </joey>
<garnt> like it was people trying to be like, </garnt>
<garnt> it was very like tribal in a
sense where they were like, </garnt>
<garnt> you can't say my stream
is bad for doing it. </garnt>
<garnt> They were just watching
doesn't do any harm. </garnt>
<garnt> So what if they get banned?
It's like, yeah. But yeah, </garnt>
<garnt> because that streamer already
makes like 5 million a year. </garnt>
<garnt> Of course they don't give
a fuck if they get banned. </garnt>
<garnt> But like what about the guy, </garnt>
<garnt> there's other smaller
streamers who maybe enjoy </garnt>
<joey> the freedom to the
current copyright system </joey>
<joey> where they can kind of, tow
the line a little bit safer. </joey>
<joey> Not watching stuff, but
maybe I can show YouTube, </joey>
<joey> - Maybe a clip. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> Remember you couldn't watch
YouTube on Twitter before. </joey>
<garnt> You can now, even then
that's controversial. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah. But I just feel like
it's selfish of like the bigger </garnt>
<joey> creators who already are well established, </joey>
<joey> don't have to worry about or anything-- </joey>
<joey> - And they can get away with it as well. </joey>
<garnt> - They'll come back, they'll get banned, </garnt>
<connor> they'll come back. They don't give a shit. </connor>
<joey> - If anything, them getting banned, </joey>
<joey> its just more publicity to them. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. Because that's why, right. </joey>
<connor> It's like you can get banned
and you're a headlined </connor>
<connor> and people are like, oh
my God, you're banned, </connor>
<joey> how that's so crazy. </joey>
<connor> We'll come back and like
you'll get even more views </connor>
<connor> and you come back. It's like,
it's just, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> It just seems selfish to me. </connor>
<garnt> - It is. </garnt>
<garnt> - And the fact that everyone's
trying to call it a meta </garnt>
<garnt> and play a joke with it and
stuff is really frustrating </garnt>
<garnt> when, we work in Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> We talk a lot with the anime companies </garnt>
<garnt> and try and work with them
and try and convince them </garnt>
<connor> that YouTubers and
stuff aren't psychopaths </connor>
<garnt> and can be trusted. </garnt>
<connor> - I think that's what
bothered me the most. </connor>
<connor> Which is like, as someone
who does make content </connor>
<connor> that really does require fair
use and a strong argument </connor>
<connor> for fair use even I think </connor>
<garnt> like sometimes I'm still like
touting the line sometimes </garnt>
<garnt> with how companies view my content. </garnt>
<garnt> Because it's such a new concept
that it's going to take time </garnt>
<garnt> to like convince big companies that, </garnt>
<garnt> Hey, please don't strike my stuff </garnt>
<garnt> because it is under fair use. </garnt>
<garnt> And when you have like like this, </garnt>
<garnt> and then on the other end of the spectrum, </garnt>
<garnt> you have people just
broadcasting, licensed TV shows, </garnt>
<garnt> movies, anime, whatever. </garnt>
<garnt> It's just, what's going to happen is that </garnt>
<garnt> it's just going to make it harder </garnt>
<garnt> for the 60, 70 year old
guy looking at new content </garnt>
<garnt> to be like, well I guess
everyone's just broadcasting </garnt>
<garnt> my shit. Right. </garnt>
<garnt> Well I guess I should
strike down everyone. </garnt>
<garnt> What it's the thing that's
gonna happen is that it's gonna </garnt>
<garnt> make it hard for big corporations
to tell the difference </garnt>
<garnt> between what is fair use and what isn't. </garnt>
<joey> Because when there is people
who are abusing the system, </joey>
<joey> because this is an abuse of the system, </joey>
<joey> then it's just gonna be harder
for the guy who is actually </joey>
<joey> trying to stay within the system to prove </joey>
<garnt> that he's actually
staying within the system. </garnt>
<joey> - I feel there's just
so many like YouTubers </joey>
<joey> and Twist streams, just
content creators who are like </joey>
<garnt> doing our best to like at
least try and like yeah, </garnt>
<garnt> as you were saying, like show
the Japanese corporations </garnt>
<garnt> being like, hey, fair use is a thing. </garnt>
<garnt> We're not using your stuff all the time </garnt>
<garnt> for malicious intent. We do it
because we genuinely love it. </garnt>
<joey> We want people to know about it. </joey>
<joey> But we will follow the
rules that are laid out </joey>
<joey> as much as we can. But at the same time, </joey>
<joey> I scratch your back, </joey>
<joey> you scratch mine. like kind
of like forgive me sometimes. </joey>
<joey> But now with this whole TV meta, </joey>
<garnt> if I feel all that effort
has just gone back to zero. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. Especially on Twitch. </connor>
<joey> - If it works, if speculating of course. </joey>
<connor> But like obviously like
it could really damage. </connor>
<connor> - It's a matter of time. </connor>
<garnt> I mean the music industry did
it with Twitch, eventually. </garnt>
<garnt> They were like, oh, shit yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> You shouldn't be shoot or
streaming music. It's not good. </garnt>
<garnt> And people are like, whatever,
testing out the music matter. </garnt>
<garnt> Because the other thing that bothered me </garnt>
<garnt> is that you can't really feign ignorance </garnt>
<garnt> because there is a precedence for this. </garnt>
<garnt> YouTubers have felt it for years </garnt>
<garnt> with their copyright system,
even Twitch streamers. </garnt>
<garnt> And I know a lot of Twitch
streamers complained a lot </garnt>
<garnt> when they had the DMCA
controversy with the music thing </garnt>
<connor> that happened. </connor>
<garnt> Where basically every piece
of music just got claimed </garnt>
<connor> and you couldn't even play some games </connor>
<connor> because some of the music was copyrighted. </connor>
<connor> - Which was bound to happen anyway. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. Which was bound to happen. </garnt>
<garnt> YouTube have been dealing
with that for years. </garnt>
<garnt> It's very entitled. And
the that's what it is. </garnt>
<garnt> It is entitlement. </garnt>
<garnt> A lot of the streamers
that were doing this, </garnt>
<garnt> just like, don't give a fuck. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause why would they? They don't mind. </garnt>
<garnt> They get the headlines,
they get the views. </garnt>
<garnt> They already got paid. </garnt>
<connor> They already have these
contracts with these companies. </connor>
<joey> - And they know they'll come back. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. They know they'll come back. </garnt>
<joey> 'Cause they get special
treatment. - Exactly. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. And then you have
like people on the other side </joey>
<garnt> of the fence, people like
totally not mark, who like, </garnt>
<joey> if you don't know a story
behind what happened </joey>
<joey> with Totally Not Mark, I
believe like TOE striked, </joey>
<joey> hundreds of his videos at once. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, 150. </joey>
<joey> - Over like 150 videos at once. </joey>
<joey> Some of them not even, even like having </joey>
<garnt> any copyrighted material on there. </garnt>
<garnt> Some of them were just like,
I believe his face or like </garnt>
<joey> - Some of them were drawings
of dragon ball characters </joey>
<garnt> that he drew. </garnt>
<garnt> - And so his channel
basically got completely, </garnt>
<garnt> like so many of these videos
got completely wiped away </garnt>
<garnt> and he was like fighting tooth and nail </garnt>
<garnt> to like try to get into
contact with Toe, to be like, </garnt>
<garnt> please Toe, bring my videos
out of copyright jail, please. </garnt>
<garnt> This is fair use. </garnt>
<garnt> And I believe that even
now it's not been sorted. </garnt>
<garnt> I believe now he is-- </garnt>
<joey> - He basically just like gave up. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I believe he just gave up. </garnt>
<garnt> - Which is so hard brain. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I think like a third of
his channel just disappeared. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> And that's like-- </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like, could you imagine that </garnt>
<joey> it's just like years of work just gone. </joey>
<garnt> - And that, to me, it's
just like, well it's like, </garnt>
<garnt> there's this guy fighting
tooth and now to try and prove </garnt>
<joey> that his videos are fair use
and his videos do deserve </joey>
<joey> to be in the platform. </joey>
<joey> - And they are fair use. </joey>
<joey> - To like a company that
doesn't know the difference </joey>
<joey> between fair use and not. </joey>
<joey> And then on the other
side of the spectrum, </joey>
<joey> you have other people who are
abusing the system to be like, </joey>
<joey> well, whatever the ban ham is coming down. </joey>
<joey> I can take like a two day
vacation, a month vacation, </joey>
<joey> whatever. </joey>
<joey> And the people who feel the repercussions </joey>
<joey> are the people who are like on
the load end of the tier list </joey>
<joey> with, let me rephrase that. </joey>
<joey> - Lower end of the spectrum. </joey>
<joey> - Lower end of the spectrum
of Twitch streamers. </joey>
<garnt> The smaller content creators. </garnt>
<garnt> That's the word I was looking for, </garnt>
<garnt> the smaller content
creators, the smaller boys. </garnt>
<garnt> - A lot of these, the
bigger content creators, </garnt>
<garnt> I think highly often it just
kind of sad seeing them do this </garnt>
<garnt> and like some of them just not
caring. And I was just like, </garnt>
<garnt> this is just sad. </garnt>
<joey> I also just think you
should be a good example. </joey>
<joey> Like why don't just like make stuff? </joey>
<connor> I don't know. Like-- </connor>
<joey> - Because what's gonna happen
is the big streamers do it. </joey>
<joey> Then everyone goes, oh, if
the big streamer doing it, </joey>
<joey> I can do it too. </joey>
<joey> But of course they don't
realize those big streamers </joey>
<joey> if they get in trouble
or they'll get as a slap </joey>
<joey> on the wrist, </joey>
<joey> if the smaller creator does it, </joey>
<joey> they're probably perma banned. </joey>
<garnt> - 'Cause I'm just like
to preface this, I don't, </garnt>
<garnt> this isn't like us trying to start drama </garnt>
<connor> with any of the content
creators that did this </connor>
<connor> because a lot of the content
creators, I actually respect </connor>
<connor> as content creators. </connor>
<connor> It was like Connor said, </connor>
<garnt> I was just a bit disappointed
that they didn't set </garnt>
<garnt> a better example because I know </garnt>
<garnt> that we are all content creators. </garnt>
<garnt> We know what's going on here. </garnt>
<garnt> We know what the
repercussions are going to be, </garnt>
<garnt> that what they could
be. So it's just like, </garnt>
<garnt> I couldn't understand why they
were poking the Hornets nest, </garnt>
<garnt> I guess. </garnt>
<connor> - Some of them were doing it intentionally </connor>
<garnt> trying to get banned as well. </garnt>
<garnt> Some of them admitted that,
that they wanted to be banned. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause it's good for headlines as well. </garnt>
<joey> If you're a bigger name
and you have more websites, </joey>
<joey> cause they're websites,
they're just dedicated </joey>
<joey> to literally just talking
about Twitch streamers. </joey>
<garnt> And then post these articles,
they get them recommend to me </garnt>
<garnt> all the time on Google. </garnt>
<garnt> Just like, "You won't
believe what Ludwig said." </garnt>
<garnt> and it'll be like, Ludwig's
like, "I like jumping." </garnt>
<connor> I hate these articles. They're so shit. </connor>
<garnt> - Welcome to journalism. </garnt>
<joey> - It's a little thing called
independent journalism. </joey>
<joey> - But it's like how have you
then at least take a click bait </joey>
<joey> and not even made it somewhat interesting </joey>
<connor> that's even more boring. </connor>
<garnt> - Now, because, I think what
the other thing that made me </garnt>
<garnt> lose brain cells when I was
like scrolling on my Twitter </garnt>
<garnt> to see what the reaction was, </garnt>
<garnt> was the amount of people
who were calling out people </garnt>
<garnt> who were like, basically saying, </garnt>
<garnt> "Hey, maybe you shouldn't
stream or broadcast anime movies </garnt>
<garnt> "to like your audience, whatever." </garnt>
<garnt> And anyone who said that was
basically basically caught </garnt>
<garnt> out to being like for being
like a corporate boot licker </garnt>
<garnt> or something like that. </garnt>
<joey> Or just like, why are you
defending the corporations? </joey>
<joey> And it's just like it turned the argument </joey>
<joey> into something completely different </joey>
<joey> because we all know DMCA
is like a decade old law </joey>
<garnt> that is outdated for
how the internet works. </garnt>
<garnt> We're concentrators. </garnt>
<garnt> We know that there are so
many things that are broken </garnt>
<garnt> about the DMCA system. We know that, </garnt>
<garnt> but that's a separate issue
to what is going on here. </garnt>
<garnt> A system can be broken and
people can also abuse the system </garnt>
<connor> at the same time. </connor>
<garnt> They don't have to be mutually. </garnt>
<connor> They don't have to be the same thing. </connor>
<garnt> They can be mutually exclusive. </garnt>
<garnt> And just seeing people try to defend this, </garnt>
<garnt> just like kind of just
made me lose brain cells. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was weird. It was really weird </garnt>
<garnt> seeing how open everyone was like, yeah, </garnt>
<garnt> no, of course it's okay. </garnt>
<connor> And I'm like, yeah, just 'cause you like, </connor>
<connor> it doesn't mean it's okay. </connor>
<joey> - And just because you can't
be bold to go to Google </joey>
<joey> and look it up yourself. It's like. </joey>
<connor> - Like obviously it would
be sick to watch anime </connor>
<joey> with 90,000 people live. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, it would be sick. </joey>
<joey> - I would love to do that. </joey>
<connor> - We can't, we're not allowed. </connor>
<joey> - Until I get up these like IP holders, </joey>
<garnt> understand that it's okay. </garnt>
<garnt> And we're not saying this
shouldn't be the case. </garnt>
<garnt> You know what I would say that </garnt>
<garnt> if a company wants to be five heads, </garnt>
<garnt> they would allow people, they
would allow people to stream </garnt>
<garnt> all that old forgotten shows
and bring it to a new audience. </garnt>
<garnt> I think that would be a five head move. </garnt>
<garnt> But until people allow
it, it's still illegal. </garnt>
<garnt> You're still putting risk
on, in an entire platform </garnt>
<garnt> that you're gonna put the clamp down </garnt>
<garnt> for all the content
creators on that platform. </garnt>
<connor> - It's like that Japanese
YouTuber who got to react </connor>
<joey> to all of attack on Titan
and like got promotion. </joey>
<connor> - He like uploaded all of him-- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. He had this deal
with Attack on Titan IP. </connor>
<garnt> - It's crazy. How did he get that? </garnt>
<connor> - And he was just like, oh yeah. </connor>
<garnt> So you got a second channel.
It's got like a million subs. </garnt>
<garnt> Just put all of Attack on
Titan on it. You're allowed. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. With him reacting. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. I saw that. </connor>
<joey> - Was him reacting to it.
And it was completely legal. </joey>
<joey> - What's crazy to me is
that like the whole entire </joey>
<joey> YouTube community, </joey>
<garnt> everyone on everyone online
hated reaction channels. </garnt>
<garnt> They came down so hard
on them in like 2015, 16. </garnt>
<garnt> And then like, why is it different now? </garnt>
<connor> I don't understand. </connor>
<connor> - Now. Everyone's-- </connor>
<connor> - What happened, is it 'cause it's live? </connor>
<connor> Is that the only difference?
Like I don't understand. </connor>
<garnt> - The Twitch matter. The TV
matter, the react matter. </garnt>
<joey> - The react matter. </joey>
<garnt> - I guess what we've
learned is that it's bad. </garnt>
<joey> It's a bad thing to do. </joey>
<joey> Unless your favorite
content creator is doing it, </joey>
<joey> then it's not. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<connor> - All right. That's a
good message to end it on. </connor>
<connor> - That's a good message. </connor>
<garnt> - I just want to go
throughout like all of history </garnt>
<garnt> and just start calling like
the most despicable acts </garnt>
<garnt> of human history. Just like a matter. </garnt>
<connor> - I do the after Joe. </connor>
<joey> - All right. Well, if you guys, hey, </joey>
<connor> you guys wanna join the patron
medal? Look at these patrons. </connor>
<connor> - The 50 patron matter. </connor>
<connor> - They're limit testing the
Paton meta right now, guys, </connor>
<connor> if you wanna join them, </connor>
<connor> then maybe go to our patron
page on patreon.com/trashtaste </connor>
<connor> also falls on Twitter. </connor>
<connor> Send us a email in the Sub with
it and if you hate our face, </connor>
<connor> listen to us on Spotify. </connor>
<connor> But yeah, God. </connor>
<joey> TV meta is now my least
favorite phrase of 2022. </joey>
<connor> - NFT, TV. Meta, what
about the NFT TV meta? </connor>
<joey> - What about the NFT meta? </joey>
<garnt> - We're just going through
the blockchain meta right now. </garnt>
<garnt> - Ah. Gross. </garnt>
<garnt> - Anyway, you've been
watching Trash Taste. </garnt>
<garnt> This has been the Trash Taste meta. </garnt>
<garnt> - Join the patreon meta,
that's the new meta. </garnt>
<joey> - The patreon meta.
That's the only good meta. </joey>

<garnt> (upbeat music) </garnt>
