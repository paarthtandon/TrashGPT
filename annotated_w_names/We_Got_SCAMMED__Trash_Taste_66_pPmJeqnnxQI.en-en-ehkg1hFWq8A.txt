<joey> - Smell my jeans, Garnt, smell my jeans. </joey>
<joey> - Get that shit out of my face, man. </joey>
<joey> - That's like musky shit. - That's dripping </joey>
<joey> with your fucking sweat, Connor, is that what you're </joey>
<garnt> talking about when you mean drip? </garnt>
<joey> - God, you don't know how many people would pay </joey>
<joey> for that experience. - Smell my jeans, bro. </joey>
<joey> - Smell Connor's jeans. - Give a sniff. </joey>
<joey> - Get that shit out of my face, man. </joey>
<joey> - Smell his jeans. (upbeat music) </joey>
<joey> - Hey guys, welcome to another episode </joey>
<joey> of Trash Taste podcast, </joey>
<joey> I'm your boy, I'm not your boy. </joey>
<joey> I am the boy with the boys. (laughter) </joey>
<connor> - Fucking stumbled through that, didn't you? </connor>
<joey> - Is that the worst intro you've ever done? </joey>
<garnt> - No, no, my all my intros are the worst one. </garnt>
<joey> - I could feel, I could feel like your mind, </joey>
<garnt> just like starting up as you're saying that sentence. </garnt>
<joey> It was just like... - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> I'm like, you know, those really old lawn mowers </garnt>
<garnt> your dad has, where you have to do </garnt>
<connor> (revving) </connor>
<connor> like five times until it finally gets started. </connor>
<joey> That's my brain right now. </joey>
<joey> - So how are you guy's week's been? </joey>
<garnt> - I just had an absolutely fucking ordeal this morning. </garnt>
<garnt> - What? (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, so, okay, </garnt>
<connor> so this is like fucking what now? </connor>
<connor> Like volume eight of Gaijin versus Japanese Bank, right? </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> I think we're, I think we're like at that volume now. </connor>
<connor> - Thriller and Manilla, Gaijin versus bank. </connor>
<connor> - "The bank strikes back" </connor>
<connor> And I mean, like, to me, like, now, </connor>
<connor> like, going to a Japanese bank </connor>
<connor> is kind of like going to the dentist now </connor>
<connor> 'cause like I do anything I can </connor>
<connor> to put it off, right? - I like my dentist actually. </connor>
<garnt> - Really? - Yeah, I really, </garnt>
<joey> it's been great here, the bank's way, far worse. </joey>
<joey> I would rather have like an anal rectal cavity, </joey>
<garnt> whatever that is, opposed to going to the bank. </garnt>
<garnt> - An anal rectal cavity at the dentist? </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - At the dentist, I would rather her use </garnt>
<joey> that drill on my ass. - Let me see your teeth. </joey>
<connor> - I would rather her do anything experimental. </connor>
<connor> - Honestly, honestly, I agree because like, </connor>
<joey> I've been putting off going to the bank for ages, right? </joey>
<joey> Because I've needed to send money abroad to back home. </joey>
<joey> - Okay. - Because right now, </joey>
<connor> I'm helping my parents pay for the mortgage of their house </connor>
<connor> so they can retire and have a nice comfy life. </connor>
<connor> - Good Asian son right there. - Flexing right there. </connor>
<connor> - Just being a good Asian son. </connor>
<connor> As you do, so, I mean, I've been doing this </connor>
<connor> for like basically since I started YouTube </connor>
<connor> but since I moved to Japan, obviously a lot, </connor>
<joey> most of my money is now in my Japanese bank account </joey>
<joey> and I've known for a while </joey>
<joey> that I've needed, that I was going to need </joey>
<joey> to transfer money into my British bank account. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Of course, of course. </joey>
<joey> - I was just dreading this, right, as you do. </joey>
<joey> As you do with any Japanese bank experience. </joey>
<connor> What I didn't realize was that I was going to have </connor>
<connor> like the biggest ordeal I've had yet in the Japanese bank. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, God. - So I mean like, </connor>
<connor> so I'm just like, okay, I booked the appointment </connor>
<connor> because you can, you can't do anything online, </connor>
<connor> as we've said, on call. </connor>
<connor> - God forbid you can be you </connor>
<connor> in the 21st century. - [Joey] Yeah, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, so I turn up as usual and normally </connor>
<connor> when we turn up to the bank, they normally have one guy </connor>
<connor> who works there that acts as an interpreter </connor>
<connor> because he speaks English and Japanese, right? </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Right, right. </connor>
<garnt> - So he wasn't there today. </garnt>
<garnt> So... - So they just let you </garnt>
<connor> do the appointment, did they know? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, they knew it was me, they knew. </garnt>
<garnt> So you know the guy, you normally- </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, they weren't gonna be like, uh, Garnt. </joey>
<garnt> Yeah, that sounds Japanese (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - So, so it was the same woman </garnt>
<garnt> that handles our accounts. </garnt>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> - But the interpreter, the guy who speaks English, </joey>
<joey> wasn't there this time. - [Joey] Okay. </joey>
<joey> - So I'm just like, "Okay, this is gonna, </joey>
<garnt> this is gonna like, this is gonna put my </garnt>
<garnt> (speaks Japanese) to the test, right? </garnt>
<garnt> This is gonna, this is going to stretch it </garnt>
<joey> to the fucking limits, right?" because, because I mean, </joey>
<joey> thankfully I have been, you know, </joey>
<joey> practicing as much as I can. - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Especially my listening skills. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. - But this is gonna, </joey>
<joey> this was going to stretch it to the limit, so- </joey>
<joey> - Like bank hard mode. - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </connor>
<connor> This was bank like fucking </connor>
<garnt> Doom impossible mode or whatever. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </garnt>
<garnt> So, we start the process and we take it, </garnt>
<garnt> we take inventory </garnt>
<garnt> and I bring all my usual stuff, right? </garnt>
<garnt> I've got my hunker, </garnt>
<garnt> got my bank book, </garnt>
<garnt> got my bank card, </garnt>
<joey> got everything. - Fully prepped. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, fully prepped. - [Joey] All right. </joey>
<joey> - I'm like, I'm experienced. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I'm a fucking Japanese bank war veteran. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> I know what the fuck I need to do </joey>
<joey> at Japanese banks, right? </joey>
<joey> So I'm just like- </joey>
<joey> - I know what happens in the battlefield. </joey>
<joey> - So I'm like, great. </joey>
<joey> So we start the process, I'm like, </joey>
<joey> "Can I transfer money </joey>
<joey> to my British bank account please? </joey>
<joey> Or transfer money overseas?" </joey>
<joey> and then she starts explaining </joey>
<joey> to me the process and I'm like, </joey>
<joey> "Fucking hell, okay, like, I understand, </joey>
<joey> like, 70% of what you're saying" </joey>
<joey> So I'm like, I'm like, great, </joey>
<joey> I'm following what she's saying, </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "You know what? maybe, maybe, </joey>
<joey> maybe this, maybe this will be a smooth process" </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So I put in my name, </joey>
<joey> put in my address </joey>
<joey> and everything I need to do </joey>
<joey> and then we get to the actual transfer </joey>
<joey> part of it, </joey>
<joey> the actual transferring </joey>
<joey> money to an overseas bank. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And so she asks me </joey>
<joey> about the bank and I say, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, it's a British bank. It's Barclays, </joey>
<joey> it's my account" </joey>
<joey> And then she says, </joey>
<joey> and here's where, </joey>
<joey> here's where my Japanese got tested. </joey>
<joey> She said something, right? </joey>
<joey> And I heard, </joey>
<joey> I heard "transfer" and I heard "purpose" </joey>
<joey> and I heard "connection" right? </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Okay. - So in my mind- </joey>
<connor> - Stitch it all together. </connor>
<connor> - No, no, no 'cause this- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, that's how you do it. </connor>
<joey> - 'Cause that's just how you do it. </joey>
<joey> So I heard those words, so I stitched the meaning </joey>
<joey> of the words to be </joey>
<connor> "what was the purpose of the transfer?" </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Right, right, right. </connor>
<connor> - Right? 'Cause that's- </connor>
<connor> - Naturally. </connor>
<connor> - That's naturally what I assume. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So I was like, oh great, the purpose of my transfer. </connor>
<connor> - "My friend in Nigeria. </connor>
<connor> A prince actually." - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So I tried to explain in the most broken Japanese I can, </connor>
<joey> the purpose of my transfer is just to transfer money </joey>
<joey> to myself in England. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I was like, British bank account </joey>
<joey> in England, my British bank account in England, </joey>
<joey> transferring money to that. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And she was like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no </joey>
<joey> and re-explains and she re-explains it </joey>
<connor> and now I'm just like, okay, so how do I explain to her </connor>
<connor> that I'm going to be paying a mortgage for my parents </connor>
<connor> in England and I'm just like, fucking hell. </connor>
<connor> This is- - I struggle </connor>
<garnt> to spell mortgage in English, I guess. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm just like, I'm just like- </garnt>
<joey> - I was like, wait, mortgage has a T in it? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. (laughter) </garnt>
<garnt> - And I'm just like, (speaking Japanese). </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - And I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> that's the most I can come up with. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Which is basically- </connor>
<connor> - Better than I would have done, honestly. </connor>
<connor> - Which is basically, for the purposes </connor>
<joey> of my parents, I'm paying for- </joey>
<joey> - Paying for their house. - Paying for their house. </joey>
<joey> Right? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And she was like, no, no, no, no, no </joey>
<connor> and then we just like try to brokenly communicate </connor>
<connor> to each other and then she just, </connor>
<connor> and then she whips out the Google translate </connor>
<connor> and I'm just like- - Yeah, I was about to say, </connor>
<connor> why don't you whip this out? - And I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> okay, here we go, here we go. - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And then she Google translates it </connor>
<connor> and she's just like, and the translation is, </connor>
<garnt> "Do you have any evidence </garnt>
<garnt> that you have a connection </garnt>
<garnt> to the purpose, to the person you're transferring to </garnt>
<garnt> for the purpose of this transfer?" </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "What? It's-- </garnt>
<joey> It's me!" </joey>
<joey> - "It's literally me" - "It's literally... </joey>
<joey> (group laughs) </joey>
<connor> "It's me! are we, like, </connor>
<connor> is this a fucking circus we're running here? </connor>
<connor> Like, what's, what's going on? </connor>
<connor> Like how can I prove </connor>
<garnt> that I have a connection to myself?" </garnt>
<joey> Right? - It's like, </joey>
<joey> if I were you, I would have been like, </joey>
<joey> "So, how many fucking Garnt Mayatapos </joey>
<connor> do you know in the world?" </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. - Tell me. </joey>
<joey> - This is the thing </joey>
<joey> that I was dreading about Japan, </joey>
<connor> is that nothing's ever good enough. </connor>
<joey> - No, no. - It's like, no. </joey>
<connor> I want to see a passport of other you. </connor>
<connor> - Yes, because, because to a Japanese person, </connor>
<connor> sending money to yourself overseas, </connor>
<garnt> it's just a concept that they don't understand. </garnt>
<joey> It's like, "Why?" </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> So the first thing I say was like, </garnt>
<joey> "Oh, I mean, my names are identical </joey>
<joey> isn't that enough proof?" </joey>
<joey> And she was like, "No, no, no. </joey>
<joey> It's because in Japanese bank, your first name comes second </joey>
<joey> and your surname comes first, </joey>
<joey> so it's Manitapo Garnt" </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And then in my British bank account, Barclays, </joey>
<joey> it's Garnt Manitapo (Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> and because the names don't match, </joey>
<joey> they obviously assume- - Different person. </joey>
<connor> - They obviously assume I'm like a duel citizen, </connor>
<connor> like I'm fucking Jason Bourne </connor>
<connor> with five different identities. </connor>
<connor> - He whips out the pistol bag. </connor>
<connor> What, which one, it's actually Russian. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - So I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> what do I need? - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And she was like, "I dunno" I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> and she was just like, </connor>
<connor> "I dunno, do you have any bills?" </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, </connor>
<connor> "I don't have any bills 'Cause I live in Japan now, </connor>
<connor> but will like a bank statement do?" </connor>
<joey> And she was just like, </joey>
<joey> "Yeah, sure. A bank statement will do" </joey>
<joey> and I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> "Do I have to print it out?" </joey>
<joey> and she says, "Yes, it has to be printed out" </joey>
<joey> - Of course you do. </joey>
<joey> - And scanned to us and I'm just like, </joey>
<connor> "Well, shit because obviously, </connor>
<connor> thanks- - "Can I borrow your printer?" </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Thankfully, </connor>
<connor> with British banks, </connor>
<joey> I can access my statements very conveniently </joey>
<joey> on my phone. </joey>
<joey> - But you can't just do this. </joey>
<joey> - And on any, </joey>
<joey> on any electronic device </joey>
<joey> and I'm just like, "Okay, how can, </joey>
<connor> okay, this is where my engineering problem skills </connor>
<connor> like commence" Because I, first up, </connor>
<connor> first thing I asked her </connor>
<connor> is like, "How, like how much like, </connor>
<connor> can I go to the Konbini? </connor>
<connor> to print off my, </connor>
<connor> to print off my statement" right? </connor>
<connor> And she says, "Sure, how much time would that take?" </connor>
<joey> And I asked "How much time </joey>
<joey> is this appointment booked for?" </joey>
<joey> And she says "I have an hour" All right? </joey>
<joey> and the appointment's booked for an hour, </joey>
<joey> so I have an hour </joey>
<joey> time slot, because I am not fucking going, </joey>
<joey> I am not coming back to the bank, </joey>
<joey> just for the purpose of this transfer </joey>
<garnt> and I'm not missing out on this appointment, </garnt>
<garnt> so I'm like "Fucking, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm doing this right now" and I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> oh, "I'll be right back, I'm going to go </garnt>
<garnt> to the Konbini, I'm going to print out my stuff" </garnt>
<garnt> - "To print out </garnt>
<connor> what I could have showed you digitally" </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. - I could've just done this. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. - I could have sent it </connor>
<connor> to you in an email. - Email. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - You know? </connor>
<garnt> - Exactly, so I- </garnt>
<joey> - Like, "Do you have a fax? You can fax it to us" </joey>
<garnt> - So I rush off to the Konbini </garnt>
<garnt> and then I realized that, </garnt>
<garnt> so there's, so every Konbini has a printer, right? </garnt>
<connor> And there's only a few ways to connect to that printer. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - One way- (laughs) - I know, I know. </connor>
<connor> - You see where I'm going with this. </connor>
<connor> One way is via phone </connor>
<joey> and the other way is via USB stick. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. - So I was just like, </joey>
<joey> "Okay, great, maybe, I got it on my phone. </joey>
<joey> So I'll just connect via my phone" so I- </joey>
<connor> - You think you will. (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> - So that to me was like my first </connor>
<connor> my first option to problem solve this fucking issue </connor>
<connor> that shouldn't be an issue, right? </connor>
<connor> So I tried to download the app </connor>
<connor> to connect to the printer. </connor>
<connor> The app's not available internationally. </connor>
<connor> - Of course. - I have, </connor>
<connor> my Google Play store </connor>
<connor> is still linked to my UK account. </connor>
<joey> Luckily, luckily </joey>
<joey> that wasn't too big of an issue </joey>
<joey> 'cause I have a Japanese account as well </joey>
<joey> for this exact purpose of downloading Japanese apps. </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> - So obviously, </joey>
<joey> I download the app and everything is in Japanese. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. - And obviously, </joey>
<joey> my nihongo is not jouzu enough to figure out Japanese. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> Yeah, my nihongo was not good enough </joey>
<joey> to figure out this app. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So what I did is, I have a second phone, right? </joey>
<joey> - And you translate it. (Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> - And this second phone </joey>
<joey> is my UK phone, so-- </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So I have like this old UK phone, </joey>
<joey> it's an iPhone five, which is like my phone </joey>
<joey> before I upgraded to this new phone now. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Which is, the only purpose for that phone </joey>
<joey> is just so I have a </joey>
<joey> UK SIM card so I can phone home, </joey>
<joey> or if any UK people want to phone me. </joey>
<joey> So I'm fucking like, </joey>
<joey> I'm fucking on my phone </joey>
<connor> with another phone Googling, </connor>
<connor> Google translating my phone with another phone (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - I've done that. - And I'm just looking </connor>
<connor> like a little fucking clown in the Konbini </connor>
<connor> being like. </connor>
<connor> So I'm there for about four, 10, 15 minutes </connor>
<garnt> trying to get this phone to connect to the printer. </garnt>
<joey> It just does not want to connect. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] No, no. - Fucking, </joey>
<joey> I don't know what is going on with the app, </joey>
<joey> I don't even think it was the language. </joey>
<joey> I just think it was the app. </joey>
<garnt> - No, I've tried, I've tried </garnt>
<joey> using that app and I tried for like an hour. </joey>
<joey> It just doesn't connect. </joey>
<joey> - This is why I just always carry around the USB stick. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, right? Same, same. </joey>
<connor> - You just never know when you need to print something. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - So I'm like, </connor>
<connor> "Fuck, this isn't going to work, okay" </connor>
<garnt> 15 minutes have passed, the time is ticking. </garnt>
<garnt> I've only got like, at this point, </garnt>
<garnt> I've only got half an hour left of the appointment </garnt>
<joey> and I also still need to fill out the rest of the form. </joey>
<joey> So I've got another 15 minutes at most. </joey>
<joey> I'm just like, "Okay, I need to find another way. </joey>
<joey> Thankfully, I remember I brought my laptop with me. </joey>
<joey> Great. - Good stuff. </joey>
<joey> - So I can and I have a USB stick as well </joey>
<joey> in my bag. </joey>
<joey> So I'm just like, "Great, I just need internet" </joey>
<joey> so unfortunately </joey>
<garnt> with Japanese sims, you can't tether internet (laughs) </garnt>
<joey> - No, it's like, it's like an option </joey>
<garnt> you have to pay for. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly, exactly </garnt>
<garnt> so I'm just like fucking Googling </garnt>
<garnt> "Where is the nearest internet Hotwire, </garnt>
<joey> internet hotspot?" </joey>
<joey> So I look for coffee shops, right? </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So I'm like brilliant, there's a fucking coffee- </joey>
<joey> - Or like McDonald's or something. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's just like everything you do, there's another thing. </connor>
<joey> (laughter) </joey>
<joey> - It's like side quest to complete the side quest. </joey>
<connor> - "I'm gonna have to order a drink at Starbucks" </connor>
<connor> - Brilliant, there's a Tully's coffee shop </connor>
<connor> like right, you know, a block down from me. </connor>
<connor> So I fucking sprint to this coffee shop. </connor>
<connor> I don't want to buy a coffee </connor>
<connor> 'cause that's just adding more time on. </connor>
<connor> So I'm like outside the coffee shop </connor>
<connor> and I'm just like fucking, </connor>
<connor> I'm just like fucking Watchdogs, you know? </connor>
<joey> (Joey and Connor laugh) </joey>
<joey> I like, I take out my laptop </joey>
<joey> in the middle of the, </joey>
<joey> in the middle of the street, I take out my laptop, </joey>
<joey> open it, fucking connect to the wifi. </joey>
<joey> - It's so ghetto. (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it's like a scene of Watchdogs </joey>
<connor> or something where I'm just like- </connor>
<connor> - Turning off the traffic lights. </connor>
<connor> - I'm hacking- - Into the main frame. </connor>
<connor> - I'm hacking the system, so I like download, </connor>
<connor> download my, download my statement, </connor>
<connor> put it in my USB stick, </connor>
<connor> run back to the fucking Konbini, </connor>
<connor> then I can finally print off the statement. </connor>
<connor> Then I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> and by then 20 minutes have passed, </connor>
<connor> I fucking run back, run back to the bank </connor>
<connor> and I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> "Do I have enough time to complete this transfer?" </connor>
<connor> And she's like, yes, yes, we'll make enough time to like, </connor>
<connor> thank fucking God. </connor>
<connor> Okay. </connor>
<connor> So I hand her the statement, </connor>
<connor> right? </connor>
<connor> And she's like, "Okay, great, we can use this" </connor>
<connor> And then, so we start </connor>
<connor> filling out the rest of the form. </connor>
<connor> So she asked me for my British account number </connor>
<connor> and account details. </connor>
<garnt> And so I whip out my Barclay's debit cards. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - And she looks at it </garnt>
<garnt> and she goes, </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh, we could have just used that" </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm just like-- </garnt>
<garnt> (laughter) </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh my God. </garnt>
<connor> I am literally about to scream right now" </connor>
<garnt> (laughter) </garnt>
<joey> - And you know, if you ever ask a bank, </joey>
<joey> like person, like, being like, </joey>
<joey> "Why didn't you tell me that before?" </joey>
<joey> Then they'll just be like, "Well, you didn't ask" </joey>
<connor> - (mumbles) Pandora's fucking box. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it's like "Cool, </connor>
<joey> thank you for giving me all the options" </joey>
<connor> - Was there a transfer limit that you could do? </connor>
<garnt> - There wasn't a transfer limit thankfully enough. </garnt>
<connor> But the transfer itself cost $80, </connor>
<garnt> which is just like, fucking Jesus Christ. </garnt>
<joey> - So I think the reason </joey>
<garnt> why Japanese banks, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I read up on this before </garnt>
<joey> 'cause I had to help Aki do the exact same thing, right? </joey>
<joey> So like send money back home </joey>
<connor> for her parents and like, yeah, </connor>
<connor> I have to go through this, </connor>
<connor> obviously I didn't have the problem </connor>
<connor> with the Google translate thing. </connor>
<connor> So I got it done in one go. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But I was just like, </connor>
<connor> "Jesus Christ, like why is this just </connor>
<connor> such an arbitrary process, like, </connor>
<connor> it shouldn't take this long" </connor>
<connor> and then I saw like a thing being like, </connor>
<garnt> oh it's because Japan has, like, </garnt>
<garnt> run into like a lot of, like, </garnt>
<garnt> money laundering issues and I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> "I don't know if anyone can be bothered </garnt>
<garnt> to money launder if it takes </garnt>
<garnt> that fucking long to do it" (Garnt laughs) </garnt>
<joey> - Honestly, it's probably a deterrent at this point, </joey>
<garnt> like, why would you money launder in Japan when- </garnt>
<garnt> - When it takes like a full day to process, I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> "I can't be fucked to money launder any more. </garnt>
<joey> I'll just be a law-abiding citizen" </joey>
<garnt> - Honestly, it's probably easier </garnt>
<garnt> to like abide by the law </garnt>
<connor> than be a money launder at that point. </connor>
<connor> - I feel like money laundering is not an issue </connor>
<joey> that is an every day issue </joey>
<joey> for the consumer at the bank. </joey>
<connor> - [Joey] Right? - I feel like </connor>
<connor> we should really be looking </connor>
<joey> at these massive billion dollar transfers </joey>
<connor> that are done from the Cayman Islands. </connor>
<connor> - I guarantee it was probably </connor>
<connor> like, it happened maybe like </connor>
<connor> once or twice and then obviously </connor>
<joey> every Japanese company, when something bad happens </joey>
<joey> once or twice, they get super paranoid about it </joey>
<joey> and they're like, "Guys, we have to stop </joey>
<joey> this money laundering crisis, it is unstoppable. </joey>
<joey> Make the process as bullshit as possible </joey>
<connor> so that no one can be bothered to do it" </connor>
<joey> - Is that really the reason why? </joey>
<connor> 'Cause I've noticed that like anything payment wise, </connor>
<connor> Japan is very easy to send money to, </connor>
<connor> but very difficult to get it out of. </connor>
<connor> And I've just wondered too, I just assumed </connor>
<connor> that was like Japanese government being like, </connor>
<connor> "Yeah, we want money to stay here" </connor>
<joey> - I mean, that's probably also a thing as well. </joey>
<joey> I'm sure the money laundering thing </joey>
<connor> is just like a farse, </connor>
<connor> like a public thing that they just say </connor>
<connor> but I think guaranteed. - Yeah, it's for safety. </connor>
<connor> That's why we don't like it. - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - "We don't want you breaking any laws" </garnt>
<garnt> - Have you ever like sent, have you ever been scammed </garnt>
<garnt> via like any money scheme or something like that? </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause like I remember like the- </garnt>
<garnt> - Like phone scams and stuff like that? </garnt>
<garnt> - No, just like been scammed with like transferring money </garnt>
<garnt> and then you never got it back </garnt>
<connor> or something like that 'cause I remember when I was, </connor>
<connor> the only time I've sent money, that was just like, </connor>
<connor> I could, just got completely scammed </connor>
<connor> and I rightly so got scammed because this was </connor>
<connor> when I was trying to buy a fake ID when I was under age. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt and Connor laugh) </connor>
<joey> - Well, yeah, mean- - I mean, </joey>
<connor> I totally deserved it. - Instant karma compilation. </connor>
<connor> - No it is, I absolutely deserved it but I, </connor>
<connor> 'cause like I remember, you know, </connor>
<joey> back when you're a UK teen, you know, </joey>
<joey> the person who had the fake ID was the cool guy, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, he was the king. - He was the fucking king </joey>
<joey> because could buy the drinks, you know, </joey>
<joey> he could buy the alcohol, he whips out the realistic looking </joey>
<connor> fake ID and it's not just like the, </connor>
<connor> obviously like really like obviously fake student ID. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Like you can buy </connor>
<connor> from like $5 from like some guy. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - So I was just like, how did, </connor>
<connor> so I knew a guy who had a fake ID, so I was like, </connor>
<connor> "How did you get it?" </connor>
<connor> and he tells me this, you know, </connor>
<connor> really dodgy fucking website and I'm just like- </connor>
<joey> - Of course. - And I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> "Am I desperate enough </joey>
<joey> to carry the risk of trying to purchase this ID?" </joey>
<joey> - He says </joey>
<joey> as he was downloading Tor. (laughter) </joey>
<connor> - 'Cause this is how I- - It isn't Amazon. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause this is how I realized </connor>
<connor> 'cause you couldn't pay by card with this website, right? </connor>
<connor> - Oh God, Bitcoin? - No, no, no, this is far, </connor>
<connor> this was way before Bitcoin, </connor>
<joey> you had to transfer </joey>
<joey> via Western Union. - Oh my God. </joey>
<joey> - Literally, anything with that is a scam. </joey>
<joey> Anything that uses, I'm pretty sure that's how Western Union </joey>
<garnt> makes money, through scams. - Which is why I asked, right? </garnt>
<connor> Because I obviously, 'cause I had never heard </connor>
<joey> of fucking Western Union before, I was just like, </joey>
<connor> what the fuck is Western Union? </connor>
<joey> - I only know about it from scams. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, same, same, yeah. - Now I do know about it </joey>
<joey> from scams </joey>
<joey> and so, because I tried, I was like, </joey>
<joey> I tried sending this, I was like, </joey>
<joey> how do I send money via Western union? </joey>
<joey> Is that a bank, is that like some Nigerian bank </joey>
<joey> or something like, like I've never heard of this before </joey>
<joey> and like I, three blind this fake ID, </joey>
<joey> because at that point I was a dumb kid </joey>
<joey> and I was stupid enough to just trudge- </joey>
<joey> - You were desperate enough. - I was stupid </joey>
<connor> and desperate enough to just try anything to like </connor>
<connor> get a fake ID. - Mans was desperate. </connor>
<connor> - Huh? - Mans was desperate. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, so I was like, sure, I'll try </connor>
<joey> this Western Union stuff, maybe it will work out. </joey>
<joey> - Famous last words. - And then I find out </joey>
<joey> that you can only send like Western Union transfers </joey>
<joey> at not even banks but like certain corner shops in the UK. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Right? </joey>
<joey> It's not even anything efficient. </joey>
<joey> It's like the most dodgiest places you can send money </joey>
<garnt> and these are the only places you can send money </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm just like, "Maybe it'll work out, </garnt>
<garnt> maybe it'll work out" - That's like the equivalent </garnt>
<garnt> of being like, you can buy this with cash </garnt>
<garnt> but we have to meet in an alleyway somewhere. </garnt>
<garnt> It can't be on the open road. - And I think I would have </garnt>
<joey> preferred to meet someone in the alleyway </joey>
<connor> 'cause at least there would be like another person. </connor>
<connor> I could communicate with, right? </connor>
<connor> - How much was it? - Huh? </connor>
<connor> - How much was it? - It was like 30 pounds. </connor>
<connor> (Connor laughs) </connor>
<connor> I mean, that was a lot for me as a 16 year old kid </connor>
<connor> or whatever all right? - Oh yeah, of course. </connor>
<connor> - Like what was I trying to, moral of the story is, </connor>
<joey> don't buy fake ID kids, it's not worth it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah and also- - Of course it's not worth it </joey>
<garnt> 'cause you didn't fucking get it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - Don't be stupid like me. </garnt>
<garnt> - The moment you see Western Union as well, turn around, </garnt>
<garnt> like don't even bother with that shit. </garnt>
<connor> I know Japan actually has like a lot of scams because like, </connor>
<connor> you know how the population here is very old, right? </connor>
<connor> Like the majority of them, so there's a lot of </connor>
<connor> like phone scams that happen. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I've heard about that. </connor>
<joey> - And the most famous, like variety of phone scams </joey>
<joey> is they called (speaks Japanese) which means, </joey>
<joey> "The Me, Me Scam" so basically how it works </joey>
<joey> is a guy calls up like an old, </joey>
<joey> you know, granddad or a grandfather </joey>
<joey> who like they do back research to see like, </joey>
<connor> "Do they have grandchildren? Do they have a son </connor>
<connor> or a daughter?" and they call them up, </connor>
<connor> and they go, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, it's me, it's me" </connor>
<connor> like, posing as their son or daughter </connor>
<connor> being like, "Oh, it's me, it's me. </connor>
<connor> I need help, you know, can you get me </connor>
<connor> like X amount of money" - Right. </connor>
<connor> - So on and so forth and so many old people </connor>
<connor> fall for it. - Everyone's so, you know- </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. - Polite in this country. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, right, it's insane how much, </joey>
<joey> like my grandma almost fell for it one time. </joey>
<connor> I remember. - [Connor] Oh, wow. </connor>
<joey> - Like when I was quite young, luckily she didn't </joey>
<connor> but like yeah, there was, they asked </connor>
<connor> for like absurd amounts of money, like, you know, </connor>
<connor> upwards of like hundreds and thousands of dollars. </connor>
<joey> - [Garnt] Jesus. - [Connor] Jesus. </joey>
<connor> - Just to be like, "Yeah, </connor>
<connor> can you transfer it like tomorrow? </connor>
<connor> I'm like desperately need it, I just lost my job" </connor>
<joey> blah, blah, blah, all that kind of stuff. </joey>
<joey> Every year, dude, like old people fall for it. </joey>
<joey> - "I need $100,000, I lost my job" </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I lost my job. - "I need </joey>
<joey> to order a Domino's pizza in Japan. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> I need a hundred thousand dollars" </joey>
<joey> - "I need to buy out all the Domino's stocks" </joey>
<joey> - I need one large Domino's pizza from Japan. </joey>
<connor> - $100,000 (laughs) - It's $100,000 (laughs) </connor>
<joey> There's also the, I think actually, </joey>
<joey> I remember I watched videos about people who became homeless </joey>
<joey> in Japan and apparently one of the scams </joey>
<connor> that makes people homeless a lot of the time </connor>
<connor> is guarantor scams, </connor>
<connor> so like people ask </connor>
<joey> people to be like guarantors on their rent </joey>
<joey> and then they just run off. - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And then they have to pay the guarantor thing </joey>
<joey> and they lose a shit ton of money. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Because most people </joey>
<connor> can't afford to pay double rent. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Which is a shitty thing, isn't it? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Not to mention </connor>
<connor> the key money and all that. - Oh my God. </connor>
<garnt> That's a scam in itself. - Key money is a scam </garnt>
<joey> in and of itself. - That's just a scam </joey>
<joey> everyone's agreed to, I think. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I think so. - At what point </joey>
<joey> does it stop being a scam and does it just like- </joey>
<garnt> - Tradition is the biggest scam of all. </garnt>
<joey> - I just don't understand the point of that. </joey>
<joey> Just being like, oh yes, here's an extra month worth of rent </joey>
<joey> as a thank you for letting this peasant stay in your abode </joey>
<joey> and it's like, I'm fucking paying rent every month. </joey>
<joey> Are you not happy with the rent money? </joey>
<joey> - I'm already paying you money to stay in your place </joey>
<garnt> and you want to pay me extra money to be thankful </garnt>
<joey> that I'm paying you money, I'm like, why? </joey>
<joey> - Am I not thankful enough for the rent? </joey>
<connor> Why should I be thankful to pay you money? </connor>
<garnt> - So yeah, in Japan, you have to pay one </garnt>
<connor> to two months rent upfront. - Yeah, depending, depending. </connor>
<connor> Some places you don't have to. </connor>
<connor> - In my place you have to. - And it's not a deposit </connor>
<connor> because you know. - No. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, deposits, like everyone always asks, </joey>
<connor> is it a deposit? - No. </connor>
<connor> - No. - There's a deposit. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Which like comes back </connor>
<connor> to you after you move out but then there's key money, </connor>
<connor> which just does not return. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - It's literally just like, </connor>
<garnt> just like a- - It's just a bribe. </garnt>
<joey> That's all it is. (laughter) </joey>
<connor> It's to be like, "You'll let me stay, right?" </connor>
<connor> - It's a legal bribe. - It's a legal bribe. </connor>
<joey> It's like, "You'll let me stay, right? </joey>
<connor> Here's some money" - You know, </connor>
<connor> at least they don't in, Japan, they have to deal </connor>
<connor> with like Microsoft scams and like the Indian call centers. </connor>
<joey> - Oh yeah, true, oh my God, can you imagine that? </joey>
<joey> - I think it's the reason we get them so much </joey>
<joey> 'cause Indian people can speak English. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that's true, that's true. </joey>
<connor> - But I remember when I- - The moment Indians </connor>
<joey> can start speaking Japanese, it's over. </joey>
<connor> (laughter) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, right, I remember- </connor>
<joey> - It's like the moment where actual companies </joey>
<joey> move their call centers from India </joey>
<joey> to let like literally any other country it's over </joey>
<connor> but it's always in India, that's what makes it </connor>
<garnt> so hard sometimes. - Yeah, God. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, everywhere you'd call in the UK, </connor>
<garnt> it was always an Indian call center. </garnt>
<joey> Especially with internet. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - The amount </joey>
<joey> of times I'd call up and I'm like, </joey>
<connor> I don't even know if I'm talking to a scam </connor>
<connor> 'cause the service is so shit, you could film. </connor>
<connor> - It's always like internet and banking as well, right? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. - That's always great, </joey>
<garnt> to have a- - Which are </garnt>
<garnt> the two big things. - Yeah, that's what was great, </garnt>
<garnt> to have a dad who worked in IT. </garnt>
<connor> 'Cause I'd never needed to call them. </connor>
<connor> I'd just be like, "Father, help me please" </connor>
<joey> - Help me. - "I know you're not Indian" </joey>
<joey> When I first worked with BookWalker. </joey>
<joey> I was doing a promotion with them </joey>
<joey> and it was actually on one of my videos </joey>
<joey> where I prank called scammers. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Oh yeah, yeah. - And this is where I learned </joey>
<joey> that they don't have them in Japan </joey>
<joey> because I'd made this video, right? </joey>
<joey> Where I basically just called up scammers </joey>
<joey> and I just kept promoting BookWalker to them. </joey>
<connor> Just kept doing it, kept doing it </connor>
<connor> and then I would like do a super cut </connor>
<connor> of like the funniest moments and they would </connor>
<connor> get really pissed off and I would be like Microsoft </connor>
<joey> and I would just be like, I would just start </joey>
<joey> playing "The Price is Right" music to them </joey>
<joey> and just start basically doing a pitch. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> And just piss them off </joey>
<joey> and then whenever they blocked my number, </joey>
<joey> I'd make a new number and I called them again. </joey>
<joey> And so I filmed it and it was great. </joey>
<joey> It was this really funny bit, it was like two minutes long </joey>
<joey> and it was just great of me and it was great promotion </joey>
<joey> because I was- - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> I mean, that series was doing really well for you. </joey>
<connor> - It was literally just me doing ad reads for two minutes </connor>
<connor> to Indians and call centers and yeah </connor>
<connor> and then I sent it off to BookWalker </connor>
<joey> and I was like, "Oh God, they might not like it" </joey>
<joey> and then they were like, "Okay, it looks that's good. </joey>
<connor> Will we get in trouble with Microsoft for doing this?" </connor>
<joey> (laughter) </joey>
<joey> - And I was like- - The truth comes out. </joey>
<joey> Microsoft backing up scammers. - No, it was 'cause </joey>
<joey> when we called them up, they were obviously pretending </joey>
<joey> to be Microsoft. - Yeah, of course, of course. </joey>
<joey> - So BookWalker is like, "Oh, is Microsoft okay </joey>
<connor> with you doing this?" (laughter) </connor>
<garnt> - How dare you harass their employees? </garnt>
<garnt> - "Shit, do we need approval from Microsoft about this?" </garnt>
<connor> - I was like, "What? No, no, </connor>
<connor> you know what this is, right? </connor>
<joey> It's like, yeah, it's a scam, you know? </joey>
<joey> They call you up, tell you your PC is broken" </joey>
<joey> They're like, "No way, that's a thing?" </joey>
<joey> - That's a thing. - I was like, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> I think it was too Maylene, actually. </joey>
<joey> - [Man] You know when we call you Microsoft, </joey>
<joey> you know who's going to answer you first? </joey>
<joey> Cortana's going to answer you first. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, yeah. - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<connor> - [Maylene] I knew it was fake but I had to make sure. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah, it's even worse because Maylene's American. </connor>
<joey> Maylene should have known this. </joey>
<connor> - [Maylene] I needed to have written proof. </connor>
<joey> (laughter) (cross talk) </joey>
<joey> - Maylene said she needed written proof </joey>
<joey> that it was a scam. (laughter) </joey>
<joey> - "Excuse me, can you give me approval?" </joey>
<joey> - "Can you sign if you are actually scamming me right now? </joey>
<joey> I'm not sure." - Only in Japan </joey>
<joey> do you need- - It's like, promise- </joey>
<connor> - Written proof from scammers that you're being scammed. </connor>
<joey> - "Do you promise you won't scam me?" </joey>
<connor> "I promise I won't scam you" scams you. </connor>
<joey> - [Man] It's an agreement. - Oh my God. </joey>
<connor> - "Do I have your word, scammer?" </connor>
<connor> - "Do I have your word?" - "Do I have your word?" </connor>
<joey> - "I can trust you, right, scammer?" </joey>
<joey> - "Do you have a hanko stamp, can I get a hanko </joey>
<connor> proving you're not a-" - My God. </connor>
<joey> Yeah, that is true, actually, now that I think about it. </joey>
<joey> We don't have anything like that in Japan. </joey>
<connor> - To be honest, you're right because think about it. </connor>
<connor> Even if Maylene says that, she joked saying proof, right? </connor>
<joey> What's stopping a Japanese company from saying, "Oh, </joey>
<joey> we're providing tech support, they get the Hanko stamp" </joey>
<joey> That Japanese governments, they start calling up people </joey>
<joey> saying, hi, we're Microsoft, they probably wouldn't </joey>
<joey> get shut down for a while. - Probably not. </joey>
<connor> - 'Cause even if the report gets filed, </connor>
<connor> the Japanese government will take five fucking years </connor>
<connor> to analyze the case and decide that it's a scam. </connor>
<joey> - And by then they would've fucking dipped out. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah and then they'll have ten new networks and companies. </connor>
<garnt> - I hope none of the Indian scammers see this. </garnt>
<connor> - They're like, "Write that down! </connor>
<connor> Write that down, write that down!" </connor>
<connor> (laughter) </connor>
<garnt> - Like "Gentlemen, we are expanding" </garnt>
<connor> (laughter) </connor>
<connor> - "Dave knows nihongo get him in, get him in. </connor>
<joey> He knows Keiko, they'll surely fall for it" </joey>
<connor> - "Who's seen anime here, who's watched anime?" </connor>
<connor> - I've been getting into like the, you know, </connor>
<connor> the YouTube channels that really </connor>
<connor> look into the Indian scammers. </connor>
<connor> Like I think, is it Jim Browning? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Is that his name? </connor>
<connor> - I'm a big fan of them all. - Yeah, I really love </connor>
<connor> what Jim Browning does and I dunno what, </connor>
<connor> like I dunno some of the other people, </connor>
<connor> as well, some of the people who actually </connor>
<connor> just phone them back up as well and just really troll them. </connor>
<garnt> I remember I saw one guy who got an Indian scammer </garnt>
<garnt> so fucking angry that he was literally shouting </garnt>
<connor> on the phone. - Jesus. </connor>
<garnt> - Well, have you watched like, </garnt>
<garnt> yeah Kitboga, have you watched Kitboga? </garnt>
<garnt> He does ones where he does like, </garnt>
<connor> what's the inverse speed runs, I guess, slow run. </connor>
<connor> - Slow runs, yeah. - Where he tries to keep them </connor>
<connor> on the phone for as long as possible. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. - And I swear, </garnt>
<garnt> he on average gets it like four or five hours. </garnt>
<connor> - Holy shit. - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - And just wastes their time. - He's far too good </garnt>
<connor> at sounding like an old grandma. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. - An old American grandma. </connor>
<garnt> - He's too good at that. - He uses a filter </garnt>
<joey> but he also like, he does a really good job. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. - And he's got the mannerisms </garnt>
<garnt> down perfectly 'cause he just does it all day. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. - So he's there </garnt>
<connor> pretending to be an old grandma for like six hours </connor>
<connor> on Twitch, it's insane. </connor>
<connor> - [Man] He works with a voice coach, apparently. </connor>
<connor> - Oh really, oh my God. - That's someone dedicated </connor>
<joey> to their craft, right there. - They will get </joey>
<connor> like nine hours, though, on a call. </connor>
<connor> - Fucking hell, reverse speed run. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah and then at the end, the reveal is so great </connor>
<connor> 'cause you could just hear like how fucking annoyed </connor>
<connor> the person, </connor>
<connor> this scammer just gets so fucking angry, </connor>
<connor> if you're not fast enough. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. - You hear some of them </connor>
<connor> where they're like, "No, got to warm up now. </connor>
<joey> Get the Google Play card now, now you dumb bitch" </joey>
<joey> like shouting at them, like "Wow, </joey>
<joey> this is some good customer service. </joey>
<garnt> This is still better than like Virgin media, I think" </garnt>
<connor> (laughter) </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah 'cause like what clocked me onto to that, </garnt>
<connor> to be honest, that was like, it was recommended </connor>
<connor> that I got recommended just a random clip. </connor>
<connor> I've just, An Indian guy like shouting </connor>
<connor> at full fucking volume. - Oh yeah. </connor>
<connor> You get a lot of that. - Just like, </connor>
<connor> "Why are you so dumb? Why are you so stupid? </connor>
<connor> Why are you doing that?" and I'm just like, </connor>
<garnt> "What the fuck man?" - Yeah, you like, </garnt>
<garnt> click the wrong thing. - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like traumatizing for these older people. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, I bet, Jesus Christ. - Like someone could </joey>
<joey> murder my mother and I don't think I'd be as angry as that. </joey>
<joey> - Right, right, right? - Like Jesus Christ. </joey>
<garnt> What the hell, man? (laughter) </garnt>
<garnt> - There's some really good Jim Browning ones </garnt>
<joey> where he like gets their like passport information. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - On their like PC </joey>
<joey> and he like shows it to them. - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - It's really fucking good. - Go on. </garnt>
<connor> - Scare the shit out of them. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's good. </connor>
<connor> Check out Jim Browning like if you ever want </connor>
<connor> to fall down a rabbit hole and just wonder </connor>
<connor> what is actually on the other side </connor>
<garnt> of whoever like phones up, phones you up </garnt>
<garnt> and tries to scam people. - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> I mean, for every one of those people </connor>
<connor> that's calling them back and fucking with them, it saves, </connor>
<connor> you know, one person's money and time. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I mean, if anyone deserves to be fucked with, </joey>
<joey> it's scammers. - It's scammers, right? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah because even if you you're quite savvy </connor>
<connor> with this stuff, you're unlikely to, </connor>
<joey> if you hear an Indian accent calling you and telling you, </joey>
<joey> "Hey, you need to pay X money to Microsoft" </joey>
<joey> You're probably not gonna fall for it, right? </joey>
<joey> But that's because we know. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But also the older people- - The older generation </joey>
<joey> have no idea, right? - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. - I have a distinct memory </joey>
<joey> from when I was like 10 of my mum coming to me </joey>
<joey> and being like, "You know our friend? </joey>
<joey> Apparently Microsoft called them up </joey>
<joey> and said that they have some of the worst viruses </joey>
<joey> in the world on their PC" (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> and I was like, "Wow, really?" </joey>
<joey> "Really" and that was all I heard of it. </joey>
<joey> A week later she comes back, she's like, </joey>
<connor> "Turns out it was a scam and they lost </connor>
<joey> and they lost 1000 pounds" - Holy shit! </joey>
<connor> - Adjust for inflation, that's like 10 grand. </connor>
<joey> - They said that they had the Y2K bug. </joey>
<connor> (laughter) </connor>
<joey> - This was around that time, I think. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - I know it wasn't actually. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. - I was very, very young </connor>
<connor> and I just had this weird memory of being like, </connor>
<connor> "That's sounds strange" - "That sounds dumb" </connor>
<connor> - "Why would Microsoft call you up? </connor>
<connor> Why wouldn't they just nuke your PC </connor>
<connor> if there was a problem?" (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> - The thing </connor>
<connor> that I've had to teach my parents </connor>
<garnt> is like, there was a period when they just </garnt>
<garnt> were not tech savvy at all, I mean, </garnt>
<connor> like they're still not exactly tech savvy </connor>
<connor> but at least they were not tech savvy enough to even attempt </connor>
<connor> to go on the internet and go on Facebook and stuff. </connor>
<connor> - Right, right. - And it was the point </connor>
<joey> when they started to take more of an interest </joey>
<joey> on being online and stuff like that, </joey>
<joey> that it really was kind of like stepping on eggshells </joey>
<connor> when trying to explain to them that some emails are not real </connor>
<connor> and some emails are scams and it's just like, </connor>
<connor> sometimes when mum just like, will send me a message </connor>
<connor> to be like, "Is this, should I click on this link? </connor>
<connor> Should I click on that link?" and like, I don't know </connor>
<joey> how to properly convey, which sometimes like, </joey>
<garnt> which emails are legit and which emails are not legit. </garnt>
<garnt> It's kind of like explaining to someone over the phone, </garnt>
<garnt> how to diffuse a bomb sometimes. </garnt>
<connor> - I told my parents, right, I said, </connor>
<connor> "Even if you get the email saying your accounts </connor>
<connor> have been hacked or anything like that" I said, </connor>
<joey> I told them and the same with numbers as well. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause my dad won nearly, I think he nearly fell </joey>
<joey> for him a few times and I always told him, </joey>
<joey> "Just call them back, like call the go. </joey>
<joey> Like if you get called by your bank, </joey>
<joey> like go to the bank's website, call them" </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Immediately. </joey>
<joey> Don't talk to them. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause you know, odds are, your bank probably isn't </joey>
<joey> going to call you and if they do, </joey>
<connor> they'll probably ask you a bunch of weird stuff. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, for like, you know- - Just call them back. </joey>
<joey> - Any like social media gets compromised, </joey>
<connor> quote, unquote from an email, then just go directly </connor>
<joey> to the website and check, yes. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, never fall for that. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> I nearly fucking fell for that, </joey>
<joey> the Google Ad Sense thing. - Yeah! </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause Jim Browning fell for it. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - I actually </connor>
<joey> didn't get that email? - Really? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Dude, you're lucky, man. </joey>
<connor> If Jim Browning fell for it, anyone can. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - I saw his video on it, </joey>
<connor> actually. - Dude, it is </connor>
<connor> worryingly convincing. - But that's the thing, </connor>
<joey> right, it's like, it's hard to like convey to your, </joey>
<joey> you know, your parents or your grandparents. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Like how do I identify </joey>
<joey> between a scam email and not a scam email </joey>
<joey> because I feel every year it's just get like, </joey>
<garnt> that line is getting narrower and narrower. </garnt>
<joey> - It's getting good, man. - It's getting too good. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Which is why like, </joey>
<joey> which is why I find it so hard </joey>
<connor> to explain to them because sometimes I say, </connor>
<connor> I have to like second guess myself. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - And I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> if I'm second guessing myself and I literally grew up </connor>
<joey> on the internet, I work on the internet. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - How can my parents, </joey>
<joey> who have little to no knowledge </joey>
<connor> of internet culture at all tell the difference? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, right? - And how am I </joey>
<joey> supposed to convey that through texts </joey>
<joey> or through phones and be like, </joey>
<garnt> just don't believe any email you get sent, basically. </garnt>

<joey> I remember the first time that Maylene messaged me </joey>
<joey> like to work with BookWalker, I thought it was a scam. </joey>
<joey> - Honestly, honestly, I thought the same thing as well. </joey>
<connor> I was just like, I was just like, </connor>
<garnt> no way this is real. - I was like, "Hold on. </garnt>
<garnt> Hold on a second, it says Kadokawa" </garnt>
<joey> I'm like, "The Kadokawa? No" </joey>
<joey> and I swear the first one, </joey>
<joey> I fucking deleted it immediately, </joey>
<joey> I was like, "Nah, that's a scam. </joey>
<joey> Get out of that" and Maylene messages me, </joey>
<joey> emailed me again after a week and she's like, </joey>
<joey> "I don't know if you read my last email, </joey>
<joey> but we were interested in working with you and I'm like, </joey>
<joey> "Did I delete that one?" - Oh, there was a, </joey>
<connor> it was a YouTuber who they, I can't remember which one, </connor>
<connor> they got like offered a role to voice an anime. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. - Right. </joey>
<joey> - By Funimation. - Right. </joey>
<joey> And they thought it was a scam? </joey>
<joey> - When they publicly announced that they'd gotten the role. </joey>
<joey> - Right. - In the show </joey>
<connor> and it was just a fake email. (laughter) </connor>
<garnt> - That's painful. - Oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> - That was like, I thought- - That is- </garnt>
<connor> - I don't think I've cringed out of body, </connor>
<connor> in pain for someone else more in my life. </connor>
<garnt> - I laughed but that was, that is just a bruh moment, man. </garnt>
<joey> - If I did that shit and I found out it was a scam, </joey>
<joey> I would just quit social media all together. </joey>
<joey> - I think I would, yeah, I would just not show my- </joey>
<connor> - I would just disappear from the internet, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I would not show my face, also, you know, </connor>
<connor> generally when you get calls in stuff- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, you're not supposed to say, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, you're not supposed to say, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So I guess maybe it was a test. </connor>
<connor> It was like, "A-ha, no role for you!" </connor>
<connor> - Gotcha. - It was like Willy Wonka. </connor>
<connor> "Ah, you were too greedy! No role for you!" </connor>
<garnt> - Maybe it was really Funimation </garnt>
<connor> but they just needed to pass the test. </connor>
<garnt> (laughter) </garnt>
<connor> - It's like Indiana Jones but the holy grail, </connor>
<garnt> it's like, "Ah, you choose grief! No" </garnt>
<garnt> - No, because I going back to the BookWalker email </garnt>
<garnt> emails that we first got, I think, </garnt>
<garnt> looking back Maylene must've emailed me way earlier, </garnt>
<garnt> before I actually replied for the first time. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - And what got me to reply </garnt>
<garnt> was meeting you for the first time </garnt>
<garnt> and being like, "Oh yeah, that email from Maylene, </garnt>
<garnt> did you get an email from Maylene as well?" </garnt>
<garnt> And that was just like, "That's not a scam? </garnt>
<garnt> That's real, that was real this entire time? </garnt>
<garnt> I've just been ghosting her </garnt>
<garnt> and deleting all the emails" </garnt>
<joey> - I remember, I think that, I think I sent that email </joey>
<joey> to about like three or four different family members </joey>
<joey> just to be like, "Does this look fake? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I'm really scared to reply to this shit </joey>
<joey> and get like a virus 'cause like, I don't even know" </joey>
<joey> Luckily it wasn't but yeah, I don't know </joey>
<joey> if it was the way that like Maylene wrote the email </joey>
<joey> or what it was, yes, I'm blaming Maylene. </joey>
<garnt> - Blame Maylene. (laughter off screen) </garnt>
<garnt> - And I think it was just before, </garnt>
<garnt> this was before the point of (speaking Japanese) </garnt>
<garnt> where we thought any kind of companies </garnt>
<joey> like would contact us. - Yeah </joey>
<joey> because before that, like the biggest complaint, </joey>
<joey> I had not worked with any big company, right? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. - It was always like, </connor>
<joey> you know, like- </joey>
<connor> - Actually yeah, it was not a thing back then at all. </connor>
<connor> - I was still tiny back then as well. </connor>
<joey> So I was like, nah, no way I can't, this jump is too high. </joey>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. - That's way too unrealistic. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, yeah, arguably BookWalker kind of like, </connor>
<joey> paved the way in that way, I feel like BookWalker </joey>
<joey> opened up. - I took the bullet </joey>
<connor> for everyone. </connor>
<connor> (laughter) </connor>
<connor> - I was like, "I'll take it for the good of the people" </connor>
<connor> Reply. - Reply. </connor>
<connor> - Did you see the YouTube scam, though? </connor>
<connor> Did you see what like the- - I saw what it was about </connor>
<joey> because I think literally every, </joey>
<joey> all of my other friends got that email, </joey>
<joey> including you guys and yeah, so I was scared. </joey>
<joey> I was sifting through my email as well and I didn't get one. </joey>
<joey> - So essentially what happened was, </joey>
<joey> is that I got an email from a Google email that said, </joey>
<joey> oh, it was, the message was sent like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, you have a duplicate Ad Sense account </joey>
<joey> and you know, your channel will be deleted" </joey>
<joey> and I think that is one of the rules of Ad Sense </joey>
<joey> is that if you do actually have multiple Ad Sense accounts, </joey>
<garnt> you will get banned off Ad Sense. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, you can only have one Ad Sense account. </joey>
<joey> - And they do send an email like that as well. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah and I only have one Ad Sense account but we, </joey>
<joey> I had multiple channels, so maybe I thought, oh my God, </joey>
<connor> there must be a mix-up because I'd recently </connor>
<connor> just had the new channel and it was kind of a, </connor>
<connor> but this is often how scams work though as well. </connor>
<connor> They prey on very coincidental circumstances </connor>
<connor> that have been happening outside of the scam itself. </connor>
<connor> You know, like Jim Browning said in his thing, it's like, </connor>
<connor> yes and I'm sure you would just order the product </connor>
<connor> on Amazon, 10 minutes later, you get scam email </connor>
<connor> about Amazon, just pure coincidence </connor>
<connor> but it happens to play off a little bit. </connor>
<connor> Right, concerns, so yeah, it's this thing </connor>
<connor> and the one thing that was probably the red flag, </connor>
<connor> which I think did make me unsure, but again, </connor>
<connor> I was kind of so worried that I was like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, I should just, </connor>
<connor> I went to hear him out at least" </connor>
<connor> it was through Google Hangouts, but it was Google email. </connor>
<connor> So I was like, okay, well it's a bit weird </connor>
<connor> because normally they would just, </connor>
<joey> but then again, I've never had correspondence through Google </joey>
<joey> because they're just so shit at talking to you. </joey>
<joey> I don't even know how they would reach out to me. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. - Because they've done email </joey>
<joey> in the past but sometimes they haven't. </joey>
<joey> So I don't really understand, I think that also </joey>
<joey> is one of the reasons why I almost did fall for this </joey>
<joey> because YouTube is so unclear on how they reach out to you. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, the only time I've ever talked </garnt>
<connor> to Google directly- - Well, I've- </connor>
<connor> - Through Twitter. - Yeah, I've spoken to them. </connor>
<connor> I've never had someone reach out to me. </connor>
<joey> That's never happened, so I'm talking to them </joey>
<joey> and they going through the thing </joey>
<joey> and they're like, "Oh yeah, you have a duplicate </joey>
<joey> Ad Sense account" and I'm like, "That doesn't sound right. </joey>
<joey> I don't have the duplicate Adsense account" </joey>
<joey> They're kind of like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, well you do" </joey>
<joey> and I'm like, "Okay, well what's the ID </joey>
<joey> on the Adsense account?" Adsense accounts have IDs </joey>
<joey> and he gave me an ID and it was just like, </joey>
<joey> not even remotely- - [Joey] Close. </joey>
<joey> - Close to anything and I was like, "Oh, </joey>
<joey> okay, well that's weird" and I was like. </joey>
<joey> "Can you tell me about the account then? </joey>
<joey> What's the duplication?" and they just </joey>
<joey> couldn't tell me anything. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - He was like, "It's all private, it's all private" </joey>
<joey> Which would kind of make sense, you know? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah and I was like, "Okay, well fine. </joey>
<joey> Fine, all right, well" I was like, </joey>
<joey> "Can you tell me that you're a Google employee? </joey>
<connor> Can you share some proof?" and he was like, "No" </connor>
<connor> - And I was like-- </connor>
<connor> - "Because I'm not!" </connor>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </joey>
<joey> Scooby-doo mask reveal. </joey>
<joey> - At this point, and then, what he was trying to do </joey>
<joey> and he was, </joey>
<joey> you can make multiple YouTube accounts </joey>
<joey> under one email. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And so he told me to make a new YouTube account. </joey>
<connor> So I did this because I was just curious </connor>
<connor> to see what the steps he was telling me to do were. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - 'Cause I knew </connor>
<connor> none of this was permanent </connor>
<joey> and it doesn't really matter if you make a new account, </joey>
<joey> it doesn't like delete anything. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - So he told me </joey>
<joey> to make a new YouTube account and then go </joey>
<joey> to the YouTube account management page </joey>
<joey> and then set, </joey>
<joey> have the new account that I made </joey>
<joey> takeover the old channel. </joey>
<joey> Now what this does is that it deletes all the videos. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right. - And delete everything. </joey>
<joey> - It's basically like a factory reset. </joey>
<joey> - It kind of just puts it like, </joey>
<joey> it's just like this channel </joey>
<joey> and it's gonna like plaster it on top. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. - Brand new. </joey>
<joey> Nothing else was here before. - [Joey] Right. </joey>
<joey> - That's kind of it. - It's just a coverup, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah and then, you know, </joey>
<joey> and it just deletes everything </joey>
<joey> and then </joey>
<joey> he was telling me to do that </joey>
<joey> and so I got to the point where </joey>
<joey> I clicked on like the, </joey>
<joey> I wanted to see what the menu was, </joey>
<joey> to do it and I was going through the steps. </joey>
<joey> It was like, "Oh yeah, it'll delete everything. </joey>
<joey> Except for like likes and comments and stuff" </joey>
<joey> And I'm like "That's weird" </joey>
<joey> But, and then I was like, "No, this doesn't seem right. </joey>
<joey> This seems a little weird" </joey>
<joey> And so I was like, "Yeah, sorry, </joey>
<joey> I'm going to contact YouTube myself </joey>
<joey> 'cause I don't trust this at all" </joey>
<joey> and so I closed the chat, </joey>
<joey> I contact YouTube and like, "Hey, </joey>
<joey> is anything wrong </joey>
<joey> with my accounts? </joey>
<joey> You know, everything's going to be deleted?" </joey>
<joey> He's like, "Nope, that's all good" </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, </joey>
<joey> "You're sure? </joey>
<joey> This guy said it was" and he's like, "No, no, </joey>
<joey> that's all good" I was like, "Oh, okay then, </joey>
<joey> I guess I'll carry on" </joey>
<garnt> And then I found out it was a big steal, </garnt>
<garnt> multiple had fallen for it. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, </garnt>
<garnt> I think the problem was that you just, </garnt>
<garnt> even if you wanted to ask an official person at YouTube, </garnt>
<garnt> how, who do you contact? </garnt>
<connor> - I had to like do a web chat </connor>
<joey> with someone at Google. </joey>
<connor> - How'd you do that? </connor>
<connor> Is that possible? - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> You can do like a web chat. </joey>
<connor> - There are real employees at Google? </connor>
<connor> - I don't know if it's real. </connor>
<garnt> (laughter) </garnt>
<connor> - Probably just like the most advanced AI. </connor>
<connor> - I think on their website they have like a, </connor>
<joey> it's like, "Would you like to talk to someone?" </joey>
<connor> It's like a pop up. - Oh! </connor>
<connor> - It's one of those services. - Right, right, right. </connor>
<connor> - I was chatting to them and then they would just ask </connor>
<joey> for information and stuff and yeah, </joey>
<joey> it was actually surprisingly easy </joey>
<joey> but you know, that's, I think that was, </joey>
<joey> that might've been just YouTube. </joey>
<connor> I don't know, you know, it's all a blur. </connor>
<joey> - That's the thing, that's the problem. </joey>
<connor> - It's all shit. - Everything is so hidden </connor>
<joey> in secrecy that if someone did come up to you and was like, </joey>
<joey> "This is who we are, we're Google, </joey>
<joey> we're YouTube, you have a problem" then like most people, </joey>
<garnt> like, especially for the smaller YouTubers, </garnt>
<garnt> they wouldn't know any better because they'd probably think </garnt>
<garnt> to themselves, "Oh, I guess, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> no one's really told me how to contact Google. </garnt>
<garnt> I guess this is how they contact you" </garnt>
<garnt> - Right. - And that's probably why </garnt>
<joey> so many people fell for it. - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - I, oh, sorry, did you have something to say? </garnt>
<connor> - No, no, no, that was it, Jim Browning fell for it </connor>
<garnt> and a few other big names, The Spiffing Brit, I think, </garnt>
<joey> fell for it as well. - Lots of big YouTubers </joey>
<joey> fell for it. - It's convincing. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, I just remembered, I almost fell </garnt>
<garnt> for like a scam recently because my friend's </garnt>
<garnt> Facebook account got hacked. - Right. </garnt>
<connor> - And yeah and so his account got hacked and so the person </connor>
<connor> who hacked his account was like really clever </connor>
<connor> and sent like a mass message out. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I got it as well. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> Like a mass message out to like, </connor>
<connor> I think everyone, just everyone on his contacts list, right, </connor>
<connor> just saying, "Hey, like, I've really needed a favor </connor>
<connor> right now, do you have a minute?" </connor>
<connor> Right and it was obviously a bot running it, </connor>
<connor> 'cause if you replied anything else </connor>
<connor> but I like a predetermined script, right? </connor>
<connor> Then it would just like block you. </connor>
<connor> Or it would like just close the message </connor>
<joey> or something like that, so a bunch of people, </joey>
<connor> including Sydney, right, 'cause this was when I actually </connor>
<connor> got the message while we were recording Trash Taste. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, me too. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> So that's why I didn't see the message </joey>
<joey> but Sidney saw the message and she was like, </joey>
<joey> "Yeah, what's going on" and the message was like, </joey>
<joey> because it felt like a natural conversation </joey>
<joey> because the bot had already predetermined </joey>
<joey> like a certain conversation route that people could take. </joey>
<joey> It ended up being like a conversation chain that says that, </joey>
<joey> where he said that he was locked out of his, I think, </joey>
<joey> I think like he was locked out or something or he, </joey>
<joey> he needed to pay the rent today </joey>
<joey> and no, he was locked out of his bank account </joey>
<joey> and he needed to pay rent. </joey>
<joey> - Through Western Union. </joey>
<joey> (laughter) </joey>
<joey> - Only accepting Western Union. </joey>
<joey> - No, not Western Union but he needed to pay his rent </joey>
<joey> or he was going to get kicked out or something </joey>
<joey> and he needed to transfer money </joey>
<joey> to his landlord. </joey>
<joey> So he was like, "Can you please transfer money </joey>
<joey> to a certain bank account? And I'll cover it </joey>
<joey> when I get my bank account back </joey>
<joey> and I'll pay you interest as well" </joey>
<joey> And like, so Sydney was phoning me afterwards being like, </joey>
<joey> "Yo, yo, yo Garnt, Garnt, </joey>
<joey> have you seen the message? </joey>
<connor> Dude, he like, like Mike's in a lot of trouble. </connor>
<connor> You gotta, you gotta send money on me" </connor>
<connor> I was just like, okay, 'cause it came from Sydney </connor>
<connor> and Sydney sounded so desperate, </connor>
<connor> so I didn't even read the message. </connor>
<connor> So I was like, </connor>
<connor> "Okay, I guess </connor>
<connor> I got to send the fucking money, right?" </connor>
<connor> So before I send the money, thankfully I checked the message </connor>
<connor> that my mate sent me and by that point, thankfully, </connor>
<connor> like I remember seeing the message </connor>
<connor> and then just suddenly it just disappeared. </connor>
<connor> - Right. - And his account got, </connor>
<connor> just got deleted. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> It was like, 'cause when I saw it, </connor>
<connor> like the Facebook was back to the default icon. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - So like I was, that's weird. </connor>
<joey> - So like I was this close to just sending him money. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause he's a good mate and sometimes, you know, </joey>
<joey> you always got to get your mates' back. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, of course. - And it was really </joey>
<joey> fucking convincing 'cause I saw the messages </joey>
<joey> some other people got, 'cause unfortunately, </joey>
<joey> we've got a pretty good, pretty big friend group </joey>
<joey> and unfortunately two people ended up sending him money. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, no. - And I saw </joey>
<joey> like the conversation chain, it was genuinely convincing </joey>
<joey> because it wasn't just a one message thing. </joey>
<joey> It was a genuine conversation chain. </joey>
<joey> - Just a really well-made bot, right? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, it was a really well-made bot </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm just like, Jesus Christ. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, I probably would have fallen for it as well. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause he's a good mate and like you- </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah and that's the thing, right, that's scary. </joey>
<garnt> Especially when it's coming from like a friend, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. - I dunno. </garnt>
<garnt> I feel in that situation, like I think the best thing </garnt>
<garnt> to do maybe is to like call them up, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> Just to like double-check, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Just to be like, sure. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I think that's what- - 'Cause it's very hard to, </garnt>
<joey> it's a little easier to fake a chat room </joey>
<garnt> than it is to fake a phone call, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> - I think if, you know, you did phone him before, </garnt>
<joey> then it would have been sorted out but sometimes, you know, </joey>
<joey> it was worded in a way where he just, he just needed it now. </joey>
<joey> - And again, that's the scary thing. </joey>
<joey> It's just getting as better and better. </joey>
<joey> - That's probably where having a Japanese bank account </joey>
<joey> would be an advantage because then you'd be like, </joey>
<joey> "Sorry, sorry man, I've got to like, </joey>
<joey> book an appointment for tomorrow" </joey>
<garnt> - "Can you wait a week, </garnt>
<joey> that's the next open slot on my bank?" </joey>
<connor> - "You know, the next quarter is in like </connor>
<joey> three months, that's the best I can do" </joey>
<connor> - "I can't get a statement </connor>
<garnt> until like three months from now, </garnt>
<joey> I'm sorry, you're gonna have to try someone else" </joey>
<joey> - "I'm sorry, man, I can't do internet banking transfer" </joey>
<joey> - "Do you accept Western Union?" </joey>
<joey> I can give you that. (laughter) </joey>
<joey> - Anyway, enough about scams, I'm going to hijack </joey>
<joey> this podcast for a moment and turn it back </joey>
<joey> into an anime podcast. - Oh, for fuck sakes. </joey>
<connor> - Because I just need to, okay? </connor>
<joey> - We don't watch anime. - Just let me have this. </joey>
<garnt> Let me have this Connor, let me have this 'cause- </garnt>
<joey> - I know exactly what you're going to talk about. </joey>
<garnt> (laughter) </garnt>
<garnt> - Of course you do. - I don't. </garnt>
<garnt> - Of course you do Joey, so this weekend, </garnt>
<garnt> I watched the new Evangelion movie. </garnt>
<garnt> - Ah, fuck sakes. (laughter) </garnt>
<garnt> - And I just, I need- - How did you not </garnt>
<joey> see this coming, Connor, he was literally </joey>
<garnt> tweeting about it all week. - I need to talk about this </garnt>
<garnt> because I need to move on with my life. </garnt>
<connor> - This man's tweeted about it, like he watched </connor>
<connor> like "13 Reasons Why" for the first time. </connor>
<joey> - I'm glad, though, you finally watched it because again, </joey>
<joey> I watched it on the day it came out in the cinemas, </joey>
<joey> which was like, </joey>
<joey> fucking six months ago or something. </joey>
<joey> It was a really, really long time ago and I was like, </joey>
<joey> "I want to talk about it so bad on the podcast, </joey>
<joey> but these two haven't seen it. </joey>
<joey> So I'm just going to like, </joey>
<garnt> I'm just going to bottle this emotion up, </garnt>
<garnt> now I can finally pop the bottle!" </garnt>
<joey> And talk about it. </joey>
<joey> - I watched it and I literally like, </joey>
<garnt> cannot move on with my life, like, I literally- </garnt>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<garnt> - It's like witnessing the death of a family member, </garnt>
<garnt> you know- - Honestly... </garnt>
<connor> - It's like actually mortifying. </connor>
<joey> I'm like, oh my God. - So good or bad? </joey>
<garnt> kind of death, like weird cousin </garnt>
<connor> that you didn't really like or? </connor>
<garnt> - I don't know how to like possibly </garnt>
<garnt> convey the feeling I felt but what I will say is that, </garnt>
<connor> I mean, like I shouldn't have just, I shouldn't have ever </connor>
<garnt> been a monk at all, right? that was like, </garnt>
<joey> that was a fucking scam 'cause if I wanted to feel Zen, </joey>
<joey> if I wanted to reach Nirvana, I should have </joey>
<joey> just been an Eva fan, right? </joey>
<joey> Because I felt more Zen </joey>
<joey> after the End of Eva, </joey>
<joey> after this end of Eva, </joey>
<joey> than I ever did as a monk. </joey>
<garnt> - Was it that good? - It was- </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like, it's the type of movie </garnt>
<garnt> that you can't just clean- - What is this? </garnt>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </joey>
<connor> - Let me explain. - It's a simple </connor>
<connor> fucking question. - Let me explain. </connor>
<joey> It's the type of movie that you can't just clean up </joey>
<joey> with the word good. - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Or bad. - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Because it's neither of those, it's just like- </joey>
<connor> - That sounds like it's mediocre. </connor>
<garnt> - No, it's definitely not. - It's definitely </garnt>
<garnt> not mediocre, - If it's anything, </garnt>
<joey> it's not mediocre, it is the polar opposite of mediocre. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. - I filled the MDB page. </connor>
<connor> The reviews were kinda- - All over the place? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah seven, eight, it's around about seven, eight. </connor>
<joey> - It's like, I think the only way I can describe </joey>
<joey> that last movie is- - Do you have </joey>
<connor> to have a very IQ to understand? </connor>
<garnt> - Do you have to what? - Honestly, yeah kinda. </garnt>
<connor> - You kinda do, actually. (laughter) </connor>
<connor> - I'm not even gonna like- </connor>
<connor> - That's why they called it-- </connor>
<garnt> - [All] 3.0+1.0 </garnt>
<garnt> - Which is like the most pretentious fucking title. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's very difficult to figure out that that's four. </garnt>
<joey> - If you can't perform rudimentary mathematics </joey>
<garnt> then you're just not even allowed. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause you watched the original Eva </garnt>
<joey> when it got released on Netflix, right? </joey>
<joey> - I did, I did. - What was your opinions of- </joey>
<connor> - The TV series? - At the time? </connor>
<connor> Yeah, he watched the TV series. </connor>
<connor> - Seven out of 10. </connor>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> it was fine, you know, </joey>
<joey> I understand why everyone is so hyped about it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, did you- - I just, </joey>
<joey> I could see why you'd watch this </joey>
<joey> and you would remember this. - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - But I didn't think it was that amazing. </connor>
<joey> - Right. - Yeah, I think like, </joey>
<joey> I think that's the common- - It leaves an impression. </joey>
<joey> I think I'll say that much, you know, and you can't, </joey>
<joey> you know, this isn't like the irregular high school, </joey>
<connor> whatever the fuck that one is where you're like, </connor>
<joey> I literally don't even know who you are </joey>
<joey> and I'm 20 episodes into this. </joey>
<joey> - It was four seasons of that shit as well, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - See what I mean, I didn't even know that. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, there's like a spinoff coming this season as well </joey>
<joey> and it's like, it's- - Well yeah, you know, </joey>
<joey> it's one of those shows that definitely was like, </joey>
<joey> I understand entirely why this is iconic </joey>
<joey> and everyone is in love with this. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. - I just personally </connor>
<connor> wasn't that into it. - Did you leave satisfied? </connor>
<connor> - No, not at all. - Okay, good, good. </connor>
<garnt> 'Cause I was like, 'cause that was my experience. </garnt>
<garnt> - That was the worst part, is the ending. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. - Let me ask you then, </garnt>
<joey> did you leave satisfied? - With the original Eva? </joey>
<joey> - No, no, with 4.0. - Oh, fuck yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I- - Like the TV series, though, </joey>
<connor> it was shit. - No, no, no. </connor>
<joey> The TV series left everyone unsatisfied. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, like I remember the first two times I watched Eva. </garnt>
<joey> I fucking hated it. - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Because the first time I watched it, </joey>
<joey> I was 12, of course I wasn't gonna- </joey>
<joey> - Of course (laughs) - Of course I was not going </joey>
<joey> to understand Eva when I was 12 </joey>
<connor> and then I re watched it. - Not enough IQ. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I re watched it to review it as an Annie tuber </connor>
<joey> and then I was just like this is even worse </joey>
<joey> than I remember it. - Right, right. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause now I now I'm actually invested </joey>
<garnt> in the characters and the world </garnt>
<joey> and the mysteries. - You actually understand it, </joey>
<garnt> sort of. - It felt like a slap </garnt>
<connor> in the face. - Oh yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Someone who spent all day watching it. </connor>
<joey> - Of course, what did I end up with? </joey>
<connor> Applause and congratulations, that's it. </connor>
<connor> Thanks. </connor>
<connor> (laughter) - Is this it? </connor>
<connor> This is it? - It's like the show </connor>
<connor> is mocking me being like, "Congratulations, </connor>
<joey> you sat through all of this for nothing" </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - So they could what? </joey>
<connor> Milk another 50 years out of this of movies? </connor>
<connor> - Hell yeah, dude. - Is that literally it? </connor>
<garnt> - Ano was five heading that shit. </garnt>
<joey> He was planning ahead. - He was fucking fiving </joey>
<garnt> and then I remember going on the internet fucking angry </garnt>
<joey> and I'm just like, </joey>
<connor> "Surely they can't be the ending" </connor>
<connor> and then people were just like, </connor>
<connor> "Yo, have you heard of this movie called- </connor>
<connor> - End of Eva. - End of Evangelion? </connor>
<connor> Which I'm- - As in, the end of it? </connor>
<connor> - Which is-- (laughter) </connor>
<connor> I mean, it is an end of Eva. </connor>
<garnt> Whether you are satisfied with- </garnt>
<connor> - Is that the alternative ending one? </connor>
<joey> - Yes. - It's alternative </joey>
<joey> but it's also cannon. - Yeah, so- </joey>
<garnt> - If that makes sense. - So kind of the history </garnt>
<garnt> behind the first two, </garnt>
<garnt> the TV series ending </garnt>
<garnt> is that as you could probably tell the studio just kind of </garnt>
<garnt> ran out of money and ran out of like budget. </garnt>
<garnt> So they had to like piece together something, right? </garnt>
<connor> And so that was the ending that you saw </connor>
<connor> and so either like either fans were so unsatisfied </connor>
<connor> that they sent Ano and the company death threats, </connor>
<connor> or Ano himself was so unsatisfied with the ending </connor>
<connor> that he decided to- - He was like, </connor>
<connor> let's just "(mumbles) call it a day. </connor>
<connor> Fans'll love it" - It's just art. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, let's make another ending to Eva </joey>
<joey> and that's the end of Evangellion </joey>
<joey> and people were just like, all right, I'm ready now. </joey>
<joey> This is the ending that we never got for Eva. </joey>
<joey> - It's on the title of the movie. </joey>
<garnt> - It's called End of Eva. - And it's not </garnt>
<connor> even the ending, right, that's what I understand. </connor>
<joey> - It's a ending. - It's definitely a ending </joey>
<garnt> but it definitely doesn't leave you satisfied. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, so what's the watch order of Evangellion? </garnt>
<connor> - One. - No, no, </connor>
<connor> TV show, then movies? - Ah, okay. </connor>
<joey> So 1.0 </joey>
<joey> is basically the first, </joey>
<connor> I'd say 15 episodes of the TV series. </connor>
<connor> - Right, there's an abridged movie. </connor>
<connor> - It's basically just like a Cliff Notes version </connor>
<connor> of the TV series and then 2.0 the first half of 2.0, </connor>
<joey> it approaches the original ending of the TV series </joey>
<joey> but then goes on a different route. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, that's fucking cheeky that. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, so he made- - And this aired in theaters? </connor>
<joey> - This aired in theaters. </joey>
<joey> - This cheeky fuck. </joey>
<joey> (out of camera laughter) </joey>
<joey> Made one third of a movie and called it a day? </joey>
<joey> - Pretty much, yeah. - Oh my God. </joey>
<joey> Maybe I should just make shit things </joey>
<joey> and re-release them again in future </joey>
<joey> and add another- - So basically, </joey>
<joey> the second half of 2.0 and you know, </joey>
<garnt> mind you, I don't fully remember everything </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause it was a while since I watched it but- </garnt>
<garnt> - I do, I do. - But I'm pretty sure- </garnt>
<joey> - You're talking to someone who literally knows every frame </joey>
<joey> of the first movie 'cause I fucking abridged it. </joey>
<connor> - Go on then, go on then. - So like one point it was </connor>
<joey> basically just almost a shot for shot recreation </joey>
<joey> of like the first four, five episodes and then- </joey>
<joey> - Oh, with cleaner art, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, cleaner art and minor, minor, minor differences </joey>
<joey> and then 2.0, like it's still like very, very similar </joey>
<joey> to like episodes, maybe like six to 18 ish. </joey>
<joey> - For fuck sake. - Yeah, I mean it goes, </joey>
<joey> it has other differences, it introduces a new character, </joey>
<joey> which is the girl glasses and it has other </joey>
<garnt> like-minded differences but for the most part, </garnt>
<garnt> it's pretty much the same and then- </garnt>
<garnt> - I feel like introducing a whole new character </garnt>
<connor> is not the same. - I mean- </connor>
<joey> - It's the same until you introduce the character. </joey>
<joey> - For fuck sakes. - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> It's the same until you introduce her and then 3.0 and 4.0, </garnt>
<connor> which I'm going to go, which I'm going to call 4.0, </connor>
<connor> because three plus one is four. </connor>
<connor> - What asshole would call it that? </connor>
<joey> (laughter) </joey>
<joey> - It's dumb. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it is dumb. - Why would they do that? </joey>
<joey> - It's an asshole called Anno Hideaki. </joey>
<joey> - For fuck sake. - 3.0 and 4.0 </joey>
<joey> are like completely different. </joey>
<joey> So it's like almost like a- - That's completely original. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - This feels </joey>
<connor> like the first time you walked into Starbucks </connor>
<connor> and realized it was not medium, small, large. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. (laughter) </connor>
<joey> - Why, why did you do this? - It's like, </joey>
<joey> which one's Venti, which ones like large? </joey>
<connor> - What is a Venti? - Wait. </connor>
<joey> Tall is medium? - I still don't know </joey>
<connor> what a fucking Venti is, I still don't understand. </connor>
<joey> - No, the part that fucked me up was like, </joey>
<joey> tall is not large. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Tall is medium. - Tall is medium. </garnt>
<joey> - I fucking hate this. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And I'm like, what is that, like giant? </joey>
<connor> - No, no, no, tall is small. - Tall is small. </connor>
<joey> - Grande is medium. - No, no, no, no. </joey>
<connor> Wait, it is? - Yeah, Grande is medium. </connor>
<garnt> Venti is large. - This is why I just </garnt>
<joey> liked the chart, I can see the price. </joey>
<joey> That's how I decide. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Anyway, sorry, go on back to the 4.0. </joey>
<joey> - Back to the 4.0, yeah. - Anyway, so 3.0 and 4.0 </joey>
<connor> are completely original. - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - So I watched, okay, so I watched 3.0 </joey>
<joey> on the day it came out in cinemas. </joey>
<joey> I was 16 when that came out. - Okay. </joey>
<joey> - So it was literally 10 years ago </joey>
<joey> and I've only seen it once. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So imagine me going to the cinemas day one, </joey>
<joey> airing 4.0 right now I'm like, </joey>
<joey> and I was like, "I got this" </joey>
<garnt> (laughter) </garnt>
<garnt> I still remember. - You don't got this. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't, I was like, "I don't got this" </garnt>
<garnt> because literally the first five minutes of 4.0, </garnt>
<garnt> it does a recap and I'm like, oh, thank God. </garnt>
<garnt> That's great because there's a 10 year gap, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - So it goes through </garnt>
<connor> like super fast, like super artistic way of just being like, </connor>
<connor> here's what happened in 1.0, here's what happened 2.0, </connor>
<connor> here's what happened 3.0, goes through 1.0 </connor>
<connor> I'm like, okay, yeah, this is just the TV series. </connor>
<joey> I've seen TV series many times, got it in the bag. </joey>
<connor> 2.0 it was like, okay, yep, still the TV series </connor>
<connor> but introduced the new character. </connor>
<joey> All right, cool, yeah, 3.0 I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> "I don't remember any of that shit, </joey>
<joey> what the fuck is going on?" </joey>
<joey> And then 4.0 just begins and I was like, "Cool" </joey>
<joey> So I'm literally going into this movie </joey>
<joey> with maybe about a 5% understanding of </joey>
<garnt> what has happened so far. - It's all good, man, </garnt>
<garnt> because I don't think that would've helped you at all </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> because the reason I didn't, I chose not to see it </garnt>
<garnt> in cinemas, right, was because obviously it wasn't subbed, </garnt>
<garnt> it was in Japanese. - Of course. </garnt>
<garnt> - With a series like Eva, I wanted to at least try </garnt>
<garnt> to understand what was going on. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I did remember what happened in 3.0. </garnt>
<garnt> So I was like, I remember most of the plot points, </garnt>
<garnt> so I'll be able to follow along easily. </garnt>
<garnt> So finally, I waited for it to come out and I was just like, </garnt>
<garnt> I should have just seen this in theaters </garnt>
<garnt> because I have as much of an understanding </garnt>
<garnt> of what's going on in my own language </garnt>
<garnt> than I do in a fucking other language </garnt>
<garnt> that I'm barely understanding. </garnt>
<joey> - For me 4.0 was like, "All right, cool. </joey>
<joey> That's a line, I understood what they were saying. </joey>
<joey> I think I'm starting to get it" </joey>
<joey> and then literally the next line I'm like, </joey>
<joey> "I don't know what's going on" </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> and I'm like, "this is a language I am fluent, </joey>
<joey> this is my first language that they're speaking. </joey>
<joey> It sounds like a different language" </joey>
<joey> There's is so much terminology and being thrown around, </joey>
<joey> which I'm sure there was some kind of explanation </joey>
<joey> of probably in 3.0 but of course, </joey>
<joey> I have a 10 year gap with 3.0. </joey>
<joey> I don't remember that shit. - The definitive way </joey>
<connor> to watch it is to watch 3.0 and immediately, </connor>
<connor> immediately start 4.0 - Probably. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't think it even matters because I doubt- </garnt>
<connor> - You're not gonna remember it. </connor>
<connor> I doubt a lot of people are going to be able to follow along </connor>
<connor> in the first watch through anywhere </connor>
<connor> because so much terminology gets fucking thrown around </connor>
<garnt> and gets like pulled out of his ass like, </garnt>
<garnt> some of the scenes I'm just like "Anno, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know if you're a genius or a madman" like- </garnt>
<joey> - Oh yeah and then here's the more fucked up thing </joey>
<joey> that I realized, if there's anything I got out of 4.0, </joey>
<connor> it's the fact that there's literally information in 4.0, </connor>
<connor> you will have no idea what the fuck it is </connor>
<connor> unless you read the manga. - For fuck sake. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. - It's like, </connor>
<connor> Anno literally took every iteration. </connor>
<connor> It was like, it took bits from the TV series, </connor>
<connor> it took bits from End of Eva, even a little bit </connor>
<connor> from Death and Rebirth and the manga </connor>
<connor> and just combined it all together. </connor>
<connor> So it's like- - What's Death and Rebirth? </connor>
<connor> - That's the other movie. (laughter) </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's just basically a recap movie. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh, for fuck sakes. - It's a recap movie </joey>
<garnt> but there's like, </garnt>
<garnt> small minor details in "Death and Rebirth" </garnt>
<joey> that are only specific to "Death and Rebirth" </joey>
<garnt> - But like, I've like, for someone like you, </garnt>
<joey> I wouldn't even recommend watching it. </joey>
<joey> - I'm exhausted hearing this. - You don't have to </joey>
<garnt> watch Death and Rebirth. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean- - If you've watched two, </garnt>
<garnt> three and four? - Yeah, I mean, if- </garnt>
<garnt> - And End of Eva. - If you feel like it </garnt>
<garnt> because- - Do I really? </garnt>
<garnt> Do I really have to watch End of Eva? </garnt>
<connor> - I think no. - End of Eva is- </connor>
<garnt> - Like, if you're wanting to get into End of Eva, </garnt>
<joey> get into Evangellion as a franchise, then yeah, </joey>
<joey> you need to watch End of Eva but like, I mean, </joey>
<joey> it depends on what you're looking for. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause if you're just looking for like a normal TV series, </joey>
<joey> a normal story to get like entertained, so much so where, </joey>
<joey> you know, you're like, you're looking </joey>
<joey> for like a normal plot arc, you're looking for mysteries </joey>
<joey> to be solved, that's just not going to happen, </joey>
<joey> as you've just experienced once. </joey>
<joey> I think what's so special about Eva is that it's a series </joey>
<joey> that's just so powerful that if you kind of relate </joey>
<joey> to what Anno was trying to portray on screen, </joey>
<joey> like you said yourself, you could tell why a lot of people </joey>
<joey> thought this, like a lot of people saw this </joey>
<joey> as like a really powerful series that affected them, right? </joey>
<joey> And it's just, 'cause it is just that raw and powerful </joey>
<joey> because Eva to me, Eva, like I didn't get Eva </joey>
<joey> the first few times I watched it. </joey>
<joey> Like I said, I was like, I hated that </joey>
<joey> and then like I reached later elite, </joey>
<joey> I reached a period in life later where I started </joey>
<joey> to like fucking resonate more </joey>
<joey> with what was being portrayed </joey>
<joey> on screen, I wouldn't say I understood the entire plot, </joey>
<joey> but I don't think that's the point of it. </joey>
<joey> I don't think the point of Eva is to understand the plot. </joey>
<joey> I don't think the point of Eva is to like, you know, </joey>
<joey> you can't just look at the shiny robots </joey>
<joey> fighting the big monsters if you want but I think, </joey>
<joey> I think the true magic of Eva was just Anno </joey>
<joey> pouring his heart out on screen and capturing like </joey>
<joey> kind of like capturing his psyche in a sense </joey>
<joey> and that's why it's like that's why you can view it </joey>
<joey> and this, and you can just be like, </joey>
<joey> "I don't get it, this is a complete mind fuck" </joey>
<garnt> which it is. </garnt>
<garnt> It is an absolute mind fuck. - Yeah, I truly think it is. </garnt>
<garnt> Especially with 4.0, I truly think the only person </garnt>
<joey> on the planet who can fully understand 4.0 </joey>
<joey> and all of Eva is Anno because- </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, probably working on the movie, </connor>
<joey> they were like, what is- - No, I guarantee it. </joey>
<connor> - I guarantee it. - Because 4.0, </connor>
<connor> I feel, especially 4.0 is like a true, </connor>
<connor> not only is it like a true love letter to Eva </connor>
<connor> but there's so much stuff that Anno just crammed into it </connor>
<connor> that really has nothing to do with Eva. </connor>
<garnt> It's literally like, he just threw it in because he likes it </garnt>
<garnt> and I feel that's what Eva is. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, it's literally a series that Anno was like, </garnt>
<garnt> "I like robots, I like monsters, I like Kaiju fights. </garnt>
<garnt> I love all of this shit that I personally enjoy. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm going to cram this shit into one series </garnt>
<joey> and that's Eva" </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah 'cause like, you like you like BoJack, right? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I still haven't watched the last season. </connor>
<connor> I'm too scared. - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> 'Cause I feel like BoJack is probably the closest kinda </garnt>
<joey> like closest big American show that I can compare to Eva. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause both deal with like- - BoJack is the Eva </joey>
<connor> of cartoons. - "Get in the robot, BoJack" </connor>
<garnt> - It is kinda, it's such a weird comparison but that is- </garnt>
<garnt> - BoJack is Shinji. (laughter) </garnt>
<connor> - I mean BoJack was like, I guess BoJack was very clear </connor>
<joey> in what it was trying to portray. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Right. </joey>
<joey> - I guess I was slightly confused many times during Eva. </joey>
<connor> I'm like, am I supposed to feel sorry for Shinji? </connor>
<joey> - Well, that's an entire character study </joey>
<joey> in and of itself. - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> Because both are the kind of same, </garnt>
<joey> well they tried to tackle, they try </joey>
<garnt> to tackle broken characters trying to just find value </garnt>
<garnt> in themselves and just live with themselves, right? </garnt>
<garnt> That's what both series tried to do. </garnt>
<garnt> BoJack has a much more structured, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> much more structured story, much more defined character arcs </garnt>
<garnt> and it's just easier to follow. </garnt>
<joey> - And much less technical bullshit. </joey>
<connor> - I felt like, you know, in BoJack, </connor>
<joey> you got to like, see why he was so fucked up </joey>
<joey> and I felt like in Evangelion, </joey>
<connor> we didn't really learn much about Shinji. </connor>
<connor> He was just whining. - I mean, </connor>
<joey> I definitely feel like, I mean, </joey>
<joey> I think the finer details are there if, </joey>
<joey> for people who want to look into it deeper </joey>
<joey> but I feel especially the movies do a really good job </joey>
<joey> in portraying Shinji as this like broken kid. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah because I mean, he's a 14 year old kid </garnt>
<garnt> who has like massive daddy issues </garnt>
<garnt> because his dad's an absolute fucking asshole. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. - Never grew up with his mum, </connor>
<connor> is forced to pilot a fucking giant robot the age of 14 </connor>
<connor> and has to save the world. - I don't know why he's sad </connor>
<garnt> about this, this is amazing. - I mean- </garnt>
<connor> - 14 year old me would have killed </connor>
<connor> for the option to- - I mean, I'm not going to, </connor>
<joey> obviously not going to say any spoils for 4.0 </joey>
<joey> but especially in 4.0, his dad is fucked. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, he's like, I didn't think his dad </garnt>
<garnt> could get even more fucked. - 4.0 it goes from like one </garnt>
<joey> to a hundred, I'm like, you can not be serious. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah but I think the reason Eva </garnt>
<garnt> is such an important series to so many people, </garnt>
<garnt> including myself, is that it just hits these emotional notes </garnt>
<garnt> that I've just never seen in any other piece of media </garnt>
<garnt> and I just, I think that's </garnt>
<joey> because Anno didn't give a shit </joey>
<joey> about telling a, you know, a story that was easy to follow. </joey>
<joey> He just wanted to like, put something out there. </joey>
<joey> He just wanted to put his emotions into something. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - And that's what I feel </joey>
<joey> from him and that's why it's so like, to so many people, </joey>
<joey> this is such an important thing </joey>
<joey> because it's rare that you see something </joey>
<garnt> that isn't like, that isn't so well-defined </garnt>
<garnt> but that you can relate to on an, </garnt>
<joey> in an emotional sense. - It's almost not storytelling </joey>
<joey> like Anno's not really storytelling </joey>
<joey> as he is almost just emoting. - I really can't describe Eva </joey>
<joey> without sounding like that pretentious dick head, right? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I hear myself and I'm just like, </joey>
<connor> it's kind of just off. - Well you know, I mean- </connor>
<connor> - What a wanker. (laughter) </connor>
<connor> - It's one of those things where I think I definitely </connor>
<joey> with TV shows and media, as opposed to traditional art, </joey>
<joey> I very much prefer it when they essentially tell me- </joey>
<connor> - Tell you, yeah. - What trying to get across. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, of course. - And as much as you </garnt>
<garnt> could argue, okay, well, that's for dumb people and whatnot </garnt>
<garnt> and it's like also like, well, you know, </garnt>
<joey> I feel that if it is art, I suppose it can be </joey>
<connor> but then also sometimes it isn't marketed as such, you know, </connor>
<connor> like when you look at a painting, </connor>
<connor> there's no doubt in your mind that it's art </connor>
<connor> and you can interpret it however you want </connor>
<connor> and you get whatever you want out of it </connor>
<joey> but I think with TV shows, because it's </joey>
<joey> such a different medium it's, you know, </joey>
<connor> what is art supposed to be when it's TV and film? </connor>
<joey> - But I would argue that some of the best shows are the ones </joey>
<joey> that can present an artistic idea in an artistic way </joey>
<joey> but make it simple enough for anyone to enjoy, right? </joey>
<joey> Like I feel that's like really good storytelling. </joey>
<joey> - Well, that's where I think BoJack Horseman is amazing. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, I agree. - BoJack Horseman- </joey>
<joey> - I felt like it delivered a topic </joey>
<connor> that I think a lot of people and a lot </connor>
<connor> of older people don't really think about or care about. </connor>
<connor> - Don't talk about. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> And I think like I'm not bringing down BoJack. </connor>
<joey> 'Cause I also think it's an amazing fucking show. </joey>
<joey> I just think like Evangellion was, </joey>
<joey> is so unique because you know, </joey>
<joey> if there's one thing that doesn't make fucking sense </joey>
<joey> or you can't logically always follow its emotions, right? </joey>
<joey> Sometimes you just feel something and you just like, </joey>
<joey> "Why the fuck, why do I feel this? </joey>
<joey> Like, I just logically don't know why I feel this </joey>
<joey> and I shouldn't feel this" - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And like, that's what Eva portrays so well. </joey>
<joey> It's not meant to be logical in a lot of senses </joey>
<joey> but sometimes you just see something, I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> "I don't know why I kind of relate to this </joey>
<joey> but I just do. </joey>
<joey> I don't know why I resonate with this </joey>
<joey> but I just do" </joey>
<joey> and that's been my experience with Eva </joey>
<joey> and I guess the biggest thing that I never got from Eva </joey>
<joey> was the satisfying conclusion of like closure. </joey>
<joey> Like this is it. - An actual ending. </joey>
<joey> - Like this is it, I am satisfied because you know, </joey>
<joey> I kind of, you know, as an Eva fan </joey>
<joey> you find your own fucking closure. </joey>
<joey> You've watched End of Eva and you're like, </joey>
<joey> "What the fuck did I just watch? </joey>
<joey> I need someone--" sometimes you need someone </joey>
<joey> to help you process what you just watched. </joey>
<joey> and like, </joey>
<joey> you know, that sometimes you spend hours reading up analysis </joey>
<garnt> and reading up this and reading up that </garnt>
<joey> and you're just like- - End of Eva </joey>
<joey> is one of those movies where like, </joey>
<joey> you watch it and you go, "That was awesome" </joey>
<joey> but then the moment your brain actually kicks in </joey>
<joey> and goes, "But do you know what it was about?" </joey>
<joey> That's the one, that's the moment where you have </joey>
<connor> like the existential dread, like, "Wait, </connor>
<joey> maybe it wasn't good, what was it about?" </joey>
<joey> - Why do you think I didn't enjoy </joey>
<connor> or connect with Evangellion, do you reckon </connor>
<joey> there was a reason why? - I feel maybe </joey>
<connor> it's because you were kind of over-hyped </connor>
<connor> from like the outside, I think maybe- </connor>
<garnt> - That's possible. - What were your expectations </garnt>
<garnt> coming in? - Something deep. </garnt>
<connor> - Maybe that's what it is, right? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, something impactful. - Because Eva is like, </joey>
<joey> Eva is simultaneously the deepest thing </joey>
<joey> but also at the same time, something that doesn't </joey>
<joey> make any fucking sense. - I mean, </joey>
<garnt> it's not something you watch </garnt>
<garnt> to per se enjoy because I remember like, </garnt>
<garnt> the only times I've actually, like, </garnt>
<garnt> I actually kind of understood Eva really depended </garnt>
<garnt> on what mindset I was in, I couldn't just- </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I thought, I was under the impression </connor>
<connor> that it was going to be some form of interesting take </connor>
<connor> on like being a teenager and struggling </connor>
<connor> with mental health issues. - It was. </connor>
<joey> I mean, to a certain point. - I mean, it is. </joey>
<connor> It's just not told in a way that is just traditional. </connor>
<connor> You know, it's told a very raw way, </connor>
<connor> where it's just, they don't care about you </connor>
<connor> following the story, they just wanted to like </connor>
<connor> put these raw thoughts and raw emotions, put it on screen </connor>
<joey> and then just like, just put it out there and that's what, </joey>
<connor> like, that's what I got from Eva, which is why like the, </connor>
<connor> the time that I connected with Eva the most just happened </connor>
<joey> to be the points when I was in the worst point in my life. </joey>
<joey> It's, you know, it's just something </joey>
<joey> where it's not something I think people </joey>
<joey> should watch to enjoy, I think people should watch it </joey>
<joey> to experience it and maybe you didn't enjoy this time. </joey>
<garnt> I didn't enjoy the first time I watched it </garnt>
<garnt> but maybe there would be a point when you're just like, </garnt>
<garnt> where some of the words or something from it rang out to you </garnt>
<garnt> and just like, maybe this is the time- </garnt>
<garnt> - Garnt, are you saying that Eva </garnt>
<joey> is an acquired taste? (laughter) </joey>
<garnt> - No Joey, stop putting words in my mouth. </garnt>
<garnt> And what I will say about End of Eva 4.0, </garnt>
<garnt> without spoiling what happens. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I'm not, I'm not going to spoil it. </garnt>
<garnt> That explains the only thing I will kind of say </garnt>
<garnt> is that it is a conclusive full stop </garnt>
<garnt> and I remember because growing up, I can't like, I don't, </garnt>
<joey> I don't know how to convey to you what it's like growing up </joey>
<joey> with a franchise and being like, this has got, </joey>
<joey> this franchise is going to be around forever. </joey>
<joey> There is never going to be an end for this franchise </joey>
<joey> and you kind of make peace with that, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah - 'Cause I remember </joey>
<joey> when the movie got released, I think I remember </joey>
<joey> we were meeting up to be like, "Oh, </joey>
<joey> I can't wait for 5.0, in my 20 years, can't wait for, </joey>
<joey> I know to like dig up the grave of Eva" </joey>
<joey> And I remember like, </joey>
<joey> I talked to plenty of Japanese people who were just like, </joey>
<joey> no, "This is the end" I was like, "Sure, sure" </joey>
<joey> Yeah, Joey goes sees it, Nabo goes sees it </joey>
<joey> and they're like, "This is the end" </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "Sure, all right, bet" </joey>
<joey> - It's literally, you won't believe it until you see it. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, it is, it is and then- </connor>
<connor> - I'll watch the movies. - I mean, you can, </connor>
<garnt> I like, I'm not like, I have like. </garnt>
<connor> - I've decided, I'm going to watch them. </connor>
<garnt> - You're going to watch them? - You have decided? </garnt>
<joey> - I'll watch the movie. - Where? </joey>
<joey> I think all four movies are on Prime Video. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, Netflix and all of End of Eva, </garnt>
<joey> all of Evangelion the original series is on Netflix </joey>
<joey> and all of the movies are on Prime Video. </joey>
<garnt> of all four of the movies. - [Connor] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Just because like, why not, 'cause like, again, </garnt>
<connor> I've only seen 3.0 and 4.0 once </connor>
<connor> and I'm like- - What, like on Stream? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, on Stream. - Oh, what, you press play? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah 'cause like Twitch has a thing for that. </connor>
<connor> - I might do that. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - There's a thing for that now? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, there's a thing for that now. </connor>
<connor> - Wait, what? - Like a watch party function. </connor>
<connor> - What's that like? - So basically, </connor>
<connor> it's like the Twitch thing, I think this </connor>
<connor> is a relatively new thing but basically, </connor>
<connor> when you do a watch party together now, </connor>
<joey> when you go to that person's Twitch page, </joey>
<joey> the person streaming is actually in the corner now </joey>
<joey> and you get prompted to log into your Prime Video </joey>
<joey> or Netflix. - Oh shit. </joey>
<joey> - And it like, and it syncs up. </joey>
<joey> - What? - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Dude! - And it's like, </joey>
<garnt> a brand new thing now, yeah, my Twitch partner- </garnt>
<joey> - You can online stream now? - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - No fucking joke. - That's a game changer. </connor>
<connor> - Holy- - I can work </connor>
<joey> and watch Netflix? - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> So my Twitch partner was like, oh, </joey>
<joey> since all the Eva movies are on Prime Video </joey>
<connor> and Twitch has this new thing now, </connor>
<connor> you can easily do a watch party. </connor>
<joey> - I'm like, oh fuck yeah, dude, let's do it. </joey>
<connor> - Jeff Bezos owns that too, he owns all of these. </connor>
<garnt> Oh my God. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> But of course, on Amazon Prime. </connor>
<connor> - So now you can- - Now, now- </connor>
<connor> - Now you can cry on Stream. - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. - Or get very confused. </garnt>
<joey> - Honestly, okay, so I got to ask you, </joey>
<joey> what was your reaction when- </joey>
<joey> - All right, I'm out. </joey>
<joey> - All right, when, okay, okay- </joey>
<joey> - Obviously, no spoilers in this episode, obviously. </joey>
<joey> - No, no, no, I just want to know what your, </joey>
<joey> I just want to know what your reaction was- </joey>
<joey> - Yes, your reaction. - When the credits </joey>
<joey> started rolling. - When the credits </joey>
<joey> started rolling? - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> I'm sorry Connor, I just need- </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no, no. - I just need to gush. </garnt>
<garnt> I just need to gush. - I've literally never, </garnt>
<garnt> I think that might be the first time in my life </garnt>
<connor> where the term dumb founded is like actually eligible </connor>
<connor> because like, I think if you had, </connor>
<joey> if I had seen myself in the cinemas, right? </joey>
<joey> I probably would have made a face like... </joey>
<joey> For the entire credits just because because my brain, </joey>
<joey> I don't think could process what the fuck I just watched </joey>
<joey> and like, because I went to go see it with Ken </joey>
<joey> who was on the show, right and he was obviously, you know, </joey>
<joey> during the credit sequence, he was just like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, I know that anime, I've had that" </joey>
<joey> Meanwhile like what Ken was saying was just going in one ear </joey>
<joey> and out the other. - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - 'Cause I was like, "Ken, don't give me more information. </connor>
<connor> I'm still trying to process everything I literally </connor>
<connor> just watched" and yeah, I dunno. </connor>
<joey> Like it was, I think the best way to describe 4.0 </joey>
<joey> for me was it was very bittersweet. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Because it's like you, </joey>
<joey> it's not until really those credits end </joey>
<joey> and you walk out of the cinemas that you realize, oh, </joey>
<joey> this is really it. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like there isn't gonna be another movie anymore, I mean, </joey>
<joey> maybe there will be, maybe there'll be a spin off </joey>
<garnt> or something, I don't know. - This story has ended, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, this movie franchise has ended. </garnt>
<garnt> Like something I fucking grew up with my whole life. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. - And like, I dunno, </joey>
<joey> I was like, "Is this how I'm going to feel </joey>
<joey> when like One Piece ends?" or like- </joey>
<connor> - That's how I felt when Arthur got canceled. </connor>
<garnt> (laughter) </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't, I don't even want to- </garnt>
<connor> - I can't believe they canceled Arthur. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Arthur got canceled? </connor>
<connor> - Arthur got canceled? - Arthur got canceled. </connor>
<garnt> - Arthur got canceled? - Arthur got canceled. </garnt>
<connor> - When? - Like right after the episode </connor>
<joey> where I said "Arthur will never be canceled" </joey>
<joey> - Are you serious? (laughter) </joey>
<joey> - Yes (laughs) </joey>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </joey>
<connor> - It literally got canceled. - Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> - I just assumed Arthur was going to be there </connor>
<joey> when I had like grandchildren children. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, right, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Fuck man. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> So like, I dunno, like I feel this is how, </connor>
<connor> because I've obviously never experienced </connor>
<joey> like a show I grew up with, like a big, big franchise </joey>
<joey> like that to just end in my lifetime, right? </joey>
<joey> Like I feel this is how it's going to be </joey>
<joey> when like One Piece, or like Jojo or like- </joey>
<garnt> - I don't even want to imagine when One Piece </garnt>
<garnt> and Jojo ends. - Yeah, right? </garnt>
<joey> - Holy fuck. - Like I feel that emotion </joey>
<joey> that I felt at the end of 4.0 is how I'm going to feel </joey>
<joey> and it's not a great feeling. - It was like, </joey>
<garnt> 'cause it's rare enough that I watch something </garnt>
<connor> and I feel something I've never felt before, </connor>
<joey> which is exactly what I felt because this </joey>
<joey> is something I grew up with, something I always thought </joey>
<garnt> would be there, right and then it's just like, </garnt>
<joey> it's just over. - And really does feel </joey>
<joey> like a family pet has just died. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. - You know? </joey>
<garnt> It's like, it's something that, it really is, </garnt>
<joey> it's like, it's honestly, it's that same emotion. </joey>
<joey> - Honestly, I started fucking bawling man </joey>
<joey> 'cause like, here's the thing, I wasn't even hyped for 4.0. </joey>
<joey> Right 'cause like nine years had passed since the fast, </joey>
<joey> since the last week and I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> whatever, it's out, I'll watch it out of obligation. </joey>
<joey> I love Eva but I don't, I could go my entire life </joey>
<joey> without watching another Evangelion movie </joey>
<joey> and I would have been completely satisfied. </joey>
<joey> So I watched it literally out of obligation and then like, </joey>
<joey> I think the last half hour hit and I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh my God, what is this I'm feeling right now? </joey>
<joey> Is this a feeling of closure, am I closing a page </joey>
<joey> in my life right now?" I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> "What is this feeling?" - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And then the end credits, felt like the end credits </joey>
<joey> started rolling and I just, process is the right word </joey>
<joey> because there are so many emotions coming up at once </joey>
<joey> that I just, I didn't know how to process them all </joey>
<joey> and you just felt empty and you just felt like, </joey>
<joey> I felt like a fucking void in my life and I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> there's nothing that's going to fill this hole up anymore. </joey>
<joey> That's why I need to talk about it. </joey>
<garnt> That's why I'm so desperate to, because- </garnt>
<connor> - Because I remember as well, like when the first posters </connor>
<connor> for 4.0 released in Japan, the tagline for it </connor>
<connor> was (speaking Japanese) which means goodbye Evangelion </connor>
<joey> and I was like, okay, that's kind of a cool, very, you know- </joey>
<joey> like very like artistic, like kind of tagline. </joey>
<joey> I didn't think anything of it, right? </joey>
<joey> But then when they said that line in the movie </joey>
<joey> at a particular scene, I was like, </joey>
<joey> "No, </joey>
<joey> don't do this to me man, don't leave me!" </joey>
<joey> - "I'm sorry, I should have treated you better" </joey>
<joey> - "I should have treated you better. </joey>
<joey> I should have treated you more, more, right. </joey>
<joey> Don't leave me, not now" </joey>
<joey> and like that was the moment </joey>
<connor> where I was like, oh, okay like this, </connor>
<connor> that point I think really solidified to me </connor>
<joey> how important this series was to me. </joey>
<garnt> - I'd forgotten it was until that moment </garnt>
<garnt> and like, I've been doing ever since, </garnt>
<connor> I've ever since that movie I could, </connor>
<connor> I've not been able to watch anything else. </connor>
<connor> I've not been able to play any games. </connor>
<garnt> I just feel like the emptiness. </garnt>
<joey> - You literally can't consume any other media </joey>
<joey> for at least a week. - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> 'Cause like I tried to and I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "This ain't Eva, what's the point?" </garnt>
<joey> - That's why I'm really scared to rewatch it. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. - I tried playing League. </connor>
<connor> Lost, I'm just like, "Don't care" </connor>
<connor> - Is that how it should all be ending? </connor>
<connor> - I was just like, nothing's going to fill this void. </connor>
<joey> - It's like that moment after you cum. </joey>
<joey> You just don't feel anything, you just sit there like, </joey>
<joey> no emotion. - I think I've just </joey>
<joey> reached Zen, like I feel like I've reached enlightenment. </joey>
<joey> Like fuck being a monk, man, like is this </joey>
<garnt> what it feels like, you just like an open book </garnt>
<garnt> and you just like, I finally- - Who would have thought </garnt>
<joey> you could become a monk with a 6.99 membership. </joey>
<garnt> - I'm finally at peace with my life and now I just want </garnt>
<garnt> to get the hell this on, I just want to move on now. </garnt>
<joey> - So for anyone watching this who's never seen Eva, </joey>
<garnt> we're not coming onto here saying that we recommend you </garnt>
<garnt> to watch Eva, it's hard to recommend- </garnt>
<garnt> - It's hard to recommend now because you're not </garnt>
<joey> going to have the same experience </joey>
<joey> that we had where you just like, </joey>
<connor> where you grew up with this, so, and you know, like I said, </connor>
<connor> if you're someone who's going in a tough time in your life, </connor>
<garnt> then I honestly recommend you experience it </garnt>
<garnt> because maybe it will teach you something about yourself. </garnt>
<garnt> - I was gonna say, I was like, </garnt>
<connor> you know, if you haven't had any struggles </connor>
<connor> with mental health, is it hard </connor>
<connor> to appreciate stuff like that? </connor>
<garnt> - I think so. - I think so. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because like after I watched Eva, </garnt>
<garnt> I've like, I've just been binge-watching </garnt>
<joey> so many like Eva analysis videos but like- </joey>
<joey> - I'm the same. - Which is like, </joey>
<garnt> I guess like my way of coping. </garnt>
<joey> - I think Ken and I had about a six hour conversation </joey>
<garnt> and Hezekiah about just the movie we just watched, </garnt>
<joey> the entire time. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah and I think the video </garnt>
<garnt> that I like related to the most in terms of what I felt </garnt>
<garnt> when I watched the first time was- </garnt>
<joey> - Was Eva abridged. - No no, no, no. </joey>
<joey> Scamboni Reviews </joey>
<joey> did a video called "You Don't Understand Eva" </joey>
<joey> right? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - In like sarcastic text, you know, </joey>
<connor> where he basically broke down why Eva is like, </connor>
<connor> basically a really badly told plot. </connor>
<connor> Like he basically broke it down </connor>
<connor> in a way where I completely agreed with him. </connor>
<joey> I would've completely agreed with them. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause that was basically what I was trying to say </joey>
<joey> when I had watched first time because I just didn't resonate </joey>
<garnt> or relate to anything that was trying to say. </garnt>
<connor> - No, me neither, you know, I didn't really feel sorry </connor>
<joey> for Shinji at all, I felt like I was supposed to. </joey>
<joey> - That's the thing, the emotions were there </joey>
<garnt> but the execution was not there. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, like, I don't think like you were even supposed </joey>
<joey> to feel sorry for him, right because yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> like either you do feel sorry for him </joey>
<joey> or you don't, like a lot of people would do </joey>
<joey> because a lot of people relate to that kind of mental space. </joey>
<joey> Right that they can resonate with that </joey>
<garnt> but like the series doesn't explicitly tell you, </garnt>
<garnt> you should feel sorry for this person, this person is this, </garnt>
<garnt> it's just, that's kind of like, </garnt>
<garnt> that's kind of like the thing that maybe like not, </garnt>
<garnt> not everyone will enjoy Eva, not everyone should enjoy it. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, I wouldn't recommend it to someone </garnt>
<garnt> in a very healthy mental state because one, </garnt>
<connor> you probably wouldn't get it and two, </connor>
<garnt> I wouldn't wish for you to be in a bad mental state </garnt>
<garnt> to begin with to get it, right, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - I mean, you know, BoJack, I thought was great </connor>
<connor> 'cause I wasn't depressed watching it </connor>
<connor> but I certainly was after. - Well, yeah, </connor>
<joey> I mean like things like BoJack and like, you know, </joey>
<joey> we related Eva to BoJack but I think like something </joey>
<joey> like Oyasumi PunPun. is probably closer </joey>
<joey> in terms of like actually, you know, </joey>
<joey> presenting a very sad story in a way that can get anyone </joey>
<joey> of any mental state invested in the story of BoJack, right? </joey>
<joey> Like, you know, BoJack in that case was told </joey>
<joey> in a very like straightforward, </joey>
<joey> like here's the thing that's fucked up. </joey>
<joey> You know, this is why you should feel sorry </joey>
<connor> and for most people, they felt sorry. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] It was very easily presented. </connor>
<connor> - It was, yeah, easily presented but like, </connor>
<connor> I feel Eva in that sense is almost so vague </connor>
<connor> with what they want the viewer to feel. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - To the point </connor>
<joey> where it's like, here are the emotions </joey>
<joey> that you should be feeling but we're not going to tell you </joey>
<joey> to feel those emotions specifically. </joey>
<joey> That's up to you to decide. - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Kind of thing. - Like, I don't trust anyone </garnt>
<garnt> who says they understand Eva, like you can spend all like- </garnt>
<connor> - It just sounds like you can have an interpretation </connor>
<garnt> of Eva. - You can </garnt>
<garnt> have an interpretation of Eva. - Oh, there's many, </garnt>
<connor> many interpretations. - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But to claim to understand Eva I feel like is just, </connor>
<connor> I don't, I honestly don't think it's possible </connor>
<joey> and I'm sure there are some Eva fans that are out there </joey>
<joey> that are just like, I can't believe he said that. </joey>
<joey> - Um, actually. (laughter) </joey>
<joey> - But like I've spent so many fucking hours </joey>
<joey> watching different people analyze it, </joey>
<joey> different people's interpretation but like, </joey>
<joey> there are so many different interpretations of the series </joey>
<joey> to begin with that I just think that's the thing, right? </joey>
<joey> There's a reason why we are still discussing it </joey>
<joey> to this day 26 years later. - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - And I think it'll always be discussed. </garnt>
<joey> - I remember, it was a couple of years ago, </joey>
<joey> I think like when we were still in the rush </joey>
<joey> of all these people, you know, </joey>
<joey> just analyzing every single piece of imagery </joey>
<joey> from the TV series, right and one that got discussed a lot </joey>
<joey> was when the angels explode, they create an explosion </joey>
<joey> that looks like a cross. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And there was, I watched so many analysis videos </joey>
<joey> being like, this is why Anno chose the cross </joey>
<joey> and why it's super symbolic and blah, blah, blah </joey>
<joey> and then a couple of years later, </joey>
<joey> they came out with an interview with Anno </joey>
<joey> and they were asking, "So is there any reason </joey>
<joey> why when the angels explodes, it turns into a cross?" </joey>
<joey> And he literally just said, </joey>
<joey> "I just think it looks cool" </joey>
<joey> (laughter) </joey>
<joey> It doesn't mean anything and all the anime YouTubers </joey>
<joey> were like, "We spent all this time analyzing something </joey>
<joey> that you just put in because it looks cool?" </joey>
<garnt> And I feel like that alone to me really showed the fact </garnt>
<joey> that Anno doesn't think this shit is deep. </joey>
<connor> He just put it in because it's cool. </connor>
<connor> - Also, if you're saying that you didn't have time or money </connor>
<joey> to make a proper ending- - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - What's the odds that he had the time </joey>
<joey> to be able to be like, no, no, no change the explosion </joey>
<joey> to a cross. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> Like this is why you should do this </connor>
<connor> because it's symbolic to the story. </connor>
<connor> No, because it's just a love letter </connor>
<connor> to all the shit Ano likes, he's like, </connor>
<joey> I think the cross looks cool, let's add that shit in. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, at the same time, </garnt>
<garnt> I would say that maybe he didn't make a conscious choice. </garnt>
<joey> He put stuff in just because it felt right. </joey>
<joey> It looked right and it created a certain tone, </joey>
<joey> a certain mood, whatever. - Especially in 4.0. </joey>
<joey> - And you can analyze that but to say that everything </joey>
<joey> had a purpose and everything was put there for a reason, </joey>
<garnt> I think, no, no, not everything in Eva, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't think Anno knew everything </garnt>
<garnt> that he knew what he wanted to say in Eva. </garnt>
<joey> - I think especially in 4.0 as well, </joey>
<joey> there was so much shit in there, I'm like, </joey>
<garnt> that doesn't make any sense, why is that there? </garnt>
<garnt> Oh, fuck it, you know what is on there? </garnt>
<joey> Just let him do what he wants to do. </joey>
<joey> Yeah. - Well, I guess </joey>
<connor> like moving on from like Eva as a franchise, </connor>
<connor> we can like tag you back in now, Connor. </connor>
<joey> We can tag you back in. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> Like, has it been any other </joey>
<joey> like points or like series or franchise </joey>
<joey> where you've kind of like grown up with </joey>
<joey> that franchise and you've had like, </joey>
<joey> you've seen the franchise come back years and years later </joey>
<joey> and you view it differently as an adult, </joey>
<joey> as opposed to when you saw it as a kid? </joey>
<joey> - Aw, geeze. - 'Cause I remember </joey>
<joey> the first time it happened to me was, </joey>
<connor> I remember when Toy Story 3 got released. </connor>
<connor> - I was literally thinking Toy Story 3 </connor>
<joey> when you said that. - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I feel that's the only thing </garnt>
<joey> that's like stuck around, right? </joey>
<garnt> - I think there's been two, there's been Toy Story three </garnt>
<garnt> and American Pie Reunion. - Right. </garnt>
<joey> (laughter) </joey>
<garnt> - What, what? - I can't relate </garnt>
<joey> to the latter, unfortunately. - I think that American Pie </joey>
<garnt> was like, 'cause like when American, </garnt>
<garnt> when American Pie one and two got released, </garnt>
<garnt> it was fucking massive during, not even like my generations, </garnt>
<garnt> but I think like I already saw American Pie </garnt>
<connor> because it was like my older cousins' generation </connor>
<connor> and they would like put it on TV and I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> "There's fucking boobs, </connor>
<connor> what the fuck is going on here?" </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] "Am I even allowed to be here?" </connor>
<connor> - "Am I allowed to be here?" - Imagine that came out today. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, no, oh my God but I remember watching like, </connor>
<connor> 'cause that's how I experienced American Pie one and two </connor>
<connor> and it was fucking massive and then </connor>
<joey> seeing American Pie Reunion and just seeing everyone </joey>
<joey> as just like responsible adults </joey>
<joey> and just like being adults. - That's what that's about? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, having like children, like, </joey>
<joey> 'cause they have a high school reunion </joey>
<joey> and you see these characters and they're, one, </joey>
<joey> they're like a lot older and people have jobs </joey>
<joey> and they have children and I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> what the fuck is this, what's happened to my childhood? </joey>
<garnt> - It's like a real high school reunion. </garnt>
<garnt> - Everyone's still in a uni, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Everyone's still getting pissed and partying, right? </garnt>
<connor> - I'm pretty sure I saw his dad, </connor>
<connor> you know his dad, in American Pie? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - The one who's </connor>
<connor> in every movie? - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Pretty sure I just saw him in Canada </connor>
<connor> when I was on like the ski lift. </connor>
<connor> - Really? - I'm pretty sure I sat </connor>
<connor> next to him, I'm near certain I did. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> He spoke to me as well ad he had the exact same voice, </connor>
<connor> but I couldn't exactly see his face. </connor>
<connor> He's wearing ski stuff. - Right, right, right. </connor>
<connor> - But he looked like it and I was like, </connor>
<joey> "I think this is him" - You should have </joey>
<connor> just been like, are you the dad from American Pie? </connor>
<connor> - I didn't ask him, I wasn't sure and imagine if he wasn't, </connor>
<connor> he'd be like, what the fuck is that? </connor>
<joey> - Then you could have spun it being like, </joey>
<connor> you sound just like him. - I'm near certain it's him </connor>
<connor> but I was like 14, so I didn't want to- </connor>
<connor> - Oh, right, right. - But I was like, I swear, </connor>
<joey> I swear it's fucking you. - How do you remember </joey>
<joey> that shit? - 'Cause he literally </joey>
<garnt> just reminded me, I remember getting off the ski lift </garnt>
<connor> thinking like, was that, was that the guy from American Pie? </connor>
<connor> - Did you see like, these fucking bushy ass eyebrows? </connor>
<connor> - Yes! (laughter) </connor>
<connor> - Of course, that's the one thing I remember. </connor>
<connor> - Bushy ass eyebrows. - He has like, </connor>
<connor> the exact same skin tone, the voice was like, spot on. </connor>
<joey> I was like, what the fuck, is this him? </joey>
<joey> Is this him? - No but like, yeah. </joey>
<connor> Well, I mean, have you seen all the Toy Stories? </connor>
<joey> - I haven't seen Toy Story four. </joey>
<garnt> - Good. - I was like Toy Story three- </garnt>
<garnt> - Don't. - Toy Story three </garnt>
<connor> was my Ava 4.0, you know, where- </connor>
<connor> - Wait, what? (laughter) </connor>
<connor> - No, no, no, where I watched it and I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> that was a nice sendoff to Toy Story. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. - And then, </joey>
<joey> they made a fourth one and I'm just like, fuck this shit. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, don't bother with the fourth one. </joey>
<joey> - Did you like three, I didn't really like three. </joey>
<connor> - I didn't like it so much, I liked, </connor>
<connor> it felt special to me because it felt like, </connor>
<connor> you know, I was saying goodbye. </connor>
<connor> - "The end of an era" - The end of Story Story. </connor>
<joey> - The end of Toy Story, 3.0, Death and Rebirth. </joey>
<joey> (laughter) </joey>
<garnt> No but just like seeing Andy grow up and seeing- </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's all right, I guess. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean- - We need like a Toy Story, </joey>
<joey> like 1.0, yeah. - What is the plot </joey>
<garnt> of Toy Story 4? why is there- </garnt>
<connor> - They're at the circus, I don't even, </connor>
<joey> I haven't even watched. - So I saw Toy Story 4 </joey>
<joey> in cinemas because it was available. </joey>
<joey> I went to go see with Aki just 'cause we were like, </joey>
<connor> "We want to go to the cinemas, </connor>
<connor> what's playing right now? </connor>
<connor> Oh, Toy Story 4 is there, all right, </connor>
<connor> let's go watch it?" </connor>
<connor> 'cause at that point, I hadn't heard anything about it. </connor>
<connor> So I went to go see it, yeah, it fucking sucks. </connor>
<connor> It really does suck, I mean, the movie is decent </connor>
<connor> but literally the last 15 minutes of that movie, </connor>
<joey> not only ruin the movie but just completely </joey>
<joey> ruin the entirety of the Toy Story franchise. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I heard it broke a lot of the rules </connor>
<connor> and also it kind of like ruined Woody's character. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, it completely destroyed every character </joey>
<joey> and it just ends off with like this, </joey>
<joey> well, Woody's on the road now. </joey>
<connor> - But I'm also not that invested in the cast of Toy Story. </connor>
<joey> So if you know, if Buzz commits war crimes, </joey>
<joey> I'm not really going to care that much. </joey>
<joey> I'm just going to be like, "All right. </joey>
<joey> Well, I mean, he shouldn't have bombed that place </joey>
<joey> but okay" - But at least </joey>
<joey> Toy Story 3, right, obviously not going to spoilers </joey>
<connor> but at least Toy Story 3-- - I think you could </connor>
<connor> spoil Toy Story 3. - Really? </connor>
<connor> - I think it's okay to spoil. - I don't know. </connor>
<joey> There might be people that are like, I can't believe- </joey>
<joey> - This is not, this is not 4.0. </joey>
<joey> You can spoil Toy Story. - I can't believe they ruined </joey>
<joey> the ending of Toy Story 3 for me. </joey>
<connor> - You can spoil Toy Story 3. </connor>
<joey> - All right, well, okay, well, </joey>
<joey> with Toy Story 3, like, you know that scene </joey>
<joey> where Woody's like, "So long, partner?" </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Like that was </joey>
<connor> like really fucking nice. - That was pretty good. </connor>
<joey> - Like that made me tear up a little bit. </joey>
<joey> Not going to lie. - I just didn't like </joey>
<connor> the fuzz bear, the care bear villain, I just didn't like- </connor>
<joey> - Well, I mean, at least it didn't last, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I guess so. - It didn't last. </joey>
<garnt> - I think the scene that stuck out to me </garnt>
<joey> with Toy Story 3, if we're getting </joey>
<joey> into spoiler territory- - The incinerator scene? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, the incinerator scene. - Yeah, of course. </connor>
<joey> - You talk shit. - What? </joey>
<garnt> - I hated that scene. - What? </garnt>
<garnt> - It just dragged on, you knew what was going to happen. </garnt>
<connor> He was like, come on, then, all right. </connor>
<connor> (laughter) </connor>
<garnt> - Wait, what? - Are you a fucking </garnt>
<garnt> movie critic, right? - What, do you think </garnt>
<joey> they should have died? - I would have, </joey>
<joey> it would've been a nice twist. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Critical! (laughter) </joey>
<garnt> - Famous Pixar movie. - What if they </garnt>
<joey> just then clear cut to like the factory </joey>
<joey> where they make Buzz and Andy, it's just like. </joey>
<joey> - It just cuts like a pile of ashes. </joey>
<joey> - Should have pulled like a Rick and Morty. </joey>
<joey> Like, actually, that was the alternative universe of, </joey>
<joey> you know- - That would have </joey>
<joey> truly ruined Toy Story. - We say like 10,000 Buzzes </joey>
<joey> in like Toy Story 2, why couldn't we have </joey>
<garnt> like Spanish Buzz takeover, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> (off camera laughter) </garnt>
<garnt> Like what's, why, why? - El Buzz. </garnt>
<connor> - Why? - I'll tell you </connor>
<connor> who would've killed off the Toy Story cast? </connor>
<joey> - Who? - Hiri Akiano. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, he would've killed them off </connor>
<connor> and been like, they're all toys, they all share one mind. </connor>
<connor> - They go into the incinerator </connor>
<joey> and then they explode in a giant cross. </joey>
<garnt> (laughter) </garnt>
<joey> The end. - The end. </joey>
<garnt> - Fuck your childhood, kids. - They're toys, </garnt>
<joey> if they went anywhere near an incinerator, </joey>
<joey> they would've melted and been deformed. </joey>
<joey> - Well, yeah, of course. - Also, what year is this </joey>
<joey> where we have incinerators attached to like kindergartens </joey>
<joey> or whatever? - That is true. </joey>
<joey> - Who installed an incinerator in the kindergarten? </joey>
<joey> How irresponsible is this, why was that there? </joey>
<joey> - "Don't go near that room, children" </joey>
<garnt> - Wait, is this- - Was it in the kindergarten? </garnt>
<joey> - It was nearby, right? - I completely- </joey>
<joey> - Or something? - I'm pretty sure </joey>
<joey> it was nearby or something. - I don't know. </joey>
<garnt> Why, I just, my gosh. - Didn't they go </garnt>
<garnt> to a garbage dump? - I don't fucking know. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, that's right. (cross talk) </garnt>
<joey> - I just thought it was attached to like the school. </joey>
<joey> The kindergarten. - That would've </joey>
<joey> been the real plot twist. - It had been like, </joey>
<joey> it was actually a disposal site all along. </joey>
<connor> It was not a kindergarten, I don't know. </connor>
<garnt> - Connor just fucking Memento'd himself. </garnt>
<garnt> Where like you just like, I'll tell you, </garnt>
<joey> you King Crimsoned yourself where like a time period </joey>
<connor> just fucking disappeared. - I think so. </connor>
<connor> - And you're like, "I guess they just ended up </connor>
<joey> in a fucking incinerator" - I was so bored </joey>
<garnt> at that point in the movie because one </garnt>
<joey> and two I liked a lot, I liked that a lot. </joey>
<joey> I love the scene where he's like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, I got to drive to work" </joey>
<garnt> and then he crosses the street </garnt>
<garnt> in his car. - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> That scene was a banger. - That's a classic. </joey>
<joey> - That's a classic scene. - I love that. </joey>
<garnt> - Just naming off memes now, man. </garnt>
<garnt> - Toy Story one and two are actually </garnt>
<connor> like really fucking funny. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, can I just say, Toy Story 2, </connor>
<connor> that scene at the airport is still one of my favorites. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] It's amazing. - That fight scene, </connor>
<connor> can I call it a fight scene? - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> That's a fight scene. - Yeah, that squabble scene. </connor>
<connor> - I felt, you know, a lot of the modern, </connor>
<connor> I can watch a lot of the older films </connor>
<connor> that I haven't even watched before, kids ones </connor>
<connor> and I thought that they were really good because they just, </connor>
<connor> you know, as an adult, you can watch them, </connor>
<connor> no problem. </connor>
<connor> But I find that when I watched a lot </connor>
<connor> of the new kids films, I can't watch them because I just- </connor>
<joey> - Oh, you're talking about recent Pixar films </joey>
<joey> and stuff like that, right? - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> I feel like they've been like, </connor>
<connor> I mean, this is a common thing where everyone's like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, they've been dumbed down" </connor>
<connor> but I did feel that like, </connor>
<connor> when I watch a lot of the older movies, like Disney, </connor>
<joey> like eighties to two thousands, </joey>
<joey> like I can watch any of them. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And I'm like, this is good but a kid </joey>
<connor> could watch them as well. - I mean like, </connor>
<connor> I did have like a period where I actually sat down </connor>
<joey> and like watched all of like the recent Disney movies </joey>
<joey> and the recent Pixar movies 'cause I wanted to make sure </joey>
<joey> and I was like, is it actually getting dumbed down? </joey>
<joey> Or is that just like my like own opinion about it? </joey>
<connor> - Like, have you watched Pinocchio? </connor>
<connor> That movie's fucked. - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> That movie is- - I do not remember Pinocchio. </joey>
<joey> Have you watched Pinocchio? - I might have. </joey>
<joey> - I might have. - Dude, they fucking </joey>
<joey> smoke cigars and they turn into donkeys. </joey>
<connor> - They smoke cigars, gamble and drink alcohol </connor>
<connor> and I'm like, what the hell? - Yeah </connor>
<joey> and these kids are like eight years old. </joey>
<connor> - I don't remember Woody like cracking open a bong. </connor>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> Do you know what I mean, like- - Buzz! </joey>
<joey> (laughter) </joey>
<joey> - "Buzz, yeah, are you gonna hit the bong? </joey>
<joey> Andy's in college bro, let's hit the bong!" </joey>
<connor> - It's huge! </connor>
<connor> - The bong </connor>
<garnt> just starts talking. (laughter) </garnt>
<connor> It's just Seth Rogan, like, I don't remember this. </connor>
<garnt> - Pretty sure that's just fucking Sausage Party, man. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm pretty sure this is actually like a- </garnt>
<garnt> - The Playboy magazine comes to life. </garnt>
<joey> - This is like a cartoon, Robot Chicken. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it's like a New Ground spinoff. </joey>
<joey> - I think this is, pretty sure this is a thing. </joey>
<joey> I don't know. - I don't know. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, wait, there was a Robot Chicken </connor>
<connor> where like they go to, am I dreaming this weather? </connor>
<connor> Like they do Toy Story parody and like dildos talk </connor>
<joey> or something. - I don't know. </joey>
<joey> That's a million dollar idea. - Maybe I've made this up. </joey>
<garnt> If not, that's all yours, I mean, </garnt>
<garnt> that's low hanging fruit but- - I feel like that </garnt>
<connor> sounds like a fever dream but most Robot Chicken skits </connor>
<connor> are fever dreams. - Adult Toy Story. </connor>
<garnt> - I feel like, with movies, I can't remember </garnt>
<connor> what I've made up and what is actually happening </connor>
<connor> and what has happened. - You shouldn't </connor>
<joey> share too much, man, you're giving away </joey>
<joey> a million dollar ideas left and right. </joey>
<joey> - The thing is, I'll have this idea, </joey>
<joey> oh, it's already been done, it was never done. </joey>
<joey> It was never done. - Until it wasn't. </joey>
<joey> - I have an absolutely horrid memory. </joey>
<joey> Just absolutely abysmal when it comes to remembering films </joey>
<garnt> and media, I just can't, I remember what I felt- </garnt>
<garnt> - You remember JoJo and that's pretty much it. </garnt>
<garnt> - I remember what I felt about the media. </garnt>
<connor> I can't remember much about it. </connor>
<connor> Just like one or two scenes here and there. </connor>
<connor> That's all I remember. - I think </connor>
<joey> that's pretty common, though. - Is that common? </joey>
<joey> - Well, I think especially if you- </joey>
<connor> - I can't remember character names either. </connor>
<connor> - I'm also shit at remembering character names. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah but I feel that's especially the case </connor>
<joey> for people who have consumed like a shitload of media. </joey>
<joey> Right, like after a while, like your brain's gonna overcap </joey>
<joey> with that kind of shit. - Is this </joey>
<connor> just the modern day problem of too much media? </connor>
<connor> - Too much consumption. - Too much media. </connor>
<connor> I can't remember fucking anything. </connor>
<connor> Now I'm watching YouTube shorts and I feel like my brain </connor>
<connor> has like one second memory. (laughter) </connor>
<joey> - I feel like the shorts are not helping. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, TikTok and the shorts, definitely </garnt>
<garnt> haven't helped in hacking your brain to be like, okay, </garnt>
<garnt> on to the next thing, consume, consume, consume. </garnt>
<connor> - But then I talked to my dad and he like, </connor>
<connor> can't remember the word for anything and I'm like, </connor>
<joey> shit is that what I'm going to be like? </joey>
<joey> I'm like- - I think </joey>
<joey> that's a different problem. (laughter) </joey>
<joey> - He just refuses to learn, like if you, </joey>
<garnt> if he's learned a word a certain way, </garnt>
<garnt> he just will never correct it. </garnt>
<garnt> - What do you mean? - Like he- </garnt>
<joey> - Like pronouncing or like- - Yeah, pronunciation. </joey>
<joey> He will never change the pronunciation once he's decided </joey>
<connor> what the pronunciation is in his head. </connor>
<joey> - I don't think that's a memory issue. </joey>
<connor> I think that's just being stubborn. </connor>
<connor> (laughter) </connor>
<joey> - But that, I think that is like an older thing. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I think I've met a few older people who do that. </joey>
<joey> Where you like, you correct the pronunciation. </joey>
<joey> They're like, "No" - My dad is like that as well. </joey>
<joey> My dad's like, he tells a fact and then I go, </joey>
<garnt> "Actually it's not" and then he's like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Nah, that's not a credible source" </garnt>
<joey> - Honestly, I'm kind of like that. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I know. - Are you going to tell me </joey>
<connor> that gif is not pronounced gif? </connor>
<connor> - It is gif, I don't give a shit if he says jif. </connor>
<connor> - It's gif. - That's the point, right? </connor>
<connor> - I don't give a shit if that guy says it's jif. </connor>
<connor> It's not. - I don't give a shit. </connor>
<connor> It's gif. - It's gif. </connor>
<garnt> - And like fucking the world could end and like- </garnt>
<connor> - You don't have a say, even though you made it, </connor>
<joey> you don't have a say. - The G stands for graphic. </joey>
<joey> You don't say jraphic. - No, exactly. </joey>
<garnt> - It's a g sound, it's gif. - Like there could be like, </garnt>
<garnt> there could be a gun to my head </garnt>
<garnt> to be like, you can live if you just say jif. </garnt>
<garnt> I'll be like, no, shoot me now. </garnt>
<connor> - Gif. - Shoot me. </connor>
<connor> - Bang. (laughter) </connor>
<connor> - I'll take the gun off him, it's gif. </connor>
<connor> I don't know, even if you made the thing. </connor>
<connor> I think you can have, you know, </connor>
<joey> if you've made it clear from the start, </joey>
<joey> that it was that, </joey>
<joey> and that's what it was but it became massive public domain </joey>
<connor> and was widely used before it became </connor>
<connor> into the public discourse that it was called jif. </connor>
<joey> - Right, right, right. - So at that point, </joey>
<joey> no, he might've been saying it </joey>
<joey> for a while but he didn't do a very good job </joey>
<joey> of making everyone know it was jif. </joey>
<connor> He should, everything at the bottom showed a watermark </connor>
<connor> saying it is pronounced jif to make it clear </connor>
<connor> but I feel like as a creator, you didn't really </connor>
<connor> have much say over how. - Especially when it becomes </connor>
<joey> that widespread, it's already like rooted into society. </joey>
<connor> - There are so many things that like, </connor>
<connor> once they're adopted by the public, you know, </connor>
<joey> they become their own kind of beast, right? </joey>
<joey> It becomes its own thing. - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - And you don't really get a say over it. </connor>
<joey> - Well that's like, you know, if Anno came out tomorrow </joey>
<joey> and said it's actually pronounced Evanjellion. </joey>
<joey> We'd all be like, "No, it's not" </joey>
<joey> It's Evangellion. - Okay, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - It's like JK Rowling telling us </connor>
<garnt> like weird Harry Potter facts, like they just, </garnt>
<joey> they shit themselves then teleported away. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<connor> No, I don't believe you. </connor>
<connor> Even though you made this and this is your world, </connor>
<joey> no, you don't have a say in this. </joey>
<joey> - It's pronounced Harry Pooter, actually? </joey>
<joey> - You don't have a say over it. </joey>
<joey> What was the other weird one that they brought out? </joey>
<joey> Like something weird about Hagrid or something. </joey>
<garnt> - It was, Dumbledore's gay or something. </garnt>
<joey> - Dumbledore's gay. - No, no, no. </joey>
<joey> That was already- - No but that's canon. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that was already canonical, there's another one </joey>
<joey> with like Hagrid where it was like something </joey>
<joey> really fucking weird about Hagrid. </joey>
<joey> - I can't remember. - He was like onto anal </joey>
<connor> or something. - And I was like, no, no. </connor>
<connor> It was like- - Hagrid </connor>
<joey> had a fucking threesome with Snape and Dumbledore. </joey>
<joey> - McGonagal. - And it's canon. </joey>
<garnt> It's just like, what are you doing JK Rowling? </garnt>
<garnt> Why, why are you doing this? - It happens </garnt>
<joey> in between the first two books. </joey>
<connor> I just didn't write it. - It's interesting though, </connor>
<joey> isn't it, how like, if you do try and retcon things </joey>
<connor> or what it feels like retconning, </connor>
<connor> the audience would be like, "No" </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, Anno has done that several fucking times </garnt>
<garnt> because he's come out several times saying like, no, </garnt>
<joey> it's not like that, like for example, </joey>
<joey> the crosses. - "The cross </joey>
<joey> doesn't mean anything" - "The cross </joey>
<garnt> doesn't mean anything" or "I just put this in </garnt>
<garnt> because I thought it was cool" and then- </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I guess, so, I guess it comes off- </garnt>
<joey> - And people are like, "No, no, no" </joey>
<joey> - But then that's interesting, right 'cause then </joey>
<joey> that begs the argument of, it's not whether as much as, </joey>
<joey> it's not really anything to do with the media itself. </joey>
<joey> It's more so to do with what the public likes you </joey>
<joey> and like is life. - That is true. </joey>
<connor> It's whether or not the public actually </connor>
<joey> takes you seriously </joey>
<connor> - So even if she released a new book, </connor>
<joey> I'm sure people will be like, "Nah, it's not canonical. </joey>
<joey> I just don't like it, I just don't like it" do I? </joey>
<garnt> - Sometimes you, sometimes you just got to decide, you know? </garnt>
<connor> - And also I think, I think she has pushed it </connor>
<joey> with what she can get the audience to agree with. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I think once you've brought in these characters </joey>
<joey> and you've brought in this world, </joey>
<connor> there's a certain amount of, ah, no, </connor>
<connor> I don't not really agree with that. </connor>
<joey> - Well, I mean, she certainly hasn't helped her public image </joey>
<joey> with that kind of stuff, right? </joey>
<joey> Meanwhile, if like fucking Nasu came out </joey>
<joey> with another Fate thing, it was like, </joey>
<joey> ah, yes, this is actually not canonical, </joey>
<connor> all the Nasu fans will be like, yes, thank you, Nasu. </connor>
<connor> Thank you for another piece. - Was Anno ever ridiculous </connor>
<joey> with the stuff that he suggested? </joey>
<joey> - Have you seen Eva? (laughter) </joey>
<connor> - Yeah but like it's all always in line. </connor>
<connor> You know, hearing JK- - Eva is the definition </connor>
<connor> of ridiculous. - Yeah </connor>
<joey> but that's why it's in line, Harry Potter </joey>
<joey> had rules to some extent. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And to hear her go "Yeah, the reason </joey>
<joey> why Hagrid doesn't have kids is 'cause </joey>
<joey> he exclusively fists people" that's not something that, </joey>
<joey> (laughter) </joey>
<joey> that doesn't line up- - He's incapable </joey>
<joey> of reproducing. - You know, </joey>
<joey> that doesn't line up with what I understood </joey>
<joey> about Harry Potter. - Right, right. </joey>
<joey> (laughter) </joey>
<joey> - To say that is like, "Okay, no, </joey>
<joey> I don't know about that" </joey>
<joey> That's is the level of absurd that JK Rowling </joey>
<garnt> would bring to the table. - I wish that was canon. </garnt>
<connor> (laughter) </connor>
<joey> - I actually wish that was canon. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, it's not any more ridiculous </joey>
<garnt> than like taking a shit and making it disappear with magic. </garnt>
<connor> - But I also, I love that, I also think that's amazing. </connor>
<joey> Why wasn't that in the movie? - I want like sometimes, </joey>
<garnt> sometimes like I think sometimes as an author </garnt>
<connor> and as a consumer, you've got to, </connor>
<joey> you got to think sometimes, at what point </joey>
<joey> is there too much detail in world creation? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, that's true. - That's the exact point </connor>
<connor> when there's too much fucking detail. </connor>
<connor> - There's too much fucking detail. </connor>
<connor> - I just loved that JK Rowling thought about this </connor>
<connor> after the fact, "That's a neat little fact" </connor>
<connor> I will let everyone know, "Siri open Twitter" </connor>
<joey> - I would like to teach you guys about the information </joey>
<joey> about the teleporting fecal matter. </joey>
<joey> - This also makes me wonder, was it just like, </joey>
<joey> were they just fucking fascinated </joey>
<joey> when they first saw a toilet in the human world. </joey>
<joey> They're like, holy, you have a room dedicated for shitting. </joey>
<garnt> That's just amazing, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> Do they wipe? </garnt>
<garnt> (laughter) </garnt>
<garnt> - Does that get teleported as well? </garnt>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<connor> It doesn't get teleported, I believe in like the, </connor>
<connor> do they get teleported? - Does every single, </connor>
<joey> by that sense, you'd never need a shower </joey>
<joey> because every single thing attached to your body, </joey>
<joey> including some, this is, you know- </joey>
<connor> - Well does it get teleported while it's inside of you? </connor>
<garnt> - No, no, I think what I remember from the tweet </garnt>
<joey> that she tweeted, I think you take a shit </joey>
<garnt> and then they don't teleport it anywhere. </garnt>
<garnt> They just make it invisible, I think. </garnt>
<garnt> Magic away the evidence? (laughter) </garnt>
<garnt> - Just magic away the evidence. </garnt>
<joey> - What does that mean? - That's so many </joey>
<joey> interpretation, oh my fucking- </joey>
<joey> - Magic away the evidence. - I need a five page thesis, </joey>
<joey> no, I need like a 20 page thesis. </joey>
<garnt> - I need like a six hour video on the poop situation. </garnt>
<joey> - You must have shit on your ass though still. </joey>
<connor> Like it's not clean, you need a bidet something or I assumed </connor>
<connor> as the spell get rid of that, if so then why would you need </connor>
<joey> to ever shower because surely the smell </joey>
<joey> can also get rid of any bodily fluids or odor </joey>
<joey> that you might have also, you know, </joey>
<joey> when they nut and if they're inside of someone, </joey>
<joey> they don't wanna get them pregnant, did they just like- </joey>
<joey> - Deletus! (laughter) </joey>
<joey> - Do they just cum and then like- </joey>
<joey> - Fetus Deletus. (laughter) </joey>
<joey> - Do they just, genuinely, do they cum </joey>
<connor> and they can just be like, cum be gone like and it's gone? </connor>
<connor> (laughter) </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> - Are they able </connor>
<connor> to cast spells, if they, okay, okay, I believe, right? </connor>
<connor> I'm on board, I'm on board with the fact that you can, </connor>
<joey> you can spell away your own fluids, right? </joey>
<joey> In your own body, if you get your fluids </joey>
<joey> in someone else's body, can your spell still get them away? </joey>
<connor> Does it, can you get rid of fluids </connor>
<joey> in other people's bodies? - I just like to imagine like- </joey>
<garnt> - Is that a thing? - I want to say that </garnt>
<garnt> next time I nut. (laughter) </garnt>
<joey> - It's like baby, where's the condom? </joey>
<joey> Pulls out a wand, fetus deletus. </joey>
<joey> - Things you should never say after sex. </joey>
<connor> Fetus... (laughter) </connor>
<connor> - Are we 10 years old here? - I'm sorry. </connor>
<connor> - JK, can you please make that cannon, please? </connor>
<garnt> That's information I want to know </garnt>
<joey> about the Harry Potter universe. </joey>
<garnt> - Please make that canon. - I don't care </garnt>
<garnt> about the disappearing shit. - [Connor] I do. </garnt>
<joey> - I care about what they do to replace condoms </joey>
<garnt> in the Harry Potter world. - Oh, God. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm not gonna be able to get that image out of my mind now. </garnt>
<joey> Connor was having a rant and I just like went off </joey>
<joey> in my own world. - Just pointing the wand down. </joey>
<joey> "I got you, babe" - Sorry. </joey>
<joey> What were we talking about? - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> What were we talking about? - Do you want </garnt>
<joey> to repeat your rant? - I was saying, </joey>
<connor> if you can get rid of the fluids, excrement, that's yours, </connor>
<connor> if you nut in somebody else, can you get rid of that fluids? </connor>
<joey> 'Cause you have nut inside of them. </joey>
<joey> - I guess, so pull a fetus deletus, then you got it. </joey>
<connor> - Right. - Your blood is now gone. </connor>
<joey> You are dead, you know? - Spinal fluid, gone. </joey>
<joey> Just collapse. - This is a very </joey>
<joey> disgusting conversation about bodily fluids. </joey>
<garnt> - It's fascinating, it's fascinating. </garnt>
<joey> - Thank you, thank you, JK Rowling. </joey>
<joey> - Thank you, JK. - For letting our imagination </joey>
<joey> run wild. - For asking </joey>
<garnt> the important questions and answering </garnt>
<garnt> the important questions as well. </garnt>
<joey> - I still can't get over the fucking, like what was it? </joey>
<joey> Deleting the evidence with magic or some of shit? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, it was her own words, vanish the evidence. </connor>
<joey> - Vanished the evidence with magic. </joey>
<joey> That's what I'm going to say in court next time </joey>
<joey> when I commit a murder, your honor, </joey>
<connor> I vanished the evidence with magic. </connor>
<connor> Moving on from that. - On other, </connor>
<connor> moving excrement, I've been moving my stuff. </connor>
<garnt> - You've been moving your shit. </garnt>
<garnt> - You've been moving period, right? </garnt>
<connor> - Yes, moving house, oh my gosh, took so long. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - How's that </connor>
<garnt> been going for you? </garnt>
<connor> - Very long. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, people on Twitter were asking </joey>
<connor> and people coming into my streams being like, </connor>
<connor> Connor's not streaming, what's happening? </connor>
<joey> - Everyone's like, why he hasn't streamed for like 10 days. </joey>
<joey> I miss it, so kind of like no subs when I come back. </joey>
<joey> So sad, gonna have to work from the ground up again. </joey>
<joey> - You're pretty much fully moved in, right? </joey>
<joey> Like you're out of your office? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I fully moved like a week ago </connor>
<joey> but then I went away for like five days as well. </joey>
<joey> and also I didn't have any furniture and then it all came </joey>
<connor> and it's taking up all of my living room. </connor>
<connor> So like building stuff is such a nightmare. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - I got like Jenga stuff </connor>
<connor> out of the way and then build it </connor>
<connor> but then it takes up a lot of room. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause the boxes obviously were tightly packed. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, you've got to leave the box to another room, right? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, so it's like every time I feel </connor>
<connor> like I make any progress, something else turns up </connor>
<joey> that I got to do and I'm like for fuck sakes. </joey>
<joey> At least have a bed now. - Oh, yeah? </joey>
<joey> - It's a nice bed as well. - You got the koala bed? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I did. - Are they like taking care </connor>
<garnt> of all the fucking cardboard that's been building up? </garnt>
<connor> - Oh my God, yeah 'cause you know, </connor>
<connor> in the UK you could just, you know, fill up your car, </connor>
<joey> drive down to the local recycling center </joey>
<joey> and chuck all the cardboard. - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Pretty easy, really. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But in Japan you can't do that. </connor>
<connor> You have to put it in your, you have to recycle it </connor>
<joey> in your building. - On a specific day. </joey>
<joey> - Actually you might be able to take it somewhere </joey>
<joey> but I don't have a car. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And also I'm not renting a car </joey>
<connor> just to take cardboard but luckily, </connor>
<joey> the new place I moved into, you can just put them out </joey>
<joey> at any time. - Oh, that's good. </joey>
<joey> - And there's like a whole area </joey>
<joey> for trash downstairs. - Oh, like an inside area? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah 'cause my previous place it was put outside. </joey>
<joey> So you could only put it on like Wednesday at 8:00 AM. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, my current place is like that as well. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I hated that 'cause I was like, </connor>
<connor> fuck dude, I got shit to do, man. </connor>
<joey> - See, my place though, it says you need </joey>
<connor> to take everything out before 8:00 AM. </connor>
<connor> (cross talk) </connor>
<connor> - Just do it the night before, not a fuck. </connor>
<connor> - At my place, they don't come to pick it up </connor>
<connor> 'til like 2:00 PM. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah, they did that too, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So I'm just like, I'll just fucking take it out </connor>
<connor> in the morning then, whenever. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> They used to, in my old place, when I first moved in, </connor>
<connor> they were like, "You have to wake up at 7:00 AM </connor>
<connor> to take out the trash" I'm like, </connor>
<joey> "I'm not waking up at 7:00 AM" - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I'll stay up till like 4:00 AM </joey>
<joey> and do it, I'm not waking up at seven, fuck off. </joey>
<joey> - Are you serious? - I mean, </joey>
<joey> it's gotten me to like get a good sleep schedule at least. </joey>
<connor> Like I wake up nice and early in the morning </connor>
<connor> to get shit done. - But that's not a good thing </connor>
<joey> to wake up to. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - "Oh yeah, wake up, </joey>
<joey> can't wait to go fucking take out </joey>
<joey> my fucking smelly garbage" - You get used to it </joey>
<joey> after a while, honestly. - But then yeah, </joey>
<joey> the new place is great, you can just chuck it out anytime. </joey>
<connor> There's like, normally the more modern apartment buildings, </connor>
<connor> you can just like go downstairs and there'll be an area. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, our old office had that. </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - 'Cause it was a newer building. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, the trash take out was super good. </joey>
<joey> It's basically like that, it's like identical </joey>
<connor> but there's like a separate room </connor>
<connor> for like stinky trash, I guess? </connor>
<joey> (laughter) </joey>
<joey> I don't know, burnable. - Uh-oh, stinky. </joey>
<joey> - All your food that's like burnable. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - So there's just </joey>
<joey> like another room for that. - I mean, </joey>
<joey> I guess that's good, right, like because you know, </joey>
<joey> you don't have to, your nose don't have to struggle </joey>
<joey> when you take cardboard out, right? </joey>
<joey> - It's so weird though, there's like, </joey>
<connor> my room has like this really like, </connor>
<connor> massive security camera that points at the trash </connor>
<joey> and I'm guessing it's to stop you </joey>
<joey> from doing anything strange. - Right. </joey>
<joey> - Or I like putting trash that you shouldn't. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - And there is literally </joey>
<joey> like black and white tape all over this room. </joey>
<connor> Like it looks like a murder room </connor>
<connor> and I think it's on purpose to scare you. </connor>
<connor> - Right. - To make you not feel </connor>
<connor> like it's okay to like- - What would you do? </connor>
<connor> - I think trashing stuff you shouldn't be trashing there. </connor>
<joey> - Because like trashing rules in Japan </joey>
<joey> are like weirdly specific. - 'Cause burnable stuff, </joey>
<connor> right, in Japan, yeah, it's very specific. </connor>
<connor> So like plastic bottles, can't go with plastic. </connor>
<connor> It has to very specifically go with plastic bottles. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, there's a whole nother area </connor>
<joey> for that and cardboard can't go with paper. </joey>
<joey> Paper is another thing. - And that paper is burnables. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, no, no, no, no, in my place, it's not. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, really? - It's recyclable. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, really? - Yeah, paper is, </garnt>
<garnt> some places it's burnable but also depends </garnt>
<joey> on the size of the paper, if it's too small, it's not, </joey>
<joey> you can't put it in the thing, it's really fucking weird. </joey>
<connor> There's so many rules and most of them you have to follow. </connor>
<joey> - And all of these rules as well, </joey>
<joey> changes depending on where you are. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can live in the same, </connor>
<connor> you can live in Tokyo but every municipality in Tokyo </connor>
<connor> has a different rule and like, you know, </connor>
<connor> so also like batteries is very specific. </connor>
<joey> It can only be in a certain place. </joey>
<joey> So all this stuff is very confusing and, </joey>
<joey> and there should be no matter where you live in Tokyo </joey>
<connor> or Cytomel Chiba or any of those places, </connor>
<joey> there should be an English guide. </joey>
<joey> They normally all have them. - You should </joey>
<joey> get an English guide at the town hall when you move in. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, it's very confusing because sometimes, </connor>
<connor> the material wasn't covered, so like cardboard is good </connor>
<joey> but cardboard pizza boxes, no, no, no. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause it's been greasy, so it can't go. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I actually have an app that, </connor>
<connor> where if I type in a certain thing- </connor>
<connor> - Oh, really? - Then it tells me </connor>
<connor> what day to take it out. - That's pretty useful. </connor>
<connor> - So if I'm not sure then I go to my app, I type in, </connor>
<connor> you know like, 'cause I remember one time it was like, </connor>
<connor> there was like a specific type of styrofoam. </connor>
<connor> It's not like the, it's not like the hard </connor>
<connor> like squeaky styrofoam, it's more like a squishy styrofoam. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, the softer one? - The squeaky one? </joey>
<joey> - Oh, the black one? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - The one that's layered? - Like the squishy styrofoam. </connor>
<connor> So I was like, "Fuck, I don't know what that is. </connor>
<connor> So I looked it up on the app and it was </connor>
<connor> on a completely different day. </connor>
<connor> I was like, oh thank God. - Wait, really? </connor>
<connor> - I put that in burnable, bro. </connor>
<joey> - Well, I dunno, maybe my municipal is different. </joey>
<joey> - Styrofoam is just the one thing where I'm just like, </joey>
<garnt> where does this go, I'm just like, uh? </garnt>
<garnt> - Styrofoam is burnable, right? </garnt>
<joey> - Some types of styrofoam is burnable. </joey>
<garnt> Other types is plastic. - I thought it was recyclable. </garnt>
<joey> Plastics, I've been putting it- </joey>
<joey> - See, it completely changes where you are. </joey>
<joey> Sometimes it's all- - I just put </joey>
<connor> like eight bags of that shit in the burnable, fuck. </connor>
<joey> Sometimes it's all burnable, sometimes it depends, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - You're gonna get a knock on your door, </joey>
<garnt> like the police are going to come in </garnt>
<joey> and just like, so... - Excuse me, </joey>
<joey> are you the guys that threw out all that styrofoam? </joey>
<connor> (laughter) </connor>
<connor> Just having a hunch. - Imagine being the guy </connor>
<garnt> that's just like threw out all the burnables </garnt>
<garnt> in the wrong place. - There's a lot of foreigners </garnt>
<joey> in my building as well, so it's, </joey>
<joey> I don't feel like the odd one out, </joey>
<joey> I definitely felt like in my old building </joey>
<connor> it was for Japanese families. - Well you were living </connor>
<garnt> in an area that was very like, not- </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yeah, dude. - Not exactly </garnt>
<joey> like gaijin friendly. - We all were. </joey>
<garnt> - 'Cause we all lived five minutes away from each other. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. - Back in the day. </connor>
<garnt> - And I lived even further out than you guys. </garnt>
<garnt> So I definitely lived with like all the families. </garnt>
<joey> - A relatively older building as well, right? </joey>
<connor> - Oh yeah, it was super old and it was </connor>
<connor> definitely a family building as well. </connor>
<joey> I don't know, I didn't see anyone else there </joey>
<joey> who looked even remotely my age. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - They were nice though, I never really </joey>
<connor> had any problems, except I got a noise complaint </connor>
<connor> but I expected as much. - Well, I mean, </connor>
<joey> if you're shouting at fucking 02:00 AM. </joey>
<connor> - It's one of those things that- </connor>
<joey> - It's probably a matter of time. </joey>
<joey> - When I first moved in, I would literally </joey>
<joey> walk around my own apartment like metal gear solid. </joey>
<joey> Like I was so sick 'cause I'd heard nightmare scenarios </joey>
<joey> about noise where I was just tiptoeing around my apartment, </joey>
<connor> like at night because I genuinely thought if I just walked </connor>
<joey> at a normal brisk pace, I would get like shouted at </joey>
<connor> but you know, the months go on and you start to realize, </connor>
<connor> you know, okay, okay. - I can't help the clapping </connor>
<connor> of my ass cheeks being so loud. </connor>
<connor> - I'm so dummy thicc. - Yeah, you're so dummy thicc. </connor>
<connor> - You know, then one time I had friends over </connor>
<connor> who stayed over until five and I never got a noise complaint </connor>
<joey> and then I was like oh, okay and then you slowly </joey>
<joey> get more comfortable. - You test the limit. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah because you know, and then maybe something happened </joey>
<connor> where, all right, there's a deadline, </connor>
<connor> I have to record this thing, it's 2:00 AM </connor>
<connor> and they need it right now. - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Okay, well I guess I'll do it. </joey>
<joey> I'll just scream one line and I'll do it </joey>
<joey> and then I'll also, I had to record voice lines one time. </joey>
<joey> I just, I distinctly remember we're full on shouting, </joey>
<joey> but this was like midday but it was to the point </joey>
<joey> where I was, this is shouting so loud </joey>
<joey> and so aggressively that I would totally understand </joey>
<joey> if the police were called in any scenario. </joey>
<joey> - Sounded like a murder was happening. </joey>
<joey> Literally, even a murderer wouldn't have done it </joey>
<joey> with such conviction the way I did. </joey>
<joey> So I was, I did that and that definitely </joey>
<joey> made me more confident. - Right. </joey>
<joey> - So it's one of those things where it just built up </joey>
<joey> and then I started streaming and I started streaming later </joey>
<joey> and later and later and then I started screaming louder </joey>
<joey> and louder and then eventually I got a noise complaint, </joey>
<connor> which is totally 'cause I think it was one where I was </connor>
<connor> totally screaming at 4:00 AM, which I totally understood. </connor>
<connor> I just assumed the people below me </connor>
<connor> because this was a four bedroom. </connor>
<joey> I just assumed they were sleeping </joey>
<joey> in a totally different room and they were so old </joey>
<joey> that nothing would wake them up. </joey>
<connor> - That's the thing, yeah. - I was hoping </connor>
<joey> that they were that kind of old people where they were not </joey>
<connor> getting up for anything. - Yeah, that's the thing. </connor>
<joey> Sometimes like, you get lucky because like the room </joey>
<joey> that if you, especially if you have multiple rooms, </joey>
<joey> the room that you screamed the loudest in, </joey>
<joey> is nowhere near where the person downstairs is sleeping. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's always, it's mostly like, </garnt>
<joey> where is the bedroom located and am I making a lot of noise </joey>
<joey> where their bedroom is located? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause anywhere else I feel like it's more understanding </joey>
<connor> about it, but it's always the bedroom </connor>
<connor> and I think like I really lucked out </connor>
<connor> with the apartment I had before. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I've never got a noise complaint. </connor>
<connor> - You're very lucky, I don't know how you've done that. </connor>
<connor> - I feel like I definitely should, </connor>
<connor> like I fucking limit tested that thing. </connor>
<connor> - We've had parties at your house at 5:00 AM. </connor>
<connor> - We've had very loud parties at 5:00 AM on a Saturday. </connor>
<joey> So we weren't being complete assholes. </joey>
<garnt> - It doesn't matter to the old people. </garnt>
<garnt> - In Japan, that is not acceptable anywhere </garnt>
<connor> but it's, yeah, I fucking limit broke that shit </connor>
<garnt> and I didn't get a noise complaint. </garnt>
<joey> I'm very, very surprised. - Saturdays, </joey>
<garnt> it doesn't matter what day of the week it is </garnt>
<garnt> to an old person, like 'cause like the cops aren't going </garnt>
<joey> to be like, all right, we got a noise complaint </joey>
<joey> and you'd be like, it's Saturday. </joey>
<joey> - License to party. - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - It's Saturday. - Cop's like, </garnt>
<connor> "Understandable, have a nice day" </connor>
<connor> - I just feel like I lucked out because I feel </connor>
<connor> like I had neighbors who had like a mutual understanding </connor>
<connor> 'cause I feel like I've had the only neighbor </connor>
<connor> that I know of, of anyone living in Japan </connor>
<joey> that was like really fucking noisy, </joey>
<joey> like they would have arguments </joey>
<joey> all the time and it wasn't just like a Japanese argument, </joey>
<joey> it was full on shouting, sometimes it was </joey>
<joey> the most un-Japanese Japanese argument I've ever heard, </joey>
<connor> right? - Very dramatic. </connor>
<connor> - And I'm just like, if you make noise, </connor>
<connor> then you know, I'm going to make noise as well. </connor>
<connor> - Mutual understanding. - Yeah, mutual understanding. </connor>
<garnt> It's a symbiotic relationship, you know. </garnt>
<connor> - I mean, there were, I always very, you know, </connor>
<connor> even if I was making noise, I would be, </connor>
<connor> if they're having a party once a month. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly. - It's once a month. </connor>
<connor> I can live with that, it's not like I have like, </connor>
<joey> I dunno like a bonsai tree that's sensitive to noise </joey>
<joey> or something in my apartment that shits itself </joey>
<joey> if it hears two decibels, you know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - I think it's okay. </joey>
<joey> I think that's why I wouldn't really call the cops </joey>
<joey> but Japanese people have no chill with that </joey>
<connor> and they just immediately call the cops. </connor>
<joey> - Well no, because to them it's like, </joey>
<joey> "Why are you being so loud at home </joey>
<joey> when you could just go to an (speaking Japanese) </joey>
<joey> and go out in town and have fun?" and I'm like, I would, </joey>
<connor> if everything doesn't close at 8:00 PM </connor>
<joey> and alcohol can't be served. - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> One of the things that's been so, taking so long </connor>
<connor> in my new places that my office I've actually </connor>
<joey> like gone through the whole effort of like trying </joey>
<joey> to sound treat it to the best of my ability </joey>
<joey> as much as you can 'cause the best way </joey>
<joey> to sound proof a room used to do it </joey>
<connor> while they're building the God damn room </connor>
<connor> but I've had to do it in post. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. - And it's been a nightmare. </joey>
<joey> I've had to put like two layers of stuff on my wall </joey>
<joey> and then I still haven't done it all yet. </joey>
<joey> So like two layers of fabric that I've attached to the wall </joey>
<joey> and then I'm doing the third, which is that like sound foam </joey>
<connor> because you know, YouTubers just put like four pieces </connor>
<connor> and it's like, it's soundproof, my room and it's like, </connor>
<connor> that is not even remotely soundproof. </connor>
<joey> - I like the rooms where it's like one piece over here, </joey>
<joey> another piece over here. - It's just one piece </joey>
<joey> behind where they're sitting and then like, </joey>
<garnt> my job here is done. - Soundproofed. </garnt>
<connor> - My living looks super weird right now </connor>
<connor> 'cause it's just all like every single wall </connor>
<joey> is like a black plastic rubber. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - But it works, </joey>
<joey> you can't really hear me-- </joey>
<joey> - Immediately the echo's gone? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, and so I put a layer of the rubber stuff </joey>
<joey> down as well and then I put noise reducing carpet </joey>
<joey> on top of it. </joey>
<joey> So like you can jump in my room, neighbors ain't going </joey>
<connor> to hear shit downstairs. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> I actually just finished laying down carpet in my office </connor>
<joey> as well, like finally. - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> 'Cause I was talking to Jerry while I was doing it. </connor>
<connor> Jerry was like, that sounds like a good idea. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, so I decided to do that in my room </joey>
<joey> 'cause my room was like super fucking echo-y. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I have like wooden floors. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, it helps so much, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Immediately once I put up, before I even started </joey>
<joey> putting up the sound foam immediately with the carpet, </joey>
<joey> it's like, 80% of the echo just gone. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, every single wall you do makes it, </connor>
<connor> it gets better results. - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's not since I moved to Japan </garnt>
<joey> that I'm just like, man, carpets look good, I miss carpets. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause like we had to carpets in England. </joey>
<joey> Like you didn't have, like you didn't have a house, </joey>
<joey> you never had a house in England that had wooden floors, </joey>
<garnt> right 'cause it's not good for noise, not noise, </garnt>
<garnt> like a heat installation, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - We had them. - Really? </garnt>
<connor> - No living room was wooden but upstairs was carpet. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, so our house was like half wooden, half carpet. </joey>
<joey> - In like your rooms, you'd have carpet and I'm like, </joey>
<joey> I didn't know how much I missed that </joey>
<joey> until I moved to Asia where everything here </joey>
<connor> is wooden floors. - We had like fitted carpet </connor>
<connor> in Europe, I think why that they come in </connor>
<joey> and they specially like get the right size </joey>
<joey> and they fit it all professionally </joey>
<joey> but in Japan they always use the square, </joey>
<connor> like just pick up and go kind of things. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, the post carpet. - They just, </joey>
<connor> in Japan, like a lot of the carpets are just like, </connor>
<joey> you'll see them everywhere, they're just like these- </joey>
<joey> - Like cubes. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> We have it here. - Like squares. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, they're everywhere, like they're just like squares, </joey>
<connor> you plunk them down and then you just cut them </connor>
<connor> around the edges, like hand cut it to my room. </connor>
<joey> It looks really fucking good but I spent </joey>
<connor> like a whole fucking day doing them. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I did too, because my room's not square. </joey>
<connor> It's like weird fucking shapes. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, fuck sakes. - Yeah and cutting the corners </connor>
<connor> and stuff in a pain in the ass. </connor>
<connor> - So look it looks good from a distance </connor>
<connor> but when you get down on the floor, </connor>
<joey> you see how much of a shit job I did. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause it's hard, man, it's hard. </joey>
<joey> - I'm very proud of it, I've been DIYing for like two days </joey>
<joey> and it look good, it looks amazing </joey>
<joey> and when everything's set up, it should be good. </joey>
<connor> - That'll be me in like two months. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I think I'm the last one to move out. </connor>
<connor> - I'm planning to have a whole wall of just JoJo posters. </connor>
<joey> - Oh nice. - Of course. </joey>
<joey> - That'll be like- - Didn't you have that </joey>
<joey> in your old place? - No, no. </joey>
<joey> Literally, before you could see the walls. </joey>
<joey> I was going to make it like literally like 90% of the wall </joey>
<connor> is just Jojo posters. - Isn't it already? </connor>
<connor> - No but like, they had gaps, they had gaps. </connor>
<joey> I don't want gaps, I want it to be literally- </joey>
<connor> - Side by side by side. - The wall </connor>
<connor> is made out of JoJo. - The wall is JoJo. </connor>
<connor> The floor is JoJo. - But like, </connor>
<connor> how good of a shot would it be? </connor>
<connor> It's like just behind me, it's literally just Jojo. </connor>
<connor> That's so bad ass. - The wall is JoJo. </connor>
<joey> - So like, the way I attached it to the wall was like, </joey>
<connor> I wasn't sure if it would, it would like be able </connor>
<joey> to hold the posters 'cause this rubber stuff </joey>
<joey> that I got to prevent sound is fucking heavy. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Right. </joey>
<joey> - You bought a roll as well, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it is, it's massive. - Like, what is it? </joey>
<joey> 10 meters, it's a 10 meter roll. </joey>
<joey> - By like one meter wide, I think. </joey>
<joey> - One meter wide, 10 meters long and it's 20 kilograms </joey>
<joey> and it is so fucking heavy. - You put that on your wall? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly, right? - How? </joey>
<joey> - With great difficulty and so I was concerned, I was like, </joey>
<joey> the way I attached to it, I was like, </joey>
<joey> I wonder if it will stay if I then put posters on it. </joey>
<joey> So before I left for my trip, I attached the posters </joey>
<joey> and I was like, hopefully when I come back, </joey>
<joey> my wall will be intact and luckily it's intact. </joey>
<joey> - It's intact, yeah. - Should be fine </joey>
<joey> but the poster frames I have are extremely light. </joey>
<joey> They're like the lightest poster frames I could find. </joey>
<connor> - Oh yeah, then you should be all right. </connor>
<joey> - Should be fine, - Should be fine. </joey>
<connor> - Hopefully, be really awkward </connor>
<connor> if I'm streaming one day and my whole wall </connor>
<garnt> just fucking comes down. - I feel like the big test </garnt>
<garnt> is going to be in summer, right or next summer. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm just going to leave my AC on all the time. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm not risking it. - Really, all the time? </garnt>
<garnt> - That's what I did in my current place, because you know, </garnt>
<garnt> the electricity bill, right, if you have, I had like what, </garnt>
<garnt> like 20 grand of computer equipment in my room </garnt>
<connor> and filming equipment, the AC bill to have it </connor>
<connor> running all the time is what like </connor>
<connor> maybe an extra 200, 300 bucks for the whole summer? </connor>
<joey> - Well, yeah, it depends on how long you have it on for, </joey>
<connor> I guess. - So for the summer period, </connor>
<joey> just to leave it on, I'll pay that much </joey>
<joey> just to have my equipment be fine. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that's true. - Humidity </joey>
<connor> fucks your microphones and cameras and PC equipment. </connor>
<connor> I would rather just have the whole room AC'ed 24/7. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I'm thinking to invest in a dehumidifier </joey>
<connor> just to put around my-. - Just get a dehumidifier. </connor>
<garnt> Yeah. - I have a dehumidifier in my- </garnt>
<joey> - As like a Southeast Asian, I'm just like, </joey>
<garnt> part of my soul is dying when I hear AC is on 24/7, man. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no, you can just put the AC on dehumidify. </garnt>
<garnt> There's a setting for dehumidify. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, that's true. - So I'll leave it on that. </garnt>
<connor> - Okay, okay, okay, what happens if the, </connor>
<garnt> when the AC inevitably breaks? </garnt>
<garnt> - It's a good AC, it's not breaking. </garnt>
<garnt> - Didn't your AC break? - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> One of the other AC is broken. </joey>
<joey> - So what's to say it won's happen in your room? </joey>
<joey> - The other one for two years was fine. </joey>
<connor> I'll deal with it when it breaks. </connor>
<connor> It'll be down for like three days at most. </connor>
<connor> It's fine. - Right, right. </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause like I grew up with like, I grew up with my parents </garnt>
<garnt> beating into me, that just like, "Look, </garnt>
<garnt> the world could be on fucking fire right now </garnt>
<garnt> but you're not telling on that AC unless you like really, </garnt>
<connor> really need to" - Also, I'm probably gonna </connor>
<garnt> get a bunch of comments being like, </garnt>
<connor> Connor's wasting so much electricity. </connor>
<connor> He's not in the room" </connor>
<connor> and I'm like, "No, no, </connor>
<garnt> I'm saving the money for not replacing the equipment" </garnt>
<joey> - He's saving the equipment. - Like the devil </joey>
<joey> could be raising hell right outside a window </joey>
<connor> and you're not turning on the AC. </connor>
<connor> - No, fuck that, sometimes I go to my mate's house </connor>
<garnt> in summer it's fucking roasting, </garnt>
<connor> I'm like, "Why are you like this? </connor>
<joey> Why do you hate yourself?" - I mean, the summer, </joey>
<joey> it's like the devil came back from hell </joey>
<joey> and planted his ass crack on the earth. </joey>
<connor> - It's like, if you can withstand that </connor>
<connor> and you can live in a sauna, that's fine. </connor>
<connor> I'm not going to judge you, you can live in that. </connor>
<joey> Don't come to my fucking house </joey>
<joey> and tell me to turn my AC off. </joey>
<connor> I didn't choose to live a life like this. </connor>
<garnt> I didn't want to live on hard mode. </garnt>
<connor> I know I don't need to, I'm not going to. </connor>
<garnt> Fuck off, don't come to my house and tell me that. </garnt>
<joey> - I'm going to do exactly that </joey>
<joey> next time I come to your house. </joey>
<joey> - I'm going to go mom mode and just be like, </joey>
<joey> "I can't believe you're wasting all this electricity" </joey>
<joey> - "Think of the electricity bill, Connor" </joey>
<garnt> - I couldn't care less, you know. </garnt>
<connor> - "Think of the electricity bill, my God" </connor>
<connor> - Listen, I've lived like that, </connor>
<joey> I don't need to live like that. </joey>
<connor> I make good money now, I don't need to worry about that. </connor>
<connor> - I just feel sorry for your AC, man, it's just like, </connor>
<garnt> oh, I'm getting a break sometime, right? </garnt>
<connor> - In the new place as well they installed, </connor>
<connor> like those industrial ones, you have them as well. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, built into the ceiling. </joey>
<connor> - Right, right, right. - Looks pretty modern. </connor>
<connor> Really nice. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> Lifesaver that. - It's beautiful. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I just noticed that this AC is not on </connor>
<connor> and it's already cold. - Yeah, I mean, </connor>
<garnt> it's thankfully cooled down this week. </garnt>
<joey> Are we still technically in summer? </joey>
<garnt> I don't even know - We are technically </garnt>
<joey> in summer, this like past week we've had this </joey>
<joey> like rain, this torrential rain from this like cold front </joey>
<joey> coming in from Hokkaido. </joey>
<joey> and there's been light flood warnings </joey>
<connor> in like the greater Tokyo area and I'm just like, oh man, </connor>
<connor> this typhoon season is really fucking off. </connor>
<joey> I looked at the news, it's not even typhoon. </joey>
<joey> - No, no, it's not a typhoon, no. </joey>
<joey> - It's just rain, and I'm like, </joey>
<joey> how is it raining more than a typhoon right now? </joey>
<garnt> - Just cause like seasons in Japan just don't make sense </garnt>
<connor> to me, like you wake up one day and then Japan just decided, </connor>
<connor> okay, summer's over, we're in the next season now. </connor>
<joey> - It's snowing now. - Yeah, winter's over, </joey>
<joey> we're in the next season, there is no fucking </joey>
<joey> transition period. </joey>
<joey> You wake up one day and you suddenly go from like dying </joey>
<joey> in the heat to like, oh you got to wear trousers </joey>
<garnt> and long shirts now and long sleeves. </garnt>
<joey> - The statement of "Japan has four seasons" </joey>
<garnt> is the biggest lie of the century. </garnt>
<garnt> - No. - It does not. </garnt>
<joey> - It has two seasons cot, cold or hot. </joey>
<joey> - Cot. - Cold or hot. </joey>
<connor> That's the only two seasons, there is no in between. </connor>
<garnt> - You know how you go to that one place and someone's like, </garnt>
<garnt> oh you don't like the weather? </garnt>
<garnt> Just wait five minutes, ha ha ha ha, in Japan it's like, </garnt>
<garnt> you don't like the season, just wait a few days </garnt>
<connor> and it'll change. - Just leave the country. </connor>
<connor> - Don't put your jacket away, you're going to need it </connor>
<joey> in about three days, guaranteed. </joey>
<garnt> - And then there's England, right? </garnt>
<joey> Where I never know what the appropriate way to dress is </joey>
<joey> in England, like if it's summer, </joey>
<joey> do I wear a long sleeve still? </joey>
<joey> Still do I wear short sleeves, do I wear shorts? </joey>
<joey> Do I bring a coat with me, I just like, </joey>
<garnt> England is the place where it's always acceptable </garnt>
<garnt> to bring a coat just in case. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't, what am I supposed to pack? </connor>
<garnt> We're going to England, I don't know what to wear. </garnt>
<connor> - I genuinely don't. - Do I, what I have to wear? </connor>
<connor> Can I get away with shirts, do I have to- </connor>
<joey> - Do I need to bring the drip? </joey>
<joey> - I don't know, how much drip do I gotta bring? </joey>
<joey> - How much drip, is drip acceptable in the UK? </joey>
<connor> - How much, am I allowed to be drip? </connor>
<connor> - Am I allowed to be drip? (laughter) </connor>
<joey> - Am I allowed to be drip in the UK? </joey>
<connor> (Connor laughs) </connor>
<connor> - I don't know. - Yeah 'cause like, </connor>
<garnt> it's just one place where I go outside </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm just like, should I bring a coat with me? </garnt>
<garnt> And the answer is always yes. - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> You can never really go wrong with bringing a coat </connor>
<connor> in the UK, in Japan, I feel like a fucking clown </connor>
<connor> when I bring a coat in the summer. </connor>
<connor> - Well I mean, especially this time of year. </connor>
<joey> Yeah, have you noticed though that like </joey>
<joey> what you wear in the UK is completely different </joey>
<joey> to what you would normally wear here? </joey>
<joey> Like in terms of like sense of fashion? </joey>
<joey> Because I feel like, at least with me, like- </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Sometimes. - I wouldn't dress </joey>
<joey> like this in Australia, for instance. </joey>
<joey> - Why? - I don't know </joey>
<joey> because I feel that like, just in general, just, </joey>
<joey> I don't know, maybe it's just the area that I live in </joey>
<joey> but like Japan, I feel has definitely like, </joey>
<joey> put in like a different sense of fashion into me </joey>
<joey> than back in Australia, like it, </joey>
<joey> to me in Australia fashion was t-shirt, shorts, sandals. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I mean that's Australia, right? </connor>
<connor> I mean that was like- - Isn't that </connor>
<joey> the national motto of Australia? </joey>
<joey> - It's like, you'd feel fancy if you wore a pair of jeans, </joey>
<connor> you know, it's like that level, right? </connor>
<connor> But here it's like, I dunno, I feel weird </connor>
<joey> going out with t-shirts, shorts and sandals. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, I think, it's just living in a country </garnt>
<garnt> that's permanently in summer, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Because that's kind of me in Thailand </garnt>
<garnt> where if I'm not wearing t-shirts, shorts and sandals, </garnt>
<garnt> something special is happening, like, so it's like this, </garnt>
<garnt> like in England, you look for any opportunity you can </garnt>
<garnt> to wear shorts, in Thailand, you look </garnt>
<garnt> for any opportunity you can to wear jeans and long sleeves. </garnt>
<joey> - I want to wear jeans, I don't really like wearing shorts. </joey>
<joey> I don't really feel comfortable in them. </joey>
<connor> - Why? - I don't know. </connor>
<connor> - You don't like exposing your legs? </connor>
<connor> - Maybe I haven't found the right pair. </connor>
<joey> Yes, don't you sit on, I feel like I'm- </joey>
<joey> - Well, how short of shorts are you wearing, though? </joey>
<connor> - No, reasonably sized, reasonably sized. </connor>
<connor> - Right, right, right, right. - I feel like I can't enjoy </connor>
<connor> every surface, you know when you just sit down </connor>
<connor> on some things like wearing shorts, </connor>
<connor> I don't like how my skin touches this, geeze. </connor>
<joey> - What about like three quarter pants? </joey>
<connor> - Oh, those are a bit strange, aren't they? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, see, like it's weird, like something </joey>
<joey> like three quarter pants is completely normal here </joey>
<joey> but I would feel super fucking weird </joey>
<joey> if I wore three quarter pants </joey>
<joey> in Australia and it's not because of like the weather. </joey>
<joey> It's just because like, I wouldn't see anyone in Australia </joey>
<joey> just fashion wise wearing three quarter pants. </joey>
<garnt> - I just don't think shorts look very good. </garnt>
<connor> Like no, no, no, okay- - No one looks good in shorts. </connor>
<connor> - No look- - Every Australian </connor>
<joey> is offended. - No one looks better </joey>
<connor> in shorts than they would wearing like jeans or something. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - Okay because like, </garnt>
<garnt> it's sunny outside, okay, so people can look good </garnt>
<garnt> on the beach or whatever in shorts or whatever. </garnt>
<joey> Anytime you go inside, you sit down in the restaurant, </joey>
<joey> you look like a fucking clown, there is no exception </joey>
<joey> to not looking like a clown when you go inside </joey>
<joey> and you're wearing shorts, like there's like, </joey>
<joey> I'm watching like the Trash Tastes off the dark screen </joey>
<joey> and I'm just like, fucking hell, our legs look so ugly. </joey>
<connor> (laughter) </connor>
<connor> - It's just knees on knees on knees. </connor>
<connor> - And there's just so many knees, man. </connor>
<connor> - Too much skin going on. - And if it's just </connor>
<connor> like the three quarter pants, well we just like, </connor>
<connor> at that point you just have commitment issues. </connor>
<garnt> Just commit to shorts or commit to jeans. </garnt>
<garnt> Like please come on, just- - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - I think like, being from the UK, </connor>
<connor> I feel like fashion was never a high priority. </connor>
<joey> Especially in Wales. - Well, yeah </joey>
<joey> and I feel in the same way with Australia as well. </joey>
<connor> Like I feel just, I never even thought about </connor>
<connor> what I was wearing in Australia </connor>
<connor> because I look around me and I'm like, </connor>
<joey> I don't really see anyone who's like fashionable. </joey>
<connor> - People have so much fucking drip here. </connor>
<joey> It's insane. - Yeah, the drip here- </joey>
<joey> - People will just be going to work </joey>
<connor> and they'll be dressed like a fucking model. </connor>
<joey> It's nuts. - And I feel </joey>
<joey> that's why I almost, not so much pressured </joey>
<joey> but I guess I kind of, that made me look at myself, </joey>
<joey> reflect on myself - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> I feel like I have to step up my game, bro. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, I feel like London was pretty fashionable. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, everyone dresses the same, I feel. </garnt>
<garnt> - Really? - Everyone dresses the same, </garnt>
<garnt> I feel in London. - I feel like, </garnt>
<garnt> I would say that even maybe people in London </garnt>
<connor> have even more drip than people here in Tokyo. </connor>
<connor> That's my genuine opinion, you see someone- </connor>
<connor> - You have such shit takes (laughs) </connor>
<joey> - Why can we not agree over fucking London? (laughs) </joey>
<joey> You the architecture, I fucking hated it. </joey>
<garnt> I think London's a fashionable city. </garnt>
<connor> - You loo at like a fucking Primark or anything, </connor>
<connor> the models, everyone fucking dresses the same. </connor>
<garnt> - What are you fucking talking about? </garnt>
<garnt> Primark slaps, like, for what you get, </garnt>
<garnt> for the price, Primark fashion is fucking amazing. </garnt>
<connor> - Of course, for fucking child labor, </connor>
<connor> you can get some good clothes, you know. </connor>
<garnt> - Primark's a great place. - I remember one time, </garnt>
<connor> I bought 10 t-shirts for eight pounds in Primark </connor>
<connor> and I thought, fucking hell, who made a deal </connor>
<connor> with the devil here, why was this price able to go through? </connor>
<connor> - I've bought one thing at Primark </connor>
<joey> and it was a pair of eight Sonic the Hedgehog socks </joey>
<connor> for five pounds. - That's overpriced. </connor>
<joey> What the fuck, you got mugged off. </joey>
<joey> They're like one pound for eight socks. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah but I'm like- - I bought a whole suit </joey>
<connor> from Primark for like 30 quid and I'm like, </connor>
<connor> what the fuck, what happened? - I mean, </connor>
<connor> it looked decent, right, it looked decent. </connor>
<connor> - That's the problem, it looked good. </connor>
<connor> (laughter) </connor>
<garnt> - What do you mean, that's the problem? </garnt>
<garnt> - I think now I'm like, you know, we paid what? </garnt>
<joey> Like fucking 70 pounds for a t-shirt, no $70 for t-shirt, </joey>
<joey> so what, 40 pounds for a t-shirt, I now feel that, </joey>
<joey> you know, maybe it's because I have more money now. </joey>
<joey> Maybe it's because I'm not, I'm doing much better </joey>
<connor> for myself, I feel that, oh, I think I would rather pay 30, </connor>
<connor> $40 for a very good t-shirt as opposed to $8 </connor>
<garnt> for 10 t-shirts. - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah but like, that's the thing, </garnt>
<connor> the biggest thing I've noticed- </connor>
<connor> - I just think something's gone wrong. </connor>
<connor> - No, I feel like the biggest difference </connor>
<connor> since moving to Japan is that there were just </connor>
<garnt> more affordable options in high street </garnt>
<garnt> in high streets in the UK and that- </garnt>
<connor> - How much affordable is like, </connor>
<connor> we're cutting some severe human rights corners here. </connor>
<garnt> - Well, I'm like, no, this is like, I mean, that's going </garnt>
<garnt> to a different topic, we're talking about drip, </garnt>
<connor> right, people having drip, I feel like, </connor>
<connor> especially in London, a lot of people have the drip. </connor>
<connor> - Drip comes with a cost, guys. </connor>
<connor> With the blood, - Of course. </connor>
<connor> Of course, it comes with the cost. </connor>
<connor> - The poor children. - But like, </connor>
<connor> you look here and basically like, </connor>
<connor> it's just Uniqlo here and Uniqlo </connor>
<connor> and like a few other places here </connor>
<connor> but in England you just have a lot of choices </connor>
<connor> and there is like no equivalent to Primark, </connor>
<connor> I think worldwide, there's been nowhere </connor>
<garnt> in the world I've gone to, that is a really, </garnt>
<garnt> really cheap place to find clothes and just looks as good </garnt>
<garnt> as Primark, I'm just, I will happily still shop </garnt>
<garnt> at Primark now, I think Primark clothes </garnt>
<garnt> are like underrated just because it's cheap, </garnt>
<garnt> but you look at Primark clothes </garnt>
<garnt> and you could easily sell that for like- </garnt>
<connor> - I just always walk out with like five t-shirts </connor>
<connor> I'm never going to wear because I thought they looked good </connor>
<joey> in the store, 'cause it's so cheap </joey>
<connor> 'cause you're like, I'll have five. </connor>
<joey> - That's literally me at Uniqlos. </joey>
<garnt> - It's literally like the Primark is the equivalent </garnt>
<garnt> of going to an all you can eat buffet at a restaurant. </garnt>
<connor> Right, you're just like, maybe I feel like </connor>
<connor> having an Indian curry and a pizza </connor>
<connor> at the same time, you know? - Sick hearing now. </connor>
<connor> I don't wanna hear that combination. </connor>
<connor> - But it's just like you do it </connor>
<connor> because you're just like, well, I just got so much choice. </connor>
<garnt> I just, maybe we'll have a bit of Mexican as well </garnt>
<garnt> and a bit of Chinese and it's just, </garnt>
<garnt> and it's an absolute fucking mess. </garnt>
<connor> - My fight or flight response </connor>
<connor> is kicking in just hearing that. </connor>
<joey> - And then you shit yourself violently </joey>
<joey> and then you wipe it away with magic, you know? </joey>
<joey> - Fine, Garnt. - Bring it back. </joey>
<joey> - You can have it, yeah, sure, drip, yeah. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<garnt> - Wait, so are you saying Primark is drip? </garnt>
<joey> - I'm not saying Primark is drip. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, I just had to make sure. </joey>
<joey> - I'm saying Primark is affordable drip, it doesn't look- </joey>
<joey> - That's an oxymoron. - Why, why? </joey>
<joey> - I don't know, like, what is drip? </joey>
<connor> - Expensive clothes, just- - Drip is like- </connor>
<garnt> - I thought it was just clothes that look good. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah but it's kind of like the Hypebeast stuff as well. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh fuck off, fuck off, drip, that just means </garnt>
<garnt> that good drip, you know, you have to buy brand name shit. </garnt>
<joey> - That's kind of what it was. - Usually. </joey>
<garnt> - That's what it was. - That's usually, </garnt>
<connor> that what is was originally. - It's kind of </connor>
<connor> been developed a bit more now and kind of hijacked </connor>
<connor> to be more of just good clothes. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, just fashionable clothing, right? </joey>
<garnt> - Just fashionable clothing, that's what I, that's what, </garnt>
<joey> when I heard drip, that's what I always thought it was, </joey>
<joey> you know, sometimes brand name clothes. </joey>
<joey> - That's what a person would think. </joey>
<garnt> - Fuck off, fuck off. - That's what someone </garnt>
<joey> who doesn't wear drip would say. </joey>
<joey> (laughter) </joey>
<garnt> - Are you telling me that every brand name's stuff </garnt>
<garnt> looks good, there are equally as many brand name stuff </garnt>
<connor> that I'm just like, this looks like absolute dog turd </connor>
<connor> and if I see someone wearing that, </connor>
<connor> I'm going to think they have zero drip. </connor>
<garnt> You can wear a Louis, that could be Louis Vuitton </garnt>
<joey> and I could think it looks like shit. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I get that but at the same time, you know, </garnt>
<joey> if I was like walking down the strip, flaunting off my drip, </joey>
<joey> right and then someone came up to me and was like, </joey>
<joey> "That drip's sick, where'd you get that?" </joey>
<joey> I wouldn't like be like, Primark. </joey>
<garnt> I'm not going to say that. - I'll fucking say that. </garnt>
<garnt> If it looks good, who the fuck gives a shit? </garnt>
<connor> If it looks like, if you look like you have drip, </connor>
<connor> then you have drip, I couldn't matter where it comes from. </connor>
<garnt> It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter where he comes from. </garnt>
<garnt> - Garnt, fighting for the everyday man. </garnt>
<garnt> - I copped this piece from Walmart. </garnt>
<garnt> - This is from The Gap. - Yeah, Tarjay. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, fashion is like the biggest fucking scam there is. </garnt>
<garnt> Are you saying to me- - I don't know. </garnt>
<connor> I just want to, I just want to say, </connor>
<connor> I don't feel bad about buying now. </connor>
<connor> I just want something that lasts as well. </connor>
<joey> - I'm obviously not going to like, you know, </joey>
<joey> fucking go to every high-end place </joey>
<joey> and buy like $500 t-shirts or something like that. </joey>
<connor> - I've bought so many t-shirts from Primark </connor>
<connor> that I sweat in once and it is like permanently stained. </connor>
<garnt> I can not get those orange pits out to save my life. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, that's why you buy five of them, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, that's the problem is I feel bad </garnt>
<joey> about buying a shirt that I bin immediately </joey>
<joey> after I have one bad summer or I go </joey>
<joey> to one Indian restaurant. - Like why buy five shirts? </joey>
<connor> - I mean, I mean, the fabric is like, </connor>
<garnt> definitely low quality fabric, right? </garnt>
<connor> - See, that's the problem, I don't want to buy a shirt </connor>
<connor> that I feel like I can only get two, </connor>
<connor> three good wears out of. - Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<garnt> - That's what you pay for when you pay for cheap fabrics. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's what I'm saying, like, </garnt>
<joey> why don't you use that money to just </joey>
<joey> buy one good quality one that'll last you and is more- </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, Garnt, I see you hating the environment. </connor>
<garnt> Fuck you with your t-shirts. - What has that </garnt>
<joey> got to do with drip, though? - Because- </joey>
<joey> - If you look good, you look good, I'm just fucking saying. </joey>
<connor> - Fuck the planet, fuck those little kids </connor>
<connor> making those shirts, you got drip at affordable price. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, you've just been brainwashed </garnt>
<garnt> by the fashion industry to say this looks good </garnt>
<garnt> because it's expensive and has a brand's name, you know? </garnt>
<connor> - No, I also think that you pay for the quality material </connor>
<joey> that lasts a while. - Yeah, I agree. </joey>
<garnt> - The quality material doesn't always equate. </garnt>
<connor> - Like Glam, right? - We buy those Glam shirts </connor>
<joey> right they're, like 60 bucks a t-shirt. </joey>
<joey> - Sometimes 80 bucks. - I have got </joey>
<joey> some serious mileage out of those shirts. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. - No, so I'm not arguing- </garnt>
<garnt> - And that shit's dripy. - Yeah, dude. </garnt>
<garnt> - If people are like, oh, it's $60 a t-shirt. </garnt>
<connor> Bro, how many of those t-shirts have you bought </connor>
<connor> from like Primark and shit that like are fucking garbage </connor>
<garnt> after like five washes. - I'm not arguing that </garnt>
<garnt> but I'm arguing that you can buy good quality, </garnt>
<garnt> good looking stuff for a lot cheaper than you can get </garnt>
<garnt> for Glam and everything like that. </garnt>
<connor> - I just think fast fashion is like bad for the environment. </connor>
<connor> It's just bad in general, I just think you should </connor>
<joey> buy shirts that- - Just buy something </joey>
<garnt> that lasts. - Buy something that lasts. </garnt>
<garnt> - He's saying that he, I mean, </garnt>
<garnt> you saying that a t-shirt should always be like $30, </garnt>
<joey> minimum, 30, $50 dollars minimum? </joey>
<joey> - It's not so much about the price for me. </joey>
<joey> It's about like what it's made of, right? </joey>
<connor> And like if it'll last. - I have so many t-shirts </connor>
<connor> that I don't wear because I just have too many t-shirts </connor>
<connor> because a lot of them, I would just buy </connor>
<connor> because they were cheap. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> I would never end up wearing them. </connor>
<connor> I would always wear the nicer shirts that I could clean- </connor>
<garnt> - Didn't you also say that you just, </garnt>
<garnt> you don't wash jeans, you just throw them away </garnt>
<connor> and buy new ones? - I would wear a pair </connor>
<connor> of jeans for like two years until they are fucked. </connor>
<connor> I wear the same pair of jeans over and over again. </connor>
<connor> - You don't wash your jeans? - I will, </connor>
<joey> I would rarely wash them, you don't need to wash jeans. </joey>
<joey> - Why are we talking about dripping advice? </joey>
<garnt> (off camera laughter) </garnt>
<garnt> - You don't need to wash jeans. </garnt>
<garnt> - We are taking drip advice from this guy. </garnt>
<garnt> - You don't need to wash jeans. </garnt>
<joey> - We're taking drip advice from a guy </joey>
<garnt> who doesn't wash his jeans. - Hey, Google. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm sorry, who is the peasant here, Connor? </garnt>
<garnt> I'm sorry, who is the fucking peasant here? </garnt>
<joey> - Do you need to wash jeans? - Look, I will argue right, </joey>
<joey> that yes, like you could buy a $10 shirt, right? </joey>
<joey> From Primark or something and you can, you know, </joey>
<joey> you can layer with something cheap </joey>
<joey> and you can make it look good but what I'm saying </joey>
<joey> is the average Primark buyer- - You should never </joey>
<connor> wash a pair of jeans is one of the CEO </connor>
<garnt> of a jean company says. - The CEO of a jean company? </garnt>
<connor> - Particularly, if it's a good quality jean. </connor>
<joey> - Said Michael Jean, the creator of jeans. </joey>
<connor> - If it's a good quality jean, you don't need to wash it. </connor>
<connor> - I will- - You just spot wash </connor>
<connor> that shit, you got to stain, just get rid of the stain. </connor>
<garnt> - I do not know enough about this topic. </garnt>
<connor> - Genuinely, genuinely, you don't need to- </connor>
<connor> - To be fair. - I don't trust your- </connor>
<connor> (laughter) </connor>
<joey> I'm just saying, I don't know enough about this topic. </joey>
<joey> - Smell my jeans, Garnt, smell my jeans. </joey>
<joey> - Get that shit out of my face, man. </joey>
<garnt> Get that out of my face. - They smell fresh, bro. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's that musky shit. - I've been sweating in these. </garnt>
<garnt> They smell good, give them a sniff. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's just, that is drip, that's dripping </garnt>
<garnt> with your fucking sweat, Connor. </garnt>
<garnt> Is that what you're talking about when you mean drip? </garnt>
<joey> - Bro, there's some stains here </joey>
<joey> that I should got to spot clean off. </joey>
<joey> - Garnt, do you know how many people </joey>
<connor> would pay for that experience? </connor>
<joey> - Smell my jeans, bro. - Smell Connor's jeans. </joey>
<joey> - Give them a sniff. - Get that shit </joey>
<joey> out of my face, man. - Smell his jeans. </joey>
<joey> Smell it. - Smells good. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah? - Yeah, man, give them a wiff. </joey>
<connor> - Would you say that after wearing them in summer? </connor>
<garnt> No. - I don't like </garnt>
<garnt> washing my jeans because, and frankly as well, </garnt>
<joey> I don't like how they feel after you do wash them. </joey>
<joey> They feel horrible the first time you wear them </joey>
<joey> after you wash jeans, they feel all like crinkly </joey>
<connor> and you got to wear them back in again, I don't like that. </connor>
<joey> - Well, I mean that's if you do like a cold wash though. </joey>
<joey> - No, no, warm wash. - If you do a warm wash </joey>
<connor> where it doesn't like shrink, then it's fine. </connor>
<connor> - No, it still does it. - Really? </connor>
<joey> You're buying the cheap jeans, then. </joey>
<connor> - I'm just-- </connor>
<connor> No, no, no, Uniqlo's finest. </connor>
<connor> (laughter) </connor>
<joey> - I mean, to be fair, Uniqlo does do good jeans. </joey>
<connor> - I'm just saying you don't, you don't need wash jeans. </connor>
<joey> - I mean- - I just, </joey>
<joey> I wear the same pair of jeans. </joey>
<joey> Like I don't have multiple, I only have one pair of jeans. </joey>
<connor> When it breaks, I just buy a new one. </connor>
<connor> When it gets holes, buy a new one. </connor>
<connor> When it's, a stain's too deep, I get a new one. </connor>
<connor> That's is pretty much all I do. </connor>
<connor> - Have you considered like, you know </connor>
<joey> like removing the color from your shirts. </joey>
<connor> - I want my jeans to look fresh. </connor>
<joey> - Just soft wash everything. - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - You don't need to wash jeans. </connor>
<joey> - Well, there you go, the drip king has spoken. </joey>
<garnt> You don't need to wash jeans. - It's the King of Drip. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, I just think fashion is bullshit. </joey>
<garnt> Don't worry about how much you spend. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, it's- - Glad to know </garnt>
<connor> that you have Trash Taste, Garnt. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean like, okay, like, the one thing I never got, </garnt>
<joey> for example was Supreme, right? </joey>
<joey> - Okay, that's a different caliber. </joey>
<garnt> - What you mean that's a different caliber? </garnt>
<garnt> It all comes down to drip, right? </garnt>
<joey> - No, no like Supreme- - That's different. </joey>
<garnt> - How is it, it's literally a brand name </garnt>
<garnt> that's expensive as fuck. - No, that's not, </garnt>
<joey> that's not a brand, that's a meme. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, that's a man. - Yeah, Supreme is a fucking, </connor>
<joey> at this point- - It's not a meme. </joey>
<joey> - They made a crow bar, no one is going around being like, </joey>
<joey> this posh. - They made a brick. </joey>
<joey> - This is not a company that is in the business </joey>
<connor> of making extremely high quality stuff. </connor>
<connor> It's in the business of making scarce stuff. </connor>
<garnt> - To this point- - At this point, it is a meme </garnt>
<garnt> but it wasn't always a meme, if you go </garnt>
<garnt> to any Asian country back when it was like in their prime </garnt>
<garnt> and people had Supreme on just because it was expensive </garnt>
<garnt> and it was one of the biggest brand names at that point. </garnt>
<connor> - It wasn't like good quality. </connor>
<joey> - It wasn't good quality, Supreme was a skate brand. </joey>
<connor> - Supreme isn't like a daily wear brand. </connor>
<joey> - Like skateboarders used to wear, </joey>
<joey> that was like made for skateboarding. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah but for the longest time, that was drip. </garnt>
<garnt> That was drip, right? - No. </garnt>
<joey> - You can't argue with me, you can't. </joey>
<joey> - There hasn't been a single, like in my opinion, </joey>
<connor> there hasn't been a single piece of Supreme shirts </connor>
<joey> or anything where I was like, that's drip. </joey>
<connor> - I feel like the old definition of drip was brand. </connor>
<joey> Was brand. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> Brands like Gucci, Louis Vuitton, </joey>
<joey> all that kind of stuff. - But I feel like now, </joey>
<joey> because it's been adopted so much </joey>
<joey> and used so much over the last few months, </joey>
<joey> it does just mean looking good. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah and I'm just saying, you don't need </garnt>
<garnt> to fucking buy expensive stuff or brand name stuff </garnt>
<garnt> to have drip, you don't. - No, you don't </garnt>
<connor> You also shouldn't be buying 10 t-shirts for $5. </connor>
<joey> - You also shouldn't be wearing a Primark shirt </joey>
<joey> and calling it drip. - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - I think you can call it a drip. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just saying if you layer it right. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, okay, if you layer it right </garnt>
<joey> but there isn't a single person going to Primark </joey>
<joey> and being like, time to buy some drip. </joey>
<joey> No one goes to Primark thinking that. </joey>
<connor> - Also, if you spend $30 t-shirt right? </connor>
<joey> I think that's a worthwhile investment. </joey>
<joey> You're wearing this shit every day. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, if it looks good. - That $30 t-shirt </joey>
<joey> is going to last you longer than those three 10 pound shirt. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, 100%. - Yeah, probably. </garnt>
<garnt> Like all I'm not saying don't buy $30 t-shirts </garnt>
<garnt> if it looks, all I'm saying is if it looks good, </garnt>
<joey> it looks good, doesn't matter about the price. </joey>
<garnt> Doesn't matter about the fucking brand name. </garnt>
<garnt> Like it's all a scam, anyway because- </garnt>
<joey> - I think at that point, it literally just comes to like, </joey>
<garnt> that person's personal preference of like, </garnt>
<garnt> do they consider this drip or no? </garnt>
<connor> - I'm just saying, I think we're fucking dumb. </connor>
<connor> I think we're just really fucking dumb. </connor>
<garnt> (laughter) </garnt>
<connor> - What the fuck does that mean? </connor>
<connor> - Don't put words in my mouth. </connor>
<connor> - I think this is a shit debate. </connor>
<joey> - Like three people who have no idea in fashion </joey>
<connor> being like, what is drip? - I feel </connor>
<connor> like I'm arguing the best way to perform open heart surgery. </connor>
<connor> I feel like I'm really not qualified to be discussing this. </connor>
<connor> - Obviously, wearing Supreme. - Not none of us are </connor>
<connor> but wait, when are we ever qualified </connor>
<joey> to talk about the things we- - We're never qualified </joey>
<connor> to talk about shit we argue about. </connor>
<connor> - Three weaves discuss drip, we're possibly the three least </connor>
<joey> qualified people to talk about drip. </joey>
<joey> That doesn't mean I'm not going to argue. </joey>
<garnt> - That's Trash Taste. - You know who do </garnt>
<connor> has drip though, our patrons. - They do, they do. </connor>
<connor> - Because they are dripping the funds </connor>
<joey> into the picture. - Man, this guy is dripping, </joey>
<connor> man, he probably owns 10 Supreme. </connor>
<joey> - Look at these Hypebeasts right here. </joey>
<joey> Look at all of them, amazing, hey, </joey>
<connor> if you'd like to join the Hypebeast gang, </connor>

<connor> what the was this episode even about? </connor>
<connor> - This was a very long episode. </connor>
<joey> How long have we been recording for? </joey>
<joey> - We talked about scams. - Fuck me. </joey>
<joey> - We talked about scams, Harry Potter shit and drip. </joey>
<connor> - And Toy Story. - And Toy Story. </connor>
<garnt> - And Toy Story and we somehow talked about Eva as well. </garnt>
<connor> I completely forgot. - And Eva as well. </connor>
<connor> - We forgot that we just talked about Eva. </connor>
<joey> - Shinji is BoJack Horseman. - Shinji is BoJack. </joey>
<joey> Shits disappear in Harry Potter </joey>
<joey> and you can buy drip from Primark. </joey>
<joey> That's three things you should take out of it. </joey>
<joey> - Hagrid fists. - Hagrid fists. </joey>
<joey> - All right, bye guys. - Bye. </joey>
