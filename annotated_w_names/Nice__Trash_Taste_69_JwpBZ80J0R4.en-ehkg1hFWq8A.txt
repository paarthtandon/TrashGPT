<SPEAKER_02> (whoosh)
(pops) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Ooh! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wait, how do you do that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (whoosh)
(farts) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, you wish you knew
the powers of my (farts). </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs)
Okay, hold on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (pops)
- Oh, it's bass. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (calm music) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Where's my lid? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Ashley] You need the lid? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Of course I need to lid,
it's a collection item. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Whoa!
(loopy tune) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It needs the lid. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why do you have a mug
with no liquid in it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Ashley] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, why are you asking for a lid? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, why are you asking for a lid </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> if you're not gonna
drink coffee out of it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Ashley] Do you need coffee? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I need this air to be nice and cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I do actually, but also you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think of this mug as a collectors piece, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as should the viewers who bought it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and it should always have the lid on it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, but there's... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, you don't have like Santa Claus </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> without the red suit on,
you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Like you don't have the Trash
Taste mug without the lid. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, but you just gotta, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you have like a coffee cup right there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And you have like a
mug that's just unused. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Here, get this outta here, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> why is there a lid on the floor? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Did you drink the coffee not
out of the Trash Taste mug? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Navi] This dude has been
doing that for a lot of things. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't like transferring
liquids from like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Fake Trash Taste fan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I also want my Trash Taste mug. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't like transferring
liquids (laughs). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I like the mug. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Look at this man's mug! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Look at this shit! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> How did you get this shit all on there? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Dude, I've been drinking out of it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - This doesn't look like drinking. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is a used mug. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Used? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> You fucking slobbered all over it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> half the coffees on the fucking mug. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Have you seen this man drink? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, he (licks). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He's like, he doesn't
know where his mouth is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Garnt is like a person
who used to be a dog </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in another life, but
just never forgot how to. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - He drinks like his mouth. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Are you kidding me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I would love to be a dog in my next life, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or this current life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Dogs have the easiest
fucking lives in existence. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Dogs and cats. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You just do nothing all day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - They piss, shit and
unconditionally love, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that's all they do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's what a dog is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I watched a... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Have we done our intro yet? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, we haven't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Hi, this is the intro, Joey's the host. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yes, hello Sonic fans, I'm
Joey, welcome to Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm with Garnt and Connor. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Episode 69, this deserves more. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Hey!
- More of an intro than that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I texted Felix earlier when we found out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that this was episode 69,
'cause a little backstory. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> So, you know, Felix, who, PewDiePie, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who we've been trying to get on the show, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can't come to Japan 'cause you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> obviously 'cause of the world situation. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> So, well we hoped that
by episode 69, hopefully, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he would have been able to come. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Obviously he couldn't. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> So I texted him and said, I'm sorry, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Didn't he specifically
say reserve episode 69? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, he was like, Joey,
if I'm not on episode 69, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I am just not coming on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause I remember you telling me that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> in like episode two or three or something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just when Trash Taste
started and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are we even gonna be
around for episode 69? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Are we even gonna have
an audience by then? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I was like, wow, Felix, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you're very positive thinker to be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thinking 65 episodes ahead. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was just like, I couldn't
even envision episode 69 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I was just like, I'll
be happy if we can last a year. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Break even with the podcast. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's weird to think that
we're probably gonna reach </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> a 100 episodes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's scary isn't it?
- I was gonna be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which episode Trash Taste did this in? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh, it's 179, actually. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's weird to think
that that could be a thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Scary.
- 'Cause when I see Joe Rogan, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like episode 800 or
something, I'm like fuck! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - But doesn't he record
three episodes a week </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> or something like that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's once every two days. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Holy, and
they're four hours long. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - The man loves to talk, man.
- Holy fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I thought I run out of
topics to talk about. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, right?
- Oh my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know, just sitting
through one episode of Joe Rogan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really makes me appreciate
just how much shit, A, he knows </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and B, how good he is at
stretching out a single topic. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No, but seriously, because
after 800-something episodes, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> four hours at a time, you
have to learn to like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, I feel like when you're very, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you do talk about current topics </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you very much get
involved with politics. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - But as well, even if
it's not current topics, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> he's very good at kind
of really extensively </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> going into a topic to the point where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a topic that can last maybe, what, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> 10 minutes on Trash Taste, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can last up to an hour
on the Joe Rogan show. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - He really stretching
out that 15 minute mark. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - He's really thinning
out his call center. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just kidding (laughs). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - How many ads can we fit in here? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> No, I mean, when you talk about politics, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they suddenly turn what could
be two-minute conversations </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> into 10 hours. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That is true. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Maybe we should do that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Are you fucking kidding me?
- I don't wanna do that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Are you kidding me? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I think the reason people
come to watch Trash Taste </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is to escape political nonsense. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I come to Trash Taste </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to escape a lot of political nonsense. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just like, I just
wanna talk with the boys. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Everyone who talks about
it, I feel like it's not, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'd feel like no one is
educated enough about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so, when everyone talks about it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know which level of education </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you need in this topic. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> But I feel that no one has enough </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause everyone seems to always
have some fucking argument </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I'm like, what the fuck is going on? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - The problem with a lot
of political topics is... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Ah, thank you man, is
that the Trash Taste mug? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Are you gonna drink coffee out of it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - You bet your ass I am. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I'll take the lid
as well, give me the lids. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, 'cause I completely agree. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause a lot of the times
there are some topics </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> where you just genuinely don't
know which side to listen to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause both sides are just
at each other's throat. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm just like, I don't feel like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Every time someone brings up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> some kind of political
conversation because I, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> A, just don't really care
about politics in general </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and B, I'm again, not
knowledgeable about it anyway. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You don't care about
politics in general? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No.
- That's taking a stance </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> in itself, Joey.
- Yeah, wow, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - See that's privilege,
to be able to not care. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - But like everything, it
doesn't matter what it is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It could be like the most far left thing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it could be the most far right thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And my only two answers
is just, "Oh, that sucks". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Or, "Oh, that's good", I guess. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I keep up with it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I do also really
despise the era we're in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where it's all. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Everything is political?
- Well, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, it's not that
everything's political, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it's everyone has to be involved in it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and has to be educated in it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Everyone needs an opinion about it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like the main players
are all just YouTubers, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm like, I don't trust YouTubers. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm a YouTuber, I don't
trust other YouTubers. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't trust myself. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Don't trust yourself. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I know what we're like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I know for a fact that
these people cannot be doing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that good of a job. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And when I listen to them,
I'm like, okay, this is fine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> You know, to me, it's also
been highly monetized now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like money has become
such a big player in it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that I don't wanna watch any
of these people on YouTube </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> telling me about why they believe X person </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> has no rights or whatever. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause it's like, you
got a horse in this race </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to talk about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You gotta get people
angry and upset about it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so you can get dollars. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's something in it for you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Which is why I also hate it a lot </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and I also just don't really
like talking about it online </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause it's a shitshow. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And also, everyone has their own opinions. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It is a shitshow and I
just feel like some things </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> are just better discussed
in private with the person, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because there's only so much you can say </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in 140 characters on Twitter. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And that's unfortunately </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> where a lot of these
opinions are being spread </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's easy to, one,
misrepresent your own ideas </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and two, other people to
misrepresent your ideas. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And might take it out of context. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It just seems like a
lose-lose situation for me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and two, I don't know why it's just so bad </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> or why more people just don't agree </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that sometimes you just
aren't educated enough </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or you just don't know
enough about a topic </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to just have an opinion on it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, and you say that and, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like there's so many things now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where we just have so much
information on topics, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where, yeah okay, maybe someone can, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> two parties can present the
complete opposite argument, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but there's enough information </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where they can kind of
both make that point </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because they have enough points
that work with one person </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and enough points that
work with the other. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, okay, well I can
get educated on all of it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then when you do try and
educate yourself on everything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> in a certain situation, you just realize, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just hate all of this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Everything is just
fucked and nothing works. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Pretty much. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's no right answer.
- What do I do? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I've gotten to
that point a lot of times </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where it's just like, how
do I fix this problem? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I have absolutely no fucking clue. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't even know where to start. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The more I read, the
more depressed I feel. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - And the rest of the
world was like, first time? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> No one knows the answer and
that's why we're arguing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like the whole thing with the, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you should reduce your energy usage </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to help combat global warming. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then it's just the whole thing of, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but then also like BP is like spilling </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the entire oil supply to the ocean. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's like, well, I feel
like I'm not really the problem. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like it's not really me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but then you see that and people get angry </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then it's like, well,
but then you're like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well change it, we should
vote against these companies. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> But that's been proven that doesn't, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it doesn't really fucking
work half the time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause clearly someone makes a new rule </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that they can go and harvest..
- The whole game is busted. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So no matter how many
times you change the rules, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just not gonna
turn out to be the game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you wanna play. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It sucks! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It all fucking sucks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It does, and that's why
we don't talk about it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> on Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It always goes to the negative for me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is why I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm on Trash Taste with the boys, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just wanna shut off
the internet for a while. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I wanna talk about how I
wanna be reincarnated as a dog. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's okay to stop caring, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> there's just too much,
there's way too much. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause right now we're just
so overloaded with information </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and things to care about. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I literally gotta shit
myself if somebody sneeze </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> within two feet of me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and now I gotta worry
about what's going on? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, in multiple countries now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm a UK, I live in Japan, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> gotta keep up with dual politics? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's the biggest thing
that's changed, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Because before, everyone
only needed to care </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about what was around them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And now being people on the internet, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I have to care about
everything going on globally. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it gets to the point </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> where there are so many
different cultures, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so many different points of view, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so many different like experiences </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that each individual has had, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that sometimes it's
impossible for a lot of people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> to get the same viewpoint on things. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because even for us who've
lived in multiple countries </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and have had experience
with multiple cultures. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You can say we're cultured ourselves. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Saying this in like the
pure, unironic sense, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because you get this
sense whenever I go home, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or whenever I hear about
any of us going home </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you see people who have
stayed in their home towns </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you see people who have
not left their home towns </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and they have the exact same viewpoint </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that they got raised on, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And coming from the place, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you kind of understand how
they got that viewpoint </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> even though you don't agree with it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But you also understand that
they don't have anything </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> to really change their viewpoint in there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because they've never
experienced anything else. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's no new information that comes in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to stimulate that change
in thought process. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So forever they just think,
well this is correct, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because this is what
it was like around me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know about anything else </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's happening in the world, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so this is just how I'm
going to see the world. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> But then, for instance, I
remember when I first came back </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to Australia after I was living here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I would go see my
friends and stuff like that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who have been there the entire time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I dunno, things that I
remember I used to be able </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to very heavily relate with
and kind of almost agree upon, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I found myself to be like,
oh, is this how I felt? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Is this really what my
thought process was like? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's so weird because
like that didn't even happen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> in that much of a large space of time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Like that only maybe happened
in two years or something, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of just living here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I think definitely doing
YouTube and stuff like that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> has got me to interact </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with so many more different
nationalities and cultures </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Doing this job, you're almost
forced to be up-to-date </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with everything that's
happening in the world </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because you have people all over the world </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> who are viewing you, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I have this weird pressure of being, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't want this one
person from this one country </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> coming into my streams
or whatever and being, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> do you know what's happening
in my country right now? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And me going, no, I don't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, you get that,
like what do you think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> about the current gentrification
of Southeast Macau, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and you're like, what the fuck? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> How the fuck would I know that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wat is Macau? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You get that a lot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You surely can't expect me
to have a horse in this race, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> please, come on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm just kidding people from
Macau, I know what Macau is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> But that's the thing,
you're almost pressured </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to be up to date on that kind of stuff, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because you don't wanna
leave any of your viewers out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so, that causes you to just, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it absorbs so much
information about the world </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that when I go back to my
hometown and I meet people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> who aren't up to date
on that kind of stuff </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who have completely different
viewpoints of the world, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because the amount of information </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that they absorb about the
world is on a different level. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It's, I dunno, it's a bit of a whiplash. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'd be like, ooh, I can't believe
I used to think like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> That's kinda weird. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't even know my I'm blood type, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> so I don't even expect people
to learn about the outside. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> How do people expect me
to keep up with weird news </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> in some country I've never heard of. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I think you should be the one
to know your own blood type. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm sure I should, I have
a blood disease as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I have a blood disease, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know what my blood type is though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know.
- It's pretty irresponsible. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You also had to do a blood test here, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you were shown your blood type. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Having said that, I don't
know my blood type either, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I got the same...
- What! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm just as monkey-brained
as him apparently. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I know it's in the alphabet. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Like it's one of them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's in the alphabet! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's one of the four. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - What is your blood type? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Sigma. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Delta, alpha, sigma. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Alpha, sigma. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm like, decaf? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know, and I do, like you said, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you do try to educate
yourself on some things, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but there's just so, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can't be expected to
keep up with so many things. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like here's a question then, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> do you feel like there's a big difference </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> between explaining to
someone your perspective </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and actually having the
person really experience it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and empathize with you? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I feel like those
are two different things. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I can sit here,
I could go back to Wales </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and explain Japanese culture all day </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and they just won't understand it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why would you do that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Why would you bow at
every single, every word? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Why would you say, excuse
me, every 10 seconds. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - To me, it's kind of very similar to, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> let's say learning a language, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where you can explain a language, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you can explain grammar
structures and you can explain </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how the writing system and stuff works. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> But there's a difference
between understanding </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how a language works and
actually just absorbing it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and really getting a feel
for the language yourself. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I know there's a word for it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> acquisition, language acquisition, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> versus just learning how it
works on a logical sense. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I feel the exact same way </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when it comes to cultures and perspective </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where there's been so many times </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where someone has told
me about a perspective </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you're logically like,
"Yeah, I agree with that". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know, they could be
making the most sense, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but then you kind of
maybe move to the country </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that they're living in
or you go travel there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> or you meet more people
from that same culture. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And you're like, oh,
I think I actually get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what you're talking about now, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I think it's like
how when you're growing up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and you hear about other
countries and you think, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh, it's that funny little
thing that country does. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I know they would probably
do this about Japan a lot, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> they would just show
with things like Sumo, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they'd be like, isn't that so strange. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - These big men in diapers
pushing each other around. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's one of those things, aint it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But I think that when you get
to experience more cultures, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> your mindset on when you see
stuff like that changes a lot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> You go from thinking,
oh, that funny thing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that weird, strange thing, to thinking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm sure there's a story behind it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm sure there's a history,
there's a culture behind it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I definitely felt that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> especially after I started dating Aki </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you know, through YouTube
meeting a lot of Americans, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> because in Australia, the image of America </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> is not that glamorous
or positive in any way. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just saying it's straight up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't think the image
of Americans in America. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I love that the Americans
are often the first people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to bash their own country.
- Right, exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I love you, America. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It depends on where they're from. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it depends. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But after actually going to America </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and talking to Americans
and stuff like that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that completely flipped it
over and I realized, oh, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the problem was just
kind of my environment </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that was pushing that agenda
and the media that I consumed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that was kind of pushing
this sort of negative agenda </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> about American culture
and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But then when you actually
go and you live it out, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you see it firsthand and
you see everything else </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that they don't show and you're like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh, actually it's not as insane or wacky </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as the TV shows or the shit
my friends were talking about, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> make it out to be, you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, but I remember when I
first started dating Sydney. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I remember when we first met
and first started dating, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I remember early on, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause she mentioned
this to me the other day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I asked her, so out of curiosity, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> what do you actually think about America? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And she was like, oh,
greatest country in the world. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I remember. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Was she dead-ass when she said it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Imagine, she came from a
small town in the Midwest </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh when you first started dating? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, when I first started
dating her five, six years ago, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> shit, seven years ago now actually. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was a long time ago and I remember </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that was the first time
she had basically traveled </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> out of America, and she
came from a very small town </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the Midwest and got
raised with the values </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you would expect a
small town to get raised in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I remember she said, oh yeah, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> America is the greatest country
in the world, obviously. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I remember, apparently she said, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was just like, "Hmm". </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - And she said to me at the time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> she got like genuinely offended, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> She straight up, she got
genuinely angry at me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at the time for doing that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> She was like, what'd you mean, why? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Why did you make that sound? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> She said to me, and I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so what constitutes the greatest country? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And why is America the greatest country? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And she was like, oh, land
of the free, isn't it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We got freedom. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was about to say. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And second, I'm like, "Hmm". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was about to say, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if she's about to drop the freedom bomb, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know what I can say to that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, because to me at the time, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was just living up to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> the stereotypical patriotic American, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause America is a
good country, you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But my issue is, the more I
travel, the more I'm just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is there a greatest country in the world? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And there's no way you can define </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the greatest country in the world. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Otherwise everyone will be living there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And to me, patriotism,
as a British person, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is just so weird. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, you see it, I see
American patriotism where, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, not saying
every American like this, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but especially some of
the Americans I've met </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who were raised in small towns, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> especially when I go back
to Sydney's hometown, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just, you see this
culture that's been, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and this idea that's just been propagated </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> through the small town, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and there's not really
been any other perspective </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to really change that perspective. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They probably believe, by their belief, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they probably believe that America </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is the greatest country in the world </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and there is no other thing
that can challenge that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's just, I can't
blame them for that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No of course not.
- And I'm not even saying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> America isn't the greatest
country in the world. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just saying that because their belief </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> has been permeated so deeply
that there's been nothing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to really break that mold for them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it took years for Sydney </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to really kinda change her perspective. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It didn't take like just
one trip to England. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It took years for her traveling
to living with me in England </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and living with me in Thailand
and living with me in Japan, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for her to like really open
up her perspective to be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know what, maybe there are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> some other good places
in the world as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know, maybe some other
places do things as good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And now she has recently
just gone back to America </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> to visit her family and she's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wow, I really don't fit there anymore. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Really?
- Yeah, it felt weird, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause she told me that
she just didn't feel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as settled as she used to be. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Mhmm.
- Ah, I get that too. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - She feels like an outsider almost. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I definitely got that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when I was back in Wales last time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know, I love my
hometown and I love my friends, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but you definitely feel like
'cause you've been doing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> so many things and exploring
so many different cultures, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you definitely feel like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> God, I must sound like that
weird fucking gap student </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who come back, like, I've
traveled the world now, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm better than all of you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause I really don't
wanna sound like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, no, but it does
open your perspective a lot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you do think, oh shit,
it really just made you look </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> at stuff in your tiny
town a lot differently. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And you know, how homogenous it is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - The tiny town just feels
so much more tinier, weirdly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And you know, again, I don't blame Sydney </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or anyone from the small
towns who think that way, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because again, I feel,
especially in America, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it really is just kind of enclosed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when it comes to the
information that you can get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about the rest of the world. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It still blows my mind that
in America, for example, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> 24-hour news channels are a
thing, but it's not world news, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's American news for 24-hours. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like, what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just insane to think, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for one, there's so much
news happening in America </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that you can just
constantly run news stories. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But also, there's just so little access </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> or ease of access to
information outside of America. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Same in the UK though, really. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> We get like, we get
trickled down to America. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We don't really get to see
a lot of inside America. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> A lot of British people don't
really know many of the states </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> outside the very famous ones. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, I'm sure it's the same
in Australia as well, though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Stuff like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And we have very rudimentary knowledge </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of outside of Europe, really. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But do you guys have
world news on your TV? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, we do, we do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - But like world news is just mostly, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's mostly the Middle East conflict. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, stuff that we fucked up, really. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Stuff that we had a hand in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, fair enough. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's rare that we hear
anything about Japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or Asia in general, unless
something massive has happened. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, 'cause of the Olympics normally. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because BBC scarcely reports on Japan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I have the BBC app and
I set the Japan section, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they don't do an article
every three days on Japan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And it would be very, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it'd probably be quite high
profile stuff in Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Or very wacky, whoa! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> They open up a new store with M&M's, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> whoa!
- Whoa! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Also, I do think as well, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the fact that a lot of people think, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one of the reasons why people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> already think America is terrible is, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in the UK and also in
Japan I feel this as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> A lot of this bad stuff and
injustices, if you will, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in the UK and I think Japan as well, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> probably don't get as much
spotlight as they do in America. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And also everything is
fucking filmed in America. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] True. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Literally everything is on camera. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - True, true, true. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So I feel like it's way
easier to catch the stuff </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that makes your country
look fucking insane. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - When there's cameras
all the fucking time, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> capturing everything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like one of the main reasons </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> why we see so many insane
stuff for America looks good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you hear all these horrible injustices </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that have been done is 'cause
there's just so much video </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and there's so much attention
brought to it by the media. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, it's also as well the fact that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> just simply the population
difference is one thing as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But it's also, again, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just that whole cultural mentality </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or I guess group mentality of, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's me versus the world, you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause it's very much an
individualistic society </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> where it's like, I'm the center... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - We have that in the UK
as well to some extent. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think the UK way more. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I think that's definitely
one of the biggest difference </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> between East and West that I've felt </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> living in both different places. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, and whereas in Japan it's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh, I don't wanna stick out too much </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause otherwise the camera
might get stuck on me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - But it's hard right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause on one hand you get society </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where everyone's comfortable </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> nobody oversteps their boundaries, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but everyone's fucking miserable. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You can't have this utopian ideal Japan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> without also having a depressed society </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where no one can have fun. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I feel that's like problem right now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> is that regardless of if you're
an individualistic society </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> versus a collective society, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> there's still shit that happens right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, like the stuff I love about the UK </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is also, I'm near certain,
the stuff that I love, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> or is also the reason why
we have a lot of the stuff </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't like about the UK. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, same thing with Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - You don't get the good
things and not the bad things. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, there's no perfect country. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's no perfect
country and I don't think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's a perfect system.
- Denmark's just like, hello. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Allow me to. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Switzerland is like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I read an article that was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> people who live in
Denmark that are unhappy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are extremely unhappy because
they're supposed to be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the happiest country on Earth. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So the people who get sad there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or their life isn't
going the way they want, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> they feel more depressed
because they're supposed to be. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because everyone around them is happy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're supposed to be in
the happiest place on Earth. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You can't fucking win. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No matter what goes wrong, you can't win. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But I think, obviously,
that also depends on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you can afford to be
healthy and all that stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So that all changes, obviously. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Being healthy is pretty good. </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_00> - I can't handle! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Back to the episode. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Are you guys patriotic? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Uh, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Only in like sport, I guess. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - To Wales, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Pretty much the most patriotic
I get is towards sports. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - But you have to, okay,
so I think Wales' patriotic </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and being in the UK is a very different. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - How many times, how often do you get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to be patriotic about Wales? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Anytime England fucks up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Basically right.
- That's the truth. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You're just like, I'm not part of that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So that's what I'm saying, it's not. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Patriotism in Wales is not like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the rest of the world patriotism
where it's like, go us! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's just fuck England. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel like that's just
- That's literally all it is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wales, Scotland and Irish? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like Northern Irish patriotism. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right, that's why, I
feel like UK patriotism </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> is a completely different brand to other. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause we get very proud
of Welsh people, obviously. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But we get the most proud when it is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to the detriment of England. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> So when people are like, oh,
you're English though, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, no, I'm not even, I have no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> There is absolutely nothing
about me that is English. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm British and Welsh, but not English. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So a lot of people always like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> well, that's English, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> No, no, no, no, I despise. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> But I despise it in a very fun way. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's very much like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Tongue in cheek. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's a lot of fun stories. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's a bit of banter, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, have you
watched "Archer", the TV show? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - A little bits of it, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, there's a really weird thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that just completely caught me off guard. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So they did an episode </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> about a very famous Welsh
event that happened. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it was very weird that "Archer", </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> an American comedy TV show did this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, there's a thing called
a Tryweryn in Wales. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's a small town
that no longer exists </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because Liverpool, which
is a city in England, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wanted a reservoir. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So their solution to getting a reservoir </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> was to just flood this town
so they could get water. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Holy shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I shit you not. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So they had to evacuate, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> they literally just made people just move. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wow, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And Welsh people weren't allowed to vote </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on whether this was. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So they had no say. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They had no say. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So they just flooded this town, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> called Tryweryn and turned
it into a reservoir. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Turned out, they didn't
even need it in the end. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And they killed four people as well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because some people refuse to leave. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Holy shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So they flooded it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's legit, you can go there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It's depressing as fuck because
they're just like buildings </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> underneath this reservoir. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And there's a bunch, around
the area is a ton of like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> remember Tryweryn and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's seen as one of
the most like injustices </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that were done to Wales. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, yeah, that's pretty shitty. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was fairly recent as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - How recent we're talking? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Think '60s, can you Google it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like '60s, '80s,
around that time, I think. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Just Tryweryn, T-R-Y-W-E-N </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I pretty sure that's just the
plot to Higarashi, isn't it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Didn't Higarashi get to build a dam </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and then there were
protests to stop the people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> from getting out?
- It just acts as a reservoir </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so English people could drink water </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then they didn't even use it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, what the fuck? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then also "Archer" just
did an episode about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And they did a whole
thing of, they were like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Navi] About Tryweryn? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Navi] 1965. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah '65
- 1965. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - They did a whole joke about
it 'cause they were like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's one of the most,
and they were all like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> nah, don't worry about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's your justice. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wow. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's something everyone
needs to care about. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - That is something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Now, you're all educated on Tryweryn. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's the very basic story, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's a lot more that
other people can tell, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> more in depth story.. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel like when you're
from a small nation </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that just doesn't get a lot of attention </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from the world media in general, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause that's me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> whenever like Thailand
gets mentioned anywhere. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just happy if Thailand
is just brought up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in any kind of capacity, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just everyone knows my country now! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I love it though, they
get insanely excited. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Like anything happens, like
they're just insane, it's great. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I remember when I went. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I wish I had that
passion about anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I remember when I went
to a con in Singapore. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh and they were
shouting at you in public? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, no, no, no, yeah that
one but like I remember </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I did a panel there and I literally, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> all I literally said was hello, Singapore. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I've never heard a crowd of people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like crying and screaming. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's us! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's us!
- Whoo! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was as if fucking Elvis
Presley came on stage </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and like said their country's name. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, he said the country name! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Ladies and gentlemen, Singapore. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Whoo! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Honestly, the Singapore
convention was like crazy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That was insane.
- Don't fucking rub it in. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I wasn't invited. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, I wasn't invited, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was just there for the ride.
- He was just there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We weren't ties at this point. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> We knew each other, I wasn't like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And plus, I was on the
other side of the world. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was already in Thailand. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - He was literally just next door. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, he's like, I'm
a pop down to Singapore. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, no, the guy literally
texted me and was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh, you're in Singapore? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Think I'll pop down for a quick second. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it's so weird
sometimes where we are, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as Southeast Asians,
are proud of sometimes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I swear to God, every time I meet </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a fellow Southeast Asian
from a different country, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we get competitive over like
the weirdest things, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because the first thing we compare </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is how shit it is to drive on our roads. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know why we do that! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like, yeah,
you're still alive, nice. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's just like, oh,
this one time in Bangkok, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was in traffic for one hour. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh you think one hour's bad? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> When I was in Jakarta, it was
a three-hour traffic jam once. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm just like, thinking
about this, I'm just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> why are we comparing? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This is like the weirdest
dick size comparison </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can think of you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, you survived two car crashes? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I survived four. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, that's not something to be proud of. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause I was just like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I caused all of them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause after living in two years, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Sydney just went around to
other people being like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, Thailand is second
on the most dangerous place </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to drive in the world and I lived there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm just like, Sydney, why
are you boasting about that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Did she even drive there? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - She didn't even drive. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why are we boasting about that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - She's saying all this
in the passenger seat. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like when I went to go to, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> my university town was number one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for heroin usage in the UK. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And we were like, yeah, number one, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, number one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, most heroin addicts! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Heroin, number one! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Heroin, number one! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wales, let's go! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Where I grew up was number one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for teen pregnancy in the UK as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And that was just a fact. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> They were like, good, be
proud of it, be proud of it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, finally, number one in something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - So, all of your parents
here are still teenagers? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Congratulations. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's kind of what
it's like in a small town. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I just realized that's
exactly the same way </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> as where Sydney comes from. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause the first thing she
boasts about from Wisconsin, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just two things, we're
like number one in cheese, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> biz and serial killers. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't think that's a good thing, Sydney. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Being number one in cheese in the U.S. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is not, that's like saying </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're number one landlocked
country in some fucking, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know, town, oh fuck
it's a terrible comparison. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I know what you mean. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's not something to be
like, oh wow, amazing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, what is amazing is the fact that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that state has the most serial killers. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like that's pretty impressive, honestly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I liked the Midwest,
it was pretty chill. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Where have you been in the Midwest? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've been to Minnesota. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Minnesota, really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's probably my favorite
state I've been to in the U.S.. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've got deported from there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Thanks Minnesota. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, I don't know about you, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I had a very warm welcome in Minnesota. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, I did not.
- I was not deported. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - They bring out the red carpet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> They're like, yes, sir CdawgVA. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They're like, your passport? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> No, we don't need to
check that, go right in. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh Mr Anime Man, welcome to
Minnesota, get the fuck out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - You said they were really nice though, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when they weren't deporting you though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - No the were nice because
they were nice about it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at least, they were like,
"Hey, it's not your fault, man" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it happens all the time kinda thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But you also have to fly
immediately to Amsterdam, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and then from Amsterdam back to Tokyo. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Are you allowed to say
why you got deported? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Is that like something
you'd like to talk about? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Ah, just Visa mix-ups basically. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean like.
- You just got the wrong Visa? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, basically I had the wrong Visa. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Apparently I asked the
immigration officer in Minnesota. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He was like, yeah, this
happens all the fucking time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> So it's like, you are
definitely not in the wrong </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for not knowing this shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like it is really confusing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but he's like, just go home, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> get this particular Visa
and then you'll be good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for like the next 10 years, at least. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sounds really cool
saying you got deported. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Sounds like you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Until you get deported! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - But I'm sure getting
deported wasn't cool? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, getting deported wasn't cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But the fact that I literally flew </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> around the world in 48 hours. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You just did a fucking speed run, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I basically speed-ran around the world. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, what the fuck took
them 80 days the first time? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just get deported bro! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - So I use the.
- Around the world </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> deportation hut. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I used the deported skip here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - The first time to the U.S., </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I didn't know you needed a Visa. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So what happened was. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We did need a Visa before. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, we did, we need the ESTA. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That was introduced pretty recently. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, before the ESTA
you didn't need it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - The first time I went to
America, you didn't need an ESTA. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - How long ago was this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - ESTA was like 10, 15 years ago? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, something like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was within my lifetime
that the legislation changed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, 'cause you've been
traveling through Europe, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> all my life, and I just
assumed you just turn out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where you want to go with a passport. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, well, yeah that makes sense. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So, I didn't know that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And so, I booked my flight to the U.S., </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is when the ESTA was a thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Which is bullshit because
America can come to the UK, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no documentation needed, just a passport. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, really?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - When we have to go to America, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we have to get this ESTA nonsense, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I'm getting all my stuff ready, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is my first flight ever to America. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm on my own, I'm like oh my God, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's midnight and my flight's at 9:00 AM. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> My dad came to my room, he's
like, did you get the Visa? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What do you mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, you gotta get a Visa. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, no one told me this! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> How do I get a Visa? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like 19 as well,
I've never heard of this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> When do I have to get a Visa? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Apparently your supposed to
get it three days before? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, you are. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like more than three days before. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, but luckily it came
in 15 minutes online, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> so I was very lucky. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I also did that in Japan as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, Aki had to do
that at the airport once. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because she realized her ESTA had run out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - You just have a really shit track record </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> at getting into countries. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Like losing your passport
before we go to Japan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, yeah, I remember that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I totally forgot 'cause
it only lasts for two years. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> When you go to the U.S. you
have to get from most countries. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And also Canada, if you get one too? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You just apply for a thing called NASTA, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> costs $15, you do it online. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> If your passport is like normal, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you have no criminal record or anything, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you should get it in like 15 minutes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, like immediately. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But do it three days just in case, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's what they suggest,
and it lasts two years. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And when I moved to Japan, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was gonna go to San
Francisco and I totally forgot </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it expired until I was
on the way to the airport </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when I realized it had expired. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I was applying for it
on my phone on the way. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And luckily, right before I
was going out to check in, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I just got it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Ah, nice.
- I was like, nice. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's gold split right there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I told my company, I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hey, I forgot to get the ESTA. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And they were like, what? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like, yeah, so I applied for it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it should be fine, we'll see. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We'll see. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We'll see. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Luckily it all worked out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - At least you weren't on the
plane when you realized that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's weird though, 'cause
they don't ask me for it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they don't ask me for the, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they don't ask you for
the ESTA at any point. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I wonder, is it just on a system? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> They only ask you for it
when you're immigrating </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> into the country that you just landed in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - What airline did you fly with? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know, British Airways? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They've never asked me for it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Really?
- Because I normally get asked </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when I'm queuing up to
check in if I have a Visa. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They never ask me that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh really? I've never been asked that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Maybe I'm just so charming they're like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no, no, no, go in, go in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Of course this charming
man doesn't have the. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They see the brown man
and they're just like, oh. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Excuse me, sir. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Or the family guy skin color thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Excuse me, sir, do you have a Visa </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to get into our country? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> This is me sharing my
privilege right now, fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, but like especially coming </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> from having dual citizenship
in UK and Thailand, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it just makes me realize,
man, we are very privileged </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> to have certain passports
because it is literally just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> some passports are completely useless. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, yeah, Japan is
like the most OP passport. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's the most powerful
passport in the world. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But only 20% of people have them here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Can you believe that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> The fucking audacity. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - And also, yeah, there's
so many weird other rules </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that come with it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And again, it's like you were saying, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's the most powerful
possible in the world and yet, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> barely any Japanese
people fly out of Japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because the tourism industry
here is just so powerful. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Go on, sorry, I interrupted you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I completely forgot,
I was just gonna say </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that some passports are pretty OP </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and that makes me jealous
of your Japanese passport </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> because you can get in like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> what can Japan get in without
a Visa that the UK can't? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm sure there's some other countries, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> put it on the screen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Obviously we not be bothered to look. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't think about this,
but I think in the UK, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's something like 70 to 80%
of people have a passport. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> In America it's like 40 or 50?
- Yeah, it was so weird for me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> going to a country and just meeting people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> without a passport. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, everyone just has one in the UK, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone I know has one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - In Australia as well,
almost everyone has one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I guess it's just
like a difference in culture. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> But I couldn't imagine
not having a passport. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What are you gonna go and do in the UK? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just go to like a field and be like, sick, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is great vacation. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Or I could get a passport, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> go to another country
and go to that field. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, exactly, but you know, there's. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Have you seen our beaches? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It's amazing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> As someone who's brought up in Brighton, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> don't we have amazing beaches? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You want sand beaches? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No, we got stone beaches! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Stone beaches. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Can't even walk on it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - UK tourism is the most
depressing thing on Earth. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just shit, it's so shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, what would you recommend? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> To someone who's never been to the UK. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - When people come to the UK-
- Don't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, no, go go to London. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> But that's the thing, is
that the reason why I think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the UK works as a tourist destination </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is 'cause you don't
know anything about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> When you know about the
UK, it's a terrible place. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think most people's
imaginations of the UK </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is the queen, Harry Potter and... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Pretty much. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - If you go to London, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you get a very sanitized view of the UK </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you can have a great time
because you only see London, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and London is very well kept. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The charming part. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - All the fucking money's in London. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'd say some of the countrysides
are pretty good as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - But that's why I really appreciate it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when I meet people who love castles </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and love going around
Wales and stuff like that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, nice. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Navi] Oxford is fine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oxford's nice, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - And honestly, if you wanna
go to the countryside though, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'd say Ireland is better. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Ireland's fucking beautiful. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've been to the countryside in Ireland </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's so fucking nice. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wales is good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Patriotism showing there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I remember when I first found out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that people just didn't live near castles, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I thought that was weird
when I first found that out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I live near three castles
growing up and I was like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - See out of context, that
sounds so fucking privileged. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why, what are you gonna do with it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What it's not my castle. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, no, but that's the thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If you said that to a Japanese
person, they'd be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> what are you, the prince of Wales? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, it's 'cause there's
so many castles in the UK. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> One of them was very dangerous and rundown </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and climbing is just a safety hazard. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know how it's still allowed, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're allowed to go and do... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But there's one really
cool castle near me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's called Conwy Castle. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel Wales to castles is
very much Japan to temples. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah, maybe. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because I think if you said to someone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who has like no idea of like Asian culture </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> or anything like that and said, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh yeah, there's three
temples around my house. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They'd be like, whoa, you
fucking bougie motherfucker. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, Japan did have a lot of castles, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> they were just burnt down. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, yeah, most of them are gone. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - There is one and there's a
really big one in what Kochi, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> there's a massive one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- It's really fucking cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - A lot of them, though, are recreation's. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That were built much, much later. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think there's only
like a handful of castles </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> from that time that are
still standing to this day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - A lot of the ones in the
UK are run down as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Out of the three near me,
one of them is well kept </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and that's mainly for tourist reasons. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The other two are completely
run down and just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's cool that it's a bunch of rubble, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you're like, sick. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But you can buy that, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> You can purchase that as property? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Some of them.
- Some of them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Normally the big ones you can't, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they're normally heritage sites. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So, you can't buy them,
yhey're like public. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - And at that point, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people who buy it just buy it for a flex. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause who actually lives
in a castle nowadays? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I believe I read something
about France or something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> has the most abandoned castles </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the most castles for
sale out of any country. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh really? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Apparently you can just buy chateaus </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and castles and all nonsense. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's pretty bougie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - All right, you say
UK is good for travel. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - No I didn't, I never said that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, what did you say? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> You say, come to the UK. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You say just go to London. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Go to London?
- Go to London, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, okay, genuine question. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Someone's coming to travel to the UK, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you wanna show them British culture, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> where'd you take them to? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - First of all, the one
question you have to ask someone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> who comes to the UK, is
do you drink alcohol? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do you drink? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Of course, of course. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And if you don't, you're
gonna have a bad time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - If you love a beer, you
love drinking with people. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You can have a two week trip
and you'll have a great time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> If you don't drink alcohol,
here's a three day criteria. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - If you don't drink alcohol,
I hope you like castles. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know, I genuinely think, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause you can do nearly
everything in London </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that's worth seeing in one day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like, one or two days. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Three days if you don't wanna rush. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> But all the major things </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are within walking distance of each other. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do you take them to
like the tourist sites </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and everything like that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, very fast, I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> here's Buckingham Palace, have a look. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> All right, here's the Big Ben have a look, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's shit, don't pay it,
it's like $90 to go on it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's a rip off, don't do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, when we went it
was in fucking scaffolding. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I didn't even get to see it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh and London Eye,
sorry London Eye's shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Big Ben looks pretty cool
actually, I like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But you know, normally it's
like, you wanna see Big Ben? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We can go and drink in the
park in front of Big Ben, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you wanna do that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, that's cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's the arcade that's now closing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's closed now, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is that the one with Shrek at the front? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [All] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, that's an arcade. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was a Namco Funscape,
there was a shit arcade, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was all right, but it's closing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But it was the only arcade. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> What else can you do in London? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Dunno. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Maybe take them on the boat. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - On the boat? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So you know how
there's public transport, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's the tube? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Part of the network is a boat. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, like a ferry system? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That you can just cross
the, yeah, it goes from, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I think, Greenwich to
Westminster or something? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, Greenwich, I really
like taking people to Greenwich. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Greenwich is a really nice area. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You can go and I can be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> look, here's where time star is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, that's all I know about Greenwich. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's a very nice area
actually, it's really well done. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Navi] There's a warship
in Belfast, in front of the. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Belfast's like six hours away, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you can't go to the Belfast. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Navi] The warship. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - The Cutty Sark. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Navi] It's right in
front of the, not palace, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> right next to the bridge. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Greenwich? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Navi] It's not Greenwich. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - You're talking about the HMS Belfast? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, that one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know.
- Don't know that one either. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - If you go to Greenwich as well, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> there's a massive boat
that's been restored on land, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a pirate ship, it's fucking massive. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Damn. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Navi] Apparently they
actually collabed with Azur Lane. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The UK government should
just hire me, I'll make right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - What would you add? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Spoons, go to Wetherspoons. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Tesco meal deal?
- Tesco. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Tesco meal deal. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Honestly, I would take
them to Spoons as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Spoons is great. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You did take us to Spoons. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I did! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I should just ask you Joey,
where did we take you again? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, we did shit with
Joey, it was terrible. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - We went to the Shrek arcade and Spoons. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - We went to the fucking
gaming bar as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - The gaming bar. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - The gaming bar.
- It was terrible. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was literally just
a pub with a Wi in it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - You can game in that bar. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - British culture, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it's sick. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause like pubs in London </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> are where all the best food are as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It's all the best food. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Dude, fair, that pub
did have some good food. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause the way I see it,
right, because the way I see it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when I go travel to a place, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I very rarely want to go
to the big tourist spots. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I Just wanna eat. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I want cool places to
see, but just like not the, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> here's just a landmark </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that everyone takes a
fucking picture around. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I just want cool local places. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And as someone who lived in
London for close to three years, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if it doesn't revolve around alcohol, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know the cool
places to take people. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, there's Afternoon Tea? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh Afternoon Tea, actually that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - The home of Afternoon Tea. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, of course, of course, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I completely forgot about Afternoon Tea. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's pretty much the only
part of like British food </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that I'm just like, yep,
Afternoon Tea fucking slaps. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - To be fair, I feel Australia
would be the exact same thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if it wasn't for the fact that we have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> some of the best beaches in the world. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause at least we can
take you to the beach. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You got it easy, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, but if you don't like beaches, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then I hope you like drinking. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause we're going to
be doing a lot of that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. It's kinda hard, I've had friends, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> normally Americans, who are
like, no, I don't drink, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm like, I honestly
don't know what to do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can show you Big Ben. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I have the same thing when
friends come to Australia </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and I have to take them around </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a couple of times I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> do you wanna see Sydney Opera House? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I swear, I'm not an alcoholic,
but it's just the culture. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, it is.
- I don't know what to do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's kinda why I wanted
to move out of England </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it just felt
like if you didn't drink, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then there was nothing
else to do to have fun </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> or just like chill out,
that's a big thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - No one does anything
on weekdays in the UK. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like weekdays is strictly for working </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then going home and being depressed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's all you do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Now, I feel that's just. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - No one goes out in the
UK, it's always the weekend. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh really, like even after work? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, no one really goes out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I agree with that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's normally older people, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they normally will go
off to the pub after work </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when they're like 40s,
'cause of their lot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I would have you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> some people will go to the pub after work. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, I know, if I worked in
office, I would love to go. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> But as a YouTuber, no one
wanted to go out in the weekday. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> So it was an absolute uphill
battle trying to get people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to do anything in the UK. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So you have to wait till the weekend. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yes, so I never did
anything during the week. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I just worked on videos, I
think, and played video games. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't really know what I did. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know what I did in London. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What did I do? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What did I do in London? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know, went to coffee? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We have a lot of good cafes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Do we? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Compared to Europe? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - We are, we were in Europe. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You guys are European. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We were in Europe. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, we're not in Europe anymore. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, 'cause it's easy to get stuff </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from like Italy and whatever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's true, that's true. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's the one thing I miss
about, that sucks about Japan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> is that importing anything from Europe </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is like 20 times the price. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Well, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like a block of cheese </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I would pay 10 pounds for in the UK </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> imported from France, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is seen as like a
luxury, expensive item. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, fucking first
time I was in Australia, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like, literally, off
the side of the planet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's depressing, I bought a
wine bottle and I looked at it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and it was like 30 pounds in the UK. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it was like 90 pounds here in Japan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, fuck.
- Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which is such a flip to whenever, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well, when someone's gonna
come visit us in Japan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because like when a friend
comes to visit in Japan, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you're just like, what kind
of experience do you want? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause like you can do anything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do you wanna see nature or
do you wanna see the city? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Do you wanna see culture? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - But do you ever get sick
ushering people around Japan? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause you were always the go-to guy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> who had to take people around Japan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I was, but after a
while, it depends who I'm with. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If I'm with a person who I'm
not super buddy-buddy with, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and obviously I want
them to have a good time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and have a good impression. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But if I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just like a fucking
mate from school or whatever, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then I used to do this thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where I would take them
to all these places, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but then pretend I couldn't
speak a word of Japanese </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just to piss them off. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't wanna be the translator
this week, so you know what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Let's see how you like it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, we would go to a restaurant </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I would be reading the menu </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'll be like (speaks
in foreign language). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, you just fucking
pretend that I was foreign. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause if I don't speak Japanese, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they'll never fucking know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So that was just like, come
on Joey, just fucking help us. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Help me translate this fucking thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like, (speaks in
foreign language), I'm sorry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, Japan is just like
local guide, easy mode. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You go to a fucking family
mart and they blow their minds. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I just take 'em like, Ikebukuro
and it's done for the day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I know right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's so easy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - One place in Tokyo, and
that's their entire itinerary </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> done for the day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, honestly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Take them to a ramen place,
though, oh my gosh ramen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well that's the thing, if
you take them to like, Shibuya, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you're easily like, two
days you can spend there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If you take them to Akihabara,
that's a whole day again. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Akihabara is several days. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, that's true. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - If you go there for
one day and they're like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> "Can we go back to Akihabara please?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I miss when I thought Akihabara </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was like super fun and amazing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - You don't think so anymore?
- I miss that as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, it's just 'cause all the figures, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you know that the price is
always cheaper elsewhere. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've just found that the more times </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've gone to Akihabara,
the more I realized </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that there was just so much
cool, hidden shit there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That really, if you're
not there with someone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who knows the area really well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it really just does seem like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> here's the place to buy anime figurines. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Here's the place to buy weird shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I just don't have the
time to explre it anymore. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Also, nearly all the restaurants
I've been to in Akihabara </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> are severely disappointing.
- Fucking awesome. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean awful, awful. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I said awes, awful. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've had pretty the
worst meals in Japan, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> consistently, in Akihabara. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, same here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know why, I think
'cause it's just on the front </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and then everyone's
like, come in our store. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well that's the thing, no one
really thinks to themselves, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh, I want a really nice
meal, let's go to Akihabara. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Also, I hate the maids who are like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> come in our store, please, please! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, that is really annoying. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - And they're like, (speaks in Japanese). </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, fuck off! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - If it's (speaks in
Japanese), they'd give this, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fuck off! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm British, I say to my head, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, please leave me alone. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Human interaction, get
outta here, get outta here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Be gone (). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - One time we walked
past and there was a maid </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that was like, Joey? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Do you remember that?
- No. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What do you say, you were
there, she started screaming, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like one of the maids. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh the maid who recognized me? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't remember. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> How do you remember this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wait, no actually what
happened was, I was with you, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we were walking and I saw
the girl looking at you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and we kept on walking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then I just heard her go, "Joey?". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yes, I do remember! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I feel like you
didn't pay any attention, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you were like, whatever
and just kept walking. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then I was like,
(speaks in Japanese) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I do remember that
actually because it's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah, I heard her say my
name, but I thought like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I didn't hear it as my name
until I walked past her. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I processed, I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think she was calling my name. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But then at that point it
was too late to turn around </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and be like, me? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't wanna be that guy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm famous, yes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was like, I'll just be
the cool guy and keep walking. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel so unguarded whenever
I get recognized in Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I'm just like what, what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It really catches me of guard. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it really is scary. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause I know like, one, it's surprising </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to hear someone speak English as well here </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or just on the streets, and
two, someone who speaks English </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and also recognizes you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's, especially I think, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> since Trash Taste has started as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, I don't know how I'm gonna handle </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> going to my next anime convention
and there's just gonna be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like, 70 million people calling me Grant, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm not gonna be able
to tell the difference. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Like if they're just meming </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> or if they actually
think my name is Grant. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I hope at the airport, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> they're like welcome Garnt, Grant, sorry. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Welcome, Grant. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, 'cause people
already fuck up my username. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> They're like, yo, you're
the anime guy, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Or it's like, your the animae dude. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, I can't wait to just be called </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all these fucking nicknames. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just like, do you actually know I am, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or are you just like taking the piss? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause sometimes I don't even know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Like when a person
comes up to me and goes, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> are you the anime guy? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know if I'm supposed
to go, I'm the Anime Man, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> or if I'm supposed to go nah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Who's that, who's that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm not that guy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Who is that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know who that is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know who that guy is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why hello there, it is I, Anime Zone. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And while Connor's not here, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm going to hijack this
podcast to talk about anime. </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> - Tell us Garnt, tell us, tell us, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Tell me when you've been
recognized in the UK. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Have you actually been? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I've been recognized once, I feel, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I think in an Argos in Brighton. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Argos?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Holy fuck.
- What's an Argos? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh God, it's a terrible store. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> So it's, the whole gimmick of this store </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is that you don't actually
get to look at the products </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> due to the warehouse, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but you get to look at
the massive 10 page, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no not 10 page, 400 page
book, and you get to pick. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, is this the place
where you were talking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> about like a Christmas gift or whatever? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah it's fucking terrible. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, basically just imagine Amazon. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - IRL.
- Except, you have to go there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and you don't have a computer
screen to browse everything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You just have a massive book. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Lord knows how they're still
in business with that model. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - That sounds very outdated. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's kinda like the Blockbuster now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - So, you got recognized in Argos? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it's really weird, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> just one of the cashiers
recognize me, it's not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> a very exciting story.
- Give you discount? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Huh?
- They give you a discount? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No.
- Fuck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Have you ever gotten that before? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Where someone working at an
establishment recognize you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and you got a thing out of it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, but if they do,
I'm very open to that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've heard stories
about, now, about some of, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> well, Sydney just went back to America </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and apparently she was just in
a bar and she got recognized. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh sick. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh shit, but that's not
good, that's not good, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's Sydney's content. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. Well, no, she got recognized </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> because she was obviously my fiance </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and she was just, and all
the guy said was just, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, are you Sydney?",
and she's like, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh, where's Garnt?". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> She's like, "Oh, he didn't come here". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And he was like, "Oh,
say hi to Garnt for me". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Ah, no!
- Ah, no! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Don't do that! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, don't do that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I hate it when people would be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> say hi to Joey and Garnt for me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, and what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> What am I gonna say? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, by the way, a random
dude I just met says hi. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, what do we say to that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Look, we appreciate you guys
coming up to us and saying, hi. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's cool and all. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But don't make us be the
messenger for another person, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> no one appreciates that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know, the 800th
century, I'm not a messenger. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm not like here to
convey messages for you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I got recognized one time
at midnight on a bus, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> which is terrifying. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was going to the gym. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And yeah, the bus went right
outside my house to the gym, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was perfect, it was 24
hours as well so it was good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was on my way back from the gym. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was extremely sweaty </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and there's only two people
on this bus, me and him. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And he was right at the back </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wearing a hoodie in the back, just like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Ah, shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I was like, what the fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Then I'm sitting close to
the front on the second level </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm just listening to music. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like, yeah, mmhmm. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then I feel like on my back, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like a tapping.
- Well, that's scary. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I'm like (startles). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like what, what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He's like, "Are you Cdawg?". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like, "Yeah, yeah,
I'm Cdawg, what's up?". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And he's like, "Love your videos". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like, "Thanks, man". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And he just walked off. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, I was like, what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's so scary. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was like, what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> He was like still hoodie and everything on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when he came up to me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, "Are you Cdawg?". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just brick shithouse. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, he was massive. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I was like, "Ah, thanks man nice." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was like, this is my house. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I got recognized in Akihabara. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Used to get recognized a lot, obviously. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, every time we
used to go with you there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I always, that's when my people are. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like Akihabara's
like a cheat code. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause that's like
saying you got recognized </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> at an anime convention. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, because it's also,
Akihabara's surprisingly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> has the most foreigners. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it does. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, it's one of the
most sensationalized, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wacky to look at places in Tokyo. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But I was recognized, I get recognized </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> pretty much every time I go to Akihabara. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But the one time I went to, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, running a
little short on my hentai. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Might pop into a Melonbooks, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is a store where you can buy hentai </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and peruse the goods. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh shit, are you The Anime Man? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, and as I was
perusing through some stuff, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I got a tap on the shoulder
and he's like, "Are you Joey?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I thought you were gonna be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the lowest section's over there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wrong place man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And he's like, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Well, I'm like, yeah, I am, hi. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like, oh no, of all... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like holding a doujin
I was about to buy as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, worst timing and
he had like a bag as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> So he obviously just like
finished at the cash register. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And the guy was like,
"What are you doing here?". </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, "What the fuck do
you think I'm doing here?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I jack off, we all jack off. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like really, are you
sure you're a fan of me? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause if you are, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you wouldn't know exactly
what I am doing here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I am holding the thing I am
about to buy, you can see that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So all I said was just,
just buying some hentai? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And he was like, "Ah, sick
dude, all right bey!". </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And he just walked out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's just like, what kind of interaction </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> can you have in that place? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I have exactly the same experience, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause the place I can
recognized the most is that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, is that Melonbooks, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's that store! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'd be recognized like
three times in a Melonbooks. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like, why? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Is it just known? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is that just a doujin store? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, Melonbooks is like a huge. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's a complete doujin store. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Basically when Sydney's
just running out of ideas </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> for content, she just goes there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and she's like, oh, this shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then the cashier's
like, is Garnt with you? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, Melonbooks and Toranoana </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> are the two big, big
hentai stores in Akihabara. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I always get recognized, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I haven't been recognized
often but when I do, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's always when I look like shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's never when I've made
an effort to look good, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's never in the JoJo suit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's never when I've got my drip game on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It's when I'm in fucking sweatpants. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - But like how often. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, how often are you in (). </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - How often is that though Connor? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Listen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I, every single day I leave the house. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember one time I went
to a Sainsbury's near me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> which is just a normal supermarket. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I was wearing sweatpants,
flip flops, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the shit which I actually
don't even normally do that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I would normally put the
effort in to wear jeans. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Actually, no, I lie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This is back when I thought
that wearing jeans was a luxury. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> If I was working. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why is it a luxury? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause those are work pants. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Actually I'm gonna, I'm
just gonna go on a detour, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause it was a story anyway. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But I basically got recognized
in sweat pants, not funny. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is this why you refuse
to wear washed jeans? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause it's a luxury? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, no, that's a different shit take. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, no, that's not a shit
take, let's go right there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> So I had this thing for
a very long time where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this isn't a meeting,
this is a general thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I used to just only wear like
sweatpants when I was at home. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> If I wasn't leaving the
house, I wouldn't wear jeans, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I would just wear sweat pants. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I still do that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - But now I changed my mind. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And now I only wear jeans in the house. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - What? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> How do you bring yourself to do that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I do that.
- What? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because what happened.
- I always wear jeans. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What happened, is that I
started just feeling like shit, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just like not working. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And so I was like, maybe if I
like dress like I'm not slob, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I might work a little better. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - You laugh but it's a real fucking thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And it actually worked. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like I wear jeans not because I want to, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> but because it's the only
way I'm gonna look good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - But when you're wearing
a pair of jeans nicely, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they feel better than anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel like my day hasn't
started until I put on my jeans. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Sometimes I try to work. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like an American fighting for freedom. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just haven't started my day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> until I put on my denim jeans. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Honestly, sometimes I try to work </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm in like sweat pants </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or sometimes just in my fucking boxes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I sleep in my boxes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I just don't get anything done. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> As soon as I put on my
jeans, the day has started. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Amen.
- I am ready to work. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just wake up and go, time to work, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then I just start working. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - If you go to jeans.
- Mind over matter man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, but if you go to jeans. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - You just work harder. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And like one time I even went so far </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as to start wearing nice shirts. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like a suit shirt. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, but the suit shirts
when I was making videos. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I was convinced
that this is the next step </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to increasing my productivity. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, turns out it didn't
work, I just hated it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I found the happy
medium at jeans and a shirt. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I felt like if I can dress enough. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Are we talking like a
t-shirt or a college shirts? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - No like this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh , yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - But I think the sweatpants
were the big player, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I basically got to the mindset of, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I wanna wear outfits
that I could just go out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to any social gathering or
I can wear this to anywhere. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And so, I felt like it
helped my productivity. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So if you work at home a lot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and you've gotten into the habit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> of sweatpants-ing all the
time, maybe give a try. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just try wearing what
you would wear to work. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, but what would you
do during the summer then? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I still wear jeans. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You still wear full on jeans? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm not gonna wear jorts.
- Are you gonna wear jorts? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fuck no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Jeans, AC blasting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, I wear whatever I would wear </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> to the Trash Tatse office. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's basically my dress code at home. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But I would never wear
anything too comfy, I guess. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Comfort is the enemy of productivity. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, 'cause if I'm wearing sweatpants, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel like I should be in my bedroom </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> or on the couch.
- Yeah, no I get that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Watching TV just chilling out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - One thing I do do in the morning </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to get me into the work
mode if I'm at home all day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> is that I don't wear like my pajama shirt. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I like change to a different shirt. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What's a pajama shirt? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You have a pajama shirt? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, just like old
shirts that I don't wear. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You wear shirts to bed? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Why don't you do that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I wear shirts to bed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause I don't wanna.
- Why do people do this? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause I don't wanna be naked. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because it just feels. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I wear boxers, just boxes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know, It just
doesn't feel comfortable. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It feels like, unless
I'm in a sleeping bag, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't have enough cover over me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I feel really bare. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And unprotected. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like boxers? Boxers I'm fine with. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I love using the body
parts as temperature control. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> So I put some out, put some in, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> depending on how cold or hot I need to be. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, but do you, do
you wear boxers to bed? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, sometimes naked, sometimes boxers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - See, I need wear boxers to bed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Sleeping completely
naked just feels weird. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's a getting used to thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause the nut sack is
a very delicate thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> to kind of like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You laugh, but that's the main problem. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Your nuts go everywhere and sometimes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> they're more elastic than other times. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - What? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sometimes you just
don't want your nut sack </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> rubbing against your leg. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know like, I dunno, for me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Are your nuts so huge </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that they're like a
fucking sack of potatoes, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like oh fuck it's gone away. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've got to forklift
them out of the way. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - When I'm not wearing a shirt to sleep, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it just feels weird to feel
my own skin on my skin. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I get that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Like you know, it's
exactly the same thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - But the only time I will. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What the fuck, you've been brainwashed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The only time where I will
go to bed without a shirt on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> is if it's excruciatingly hot, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to the point where even the AC on blast </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> isn't gonna do it for me.
- What? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - To me, I need some fabric on me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> to stop myself from touching myself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Use the bedsheets. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, it's an embrace. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You're lightly embraced by the shirt. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, go to sleep. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like an extra layer
of skin that you're not, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that sounded really like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Epidermis 2.0 right here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel like you're just
giving me a very shit reason </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as to why you wear a shirt to bed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's comfortable, end of story. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't understand why
you would feel uncomfortable </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> without a shirt on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then another thing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sometimes if I'm not wearing a shirt, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my body gets even hotter. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because you have like a
natural body temperature </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and if it's like skin on skin, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sometimes it's like a loop system </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where it warms itself up a bit more. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know if that's just me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think that's bullshit, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I think you've got
insulation with more shirt. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like an eddy current up here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Surely the shirt keeps
in the heat more, no? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, I mean like insulation
works both ways, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like if you put, if you put
a jacket on a snowman, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It insulates the heat in,
it insulates the cold in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - They actually say to preserve body heat, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like in super cold
temperatures when you sleep, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's actually better to sleep
naked than to wear something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I just, why wouldn't you wanna. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I just think that you're
meant to sleep naked. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I juts thought that's what
you're supposed to do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Where'd you get this idea from? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] The fucking cavemen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Isn't that how God intended? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, God sleeps naked. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why wear clothes then? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It just seems like a lot more effort </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to be wearing clothes to bed,
why are you complicating it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Effort? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, just go naked. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How hard is it to
put a shirt on for you? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I just think why are you
adding shirts into an equation </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that doesn't need it? You know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why do you use blankets then? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, question then. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, why need blankets? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - All right, here's a question then. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why not just sleep on a slab of rock? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I have a serious question. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - So then when you start
doing the business, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't you just throw the shirt off? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, that just seems like a lot of work. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm always ready. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's two seconds, it's
just whoop, you're done. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - When you jack off, do you wear a shirt? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Depends where I am. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's never really part of
the equation of jacking off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just like, do I have my shirt on? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel like I'm like the Michellin man </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> when I'm jacking off wearing a shirt, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like I'm constricted. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, fucking hell,
get this shirt off me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do you fucking bulk up when you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Have you never done the
business with a shirt on? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I have, I don't like it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It feels like I'm in some
kind of like constriction. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't like it at all. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - You don't like it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, it feels dreadful. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't mind it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, sometimes you need
to, something it's nice. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's a reason why, in
porn, they take the short off. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's 'cause you want to get like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, that's because they're
on fucking camera mate. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, but also.
- Are you on camera? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I might be. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Don't know what I'm into. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Gotta know I'm fucking. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Next sponsor. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> But it's also like when
you're pooping sometimes, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you have to take your shirt off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - But that's more of just like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The same kind of energy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, that's the
thing, if it gets intense </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll take the shirt off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Not every poop, you need
to take your shirt off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I would prefer if possible. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Speak for yourself. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - When you wake up, right,
and you have the first poop, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> do you take the shirt off when you do it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Or do you just like to.
- No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, I keep it on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like the shirt-taking-off-poops </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> are for the poops that fight back. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It's when you need to like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you need that extra push and that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Those are the poops that are
like, no, I'm staying here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> The ones in the morning
are kind of just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> all right, it was a good night. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I generally prefer to just
take it off when I poop anyway. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Not during the day, if I'm
out in a public restroom. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, time to undress. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Connor goes for a poop and just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and he takes off the
JoJo suit, puts it over, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> takes off the tie, takes off the shirt. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I'd still poop faster than Garnt. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know, it's
just a placebo, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just feel more comfortable
wearing a shirt to bed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I dunno what it is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think you've nerfed yourself. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - In what way have we nerfed ourselves? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - How? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel like you've nerfed yourself. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, 'cause I can poop
without any requirements. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know what it also is as well? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It doesn't sound like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because it sounds like the requirement is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you need to take a shirt off. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You need to have nothing on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I just prefer it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's literally a requirement. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I can sleep naked, I just
prefer to have a shirt on.. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - What of you're stranded without a shirt. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Then I'll sleep with my shirt off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> He's the reason. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But you'll be
complaining the whole time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - He's the reason as well though, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I've actually experienced this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where in the middle of the
night, we're in Japan, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Earthquakes, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They happened all the fucking time, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> If there's a massive earthquake
in the middle of the night, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't wanna be that weirdo
running out of my house, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> butt fucking naked. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You have time to grab your clothes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well the why don't
you just wear the shirt </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at that point, then, if you have the time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to wear a shirt escaping
from an earthquake, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> why not just sleep with it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm not Jason Bourne, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't need to be ready
for combat situations </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> every fucking night. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I haven't got a drawer full
of passports ready to go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in case I need to be deported. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> This t-shirt is on the floor, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this one extra second of
putting on the t-shirt, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which I can do on the way to
the elevator or some shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't need to. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - On the way to an
elevator in an earthquake. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Nothing is, I'm not walking downstairs. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just have this mental
image of just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if an earthquake happens when
Connor is either sleeping </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or on the toilet, it's just gonna be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that scene from Borat out all over again. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Connor just emerges butt naked. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Completely butt naked. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - If I'm shitting in the
middle of an earthquake, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm taking my chances, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm gonna carry on doing what I'm doing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm not, why would I run out? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like running out
is just a stupid idea. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just stay in your house. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Maybe, yeah, if you die, you die. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, it is a very specific situation. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, of course. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - When we evacuated in LA, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I felt like we did not need to evacuate. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I felt like we should've
just stayed in our room. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I dunno what they what the
recommended guideline is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I'm pretty sure running
down to the bottom floor </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is not the right idea. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Navi] Nor is the elevator. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, you can't use the elevator. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] I ran all the way down. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Navi ran 51 stories. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I would say not using the
elevator during an earthquake </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> is probably at the top
of things not to do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I just had shit to do after it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> so I really wanted to get down fast. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Those Chick-fil-A nuggets
weren't gonna eat themselves. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - That as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And also, the moment that
I was immediately put off </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> going down the stairs,
was when we ran past </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the American family
and that guy was acting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like we were in a Hollywood movie. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And he had like three
kids and he was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> kids stay with me, stay with your daddy! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We're gonna go down together,
as a team, hold hands! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was like, I'm not
being in this guy's movie. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm gonna do my own thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't want to be part of this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's when I decided that
I was not doing the stairs. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was a pretty tense situation. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But the moment I heard that dad say that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I was just like, pfft. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - The earthquake had ended,
it was like, whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I was not really scared anymore. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The building was still shaking, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I was like, whatever,
it's not a big deal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The building's built for it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, the building's built
different to withstand it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - To withstand those, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So I was pretty confident
that we were gonna be fine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> So I was like, whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think I'll take the elevator. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I realized that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Don't take emergency advice from Connor. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm not recommending
it, I just, I'm lazy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - He just does it anyway. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was just, you know,
I felt confident enough </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that I was gonna be fine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And if I died, you know, sure, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can have my Darwin award
in peace, 'cause I'm dead. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can kind of relate to that
in like a tangential sense </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> where you just willingly
put your life in danger, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just for a bit of convenience. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't feel like he was
endanger, I didn't feel that way. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because living in Thailand, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is going on a complete tangent. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Every time you get in the car. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Take your shirt off. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, that's not
risking your life, okay? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Bangkok is the only place I've lived in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> where people willingly risked
their lives on the daily </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> by taking a motorcycle taxi daily </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> in some of the most
dangerous roads in the world </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just to save yourself
30 minutes of traffic. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And we do that on a daily
and I do that on a daily. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just like, that's weird
when you think about it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I can't really describe </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> why I just wanted to take the elevator. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I think I just realized, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I could either walk
down 70 floors of stairs </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or I could just risk it
and take the elevator. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I think at that point in time, to me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> taking 70 flights of stairs
was not worth my life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, I mean, I can't argue against that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I also went in the elevator. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think it was one of those
things where it was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Connor's going in the elevator. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> All right if he's stupid
enough to risk his life, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I guess I feel confident enough
where I'll go in with it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I can blame Connor if I die. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know, I know that
I shouldn't do it, but I did. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, we ended up
not going down anyway. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, so what ended up
happening was cosmic justice, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is that the elevator to get down, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you had to go up to the
70th floor, to the lobby, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to then get down and when
we got to the 70th floor, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they stopped all the elevators. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - So basically, we went down
about 35 stairs for nothing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> So basically just instant karma. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Instant karma compilation. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then we waited 10 minutes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and the elevator started working. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, and then there was no problems. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I was very delighted by it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Navi] I literally
looked back and was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where the fuck are they? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Meanwhile, Navi was like,
went down 70 flights of stairs, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> turned around, was like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - But you know, when
stuff like that happens, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like I don't wanna
be that guy who's panicking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and running around like all these people. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No that's the worst thing to do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just feel like this is.
- Dopey sheep. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wake up sheeple. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is how you're inviting
a shitty situation to happen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> You know, I also don't wanna
try my chances on the road. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause when you leave the hotel, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're just facing the road. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't want to try my
chance with stuff falling </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> or people driving on the
road in an earthquake. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was pretty content
that my room was fine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, oh whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, that's the
thing, in some situations </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's actually more dangerous
to go out on the road </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because in the case with Japan, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> we have so much like electrical
wiring from the roads </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that if those fall and snap,
they can easily electrocute you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> fucking traffic signs
can come down, hurt you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel like the safest
place is just to probably be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> on the ground floor. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yes.
- Of a building. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I dunno but you get way more
like earthquake vibrations </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> on the first floor.
- Do you? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, the higher up the
building, the less you get. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You just get swaying if you're up top. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And when you're down below </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you get the fucking violent shaking. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, the best thing
to do is to just go out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> into like a really, really open field. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel like this is a point in my life </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> where I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know if I should
listen to this advice. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, 'cause the really tall buildings </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> are built on like rolling mechanics. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So when the building, you
fucking experienced it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - What'd you mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The hotel we stayed in? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's built on rollers so that
when the earthquake happens, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it starts rolling. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, but on the ground floor. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Sometimes you literally don't
even feel the earthquake. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Because there's no swaying
or anything like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, 'cause you're getting like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the actual fucking earth shaking. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's not what it feels
like on the ground floor. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it does! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You've had an earthquake
on the ground floor, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It feels very violently shaking. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, but it's kind of the
same as being on the building. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - When I experienced both in Japan, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I definitely prefer in LA </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when the building was just swaying. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I liked that a lot more. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was literally on the street </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and sometimes I didn't even notice </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that there was an
earthquake when people will. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause there's nothing to
like, how can I put this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There's nothing to put your perspective </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> in that you're in an earthquake. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> You just feel a bit wobbly.
- The floor is moving. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The floor doesn't move, it shakes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Does it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It shakes but a lot of the times </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you can't actually see it moving </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> until you look at something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, there's nothing to
ground your perspective. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Whereas, if you're in a building, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can see other buildings doing this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't really mind though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Most of the times, I don't even
realize I'm in an earthquake </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> until I have something to
like ground that perspective. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Sometime like living in Japan, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sometimes I just get up, get a head rush, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, ooh, was that an earthquake? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like do you ever get that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, but because there's
so many light earthquakes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But you know when you're
getting an earthquake, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause it used to be like, just fucking. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - My mom has this story
of when she was in school, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> she was like running along
the tracks at school. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And you know when you're running, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> your entire world is doing this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So she was running and she was looking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at the school building
and then she stopped </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the building just kept doing this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and she realized she was in an earthquake. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And she didn't realize until she stopped </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because to her perspective,
it's already going up and down. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> But then, I think again,
it's that like perspective </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> of being, that's not moving
the way it's intended to. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - But also, the swaying
and all that stuff, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't really give a shit, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as long as the building
isn't falling down. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I just don't want my stuff to break. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, yeah, that's the biggest thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is just shit falling down, isn't it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, that's why if I ever
knew there was an earthquake, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I would just rush to my like camera gear. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like hold my shirt and coat. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Protect, protect. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - JoJo figures, please. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Me and my anime figures. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Those are the real
casualties in earthquakes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I had those 400, $500 Jojo figures </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that were like very finely balanced. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That were balanced, the
weight was like this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So that the center of
gravity was very worrying. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And during earthquakes, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I immediately had to just like
go to them if I was there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And during, we had one
pretty big earthquake </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I was surprised 'cause
my figures just stayed up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, I mean same
with the studio as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yours didn't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's weird 'cause the
figures that had fallen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> looked like pretty normal figures </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but the one that I really expect to break, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> didn't move at all. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, I mean, it's
the same here as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Like at the old track station. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I expected Rohan to just be over. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - All of these knockedover,
but the only casualty we had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> was fucking Mike. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fucking Mike. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Every time I'm not at my house </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and there's an earthquake in Japan, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just assume my house
is gonna be demolished </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> when I'm back. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, everything's fucked, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I have to rebuild my whole
life, it's all ruined. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do you guys have like the
anti-earthquake proof stuff </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in your cabinets? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You probably should do that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It really does make a difference. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Does it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- What is it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So basically like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or, I mean there's lots of
different variations of it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Do you need it for most stuff though? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like it's for very specific things. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - We put it on most stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like most of the big
stuff will sound like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you have figuring
cabinets or like bookshelves, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> this is like little, kind of like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they look like little rubber doorstoppers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I know what they
are, I know what they are. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And you put them underneath
and it completely stops </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the shaking from happening. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I wanted to get the
figures to stop shaking. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yes I have them under
like all of my bookshelves </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and figuring cabinets and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And you know, I've seen
the move in an earthquake. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That shit doesn't budge. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So that's really good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And also like there's also
these little sticky pads </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of thing that you
can put on some figurines </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and stuff like that stops
them from falling over. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's just weird that you
have to live in a country </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and you can just worry
about like instant death </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just happening. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> In the UK nothing kills you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Instant death, I mean
it;snot exactly instant death </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was just worried,
well, I mean, it might be. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - If you're in the wrong situation. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I suppose we've been lucky enough </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> to had never have been
in a bad earthquake. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know, I feel like we've never. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Garnt says this, don't fucking say it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Well they've been
predicting the mega-quake </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for a few years now in Tokyo. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Where there's bound to be some kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> magnitude eight or nine
fucking earthquake in Tokyo </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and I hope to God it happens
in the next three weeks </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so I'm not here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I bet you'll wish you were </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> on the ground floor then, Connor. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, I felt like the
shaking was very violent. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I used to live on the 4 to 5th floor </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it used to shake really
weirdly, I didn't like it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I felt like it was just high enough up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> where I got really violent shakes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I got, I was on the 8th floor, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and I think with the biggest
earthcake we were in, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which was the one where,
- Earthcake. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Earthcake, earthquake,
(laughs) earthcake. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The biggest earthquake we were in, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which was the one where
my figures fell over, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was in the toilet at the time, but. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's the safest room to be in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was in the bath one time as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - But that earthquake just
lasted for so fucking long. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It felt like it lasted like two minutes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> or something like that.
- At least, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, go on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, 'cause it just started
and like at which point, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause you have to make
this mental judgment of, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at which point do I start giving a shit? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, because most of the
time it's a little shake. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause it happens so often. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It happens so often, so I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh, is this the one I should start caring. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's not stopping, should
I start caring now? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But also, what are you
gonna do if you give a shit? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, what am I gonna do? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just be like, oh shit, I'm worried. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, you have to like evacuate </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to your nearest evacuation point, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> which everyone should know when you move. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Do you know where is it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fuck no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - You gotta get under
the doorframe, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Doorframe, but also like
if it gets really bad, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then there's like in your local town, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's usually like evacuation points </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you have to go to. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's normally if your
water and shit turns off </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and all that, is right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, in a lot of situations
it's like earthquakes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and floods and stuff like that, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But why would you leave
your house in an earthquake </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> if it's like, that's surely
if it's unstable, no? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, I mean, what if. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - The building's unstable. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's usually in the case of like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if the earthquake is really
powerful that your water stops </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> or your electricity stops, your gas stops. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's what I thought, right,
to get supplies and shelter. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause if the winter, if
it's really fucking cold </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and your electricity turns off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, then you're kind of screwed it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm kind of fucked
because I am not stocked up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on any kind of emergency or disaster. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, we recently restocked our shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> So it's all in the front.
- I need to. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I've been meaning to, it's been two years. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Been meaning to.
- Two years now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I've been meaning to do that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll get around to it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll get around to it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Not to wait. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I remember for
"Journey Across Japan", </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> we went to like, Sakurajima, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is that island volcano in Kagoshima. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I remember two weeks
after we left there, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it fucking erupted. And it's like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But high though? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, it's pretty big as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it made me realize, I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh yeah, earthquakes are
like the least of my worries </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause Japan is like
fucking volcanic area. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There's like so many active volcanoes, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like Mount Fuji's a
fucking active volcano. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah, it is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It is, it's an active
volcano and it last erupted, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think, about 250 years ago. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And they're expecting it to- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 250 years ago? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, in the edo
period, it last erupted. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - And they're expecting it to erupt soon. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Sick. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So, I'm like, sick. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Navi] They actually did a simulation </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if it erupts completely, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it actually reaches all
the way to Hachioji. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Navi] It's still that fucked. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Wow. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's kinda like Yellowstone,
right, in America? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Where that's like one
of the biggest active, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> super volcanoes in the world. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And if that erupts then it's just, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of like the end of
civilization for a lot of people. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Makes a lot of the waters
at Yellowstone boiling hot, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like the lakes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Some horrifying stories of
people jumping in the water, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thinking that they can swim
in it, and it's boiling. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - They just get boiled away. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, pretty grim. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's pretty grim. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But I don't know when it's so bad, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when do I leave my house? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Is there a hard guide on
when to leave your house? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, I'm pretty sure
you'll know when you'll know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like when it gets to
the point where it's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> oh, I can't be here for
a multitude of reasons, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> then it's time to go. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, the ones that I
don't really get scared </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of the earthquakes in Japan, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but the ones that do kind
of make me uncomfortable </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is when it starts small and
it just keeps getting bigger. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then you're like, when will it stop? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Will it keep escalating? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because when it starts off big
and it doesn't get any worse, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, okay cool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's the long ones for me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, where it starts,
it shakes, shakes, shakes! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And you're like, please,
okay please, please stop. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is like when is this gonna peak? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Where's the peak, this is the peak? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No, it's not peaking yet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just feel like it's the British in me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where you just don't take </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> any kind of like natural
disaster seriously. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm just like, come on, pack it in. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> All right, stop this now, come on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've had enough of this,
I'm finished, come on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's a natural disaster. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Come on, there's no natural
disasters in the world. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - So you guys don't have
any natural disaster? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - No.
- No. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's some flooding, but very light. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's not really.
- Right, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - We have flooding here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I hear of like a
weather warning in Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just like, what the
fuck's a weather warning? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - How can weather kill you? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - My phone has been on
permanent weather warnings </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> since I've moved here, I'm pretty sure. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'd love to imagine the
first time a British person </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like went abroad, in 1600s
and there's an earthquake, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like what the fuck was that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What the fuck was that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And they're like, yeah,
that happens all the time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What do you mean that
happens all the time? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The Earth just moves? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah the Earth just moves. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And you're all okay with this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You haven't asked
management what's going on? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's a living. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And they're like, yeah, yeah, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and sometimes the mountain explodes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The mountain explodes? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And fire? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - The mountain explodes, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> we get these things called typhoons. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, they're like,
what do you mean lava? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> That's hell, that's hell coming out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We've only seen that in the
books, this doesn't happen? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> This is nonsense. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's 20,000 leagues under the sea. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - And you accept this? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Is this okay with you? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like, what is a typhoon? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's just a bit of wind aint it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Bit of wind's never hurt anyone. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just a bit of rain,
we get that all the time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's a bit of rain and wind. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What do you mean nature
destroyed your house, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and did you get a refund? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What is all this? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - What is a Tsunami,
it's just waves, aint it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, when we think about it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Japan really is world
number one when it comes to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the variety of fucking things
that can kill you in nature. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We really do have everything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause I remember before
I moved out of England, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you'd hear about these
disasters that happened </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all the way on the
other side of the world. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like the Japan tsunami, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which was an awful tragedy that happens. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And you just didn't,
it never quite sank in. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It never felt real. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like how bad it was. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I remember just
before we moved to Japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where you guys are having
like super bad typhoons </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and like the videos that
came out just look super bad </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was just like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It still doesn't sink into me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that it's just this bad here
in Japan, as a British person, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I've just never
experienced it IRL, in real life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It's never just happened
right in front of me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It really is completely different, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can watch like,
hundreds of videos on it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and the one that you've actually
experienced in real life </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is unlike anything you would ever imagine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like those typhoons look bad, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's a hundred times worse in real life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Watching earthquakes
from the 2011 earthquake </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> is like, really fucking weird. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's fucking terrifying, dude. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just seeing people just
everything's shaking super badly, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, oh gosh. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - And just like the water
level rising and shit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> is like terrifying. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That happened 10 years ago, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah time flies.
- Yeah, 2011. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Holy shit, I was still in university. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I would gladly take
volcanoes if we can get onsens. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Stick a volcano somewhere in
Wales, I will have an onsen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Would onsen culture work in the UK? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - If we had volcanoes, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You sure?
- Yeah, I think so. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I wouldn't.
- I agree. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> They'd serve alcohol. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You just want it to work. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'll make it work, we'll serve beer. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Not if people have to get
naked in front of each other. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think you underestimate how. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think that culture just
wouldn't work in the UK. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It wouldn't work.
- I think it could work. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - If you teach them from a young age. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Listen, get naked. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Getting naked is normal with your homies. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - You can teach a group
of people cannibalism </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from a young age and they'll
think it's all right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, we're not talking about, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like if the entire history
of the UK had changed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> to introduce this culture
from the beginning, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause then they'd just be
fucking Japan, wouldn't they? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - If you gave them a free
beer at the end of it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you go in naked with your
boys, you get a free beer, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> they'd do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - You sure?
- 100% </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I doubt. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> If I went up to a guy from the UK, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like born and bred, never
left the country and I said, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll give you a beer
if you get in this bath </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with this other dude naked. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - When you say it like that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that sounds way worse 'cause that's. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So that's what an onsen is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause they're probably imagining </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> some tight traditional bath
where their dicks are touching </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they're like, oh God,
oh, I'm so scared of penises. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean there are
onsens like that though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, but not really public ones though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, well, I mean, we've been in one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Have we? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, remember.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - We've been pretty close
together in an onsen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah at the end of the cycling tour. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> We went in that really,
really tight onsen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was like me, you, Joey and Chris </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and our legs were definitely touching. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- I don't remember this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That just shows how used
to it you've gotten, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it's just like nothing to you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm sure someone who's not
used to that type of culture </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> would find that traumatizing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Especially a lot of Brits, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Imagine being scared of a penis though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just couldn't imagine it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, you'd be surprised. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like not even being scared of penises, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> but just the social boundary
of seeing your mate's penis </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or seeing someone close to you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and just knowing what
they look like naked. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, I'm totally fine with it now, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but that's because I've done it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> since I was with you boys right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's that one thing of
just getting to that point </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and once you're over
it, then you're over it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I think for a lot of people, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it stops at getting to that point. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, maybe in the
UK, if it was in the UK, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I would think it's weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Which is why for me, it's such a shame </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because when people from overseas </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> come to Japan for the first
time and they're like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I wanna know everything
about the culture, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What are some really
unique Japanese things. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And of course the first thing
I think all of his onsens. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> But immediately I always
hesitate, being like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I get this, you're about to see my dick, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but in like a cool way. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I said cyber punk
music, when you said that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - In a nice relaxing way. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> We're in a bath together
and yes, we're naked, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's not weird, it's
not weird, trust me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And we're with other
random people as well, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it's not weird, you know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - The first thing I tell
people now, it's just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you wanna come to Japan? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> You want me to take you around? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We'll go into an onsen right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Just get that out of the way. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think if someone's willing
to go to the onsen with you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - They probably will be
up for anything, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah everything Japanese culture. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like if you can't put
your own cultural differences </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> aside to participate in another culture, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> then I don't think you're. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I agree. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - And yeah, again,
that's what I kind of use </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as a gauge of like cultural
understanding for that person. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, if they can get over this, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then you'll be fine in Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm very open to some things, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but there are some things
where I've seen in like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you know when they had, what was it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Was it a TV show called "Tribe" in the UK. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's dude who went around tribes
in the Amazon or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And there was one thing
that he did that I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Okay, I don't think I'd that," </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it was like a penis
inverting ceremony or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh that!
- Oh that one! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Did you see the video
where the guy faints </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when they do it to him? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, yeah, you know what, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I thought I was up for a lot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I think that's where I'm good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Have you seen the one where
they have to wear that glove </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> of just like bullet ants? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, oh my God.
- Oh, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I'm just like, why
would anyone wanna do this? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - If I was, you gave me enough beers, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> maybe I do the ants thing but. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Let's go! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - But it's the video of that guy, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the tribal chief does it to him </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and he just faints immediately. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh God, it sounded terrible. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I think there
are many penises going, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> ah, just listening to you, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Just like, aah! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I'm pretty much up for anything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that doesn't involve destroying my body </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or pain or stuff like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm pretty much down for anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I'm usually down for
anything when it comes to like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> especially when it comes to
things like food and drinks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, which is why I hate
it when people lie to me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about their, they make a joke that like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah, our culture, we do this
and then they just lie to me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I didn't have to put
my penis out in public. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm kidding. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But this is why I trust my
friends when I go somewhere new </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they're like, this is what we do here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, I trust you, that sounds weird, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I trust you, please don't fuck me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Like Garnt could be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah, so in Thailand we get
our dicks out in restaurants </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and swing them around and be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all right, well, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is the culture. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - When in Rome, do as the Romans. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I would trust Garnt if Garnt
told something like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Garnt was like, yeah, you
have to spit on the food </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> before you eat it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm just waiting for
the perfect opportunity </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to abuse that power. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - He's gonna do it, he's
gonna fucking do it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I know he is as well,
that's the worst part. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm just waiting for
the perfect opportunity </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to abuse that power. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I'm gonna do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause I've only got one chance to do it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> before I completely lose that trust. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like Joey in
Australia, he'll be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah, you have to snort all your alcohol </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'll be like, oh okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - You have to drink
alcohol through your eye. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think a few Australians do do that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, we do do that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's called a suicide
shot I'm pretty sure. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - To be fair we used to have
a lot of shows in the UK </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that would cover binge
drinking and clubbing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know why we had
TV shows about this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And there'd be this one show </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and this is where I first discovered </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that people did vodka shots
through their eyeball. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it was weird and they would
do it and they'd ask them, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the interviewer would ask
them, why did you do it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He's like, 'cause I
just get drunk so fast. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like, is drinking not fast enough? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's pretty fast, it's
pretty damn instant. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's pretty fucking fast. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then it just immediately
cut to a doctor who was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah well actually, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> inserting any kind of alcohol in your eye </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is extremely dangerous and
can remove the lipid layer </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of an eye and can permanently
damage and possibly blind you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, of course.
- And I was like, oh. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't need a professional
doctor telling me that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like it should be common sense. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah it's like a splinter in your butt. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, I didn't
need a doctor to tell me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that that didn't need to go there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's weird, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's so strange 'cause
I feel like in the UK </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> with partying and all that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's so many stuff that you just do it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause everyone else tells you to do it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I would just always
sat there thinking like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> what the fuck is going on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it's definitely,
especially in a university where- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just the idea of doing a dirty shot now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just makes me feel sick. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What is a dirty shot? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Explain to the viewers Garnt,
and me, 'cause I forgot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I don't know what it is either. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Or I dirty pint. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You just, you play
probably most of the time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it's fucking ring of fire,
which is the university game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And then you have this pint
glass in the middle where, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> whenever you draw certain cards, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you have to fill up with whatever alcohol. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel sick hearing that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Whatever alcohol that
person is drinking. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And sometimes if you're in
like an ultra hardcore party, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> then you fill up with like other shit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you would never
put in a fucking drink. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Shit like washing up
liquid or stuff like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, they would do it.
- Or Tabasco sauce. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Or Nandos sauce. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We had a rule in ours
where whoever lost, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> they had to leave the room for 30 seconds. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And anything in the kitchen
could be put in the drink. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - People would put like pepper
grains, washing up liquid </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and they would drink it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I understand pepper grains and Tabasco, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but washing up liquid? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You'd immediately throw it
up, there's no way you could </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. I've actually done
it before, when I was 17. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You fucking idiot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah you're a fucking ass. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm lucky, for some
reason during my whole time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> at university when I played
this game, I never got it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But I would've refused. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, we played that game, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but we made it stuff that
you could actually drink. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah it's really disgusting. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's the civilized thing to do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I had food poisoning
yesterday and I feel dreadful </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and hearing this makes you
feel even more dreadful. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why did you get food poisoning Conor? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I ate a bad sausage. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - You had a bad sausage. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I ordered two sausages, I cut one up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and it was very, very pink on the inside. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's a bad sign. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I thought no, I'm
not eating that one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> But I cut up the other
one and it looked okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And you ate it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and it was not.
- What kinda sausage was it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Was it Italian sausage?
- A fucking terrible sausage. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Narrator, and it was not okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel sick describing it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - You have Connoren food poisoning. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, you are so susceptible to it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think since you've been in Japan, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you've had food poisoning
at least three or four times </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> from my memory.
- Three times. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - What's the worst food
poisoning you've ever had? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - The () one? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - () one? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, that was the worst one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You had food poisoning for a week. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was shitting and
vomiting for a week straight </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was terrible. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> God it was so bad.
- I think I've only had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> food poisoning once. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - In Japan, 'cause they
should have so much raw shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like you know, they serve
raw chicken here, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And they say like, ah,
there's no salmonella. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There is salmonella, there's
just way less of it right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're just less likely to get it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It doesn't mean you can't get it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm not being funny, but you
should not eat raw chicken. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I don't care if Japan
is like, yeah, it's safe. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've had it before. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, but it's not. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's not even that good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's not that good and
you all rolling a dice. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You can eat it, but
you are rolling a dice. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, I had raw chicken at an Izakaya </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that specialized in raw chicken. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause there's a lot of Izakayas </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that just like give it to you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I still wouldn't. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's a cultural thing, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Where people would just like,
this is safe, this is safe. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm just like, is it though, is it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Is it safe? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like you are eating
it and there is a risk, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there is still a risk. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Of course there's a risk. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But you are unlikely
to get food poisoning </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> from eating the raw chicken, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but there was still a
chance you can get it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, you can still get it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> especially if your stomach's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> not used to it.
- Way more than other foods. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But, I mean, a lot of things, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> especially I feel like in
Asia, which just has a lot of, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> a lot less standards when it comes to say </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the health and safety
of the food you serve. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like even like Japan
compared to the rest of Asia </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> has really, really good food standards, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> compared to fucking Southeast Asia. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, yeah.
- Oh my God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - But Japan compared to the UK </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is like Japan doesn't bat
an eye if it's like pinkish </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm like, oof, my
chicken's pink in the middle. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, oh God, don't
know if I can eat that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean yeah, the only
time I got food poisoning </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was when I went to the
Philippines for the first time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And of all things I could
have got food poisoning from, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it wasn't the duck fetus,
it wasn't even the water, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was a fucking mango shake. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I ate a fucking mango </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> straight off the fucking street vendor, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and that's what gave me food poisoning. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like cool, amazing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was a fantastic shake,
but man, I was shitting, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I was pissing out my
ass for about two days. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It was horrible. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I think the worst
food poisoning I've ever got </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was from China actually when
I was still living there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And you know, when you live in China like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the food there is fucking great,
especially the street food, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it's just trying to pinpoint </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where you got food
poisoning there is like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - A needle in a haystack. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's kinda like a needle in a haystack. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You're just like, where did,
which one of these food stands </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> did I get food poisoning from,
it could be any one of them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Could be like a culmination
of all of them too, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just come together as one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I remember it was so bad </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I almost had to go to the hospital </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I remember it was new year's Eve </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for one of the years, I
can't remember which year, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> exact year it was. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But I remember I was sitting on the toilet </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I needed to throw up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> at the same time that I was shitting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Those are the worst. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - You laugh but it was a
traumatic experience for me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What were you just alternating? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was trying. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Or did you have to like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was trying to keep
it in, but that one time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> one time I literally could
not like hold either one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I literally didn't like needed to like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was sitting on the toilet </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I needed to like try to like aim. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I can't listen to this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's awful, I don't
wanna get too graphic. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've done that before. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But it was the most awful
food poisoning experience </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've ever had. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's kind of like a scene
out of "South Park" where. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I know which one you're. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Where he literally
shits and then pukes up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then has a nose
bleed at the same time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> That was my experience. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, say what you will
about fast food chains. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've never gotten food poisoning
from a fast food chain. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've never gotten food poisoning, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you mean like junk food
and stuff like that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah like McDonald's whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've never gotten.
- I've never gotten </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> food poisoning from it personally, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but I have gotten very sick. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I felt bad, but I've
never had to throw up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> after eating like KFC or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know about America, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've seen some really
ghastly ones in America. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But in the UK and Japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I've had nothing but good experiences. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, Japan is really good with fast food. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think like the few times </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that I've had McDonald's
in America, I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I really wanna throw up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel so rough. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I really wanna throw this
up, yeah, it's horrible. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know how they
make burgers tastes so bad </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> at McDonald's in America. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know what they do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I dunno, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's 'cause McDonald's just
makes enough money worldwide </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and in America there's just
so much better burgers right, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that it doesn't matter. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's more higher-end
burgers in America. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's way more competition
in America, I feel. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like in America, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> McDonald's lives off the
reputation of how would. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's the American burger. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - The rest of the world, right? </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_01> back to the episode. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Speaking of traveling and stuff, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> this is the last podcast
before we head back to the UK, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> me and you, so you're
not going to see a break, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but we're going to have
about like a six, seven week? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, like a month and
a half break, basically. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, a six week break. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Which is the longest break </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> we've ever taken from Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I wanna see people who are
like bingeing Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Like watching this episode
and then going to the next </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and being like, what the fuck happened? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I wonder if there's any difference? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Like what if I just get a scar, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a really cool scar? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - You just come back and you're
just like completely bald. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Just got an eye patch on
or something like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Woohaa! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's been really with
me for the past few weeks </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> because I've been living alone, I guess, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for like the past two, three weeks? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah, 'cause Sydney
went back to America? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, Sydney, she's back in America. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think this is like the
longest we've been apart. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - First time, huh? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it's so weird not
having a partner home. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's just one, the
home feels so empty. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like my God, like if it
wasn't for Corona lockdown, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I would want to meet so many
people 'cause I'm just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I need to do something to remind me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - You need someone to talk to. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I need someone to talk to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I need someone to fill in the gap </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of having no one in your house. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I've forgotten what that felt like, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel that, I feel that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's just 'cause
you're used to it right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> To me, it's like, I don't feel that way. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I now see why you try to meet up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with as many people as you can. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause if I was in your
shoes I would do the same </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause it's lonely without having someone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just there to talk to
whenever you want to. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I also just really like
being alone sometimes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I really value being able to
just like do whatever I want. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I like my alone time too. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, but like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - But only to a certain extent. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I like it a lot, a lot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I like my alone time as well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and I feel like any healthy relationship, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you have space to have your alone time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But if you're feeling lonely,
there's just someone there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Also, not a thing is
that the chores are now, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like I'm in charge of all the chores, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm just like, what is this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, this is gonna
sound a bit misogynistic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But like in my household, I'm
in charge of the washing up, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and Sydney is in charge
of the laundry, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And so I was just used
to only do the washing up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and having the woman
doing the laundry, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why did you have to say it like that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just wanted it to sound
as misogynist as I can. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because now I am, there's
no one to do the laundry </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm just like, woman,
where is my laundry done! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I just realized, I
have to do it myself now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just like to imagine I just
slowly enter Garnt's house, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and from across the house, I just hear, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> "Woman, I need a fresh pair of underwear!" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - You really got done dirty </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause laundry is like the
easiest of the household tasks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I'm the one that does
the laundry in our house. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think washing up the
dishes is far more painful. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, I hate washing up the dishes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why did you agree to that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because I also hate
doing the laundry as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - No I like the laundry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why?
- Laundry's nice bro. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Fresh sheets. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, now that we've
bought a washing machine </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with a built-in dryer. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> All I have to do is just fucking
take it out and fold it up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But I liked the process
of folding up washing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know why I hate that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's meditative. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's so unoptimized. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Because the thing is, the
thing about the laundry </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is that at least with washing up, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just a one activity
thing, you get it over </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with laundry, you have to put it in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then you have to remember
that you put the laundry in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and sometimes I'm such
a forgetful little shit, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that like you forget hours
afterwards that you had laundry </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in the laundry machine
and then you take it out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it fucking stinks </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> because you left it in there for so long. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> So then you have to re-laundry
your fucking laundry! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well that just sounds
like a you problem. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - That is a me problem,
gonna hate laundry. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The laundry machines often have this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> very loud thing called a beeping noise? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it goes, (beeps) when it's done. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, but sometimes you just. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You might have heard
it on your microwave, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kinda same thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Sometimes you're just doing shit, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sometimes you're just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh, let me just finish
up this piece of work </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and then I'll do the laundry </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then you just forget
that you hear that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It sounds like a you problem, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause if I'm doing work </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and then I hear from my
laundry machine going (beeps), </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, all right
time to do the laundry. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know how hard it is.
- Really not that difficult. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Also, I don't have to
worry about dishes anymore </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> because we have a dishwasher. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I wish, I wish, I wish that was me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel like I'm like a
cave man just evolving. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel like discovering
civilization for the first time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I mean dishes I was used to doing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but with laundry, is this
how men felt in the '60s? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - We're gonna get
canceled for this episode. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm not saying shit bro. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Garnt's gonna cancel this episode. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I disagree with all of
Garnt's opinions here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because in our house </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I have to do the laundry and the dishes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> because that's the one
chore that Arki hates doing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So she does like the vacuuming </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and like the cleaning
up and stuff like that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> because I fucking hate
vacuuming the house. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I also hate vacuuming the house. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Imagine doing all of it yourself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, I had to do that
when I was living on my own. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's crazy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But now I feel bad 'cause my two chores, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> which is the laundry and the dishes, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just let the machine do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I literally just press
a button, I'm like, done. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's great. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I wish that was me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I have to wash my dishes by hand </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and my laundry doesn't
have a dryer as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Dude, I'm telling you, man, when you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't really like the
dryers in laundry machines, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel like they ruin the clothes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't like the dryer either. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Really? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - But I also hate having to
put out the laundry to dry. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I hate having to
put up the laundry more. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's something good
about an old-fashioned, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> natural dryer that just
kind of gets to me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It does, it does. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But the problem with that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is that you are at the
mercy of the weather right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because what are you meant
to do in the winter time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Hang it inside, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - The best, the best. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why, just hang it outside,
what are you talking about? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What, in the rain? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's not permanently
raining in the winter. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah but what if you have
laundry that just finished </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it starts raining. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it's unfortunate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but you can just hang
it up somewhere else. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, inside. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So basically what I just fucking said! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - You can do it outside,
it's not a big deal. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - No it is a big deal 'cause
it's gonna get dirty again </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> from the rain. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You wash it against,
it's even more clean. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - See that's what someone
living on their own would say. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I know, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I would've said the same
thing if I was living alone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because it's like, oh, it's my
clothes, fuck it, who cares? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> But I have to take care of
another person's clothes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and she doesn't quite like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Does Aki get like, no,
you have to do it this way. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, no, it's not so
much Aki's preference, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's more so just fucking common sense. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Don't try and dry washing in the rain. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Don't you put it out when it's raining. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Sometimes you put it out,
then it starts raining, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you forget that it's raining, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause you didn't notice right away, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's a little wet,
fuck I have to do it again. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - At that point that's
just annoying right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause then you just take, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like leaving it out in
the rain, I have to rewash it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Because that washes out the
good stuff about the laundry. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm simply one man, I
cannot conquer nature. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've accepted that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right, so that's why I
bought a washing machine </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that has a really good
dryer attached to it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - You're trying to play God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, no, no, no, no,
because here's the thing, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Here's the thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Because if you dry your
clothes in the dryer, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then you're gonna need to
iron your shirts, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel if it's like naturally dried, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sometimes if you get it out
just fresh out of the washing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you like, what's? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Whip it?
- Whip it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was trying to think of the English word </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I just knew the Thai word for it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You fucking whip the clothes
and it dries naturally, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you just get the creases out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's like a nice. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Sometimes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - A lot of the time, unless you're wearing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a really expensive shirt </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or something that needs to be ironed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Most of the time for
like a natural t-shirt </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you get the creases out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> So that's why I've always hated actually </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> having to use the dryer. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, I get that, but there's also like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we use like these kind of drying sheets </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you throw into the washing
machine after it's done, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that creates less creases in the clothes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like a thing,
apparently, I didn't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Aki found on Amazon and I was like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - But pants are sort
of bullshit like this, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that sometimes works,
sometimes it doesn't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, true. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It sounds like yeah,
put this in your fridge </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it'll make it smell like oranges. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And then it like smells like oranges. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like my last washing machine supposedly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> had a dryer inside of it and
I span it for like three hours </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was like, oh cool, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just a little less
damp than was before. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Japan's the king at selling you shit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you think you need,
that you don't actually need </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it doesn't work. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just remember, so do
you guys have an issue </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> of like, your fucking trash </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really, really stinking in the summer. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like no, I remember
when I go to your house, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> your trash, for some reason,
always smells dreadful. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'd don't know why. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - My trash doesn't smell that bad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like, the burner balls sometimes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause like we don't cook often right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So sometimes it's just, we
have like a little trash there, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but especially in the summer, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sometimes it's just fucking
decomposes in the summer. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - How fucking long are you
leaving the this there for? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do you not throw it out every week? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Uh, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, there's your problem. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why are you not throwing
it out every week? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because it doesn't get full every week. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It doesn't matter,
you should throw it out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - How do you, as a couple,
not get it full every week. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I get it for every week on my own. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - You're burnables? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, every week. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I get ours full every week, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> We sometimes have to go through two bags, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we have to go through two
bags of burnables a week. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like I dunno, we finish our foods. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I finished my food too, what
are you trying to say Garnt? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Then how are you filling, what are you, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what is it filled with? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Sometimes Amazon comes in
the box, it's burnable stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - But that's cardboard? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, no, no, like
sometimes they give material, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that's not the polystyrene
and it's not bubble wrap. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like the shit that's burnable. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, and then if you for example, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> if you get Uber Eats, for example, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I get a lot of Uber Eats. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah like the boxes and stuff like that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the food scraps, that's all burnable. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel very excited. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - You wash the boxes? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Do you not wash the boxes? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Depends on the box,
what type of material. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I do not wash the box. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just throw it all in the burnables. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Wow, wow Joey! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Wait, so why does yours stink then? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, why is your stinking worse? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because I don't push
the box in the burnables. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The burnables is purely just food waste. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, that's why it stinks. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, of course! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Where are you putting
the other burnables? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, where are you putting the boxes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What other burnables are there? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - A lot of the food trays.
- Like food scraps. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And they'll say if you
have like certain materials, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> if it gets oily or if it
gets stuff on it, it's, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wait, wait, so when you order a pizza, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> do you wash the pizza box when it's done? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like, it goes on with the cardboard. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Your supposed to put
in the burnables dude. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yes, that's grease,
there's grease in it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No because most of the time, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if it comes in like a plastic
tray or plastic whatever, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you can just wash it and
then put it in the plastics. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Plastics yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But a lot of the food
trays aren't plastic. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They're cardboard like, paper. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - No?
- Like styrofoam stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Most of it is plastic. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Most of everything I get is plastic. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Most of the stuff I get is styrofoam. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So, what happens
right is, unfortunately, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> most of my burnables like
pretty much 90% of my burnables </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is pure food waste.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And that just, we don't
have a lot of food waste. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So it just ends up that a
lot of food just accumulates. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Not a lot of food, a little
bit of food accumulates there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and because it's in the summer, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it just decomposes so quickly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, that's all the more reason </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> to take it out every week,
even if it's not full. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I have a small bag that's
attached to the kitchen counter </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> because I go through so much tea </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and tea decomposes very fast.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's where all the tea
and all the small bits of food </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that I don't eat goes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So it's a tiny plastic bag </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that I can tie up and take out every week </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> if I want to, and it doesn't smell. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think it's not actually just the food </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just 'cause it's so
humid as well that just like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You should definitely get
the thing out of the house. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like the humidity
condenses inside the bag </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> so it ends up that you
have like the garbage water </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> at the bottom as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - You can throw out tiny bags,
you know, that's allowed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It doesn't have to be big bags of trash. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> You can throw out little. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You can throw out little bit
konbini bag levels of trash. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sometimes you just forget. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Again, that sounds
like a you problem, bro. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - This feels like consulting
people on their recycling. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, I mean, what I was going to say was, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> so obviously the trash ended
up smelling at least like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sometimes we throw it out
every week in the summer, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but it's sometimes still just smelled. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I really only get smelly
trash when I open the trash. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - In my case, if I open up the trash </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and it really stinks like
that decomposing smell, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I just double bag it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I close up the first bag, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and I get a second bag
and I wrap that up again. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then boom, there you
go, the smell's gone. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, because what we did was we, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there was this device from a Daiso, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I think it's Daiso, or like Amazon. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Already red flags. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - There was this device from Daiso. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Stink be gone. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That was basically like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you know that thing you put on the toilet </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to make it smell nice whenever you flush. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was like the equivalent of that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but you put it on the bottom
of the lid of the garbage can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and completely solved the issue. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Our bins smelled great, it smelled fresh. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Japan is the only country
on Earth that gives a shit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what the shit smells like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It smelled fresh and I was like, great, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> this is a fucking amazing device. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh my God, this has just saved me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this has made my kitchen
actually pleasant to be in. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Until about a month in, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when we needed to take out the trash. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And we noticed that there
were a lot of flies. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I don't know how the flies,
where the flies came from. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You never know where
the flies come from. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I didn't know where the flies came from. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, yeah you had a lot
of flies, I remember this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I was like, where are
these flies coming from? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And why are they gathering
all around the bin? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause this never happened before, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so Sydney opens the
lid, and there's like a few, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we could see literally like
a few fly eggs on the lid, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on the lid cover. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, what the
fuck, how did this get here? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then, and then I had to
wash it, right, obviously. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause Sydney was scared
of it, so I had to wash it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I was like, okay, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I gotta take off the nice smelling thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Take it off and, okay
it's like a rectangle, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like a rectangle patch, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I took off the rectangle patch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and the entire patch was filled with eggs. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I had like an entire patch of fly eggs </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that were just covered
because of this one patch. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So this nice-smelling
patch had just attracted </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all the fucking flies in the vicinity. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I have no idea! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I have no fucking idea. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Damn, you gotta do
something about that shit bro. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I had to quarantine the place, my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Like the thing, the thing was like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I would throw the
trashcan out, just gone. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The thing was like fucking Chernobyl. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like I have to like
quarantine the entire kitchen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Hazmat on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - That is so disgusting. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Dude, I dunno what it is, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it doesn't matter if you have like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the cleanest kitchen in the world. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know where the fuck
these flies are coming from, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they're just like, it's like
the kitchen is a respawn point </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for some of these fucking flies. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like they just appear out of thin air. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, I am here
now, time to terrorize. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, this is like, you know
in like a Junji Ito Manga, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> where you turn the panel and
you see like the monster? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> That was there when I shredded off </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that fucking patch.
- Ah, I feel shit, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> shut the fuck up, stop, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you're gonna make me throw up please. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like a page-turn jump scare. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, ah! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - To talk about something
more pleasant, though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Going back to laundry.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like I remember when I moved out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Opened up my laundry
and there was flies? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I remember moving out of my mom's place, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was just like laundry. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> All you need to put is a
bit of detergent there, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and laundry is done. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> My God, I didn't know how
fucking OP fabric softener was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> until I started doing my laundry. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like not many people talk about it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but my God, fabric softener is one of the, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is a life hack that actually works. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I literally do like the two
shots of vodka meme with my. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Two shots of fabric softener. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Honestly, I go through
detergent so slowly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like one cup of Vodka. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's like the whole
fucking jug I put in. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I know it's bad for your clothes, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but I don't give a shit, it's so comfy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I put a tiny amount in and it works. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause I feel like with clothes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and especially with your bed covers, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know how people sleep </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> without not putting fabric
softener on their bed covers </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and bed sheets and stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, sure, I wanna be in
that maximum comfort man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Damn.
- I wanna be embraced. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Embraced. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I wanna be embraced. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like a light hug from your mom. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - You don't wanna sleep naked. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - You don't wanna sleep naked. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I want my nut sack to
feel the fabric softener. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I want my nut sacks to be embraced. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I want them to be cradled by my sheets. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Bathed in the God's liquid
known as fabric softener. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I can't wait. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It's gonna be weird though,
It's gonna be weird coming back. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Are you guys excited? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Not excited for all the
quarantining we have to do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh shit, I mean, it's been what, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a full almost two years now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> since you guys were in the UK last? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I haven't seen anyone. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's weird. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's weird, I've never gone two years </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> without seeing my family. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, it is a massive pain in
the ass to travel right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, just seeing all the paperwork </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you guys have to do to get through. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Ah, fuck man, Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like getting gout the country </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> seems pretty simple and easy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's getting back in the country that is, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that sounds we're gonna
save our experiences </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for when we actually come back. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> From third hand experiences, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it actually sounds like a prison camp. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I'm not joking. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Like my mate who went out, went back in, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the experience he told me,
it's not like a prison camp, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but then he sent me an article </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of some of the Olympic athletes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that had to come in the
country and had to quarantine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And they literally also
said that prison camps </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> will probably, they would
probably would probably </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> be better treated in prison camps </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> than they were in like
the quarantine hotels </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that they were in.
- Yikes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, I'm gonna read a lot of manga. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, just stock up
on all the manga man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, dude, you can finally
catch up with "One Piece". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] While you're in quarantine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just read "One Piece", man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Hope I don't gain too much weight. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause God knows, I'm
just gonna eat and drink </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all the time when I'm back. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - You should like weigh yourself before </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> just as an experiment. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't wanna know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't wanna know.
- You should. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I wanna know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fuck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's gonna be like Christmas
holidays all over again. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Christmas holidays. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know like, do you guys gain weight </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> during the Christmas holidays? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Of course, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I gain weight generally. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I breathe near McDonald's
and I gain weight. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, but hopefully you
guys make it back all right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, I'm sure it'll be all right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Hope so. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I hope so. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The first thing I'm gonna
do is go to a fucking Nando's. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm not even joking. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like before I hug my
mum, before I say hello, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> before I see the family,
get myself to a Nando's. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like, mom, hold
on, hold on for a second. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm gonna go to Greg's and
get a vegan sausage roll. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Vegan.
- Vegan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - And a Tesco meal
deal, perhaps two maybe. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, wow, spoiling yourself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because I can. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause I'm an adult. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Don't want a normal portion size? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> No, don't think I will. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think I'll get whatever the fuck I want. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then I'll cry because
I'll cry when I've realized </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that there's no good food
options where I live. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think I'm gonna miss Japan a lot more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> than I think I will. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think so. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like you guys, yeah, I
reckon you guys will obviously </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, have that like great
rush of, yeah, I'm back home, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm seeing my family, I'm seeing my mates. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But then you'll realize, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> man, there's just so much shit to do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in Japan I can't do here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I am looking forward </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> to ordering a coffee in
English, that's very exciting. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Very exciting times. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I am like looking forward
to going to a Tesco's, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> which is our konbinis and
also doing that in English </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and having the clerk respond to me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Having an English conversation
with another person. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like being asked if I want a
plastic bag and not a fukuro. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> That'd be nice. That'd be nice. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, they'd be like, do
you want a bag with that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (speaks in Japanese) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Ah sorry, sorry fuck, nah, I'm good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - (speaks in Japanese) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I gotta realize I haven't
paid with my card in so long. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> In the UK you just tap it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So I'm excited for that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah, that's a thing! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You just tap.
- Tap and go. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, I actually can't
do that straight away </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because all my cards have expired. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> All my UK cards have expired, so yeah, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm lucky to have a bit of UK cash on me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I've only got my
Japanese card on me right now, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's not either Visa or MasterCard, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is the two companies
that everyone else uses. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like JCB or something like that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> which I've only ever heard in Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, that's only in Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I don't think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> anywhere else except it.
- Japan Credit Bureau. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is it? I thought it
was Japan Central Bank? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I thought it was Japan credit Bureau. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know, it's Japan something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so it doesn't work outside Japan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's all nonsense. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's all nonsense. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Well, hopefully, I mean,
luckily I guess the good thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is that, yeah, since it will be six weeks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> we're gonna have a lot to
talk about next episode. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah!
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Hopefully, you'll know if
things have gone smoothly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> if Trash Taste is uninterrupted. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - If one of us get stuck or for
some reason RIP Trash taste. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - How's it gonna feel for you Joey? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Not being in, not having
Trash Taste record every week? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, September is just gonna be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a very slow months for me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It's gonna be weird waking
up on a Tuesday morning </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> being like, wait, I don't
have to go to the office. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's not a work day today, what the fuck? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, but I think for me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I'm not gonna go back to Australia </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I don't wanna go
through that whole process, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I'm gonna go see my family in Japan, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who I haven't seen in two years. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So that's gonna be nice to
finally catch up with them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause they're all a vaccine now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Fuck yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So, yeah, it's gonna be nice to just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> live how I used to live three years ago </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when everything was a lot more simple. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm waiting for the day until </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> they actually let tourists in here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh dude. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I think that's
why I wanna go back now, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I'm like I don't see
it happening any time soon. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If I go now, I'm fine if
it takes another two years. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah definitely. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You think it's gonna take two years? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, but if it does, it does. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It could. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know how long it's gonna take. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, but uh, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But anyway, I guess
we'll wrap it up there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - We'll wrap it up here. </SPEAKER_00>
