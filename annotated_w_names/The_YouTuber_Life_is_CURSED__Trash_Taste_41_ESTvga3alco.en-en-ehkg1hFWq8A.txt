<garnt> - The thing about this
like frail Asian kid </garnt>
<garnt> wearing a beanie walking around. </garnt>
<garnt> You look like a fucking cancer patient. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> So I was like, "I'm tired of this, </garnt>
<garnt> I wanna change my style." </garnt>
<joey> - Right?
- Lemme get there, right? </joey>
<garnt> So I went for the skinhead look, </garnt>
<joey> (chuckle) </joey>
<garnt> I looked like a complete... </garnt>
<garnt> (laughs and claps) </garnt>
<joey> I look like I just came
out of prison, right? </joey>
<garnt> (bright upbeat music) </garnt>
<garnt> Hello and welcome to another episode </garnt>
<garnt> of the Trash Taste podcast. </garnt>
<garnt> I am your host for today, Garnt </garnt>
<joey> that is a real name I can assure you. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> And I'm joined today, </joey>
<joey> with my cohost Connor and Joey. </joey>
<joey> - The ones with the real names
- Real actual names. </joey>
<joey> - The actual real names. </joey>
<joey> - The actual real names. </joey>
<garnt> - Me, the wisest man on earth. </garnt>
<garnt> ( Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - So by the time this comes out, </garnt>
<garnt> this would have been very old by now </garnt>
<garnt> but we haven't really got a chance </garnt>
<joey> to have, had a real debrief
on our cycling special. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Because we filmed an outro </joey>
<connor> and that turned out to be 26
minutes or something like that. </connor>
<connor> And we were just like, </connor>
<connor> people gone
- originally. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. Originally people, we were like </connor>
<garnt> people don't wanna hear us
talk about a special day </garnt>
<garnt> they've just seen.
- Yeah, by the way, </garnt>
<garnt> If you haven't watched
the cycling special, </garnt>
<garnt> - Yes. </garnt>
<garnt> - You should go and do that before </garnt>
<garnt> we're gonna talk. </garnt>
<garnt> we talking about that video.
- Yes. </garnt>
<connor> - So if you wanna watch
that link down below or top </connor>
<garnt> - On screen now. </garnt>
<garnt> But I think the biggest thing, </garnt>
<connor> I mean obviously the reaction for that </connor>
<connor> has been absolutely, </connor>
<connor> - I'd say awesome.
- Awesome. </connor>
<connor> But what I found funny was, </connor>
<connor> how seriously people took
when it came to discussing </connor>
<garnt> who won and who lost and who cheated. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - In that cycling special. </garnt>
<joey> - There was, I've never
seen like our subreddit turn </joey>
<joey> into like just the most like, "No you" </joey>
<garnt> - Top of like thread
- It was a fucking </garnt>
<garnt> free for all for a good
period of time there. </garnt>
<garnt> (Connor laughs) </garnt>
<joey> - It was like fucking team Garnt </joey>
<garnt> and Joey versus team Connor
battle is this like-- </garnt>
<garnt> - Is this how the twilight
fans I'm wearing the prime? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah I mean I get it you
know, they they're invested </joey>
<connor> - They invested
- I appreciate it, you know </connor>
<garnt> - Which is a good sign,
which is a good sign. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah but I mean okay, </garnt>
<garnt> I think I'm very like,
I'm very fake salty, </garnt>
<garnt> like I'm always like, fake angry. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think we are all fake
salty and fake angry. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - But like in real life as well </garnt>
<garnt> I'll get like, </garnt>
<connor> I'll start like getting like, </connor>
<connor> I'll sound like loud I'm
like, "Yo this is fucked up" </connor>
<connor> and then I'll be like,
"oh you really count </connor>
<connor> like no, no, not really. </connor>
<connor> ( Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> Am just like ,I just like
getting annoyed about things </connor>
<connor> in a way that isn't like,
- Right. </connor>
<connor> - Twittering.
- That's very British of you. </connor>
<connor> (joey and Connor laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah yeah yeah British, very British. </connor>
<connor> Am so like I can't believe this! </connor>
<connor> Oh my God really like, no. </connor>
<joey> I don't wanna do this shit
- Like no. </joey>
<joey> - I mean like , you know, the cheating. </joey>
<joey> I was like at the moment, </joey>
<connor> I'm sure when I found out
you cheated I was like, </connor>
<connor> "motherfuckers." </connor>
<connor> and then I probably just
thought through like </connor>
<connor> alright well. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But then obviously, </connor>
<connor> 'cause there's also clips
said like me talking </connor>
<connor> about it on my live stream, </connor>
<joey> but obviously like I play up the saltiness </joey>
<joey> cause I it's good to
showmanship, you know. </joey>
<joey> It is. Its fun. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. But it's unfortunate that like </connor>
<joey> a large majority in the internet
doesn't understand sarcasm. </joey>
<connor> - Dude that was so I, there was like </connor>
<connor> an all subreddit people discussing. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Who cheated, who really
won, who is the real winners? </connor>
<joey> - Who done it? </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - And I there's just one comment, </joey>
<joey> I can't remember what it was called </joey>
<joey> but they were like big man Connor Cahoot </joey>
<connor> thinks he's a real winner, real chad huh. </connor>
<connor> Connor's friends,
cheaters when he cheated, </connor>
<connor> and he was getting so angry about it </connor>
<connor> and I was like what the fuck? </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> - And it was so funny seeing how like, </joey>
<joey> the fact that there were so many people </joey>
<joey> who are infinitely more
saltier then we are like, </joey>
<joey> we didn't give a shit like </joey>
<connor> - What its like now it's like to us, </connor>
<connor> it's we make the video, we film it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - If someone cheats you know, </connor>
<garnt> and it makes for good content </garnt>
<garnt> then its make for good content. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<garnt> - I mean originally I remember
going on a cycling special </garnt>
<garnt> I think I, this got cut out the video </garnt>
<connor> but I remember telling Connor. </connor>
<connor> Yeah I'm gonna do the whole thing because </connor>
<connor> (chuckles) </connor>
<connor> you know I, </connor>
<connor> - Its pretty wild time. </connor>
<connor> - Even if I don't, </connor>
<connor> when I'll feel good if
I do the whole thing. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And then so the fourth
challenge happened </connor>
<connor> and then Joey suggested the cheating </connor>
<joey> and I just thought to myself </joey>
<joey> that would make for a
really funny segment, </joey>
<joey> if we can actually cheat.
- That's exactly what it was </joey>
<garnt> it's like yeah sure, you know </garnt>
<connor> saying that "oh I wanted to
take a fucking free car ride" </connor>
<connor> like you know, </connor>
<connor> - I'd be lying if I
say I didn't want that. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But ultimately </connor>
<connor> I was like, no, no, no let's do this </connor>
<joey> because it will make for
great content and it did. </joey>
<connor> - It's not about the race
it was about the friendship. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - It was about the friends
we lost along the way </garnt>
<garnt> (chuckles) </garnt>
<garnt> which is apparently each other. </garnt>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - True true. </joey>
<garnt> - No, because like I feel like, you know </garnt>
<garnt> there's a difference between </garnt>
<garnt> obviously none of it was scripted, </garnt>
<garnt> which we don't script what
happens on the specials, </garnt>
<garnt> but we all still, you know, we all </garnt>
<garnt> we do still have that voice
in the back of our head </garnt>
<garnt> that says this is going to be content. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - People are gonna watch
this for entertainment and-- </garnt>
<joey> - Cause let's be real like, </joey>
<joey> you know there was a
part of me that was like, </joey>
<joey> you know, I'm sure
there will be some level </joey>
<joey> of entertainment factor if
hypothetically all three of us </joey>
<joey> with no excellence whatsoever... </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - Completed everything
from start to finish. </joey>
<joey> But, you know, it's the little
bits of unexpected drama </joey>
<joey> that makes for an interesting-- </joey>
<garnt> - Its the drama, its the banter, </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like that's what makes
for the interesting video. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - And I feel like part of this discussion. </garnt>
<joey> It's like we laugh at it </joey>
<joey> because we know we
didn't take it seriously </joey>
<joey> but I'm glad people were that
invested in our contents. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah man. </joey>
<joey> - To really go balls deep </joey>
<joey> to really like break down
the levels of cheating. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And like okay I had like I swear </joey>
<joey> some people could make a spreadsheet </joey>
<joey> of like every little thing that we do. </joey>
<garnt> - Such that--
- No its like thesis papers. </garnt>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - It's like the dream cheating thing. </joey>
<joey> (laughing)
- Yeah yeah. </joey>
<joey> - People gonna start
hiring like astrophysicists </joey>
<connor> who cheated technically
I though I got that. </connor>
<connor> - It was a one in seven trillion chance </connor>
<joey> that Garnts chain would
break at that very moment. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - There was one call and I was like </connor>
<connor> why didn't Garnt just
put the chain back on? </connor>
<connor> I did think that, was like did Garnt, </connor>
<connor> why didn't Garnt just
put the chain back on? </connor>
<garnt> - Actually this wasn't,
there's a lot of my, </garnt>
<garnt> you know, trying to fix
the chain did get caught up </garnt>
<joey> but it was like completely
lodged in there. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So like, the reason you
were waiting so long for us </joey>
<joey> was because I was like trying
to unlodge this fucking chain. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And then like I got it back on </joey>
<joey> and then it came off again immediately </joey>
<joey> and I was trying to figure out </joey>
<joey> what the fuck was wrong with my bike. </joey>
<joey> So I had this like half
an hour to 45 minutes, </joey>
<joey> where I realized that I
had gone the entire cycle </joey>
<joey> without first gear. </joey>
<joey> So the reason that the
reason the chain came off </joey>
<joey> was because when I went
to the highest gear. </joey>
<joey> - It just slipped off. </joey>
<joey> - It just slipped off. </joey>
<connor> And... </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, these bikes were very cheap. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah and like I realized why
I was suffering so much now </connor>
<joey> on the fucking hills was because., </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - You were in second gear. </joey>
<joey> - You were in second gear the entire way. </joey>
<garnt> - I was in second gear the entire way. </garnt>
<joey> - I also love though how like
there was so many comments </joey>
<joey> even on the video being like, </joey>
<joey> "oh man this seats are too
low, the bikes are too small." </joey>
<joey> It's like look, that was the
biggest bikes they had there. </joey>
<garnt> - Those were the biggest bikes </garnt>
<joey> and I think I did adjust my seats </joey>
<joey> to be the highest it could be.
- To the highest. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Because these people are
designed for Japanese people </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Because we didn't buy the bikes </joey>
<connor> there were the rental bikes </connor>
<connor> from the locaL bikes place there </connor>
<garnt> - We had to fly it to the
other side of the country. </garnt>
<connor> - And so we couldn't bring bikes with us </connor>
<joey> - These bikes were definitely not suited </joey>
<connor> for six foot foreigners that's for sure. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Speak for yourself Joey. </connor>
<connor> Five foot gang over here. </connor>
<joey> - But even for your size it was small. </joey>
<connor> - It was just maybe okay for me. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But I'm really pushing it. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah yeah yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Like it was... </connor>
<connor> - Yeah 'cause I remember I put my seat </connor>
<connor> all the way to the top I was like. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Oh no this is the highest
it goes I'm gonna fucking die. </joey>
<connor> - Okay we're pretty fucking dumb, right? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - We're not that dumb. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But I saw comments that were also like, </joey>
<connor> "did they ever use any gears?" </connor>
<connor> I'm like bro you know, you would know </connor>
<connor> if we didn't change gear. </connor>
<connor> Cause Garnt would not be
moving up any of these hills. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - You think Garnt could
pedal at six gear up a hill, </garnt>
<garnt> are you kidding me? </garnt>
<garnt> - I was already suffering
enough on second gear </garnt>
<garnt> let alone fucking sixth. </garnt>
<joey> - Like some people pretend
like it was the first time </joey>
<joey> we ever saw a bicycle
with gears like that day. </joey>
<joey> It's like, "what are these things?" </joey>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<joey> Lets just leave it alone. </joey>
<garnt> - I didn't realize until I
saw the footage actually, </garnt>
<joey> how much of a clown I looked with like, </joey>
<joey> this fucking mini bike. </joey>
<joey> - You do look like a fucking clown. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> You did look like a clown.
- With one massive legs, </garnt>
<connor> just like peddling along. </connor>
<joey> - You're basically like one
of those like the kid bikes, </joey>
<joey> they're like young and
they're like sitting. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> by the feet are going like over here, </connor>
<connor> like that's what you look like. </connor>
<connor> - You're like kneeing yourself
in the rib cage every time. </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - I was. </joey>
<connor> - Oh man </connor>
<connor> - Bad dude squalts every time. </connor>
<joey> - Oh man I'm glad people
enjoyed it but man, </joey>
<joey> just it's not that serious guys. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was just a little bit of fun. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean there was a lot of like fluff </garnt>
<connor> that got cut out, shout out to Mood On, </connor>
<connor> for editing that and going through. </connor>
<joey> Jesus! How much footage did we have? </joey>
<joey> - A hundred hours footage Joey. </joey>
<joey> - Like a hundred hours between us. </joey>
<joey> Cause it was like we had the six Go Pros. </joey>
<connor> - It was like one terabyte of footage. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - We had six Go Pro's,
four, so two Go Pros </connor>
<connor> between each of us </connor>
<connor> and then also the Handy cams and whatever. </connor>
<connor> - The drone.
- The GoPro in the camera. </connor>
<connor> The GoPro in the carrier as well which is, </connor>
<connor> that's why it took so long. </connor>
<connor> We filmed that in October, </connor>
<connor> that's why the production took so long. </connor>
<garnt> For our next special we
probably won't like scale up </garnt>
<garnt> until we have like a super super big idea </garnt>
<garnt> maybe try something a
bit smaller, you know. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - For our next project.
- I feel like at this rate </garnt>
<joey> it's just gonna get like bigger </joey>
<connor> and it's gonna turn into like
a mist a beast tale Dante. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - If we don't scale back a little bit... </joey>
<joey> - I mean cause we the ones
mainly arranging this as well </joey>
<joey> so we have to come up with
all the equipment we needed </joey>
<connor> to figure everything out, </connor>
<connor> and so like it's quite a
lot to do it for all of us. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, like I kind of realized this </garnt>
<garnt> when we were doing the thing </garnt>
<garnt> and then Connors tire popped, </garnt>
<garnt> and every comment was just
like, "wow, I can't believe they </garnt>
<garnt> didn't plan for like a spare
tire or something like that." </garnt>
<joey> And yeah in hindsight, it sounds
fucking stupid, doesn't it? </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> But you have to understand
that most of our planning </joey>
<joey> went into how the fuck are we
going to power six Go Pros. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - On our bicycle when we have one car </joey>
<joey> and none of us near each other. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah yeah yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So we were trying to figure out </joey>
<joey> the logistics of trying to get this films </joey>
<joey> and that's where... </joey>
<joey> - The last thing we're
expecting was a pop tire. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah these bikes were like extra heavy </connor>
<connor> cause we had like duct tape
the shit out of stuff to it </connor>
<connor> like that was like portable batteries. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Strapped to these bikes.
- Its like a brick </joey>
<connor> - Just to like keep the Go Pros on. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - And also Go Pros as such
the fickle things are amazing </joey>
<joey> when they work but the
moment like there's any heat </joey>
<connor> they just stop working. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- yeah. </garnt>
<connor> Because we realized this
during the drifting special. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Because people look at </connor>
<connor> this content and think, </connor>
<connor> that they don't see the
fucking effort and logistics </connor>
<garnt> that goes into this. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause I didn't think about this, </garnt>
<garnt> until I had to go out and film it. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah they just think, </joey>
<joey> "Oh just buy some cameras and
attach it and turn it on." </joey>
<garnt> - So with the drifting special </garnt>
<garnt> a lot of Connor's footage just got lost. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Cause like, </connor>
<connor> it's a shame. </connor>
<connor> Cause like, the one when I was
doing like the sick donuts. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like all of that footage
was lost 'cause the GoPro </joey>
<joey> just overheated in like five minutes. </joey>
<joey> - Its 900 degrees inside the car. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah because it's an oven in that thing </joey>
<connor> and mine turned off,
luckily yours guys work. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
- And mine kept dying </joey>
<joey> in the second half.
- Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah it's just sucked </connor>
<connor> cause like all you get
to see as an outside shot </connor>
<connor> it doesn't even look like I'm in the car </connor>
<joey> doing that fucking the thing </joey>
<joey> and you missed all like
me getting hype screaming. </joey>
<joey> - Spoiler it was a stunt dog. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Exactly, like that's what it looks like. </connor>
<connor> It could look like a
stunt dog I so said like </connor>
<connor> that's my drift, that's mine. </connor>
<garnt> - Like I recently watched
this horror movie with Sidney, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't remember the name it's
a Korean horror movie right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - But the premise of this horror movie, </garnt>
<garnt> is that there's this company who basically </garnt>
<garnt> does live stream content, right? </garnt>
<garnt> And so this company
hires a bunch of people </garnt>
<garnt> from the public to live
stream going into this like </garnt>
<joey> haunted asylum. </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> - And you know live streaming
there experiences there. </joey>
<joey> And, </joey>
<joey> (clears throat) </joey>
<joey> so I was watching this movie </joey>
<joey> and they had this like jank
set up with some Go Pros </joey>
<joey> that were apparently like live
streaming to this base camp </joey>
<joey> that was like a literal camp. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - That they had set up outside
this mental asylum Right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And when I was watching this, </joey>
<joey> I couldn't get invested in the movie </joey>
<joey> cause I felt like that guy doing like, </joey>
<joey> "YouTuber reacts to
YouTuber movies," Right? </joey>
<joey> And all I could see in
the back of my head was </joey>
<joey> they these Go Pros don't
even have any spare cameras, </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> fucking lie there they
were like live streaming </joey>
<joey> for five hours or something like that. </joey>
<joey> - Two out of 10 not realistic. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah yeah there's no
way that would work. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Also, how are they getting
signals in this mental asylum. </connor>
<joey> There's no way the stream
would be this clean, </joey>
<joey> while they were streaming, </joey>
<joey> quite inside of it.
- Inside 5G twitch backpacks. </joey>
<joey> - Exactly. </joey>
<joey> ( Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Where are they, they didn't even have </joey>
<joey> the fucking 5G Twitch backpacks. </joey>
<garnt> Like this is fake movie, two out of 10. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - Oh my God, </joey>
<joey> I mean I like to do something
like that but like just, </joey>
<joey> you know, the the fucking
effort it would take </joey>
<joey> to just try and organize the
technicalities behind that </joey>
<joey> just sounds like a
nightmare in and of itself. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean to me
twitch like IRL streamers, </garnt>
<garnt> they're just built different
I don't know like... </garnt>
<connor> - I don't have the duo man. </connor>
<connor> - I think you have to be
another level of like masochist. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I think to me it seems like </joey>
<joey> why would you wanna just
be embarrassed in public? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like constantly. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - But I don't mind doing it
for a video every now and then. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah but like having it constantly on, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause at least in a video
when you're out there filming, </garnt>
<connor> when you're out and about they're filming, </connor>
<connor> at least you can like edit it </connor>
<connor> so it's the most interesting things </connor>
<connor> that happened on the day. </connor>
<connor> But if it's an IRL stream,
you see everything. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And it's just especially when you're not </connor>
<connor> even in the safety of your own home either </connor>
<connor> you're out there in
public people can see you, </connor>
<connor> people can judge you. </connor>
<garnt> And to me that's just a level of like, </garnt>
<garnt> that's the dystopian future
that I don't want in my life </garnt>
<joey> I don't know. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Not to... </joey>
<garnt> - Oh go on. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh just saying like not to mention like </joey>
<joey> in Japan especially where
people already fucking </joey>
<joey> way too wary about filming and pumping. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> - So I don't know how you can just like </joey>
<joey> rock up to an Izakaya full of people </joey>
<joey> and just be like, yeah I'm just gonna put </joey>
<joey> this camera here and just
start talking about our dream. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah I don't know I
couldn't do that either </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know I haven't tried it. </garnt>
<garnt> but like I don't know how I would get </garnt>
<garnt> over that mental barrier, of just going </garnt>
<garnt> into around restaurants,
like having the phone </garnt>
<garnt> in front of me and just
talking to the phone. </garnt>
<garnt> - Am too British I can't do that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- The thought of going into </garnt>
<garnt> just a place and doing that is like, what! </garnt>
<connor> - Well just like on the street as well, </connor>
<joey> I don't get like J Vagus for instance, </joey>
<connor> can like just be walking on
the streets by themselves. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Just have a camera like this </connor>
<connor> and being like, alright guys </connor>
<connor> so we're gonna go to blah blah-blah-blah </connor>
<joey> and just have people staring
at you the entire time. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah I've done that and it looks like </connor>
<connor> a fucking hostage video, </connor>
<joey> I'm like fucking talking
down to the camera like-- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah like I would go like, </joey>
<connor> I would go like this.
- Yo what's going on people </connor>
<joey> - But some people just like yep, hello? </joey>
<connor> - Hello. </connor>
<joey> - The giant selfie stick out, </joey>
<joey> yo this is everyone in EK
Bokuto right now check it out. </joey>
<connor> Like, I don't know I
mean to me, it's like, </connor>
<connor> and I watch some of these IRL streams, </connor>
<connor> so I'm quite interested in it myself </connor>
<connor> and I think like oh maybe
I could do it sometime. </connor>
<connor> But then when I watch
it I'm like okay cool </connor>
<connor> they did like one cool thing in the day. </connor>
<joey> And the rest of it, like a lot of the time </joey>
<joey> they were just being like </joey>
<joey> sitting there asking that child like </joey>
<joey> what's you just want to do? </joey>
<joey> What's you just want to do? </joey>
<joey> what should we do guys? </joey>
<joey> And it's like alright. </joey>
<joey> And then everybody get what the appeal was </joey>
<joey> cause most of the time real
life is pretty fucking boring. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- It was kind </joey>
<joey> like traveling or waiting. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah exactly. </joey>
<connor> - I think though,
- What's the fun. </connor>
<connor> - In this day and age, </connor>
<connor> I feel it's a type of content </connor>
<joey> that is like really sold after all. </joey>
<connor> - Maybe right now I can understand that, </connor>
<joey> but before that I'm like </joey>
<connor> why would you wanna watch
someone just kind of like wait </connor>
<joey> and sit around all day </joey>
<connor> and maybe do something
interesting for one hour. </connor>
<joey> - Because its like you'll really there. </joey>
<connor> - I get it in COVID times though. </connor>
<garnt> - Isn't this some kind
of like black mirror as, </garnt>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> okay that we're getting oh no like. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't wanna have a day myself </garnt>
<connor> I'm gonna watch someone else have a day </connor>
<connor> and I'm gonna give them money. </connor>
<joey> - It's like, it's literally
that fucking meme image </joey>
<connor> of you know that kids sitting
in front of the poster </connor>
<joey> and being like every podcast they like. </joey>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Its like really what that is. </joey>
<joey> - The meme just keeps getting
posted on WhatsApp right. </joey>
<joey> - That's literally what that is. </joey>
<joey> - Cause like for me like I feel awkward, </joey>
<connor> if I have a hands-free
sets and I'm just in public </connor>
<connor> and I'm on the phone.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah yeah.
- Like sometimes, </connor>
<connor> I'd have a hands-free set </connor>
<joey> and I have the phone up to my face </joey>
<joey> to look like I'm talking on the phone. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah yeah. </joey>
<joey> I do exactly the same.
- As opposed , </joey>
<garnt> as opposed to just
talking to myself I dunno. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah cause the other day </joey>
<joey> I had to go by like some
like eyelashes for Rocky. </joey>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - So I went to like </connor>
<connor> the local local pharmacy. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah the local pharmacy and I was like </connor>
<connor> fuck I don't know which one she wants. </connor>
<connor> So, I tried to like take some pictures </connor>
<connor> and send it being like yeah
pick out which one it is. </connor>
<connor> And she just fucking calls me
and he's like, just show me. </connor>
<connor> (laughing)
- So I had to like, </connor>
<connor> flip the camera.
- Bitch show me. </connor>
<connor> - And I'm just doing this, </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> while talking on a hands-free set. </joey>
<joey> And these all women are looking at me like </joey>
<joey> what the fuck is this guy doing? </joey>
<connor> ( Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - They pretty understood
during the eyelashes. </connor>
<joey> - Just like filming eyelashes
and being like which one. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> - I don't know why I find
like only IRL content is </connor>
<connor> where it feels little
black mirrorly to me, </connor>
<connor> a little weird I don't know why. </connor>
<connor> Like no other type of content
- yeah. </connor>
<connor> makes me feel in that weird kind of, </connor>
<connor> this is like no other content </connor>
<connor> makes you feel like this is too far. </connor>
<connor> Like IRL, just something about it </connor>
<connor> sometimes I'm watching it I'm like. </connor>
<connor> Why is this weird?
- Well because I, </connor>
<connor> I feel that like, </connor>
<joey> If you stream in like say
a studio like this, right. </joey>
<joey> There's like a performative side to it. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - It's almost like a stage
or like a setup for all. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah like there is literal sets </joey>
<garnt> that's we perform in like this. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah
- Yeah yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - But sitting down for like three hours </joey>
<joey> at an Izakaya wall like
having a casual beer, </joey>
<joey> that's a little too realistic. </joey>
<joey> - Do you know is well like I saw </joey>
<connor> a lot of them like a lot
of them get like drunk </connor>
<joey> a lot of the time and that's
like the audience loves that. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah. </joey>
<joey> - They love it when they get drunk </joey>
<joey> 'cause they're like,
Oh they could fuck up, </joey>
<joey> they could say stuff like.
- Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So the audience
constantly eggs them into </joey>
<joey> drinking even more. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah people are drink and people are </joey>
<joey> like waiting for the
next like string fail. </joey>
<joey> - And this is, and I'm like fuck </joey>
<joey> that's a horrible relationship to have </joey>
<garnt> with your viewers. </garnt>
<connor> Where they just wanna see you
fucking, fuck everything up. </connor>
<garnt> - Its probably why like most.
- Yeah. I mean, </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like even though,
even though you're </garnt>
<garnt> it's an IRL stream, you
know, when we're streaming </garnt>
<garnt> we do have this performative side to us </garnt>
<connor> that we just talked about. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - That we feel like we wanna be, </connor>
<connor> well want something interesting to happen </connor>
<connor> or we at least want an interesting
conversation to happen. </connor>
<connor> So I feel like it's a very, I
dunno like unhealthy kind of </connor>
<garnt> like relationship to have with
your viewers at that point </garnt>
<garnt> because you have your best interests is </garnt>
<garnt> for something to happen. </garnt>
<garnt> So you are in this performative side </garnt>
<garnt> and I've talked to a few IRL
streamers who have done things </garnt>
<garnt> on their streams, which they
probably wouldn't have done </garnt>
<garnt> if you know, nobody is watching. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right. Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, you defiantly
like fake confidence. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. Yeah.
- In the stream watching you. </joey>
<connor> - Exactly.
- I mean, </connor>
<joey> isn't that way like the
whole generalization of like, </joey>
<connor> you know, fun bases of IRL
stream is being like supper... </connor>
<connor> - Pretty fucking toxic.
- Toxic yeah. </connor>
<connor> Like I know a couple of viral
streams in Japan as well. </connor>
<connor> And you know, they're all lovely people. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You know, off stream. </connor>
<joey> - But I think it's because of the fact </joey>
<joey> that they have this
really toxic and you know </joey>
<joey> quite aggressive type of audience </joey>
<joey> that loves to egg them on. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - To make them do stupid shit </joey>
<joey> or, you know, fail in some way </joey>
<joey> that they kind of get dragged into that. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And they, you know, hate to say it. </joey>
<joey> A lot of them on-stream turn
into a bit of an asshole. </joey>
<joey> But that's also because you
know, you have thousands </joey>
<joey> sometimes tens of thousands
of people being like, </joey>
<joey> "Yeah do this thing that makes
you look like an asshole" </joey>
<connor> for our entertainment.
- Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's kind of unfortunate, its like </joey>
<joey> you know, if you're being
an asshole, you know </joey>
<joey> that your audience is enjoying it </joey>
<connor> and the acting you want and you can, </connor>
<connor> you can almost get lost in the fact that, </connor>
<connor> "No, I don't think I'm being an asshole. </connor>
<joey> I think I being entertaining." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Right, right. I think so. </connor>
<joey> - But then, you know, </joey>
<joey> you see them when you talk
to one-on-one you realize </joey>
<garnt> Oh, they're actually quite normal. </garnt>
<garnt> - They nothing like, </garnt>
<garnt> they are on the screen.
- They nothing like this. </garnt>
<connor> They're really nice most of time. </connor>
<joey> - I don't know. Yeah,
maybe I'm overgeneralizing. </joey>
<joey> I don't know. </joey>
<connor> I haven't met many, but
the ones I have met a very </connor>
<connor> different how they act on strings. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> I mean, yeah. </joey>
<joey> I only really know like a
few who will like exactly </joey>
<garnt> the same, but I feel it's a rare breed. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. But, I feel, I
completely review with like </garnt>
<garnt> IRL stream content being the
black mirror kind of content </garnt>
<joey> as opposed to any other stream kind </joey>
<joey> of content in my opinion. </joey>
<joey> And I'm not sure why maybe
it's because it's you </joey>
<joey> it literally is like kind
of like a slice of life. </joey>
<joey> - [Conner] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Where it's, it feels a bit too intimate. </joey>
<joey> - I feel especially when
it's those IRL strings </joey>
<joey> where it's like it's not the
camera pointing at the person </joey>
<joey> but it's like shot in POV. </joey>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Like that shit especially is like, Whoa. </joey>
<connor> (Joey chuckles) </connor>
<joey> - It's weird. </joey>
<joey> It's just, it just makes you think like </joey>
<joey> where's he gonna go from here? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Like what's the next step? </connor>
<connor> Cause there's gonna be a next step. </connor>
<connor> And like, I'm just. </connor>
<garnt> - It's only going to one up itself. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> which is why I'm like, I
wonder where it's gonna go. </connor>
<joey> Like, it's just like,
it's really interesting. </joey>
<connor> - Streaming my wife's pregnancy. </connor>
<connor> - Kind of scary. </connor>
<garnt> - Obviously, I could see that happening. </garnt>
<joey> - You know what you mean? </joey>
<joey> - Streaming my child's birth. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<garnt> Streaming my child's conception. </garnt>
<garnt> - Dad reacts to childbirth. </garnt>
<connor> - It's like, there's fucking... </connor>
<joey> - Oh there it is. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughing loudly) </joey>
<connor> - There's families on YouTube
that have like more kids </connor>
<connor> cause more kids is more click bait, </connor>
<garnt> if I can say its click bait. </garnt>
<connor> - Its more content. </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> I just got reminded of that video. </connor>
<connor> You found the other day Connor about the </connor>
<connor> the What's up, what's
in your bum challenge. </connor>
<connor> (laughing loudly) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah actually, I follow
like Justin Wang on Twitter </connor>
<joey> I don't know if you follow Justin Wang? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - These man fucking... </connor>
<joey> - He loves retweeting
the most kush shit ever. </joey>
<connor> - This man fucking retweets
and posts the kush shit. </connor>
<connor> And I thought this has got to be a troll. </connor>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - But there's literally
a series on YouTube </connor>
<joey> with people being like, </joey>
<connor> "is that a dildo or a dick in my ass?" </connor>
<garnt> (Garnt and Joey laughing loudly) </garnt>
<garnt> on YouTube. </garnt>
<garnt> No joke. </garnt>
<garnt> This isn't a joke. </garnt>
<garnt> I know it's disgusting. </garnt>
<garnt> And like I watched it. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> this can't be right.
- I thought it was just meme. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> I though this is like,
- I thought it was a meme. </connor>
<connor> This is like no way this on YouTube. </connor>
<garnt> This was like the canned
Goku Pete AIDS meme. </garnt>
<connor> that we thought that. we
thought was just a Photoshop. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. And then you go
in and you have a look </connor>
<connor> and they're like literally
he's fucking doing it. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "this is on YouTube. </connor>
<connor> What the fuck? </connor>
<connor> What is this?" </connor>
<connor> And then they're just
like, he, "oh yeah, I think </connor>
<connor> that's your Dick." </connor>
<connor> ( Garnt and Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> And it's like, "What is happening? </connor>
<joey> What world are we in? </joey>
<connor> This is insane." </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> It's just like that moment
of disbelief where you just </garnt>
<garnt> you can't quite believe
that this is this kind </garnt>
<garnt> of content has just, we've
gotten to the point where </garnt>
<garnt> we can post something
like this on YouTube. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's just, it's not
even a meme like before. </garnt>
<connor> - We went to fucking like
equals three to this shit. </connor>
<connor> What the fuck happened? </connor>
<connor> What happened? </connor>
<connor> Who came up with the genre? </connor>
<connor> It's a genre. </connor>
<connor> More than one people is doing it. </connor>
<connor> - Is it an actual genre? </connor>
<connor> - More than one person
has done this challenge. </connor>
<joey> - It's like a dead ass just
like YouTube challenge. </joey>
<joey> Like pass It on. </joey>
<joey> Tag the next creator who's
gonna do on you once on </joey>
<connor> my bum challenge. </connor>
<connor> - And before someone was like,
" Oh dude, cause it was like, </connor>
<connor> Oh, people are gonna be like,
bro, cause you're saying, </connor>
<connor> cause it's like dudes doing it, no. </connor>
<connor> - If it was fucking women
and guys doing it too. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - [Garnt] No. </garnt>
<connor> - Its fucking weird.
- [Garnt] It doesn't matter. </connor>
<connor> - why is it on YouTube? </connor>
<connor> - I think what killed me was just, </connor>
<joey> how straight they were playing it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - There wasn't any irony. </joey>
<joey> No, there wasn't. </joey>
<joey> There was zero irony. </joey>
<joey> There was zero like sarcasm
and what they were doing </joey>
<connor> they were just like, "Oh
I think it's your Dick. </connor>
<garnt> But I don't, I can't trust
my bumps anymore." Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Listen, please don't watch this. </connor>
<connor> It is literally what I.. </connor>
<joey> - It is the most curse, one
of the most cursed videos. </joey>
<joey> - Its so fucking cursed. </joey>
<joey> - Another we went from like, you know, </joey>
<joey> reaching into a box to see
what it is to just like, </joey>
<connor> let's replace the box, </connor>
<connor> - Yeah remember fine
- but with the anus. </connor>
<joey> Remember when fine bros or TV shows like, </joey>
<connor> is it jelly or a spider? </connor>
<joey> (laughing loudly) </joey>
<joey> - Is it a Dick? </joey>
<joey> - Is it my dildo or my Dick? </joey>
<connor> I'll never tell. </connor>
<connor> - I can't wait for the next step. </connor>
<connor> Which is like, which operation
are we performing on you? </connor>
<connor> Is it a for vasectomy or a colonoscopy? </connor>
<connor> You tell me. </connor>
<connor> And he's like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, okay. I think I'm being like, </connor>
<connor> my penis is being surgically removed." </connor>
<connor> What is happening? </connor>
<connor> The fuck? </connor>
<connor> How, can YouTube crack down on dump shit? </connor>
<connor> And just leave this up. </connor>
<connor> This is insane. </connor>
<connor> I couldn't believe it. </connor>
<garnt> - Is it the mouth? </garnt>
<connor> - I was...
- Oh or a vagina, </connor>
<garnt> sponsored by Tenga. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - I was... </garnt>
<garnt> - Like where did we go from here? </garnt>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah like, </connor>
<connor> so you did the video where
you reviewed sex toys. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But we didn't actually like... </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, its not like you're
under the table, you're like, </connor>
<joey> "Oh, this is fantastic. </joey>
<joey> This is rather lubricas.
- Yeah, its not like, </joey>
<joey> I went up to Garnts like, is it a tango? </joey>
<joey> Or is it my mouth? </joey>
<joey> (laughing loudly) </joey>
<joey> I'll never tell. </joey>
<connor> - I feel like there's a clear line. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - In which shouldn't be crossed. </connor>
<garnt> - Honestly like when, so yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> For those of you who don't know, </garnt>
<joey> Joey did a video where we
review Sangha products. </joey>
<joey> - Great video, check it out. </joey>
<joey> - Great video, great video, great video. </joey>
<joey> I found it funny cause
Joey didn't really tell me </joey>
<joey> what we were doing until
the day of filming. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So in the back of my
mind, I was just like, </joey>
<joey> "Is Joey just gonna make me
like go behind a curtain." </joey>
<joey> And just like, fuck this shit. </joey>
<joey> Am like, what am I doing today? </joey>
<joey> I like how possible we got in this shit? </joey>
<joey> (indistinct chattering) </joey>
<joey> Cause Joey was just like, </joey>
<joey> yo, you want to go test out some tangles? </joey>
<joey> And I'm just like, yeah, sure. </joey>
<joey> In what capacity are we
testing them out Joey? </joey>
<joey> - Just boys hanging out. </joey>
<joey> - Just boys hanging out. </joey>
<garnt> Just another night with
the bros. You know. </garnt>
<joey> - Another cold one one with the boys. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Fucking jokes. </joey>
<joey> - That's a great video. </joey>
<garnt> - We didn't do that by the way. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, </joey>
<joey> - I just can't believe that
video got made, like that had to </joey>
<connor> be like filmed edited at
no point in the process. </connor>
<connor> People think is this too much? </connor>
<garnt> - No, the thing, it wasn't
just a one part series. </garnt>
<connor> - It was multiple. </connor>
<connor> - It's a multiple part series. </connor>
<garnt> And it obviously did really well </garnt>
<garnt> because everyone just can't believe. </garnt>
<connor> - Obviously it did pretty well </connor>
<connor> Cause who's not gonna
fucking click on that. </connor>
<connor> When you see that. </connor>
<connor> - It's actually... </connor>
<connor> Like it's so absurd </connor>

<joey> how are they getting away with this? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, how's the law beyond me? </joey>
<joey> - What is so, what is

<joey> - Please. </joey>
<joey> - Like what is, what is
some of the most curse </joey>
<joey> you have seen on YouTube? </joey>
<garnt> I'm actually curious now because I know, </garnt>
<garnt> - That's probably the, </garnt>
<connor> honestly the most courseily I've seen. </connor>
<connor> - It's pretty cursed. </connor>
<connor> - Its pretty fucking up there. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean that, that is
definitely up there. </garnt>
<garnt> But. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, if I told you like
classic, like coast content </joey>
<garnt> like... </garnt>

<joey> - No.
- No. </joey>
<joey> - You haven't seen that one? </joey>
<joey> - No, what's that? </joey>
<connor> - It's this video from like, </connor>
<connor> Oh, I don't even know when it's made </connor>
<connor> but it's basically these
like a bunch of dudes </connor>
<garnt> like you watch teenage
mutant Ninja turtles, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah. You know how they're
like obsessed with pizza. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - So it's basically
like a shit post on that </joey>
<joey> but it's basically this
like explaining it. </joey>
<joey> It's so weird, but it's basically just </joey>
<joey> like a bunch of dudes dressed
up in Ninja, turtle cosplay. </joey>
<joey> And then they like whip
out their like fake dicks </joey>
<joey> and like jerk off onto this like pizza. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - What? </garnt>
<garnt> - Have you not seen it? </garnt>
<garnt> - No. </garnt>
<garnt> - This is on... </garnt>
<garnt> - This is on YouTube? </garnt>
<joey> Fuck YouTube. </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> Well, I gotta know, are they Australian? </joey>
<joey> - No. </joey>
<garnt> - American? </garnt>
<garnt> - I've no idea. </garnt>
<garnt> No, the video was silent. </garnt>
<garnt> That's the most coolest thing about it. </garnt>
<garnt> - What? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - What? </connor>
<connor> - The entire video is silent
and it's easily the most. </connor>
<connor> I don't even remember where, </connor>
<joey> - Choose your own sound track. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I don't even remember
when I fucking saw it. </joey>
<joey> but like it was one of
those like, you know </joey>
<joey> fucking course content
that made his rounds. </joey>
<joey> Like, you know, it's like fun
spin and that kind of shit. </joey>
<connor> Right. But it was on YouTube instead </connor>
<joey> of its own dedicated website. </joey>
<connor> - feel like I already have intention </connor>
<joey> - Don't look it up by the way, </joey>
<joey> please don't look it up.
- Don't see it </joey>
<joey> as often as the way it used to be. </joey>
<joey> I don't know. </joey>
<joey> It used to be like kind of
a like bonding experience </joey>
<joey> and you'd watch cursed content. </joey>
<joey> But now it doesn't feel that much. </joey>
<joey> Now just things like, I feel </joey>
<connor> like everyone thinks you're fucking weird </connor>
<connor> if you watch that shit. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, it's, it's kind of true. </joey>
<joey> (laughing loudly) </joey>
<joey> That doesn't matter if you
do it on your own or do it </joey>
<joey> as a group. </joey>
<joey> It's still weird. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. I mean, it's it's, I mean, </joey>
<joey> I remember when YouTube went </joey>
<connor> through the point where
pretty much you can </connor>
<connor> you can say anything was a prank
and just like, and just get </connor>
<joey> away with it.
- Fuck the prank thing. </joey>
<joey> - Like just, just </joey>
<garnt> just physically assault
someone and call it a prank. </garnt>
<connor> - The fuck was his name? </connor>
<connor> No, Sam pepper. </connor>
<connor> - Oh God. </connor>
<joey> - Remember that guy?
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> What was it? </joey>
<connor> He used to be an IRR streamer. </connor>
<joey> He did a prank where he did like </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. He killed his best friend. Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Wait, what? </joey>
<joey> - Remember that? </joey>
<joey> Have you seen that one? </joey>
<joey> - So he did a prank </joey>
<joey> where he would kidnapped one
of his, two of his friends. </joey>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - And then he would pretend to kill one </connor>
<connor> of them in front of the other friend. </connor>
<connor> And it was a prank </connor>
<connor> - And I was like just a prank.
- Are you serious? </connor>
<connor> This is thing. </connor>
<connor> Yeah serious. </connor>
<garnt> - This is a huge deal. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah. Huge. </garnt>
<joey> People, people were honest also about it. </joey>
<garnt> - Apparently so, that's, </garnt>
<joey> - That's pretty fucked up. </joey>
<garnt> - And it's like, in the video, </garnt>
<garnt> like you just see this like, </garnt>
<joey> this dude like in a fucking
like bag over his head </joey>
<joey> just like getting fake shot. </joey>
<joey> Right. </joey>
<garnt> - What? </garnt>
<garnt> - And, and the guy, this
is a black mirror episode. </garnt>
<garnt> There's no way this is real. </garnt>
<garnt> - And the other friend is </garnt>
<garnt> like strapped to the chair,
breaking down, crying. </garnt>
<joey> And he's like just a prank bro. </joey>
<joey> - He just thought his
best friend got murdered. </joey>
<connor> So of course, naturally
your natural response </connor>
<connor> is to freak the fuck out. </connor>
<garnt> - Just mentally scared
my best friend for life. </garnt>
<garnt> Just the prank bro. </garnt>
<garnt> What? </garnt>
<joey> - Honestly, it was fucked. </joey>
<garnt> - Reminds me of that, </garnt>
<garnt> like the recent news
that broke where someone </garnt>
<garnt> actually got shot or
got murdered in America </garnt>
<garnt> or something because they were
filming like a prank video. </garnt>
<garnt> Right. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh that's right </connor>
<connor> - And they were like approach. </connor>
<garnt> I think they were like
fake mugging people. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. That was it. </connor>
<connor> - Really? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. There was, </connor>
<connor> I can't remember the
exact details of the story </connor>
<connor> but that was his kid or something </connor>
<garnt> who like was just pretending
to mug people or like yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - How do you pretend to mug someone? </garnt>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<garnt> - I just go up to the knife </garnt>
<connor> play the YouTube brought
to you through duh. </connor>
<connor> - Am taking, </connor>
<connor> - Make it louder on the speaker. </connor>
<connor> - I'm taking your money. </connor>
<joey> (laughing loudly) </joey>
<connor> - There's a guy on the back ground like... </connor>
<connor> - I mean you know, </connor>
<connor> I think that's unfortunately
more than one body in. </connor>
<connor> And now when it comes to YouTube pranks </connor>
<connor> gone wrong or whatever. </connor>
<joey> - Wait, wait. </joey>
<connor> So what happened to the
guy getting like pranked? </connor>
<joey> - Well he went up to some guy </joey>
<connor> and the guy fucking
pulled a gun and shot him </connor>
<connor> cause he was trying to mug him. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh my God. </garnt>
<connor> I mean really. </connor>
<connor> So I mean, it was self-defense. </connor>
<joey> I mean he's fucking right,
what's going to happen? </joey>
<connor> - I mean, it's just, to me,
it seems so you're literally </connor>
<connor> in America, everyone has a gun. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, it's not even just in America </garnt>
<joey> in any fucking country,
what can you expect? </joey>
<joey> - Any country you just
pull a fucking knife out, </joey>
<garnt> other than just getting beat the fuck out, </garnt>
<connor> I'd be like, oh forgive
me, am not doing it. </connor>

<garnt> - Speaking of our souls online </garnt>
<joey> and people acting like assholes online. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Going back to the cycling special. </joey>
<joey> So we've we've I mean, we've </joey>
<joey> it's funny how we've talked
about like online privacy. </joey>
<connor> So, so much on this podcast. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. We've we've talked about it a lot </connor>
<connor> and sometimes I feel like
we're beating a dead horse </connor>
<joey> because we're just like yeah. You know </joey>
<joey> we have a lot of crazy stories. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So it, it kind of surprises me </joey>
<joey> when there are still some people out there </joey>
<connor> despite how many times
we've talked about it. </connor>
<connor> Will do some, not pretty, not cool stuff. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. I mean, so if </connor>
<connor> if you haven't been following
my Twitter, so yeah. </connor>
<joey> Someone tried to leak some
monk photos that I had </joey>
<joey> which were private </joey>
<connor> on my mom's Facebook and
know, I mean, I, I said this </connor>
<connor> I said this on my Twitter
longer, but you know, I </connor>
<connor> I purposely didn't release
it because you know, it's </connor>
<connor> I'm fine people knowing that I was a monk </connor>
<connor> meaning that aspect just, you know </connor>
<connor> meaning the knowledge or whatever. </connor>
<connor> But I was just like, I
kept that part private </connor>
<connor> because you know, there are
like quite intimate photos. </connor>
<connor> It's like a religious ceremony. </connor>
<garnt> So I didn't, I didn't
want that part of my life. </garnt>
<garnt> - Cause when you were in
initially told the story. </garnt>
<garnt> I remember after it,
you're like, yeah, boys </garnt>
<connor> I don't wanna share a photo. </connor>
<joey> - I'm pretty sure he said it on the clip. </joey>
<connor> - Did you? </connor>
<connor> - Like I'm pretty sure on the clip. </connor>
<connor> We were like, I think
one of us said like, Oh </connor>
<joey> we'll put the pictures
and then go was like, no </joey>
<joey> I don't wanna put the pictures. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. I think I might've said that. </garnt>
<joey> - Maybe its been awhile.
- Its been a while. </joey>
<garnt> I remember it being like </garnt>
<garnt> you didn't wanna share the pictures. </garnt>
<connor> - Sure, I understand. </connor>
<connor> And it's, you know, it's become a meme. </connor>
<connor> I'm completely fine with, you know </connor>
<connor> being the monk has become
a meme, but yeah, someone </connor>
<connor> someone literally stalked
my mum's Facebook, which </connor>
<connor> you know, it's, there's, there's </connor>
<connor> there's a difference between, you know </connor>
<connor> if I fucked up and you know, I </connor>
<connor> there's some part of my
private life that, you know </connor>
<connor> I forgot to private, you know </connor>
<joey> send an move, but you
know, as a public figure </joey>
<connor> you can expect that people
are gonna try and dig </connor>
<joey> into your past something like that. </joey>
<joey> - Which is fact in and of itself. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> Yeah. I mean, it's we, you
know, we can talk about </joey>
<connor> that fact that we kind of slipped that </connor>
<connor> but you kind of do have to expect that </connor>
<connor> but it just felt dirty that
someone tried to stalk my family </connor>
<garnt> especially like my close family. </garnt>
<joey> - That's actually fucked. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. And like, these are
really old pictures as well. </garnt>
<garnt> So they would have had to go back years </garnt>
<joey> and years worth of like,
my mom's pictures died. </joey>
<joey> She had creepy to think
someone's just scrolling. </joey>
<joey> - How bored are they? </joey>
<joey> - I don't know. </joey>
<connor> And, and like, all this,
all this for a meme. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<garnt> It's like, I'm like all
this for like a single meme. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, the person knew that
they were being scummy as well. </garnt>
<connor> They even like self admitted
that they was like scummy. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. I know this is a scummy low. </joey>
<garnt> It's like, no, because I, I
feel like, you know, we, I mean </garnt>
<garnt> we literally talked about
this last week where, you know </garnt>
<garnt> the barrier of privacy between reality </garnt>
<joey> and what's entertainment is like slowly </joey>
<joey> slowly drifting apart
and slowly being erased. </joey>
<joey> And I don't know, it feels
weird, funny experiencing </joey>
<garnt> that for myself and
being in the crossfire. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. Sucks. </connor>
<connor> I mean, I had to like tell my parents. </connor>
<connor> I was like, you know </connor>
<connor> cause luckily my parents, you
know, they're mega boomers. </connor>
<connor> So they, they think </connor>
<connor> that Facebook is the play
you can always have, but yeah </connor>
<connor> so they never signed up to it. </connor>
<connor> But I still have to tell them like, listen </connor>
<connor> if anyone asks you questions about me </connor>
<connor> or like anything private about
me and try to get anything </connor>
<connor> just tell them like,
okay, don't answer it. </connor>
<connor> Just tell them to ask me. </connor>
<joey> Like, if, even if it's like you know, </joey>
<joey> Like someone claiming to
be like a government agency </joey>
<joey> which like, I think somebody,
I can't remember who </joey>
<connor> called them up. </connor>
<connor> And asked somehow got my
parents' number or something </connor>
<connor> and like tryna ask them
questions about me. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, don't,
don't answer anything. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. You know, if the police want me, </connor>
<connor> the police will find me. </connor>
<connor> - Right. I mean, it's not </connor>
<connor> like don't parents, don't
anyone who claims to </connor>
<connor> be anything don't fucking
tell them anything. </connor>
<connor> It's sad that you have to do that. </connor>
<connor> Right. I like the thought,
I think it's just really sad </connor>
<joey> that I would rather be harassed </joey>
<joey> like a hundred times personally </joey>
<joey> than my parents be harassed once. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I mean I just couldn't </joey>
<joey> - Cause they got nothing to do with it. </joey>
<joey> Why then ask them to get involved. </joey>
<joey> Right. </joey>
<joey> - It's hard enough raising
me as it was. Right. </joey>
<joey> Like the way I learnt. </joey>
<connor> - The little shit that you are. </connor>
<connor> - The fuck that I was. </connor>
<connor> I don't wanna have to give them extra work </connor>
<garnt> after they're trynna enjoy
retirement. You know? </garnt>
<garnt> So </garnt>
<garnt> - It it's, it's been kind of
funny seeing the transition </garnt>
<connor> between like my, my parents leaves </connor>
<connor> cause my parents were like
really technologically illiterate </connor>
<connor> and I've had to basically
teach them everything. </connor>
<connor> But it's been funny seeing
the transition between them </connor>
<connor> like not understanding social media at all </connor>
<connor> and just like not using it at all. </connor>
<connor> And then transitioning that
to like transitioning that </connor>
<connor> to most of my family now use Facebook. </connor>
<connor> But remember when Facebook was
just like a cool kids thing </connor>
<garnt> and like the parents,
parents didn't get it. </garnt>
<connor> - My parents still, they
still take it that way. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - They still think it that way. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. Cause it was really funny. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause I remember one day, cause
I, you know, I've, you know </garnt>
<garnt> we are all grown up on the internet </garnt>
<garnt> and especially I've been doing YouTube </garnt>
<garnt> and social media for like a long time. </garnt>
<garnt> But one day my mom phones
me up and this, this was </garnt>
<garnt> this was when I had stopped
using Facebook by this point. </garnt>
<joey> And I'd like, most of
my online life has gone </joey>
<joey> to Twitter because that's
my job and everything. </joey>
<joey> But my parents had just
started really getting </joey>
<joey> into Facebook and you know,
being, being that, being </joey>
<joey> that parents who, you know,
tag, tag you in everything </joey>
<joey> comment on people's photos,
you know, properly involved. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> And I remember she phones
me up one day and she goes, </joey>
<joey> "Garnt, someone left a mean comment, </joey>
<joey> on one of my photos. </joey>
<joey> What do I do?" </joey>
<joey> I'm just like, "what'd you mean mom? </joey>
<joey> What, what'd you mean? </joey>
<joey> What do you do?" </joey>
<joey> And she's like, "ah, I
don't know what to do. </joey>
<joey> It makes me feel sad. </joey>
<joey> I kind of want to reply." </joey>
<joey> And I'm just like, mom do not. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> Do not do this. </joey>
<connor> Do not reply right now. </connor>
<joey> Do not get involved at this. </joey>
<connor> - That's the one thing you should not do. </connor>
<joey> - It was just funny because, </joey>
<joey> because like years ago she's like, </joey>
<connor> she's like, you know, just, </connor>
<connor> just ignore all the mean comments online. </connor>
<connor> It just don't worry about it. </connor>
<connor> As you know, as the parents
do, because you know, as </connor>
<connor> as someone, as, as a
parent watching a kid does </connor>
<joey> the social media and do
YouTube, you just don't get it. </joey>
<joey> You see comments. </joey>
<joey> You're just like, these
comments don't mean anything. </joey>
<joey> Right. But it was funny seeing </joey>
<joey> seeing my parents who had
never been into social media go </joey>
<joey> through the same cycle
that we had to go out. </joey>
<joey> We had to go through being like, what </joey>
<garnt> what is a mean comment? </garnt>
<garnt> Why are people commenting
mean things on me? </garnt>
<garnt> This doesn't make sense. </garnt>
<garnt> You know what? </garnt>
<garnt> I'm gonna reply. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm gonna give the trolls
everything they want. </garnt>
<joey> - At least your mom wasn't like, </joey>
<joey> "do you know the number
to the cyber police? </joey>
<joey> (laughing loudly) </joey>
<joey> I need to report a crime." </joey>
<joey> (laughing loudly) </joey>
<joey> Like my mom's like, my
mom's really smart about it. </joey>
<joey> Like, cause she's been using </joey>
<joey> do you know about this
website called Mixi? </joey>
<joey> I don't think it's an annual brand anymore </joey>
<joey> but basically it's like,
it's really old web. </joey>
<joey> It's basically like the
old Japanese version </joey>
<joey> of like my space or like
Facebook and stuff like that. </joey>
<joey> I don't even think it's around anymore. </joey>
<joey> Basically. My mom's been like using that. </joey>
<joey> So like she's had a pretty
good understanding of like </joey>
<joey> you know, privacy can
be very easily leaked </joey>
<joey> on the internet if you not careful. </joey>
<joey> So like, my mom has openly
told me, she's like, yeah </joey>
<connor> I follow you on Twitter and Instagram </connor>
<joey> but you'll never know
which account is mine. </joey>
<connor> - Fuck that. </connor>
<connor> (laughing loudly) </connor>
<joey> That's some death note shit. </joey>
<joey> She's like, </joey>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Like she just uses like
a completely separate name </connor>
<connor> and like doesn't use any
photos and stuff like that. </connor>
<joey> And I'm like, I'm glad that,
you know, she understands that </joey>
<joey> you know, if she used
her real face a name , </joey>
<joey> that could lead to a
whole lot of problems. </joey>
<joey> Meanwhile, my dad is like, you know </joey>
<connor> fucking openly comments on
my videos and being like </connor>
<connor> - That's my son. </connor>
<connor> (laughing loudly) </connor>
<connor> That's my boy. </connor>
<connor> - No, I remember one time. </connor>
<connor> He's like, did you see the comment </connor>
<connor> on my latest on your latest video? </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, no, I get, </connor>
<connor> I get thousands of comments every day. </connor>
<connor> And he's like, Oh, okay. </connor>
<connor> I'll, I'll send you a screenshot. </connor>
<connor> (laughing loudly) </connor>
<connor> And it's like, and he's
like, "Oh you might've it </connor>
<connor> because I don't use my name on it." </connor>
<connor> But instead he didn't use his name on it. </connor>
<connor> Right. It's like a completely
different username. </connor>
<connor> But I knew immediately it was my dad </connor>
<joey> because the comment starts with, "Hey son" </joey>
<connor> (laughing loudly) </connor>
<joey> - That was pretty good. </joey>
<connor> (laughing loudly) </connor>
<joey> - "Hey son, I really liked this video. </joey>
<joey> The editing was done really well." </joey>
<joey> (laughing loudly) </joey>
<joey> He's like, "you'll never know it was me." </joey>
<connor> I was like, "Yeah. Yeah. Sure dad." </connor>
<connor> - That's so fucking wholesome. </connor>
<connor> That's so fucking wholesome. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah but the problem is that like, </joey>
<joey> when I was still using
Facebook back in the day, like, </joey>
<joey> you know, again </joey>
<connor> like my mom would use a
completely like separate name. </connor>
<connor> Right? </connor>
<connor> So like, you know, it
was fine or whatever. </connor>
<connor> But my dad would not
only use his real name </connor>
<joey> but would also comment on
every fucking thing I posted </joey>
<joey> always starting with, Hey son. </joey>
<joey> (laughing loudly) </joey>
<joey> - So like, </joey>
<connor> - Hey guys, Joey's dad here. </connor>
<connor> - And so like, I had to like </connor>
<garnt> and so like one day he came
in being like really upset </garnt>
<garnt> at me being like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Why'd you block me on Facebook son?" </garnt>
<connor> I'm like, </connor>
<joey> "cause you keep fucking, stop commenting. </joey>
<joey> Stop opening a comment with, Hey son." </joey>
<connor> (laughing loudly) </connor>
<connor> - Your dad sounds like such a fun guy. </connor>
<connor> - He's a great guy. </connor>
<connor> Don't get me wrong. </connor>
<connor> But like I had to, I had
to literally block him </connor>
<joey> on every social media. </joey>
<joey> Just because, he kept fucking doing that. </joey>
<connor> And now the only, </connor>
<connor> - The number one harasser. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> And now the only way I can get in contact </joey>
<joey> with my dad is, get this through email. </joey>
<joey> - Email. </joey>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> - You don't have like
a number or something? </connor>
<connor> - No. Okay I have his number, </connor>
<connor> but like, you know, obviously </connor>
<connor> because it's international,
costs a bit of money, right? </connor>
<connor> And so I was like, Hey dad, you
should start a line account. </connor>
<joey> Cause everyone in Japan has line. </joey>
<joey> Everyone in my family has line. </joey>
<joey> Right. It's like, if you guys don't know, </joey>
<joey> LINE is like, you know, Facebook messages. </joey>
<joey> It's just a messaging app
that we use in Japan a lot. </joey>
<joey> So I was like, you should start LINE. </joey>
<joey> And he's like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, I don't wanna start
another social media son." </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, "dad,
it's not a social media. </joey>
<joey> This is just a messaging app." </joey>
<joey> And he's like," all right. </joey>
<joey> All right, fine. I'll do it." </joey>
<joey> And so I added him and I messaged him </joey>
<joey> and I was like three
months later he came back </joey>
<joey> being like, " hey what's up son?" </joey>
<joey> So I was just like, I was like, all right </joey>
<connor> I guess I'm just sticking
to email now with my dad </connor>
<joey> if my dad ever needs anything </joey>
<garnt> I'll just be like, just email me. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's urgent. </garnt>
<garnt> I've got to email him right now. </garnt>
<joey> - Urgent. "Hey son." </joey>
<joey> (laughing loudly) </joey>
<garnt> - Now every one of your comments
on everyone of your views </garnt>
<garnt> is gonna sound like, "Hey son." </garnt>
<connor> - I mean, that's good. </connor>
<connor> - I love the Tenderloin. </connor>
<connor> - No. I guess that's good then. </connor>
<joey> Cause then now we'll truly
won't know which one my dad is. </joey>
<joey> (laughing lodl;y) </joey>
<garnt> The comments section is
all going to be my dad. </garnt>
<garnt> - He's going to have to try </garnt>
<garnt> and find something like
a new phrase to go with. </garnt>
<joey> - Hey boy, Hey boy. </joey>
<joey> I love you, dad. </joey>
<joey> I'm just joshing. </joey>
<joey> Well, were we talking
about internet privacy? </joey>
<garnt> - I guess internet privacy. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, I don't know,
like I've, I've never </garnt>
<garnt> I guess this is the
first wake up call for me </garnt>
<garnt> that I've had to really think
about my internet privacy. </garnt>
<garnt> It took me way too long
to make my Facebook, </garnt>
<garnt> my Facebook privates. </garnt>
<garnt> That was, that should
have been the first stage. </garnt>
<garnt> But, I think the problem with
internet like celebrities </garnt>
<joey> or whatever nowadays is </joey>
<garnt> that there's a difference
between say it's, </garnt>
<joey> you know, someone who's
signed to a big film </joey>
<joey> or someone gets picked up by music label </joey>
<joey> like old school celebrities
who there was this system </joey>
<joey> by which they got picked up </joey>
<joey> and they knew they were
going to be famous. </joey>
<joey> But the problem is
anyone can be famous now. </joey>
<joey> Anyone can have their
privacy leaks and you know </joey>
<joey> not really think about the
consequences of really going </joey>
<joey> through their entire past
and just making it private </joey>
<joey> or making it not public because
we were, we were teenagers. </joey>
<connor> We don't remember every
sites that we signed up to. </connor>
<connor> Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> Like, I dunno how many,
one of my like old forum </connor>
<connor> like old anime forum
profile pictures are still </connor>
<connor> like public or whatever, you know? </connor>
<connor> Cause I signed up to a lot </connor>
<connor> of sites back then
because I was a teenager. </connor>
<connor> But I it's, it's something
that you don't really think </connor>
<connor> about when you don't make
content on the internet </connor>
<connor> because you don't no one
really expects to be famous. </connor>
<connor> Well, no one really
expects to have an audience </connor>
<connor> or anything like that. </connor>
<garnt> - [Connor] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I feel like I, I do wonder </garnt>
<garnt> if like the newer generation
is gonna think about this when </garnt>
<garnt> whenever they do anything or </garnt>
<garnt> if we're just gonna
continue to be stupid kids. </garnt>
<garnt> That don't really think about anything. </garnt>
<joey> - I wouldn't like to, for
it to be the first option, </joey>
<garnt> if I'm being honest, just
cause like you know, again, </garnt>
<garnt> it's like, I think that
whole prenotion of like, </garnt>
<connor> yeah, you know, you, you should expect </connor>
<connor> your privacy to be, you
know, hacked and slashed. </connor>
<connor> - Because,
- people shouldn't be that </connor>
<connor> that weirds me out. </connor>
<joey> - It's like, what is it about
suddenly being, you know </joey>
<joey> quote unquote famous, you know </joey>
<joey> regardless of how you
view, you know, fame to be </joey>
<joey> where it's suddenly like,
Oh, well, you know, you </joey>
<joey> you have a presence on the internet </joey>
<joey> that you share openly
with a large audience. </joey>
<joey> So that means that you know,
you don't have a privacy. </joey>
<garnt> If it's on the internet,
it's not private anymore. </garnt>
<joey> - It's literally like the same argument as </joey>
<joey> like old school paparazzi. </joey>
<garnt> Have you ever seen any fucking interviews </garnt>
<garnt> with like any paparazzo photographer? </garnt>
<joey> It's the most, </joey>
<connor> - They're all assholes. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. It's the most like
you would see these people </connor>
<connor> openly being assholes and they're just, </connor>
<connor> they're proud of it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - They're fucking proud of it. </connor>
<connor> Like I think I remember the
last one I saw was I think, </connor>
<joey> Anthony's like sitting
down with a paparazzi . </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. I saw that one. </joey>
<joey> - Literally everyone he interviewed </joey>
<connor> was just the biggest classy asshole. </connor>
<connor> - yeah. Because, you know, </connor>
<connor> they do the whole bullsihit of like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, if I don't do it </connor>
<connor> someone else is gonna get it." </connor>
<joey> And it's like, how about
none of you fucking do it? </joey>
<joey> And then it sucks. </joey>
<joey> Cause like I think, </joey>
<joey> And I'm sending people
again who are watching this </joey>
<joey> are like super chill. </joey>
<joey> Don't think like that way. </joey>
<joey> All it takes that 1% just
to make your life hell. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like, and that's unfortunate. Right? </joey>
<joey> Cause you know, I don't, I
don't have any resentment </joey>
<joey> to mine, like audience
or anything like that. </joey>
<joey> It's super fucking nice. </joey>
<joey> - Exactly. </joey>
<connor> - Its just a shame that
some people are just like </connor>
<connor> I'm a fucking ruin this man's life. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's a shame that, you know </garnt>
<garnt> you have to change your
behavior for literally 1% </garnt>
<garnt> of the people watching you
and you know, that most </garnt>
<garnt> most of everyone that you interact </garnt>
<garnt> with is just going to be a
generally nice cool person. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - And then it just sucks that
there's that small percentage </garnt>
<garnt> that unfortunately it's
that small percentage </garnt>
<garnt> that ruins it for everyone. </garnt>
<joey> And it's I guess </joey>
<garnt> I guess that's just the
world in general, right? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. But you know, we'd be living </joey>
<joey> in a Utopia if everyone
was being honest in, </joey>
<joey> - Flying cars </joey>
<connor> - With lying cars by
now, that's not the case. </connor>
<joey> Some of us are still
walking on the ground. </joey>
<connor> So yeah. </connor>
<joey> - A bit sad. </joey>
<joey> - A bit sad. </joey>
<joey> - I was, I was watching this
video they're there and it was </joey>
<joey> like some blues clues,. </joey>
<joey> - Blue squats? </joey>
<joey> Trust me. </joey>
<joey> This is really okay. </joey>
<joey> Sorry. Did you watch Blue's
clues when you're growing up? </joey>
<joey> - Of course what's blues clues. </joey>
<connor> All right.
- What? </connor>
<connor> - So, blues clues is TV show </connor>
<connor> and it was basically this guy, </connor>
<connor> who was like talking to the camera, </connor>
<connor> kind of like Dora styling. </connor>
<connor> This is where it started
this kind of style. </connor>
<joey> And maybe he didn't know, but
I'm definitely popularized </joey>
<joey> - Yeah popularized. </joey>
<joey> - Where they would be like a, a task. </joey>
<connor> And there was this, you know, a notebook </connor>
<joey> and they'd have to do
extra amount of tasks. </joey>
<connor> It was a really good show actually. </connor>
<joey> - And there was a dog called Blue. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Okay. </connor>
<joey> - And so the dog would help Steve? </joey>
<joey> - Steve yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Steve find all the clues. </joey>
<joey> Right. </joey>
<joey> And yeah. </joey>
<joey> So I always wondered, I was
like, why did you stop doing it? </joey>
<connor> Cause if you, if you watch the show </connor>
<connor> he basically swaps
halfway through the show </connor>
<connor> with another actor. </connor>
<connor> I thought, "Oh, that's weird. </connor>
<connor> Why, why did that happen?" </connor>
<connor> So turns out that he was losing his hair </connor>
<connor> and that he didn't want to
like go bold on like TV. </connor>
<connor> Right. Right.
- Okay. </connor>
<connor> - So, and then I was like fuck! </connor>
<connor> That hit me. </connor>
<connor> I was like, oh my God, fuck! </connor>
<connor> Cause like, I mean okay, </connor>
<connor> there's like tons of comments about it. </connor>
<connor> And it's like, it's frustrating. </connor>
<connor> Cause like, I don't really give a anymore. </connor>
<connor> Like I've gotten over it. </connor>
<connor> But like, unfortunately
my dad did not give me </connor>
<connor> a lucky dice roll with my genetics </connor>
<connor> and I am going bald eventually. </connor>
<connor> It's gonna happen. </connor>
<connor> And obviously it's been
happening a little bit </connor>
<connor> and it's so frustrating
that people will like go </connor>
<joey> to other videos and be like Connor. </joey>
<joey> Yeah. "Did you know you're balding?" </joey>
<joey> and I'm like, </joey>
<joey> - Pointing it out </joey>
<joey> - And it's so frustrating. </joey>
<connor> Cause the thing that bothers
me is that like, again </connor>
<connor> like I fully accepted that it's happening. </connor>
<connor> I know people are gonna be
like, have you tried doing this? </connor>
<connor> Have you tried fucking doing voodoo? </connor>
<joey> And it's like, yes. </joey>
<joey> - Try doing voodoo. </joey>
<joey> - Cause people are always
like, Hey, just try it. </joey>
<garnt> - Cause people are always
like, Hey man, just </garnt>
<joey> take these drugs, do these things. </joey>
<connor> It's like, honestly like done
all that, tried all that. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Unfortunately, like I
can't do surgery either. </connor>
<connor> So whatever. </connor>
<connor> And so I just kind of got to
the point where I was like </connor>
<connor> all right, I think I've
tried enough things </connor>
<connor> where I'm like this fucking sucks. </connor>
<joey> Yeah. But can't really do much about it. </joey>
<joey> Right. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> And so I kind of got over it,
but it's really frustrating. </joey>
<joey> Like I said, when people go
to other videos and be like </joey>
<joey> bro, you're balding. </joey>
<joey> And it's like, yeah. </joey>
<joey> Like, like I I'm, I am
aware, but it's frustrating </joey>
<joey> that sometimes I have to
like edit videos differently. </joey>
<joey> Cause it's like, all right. </joey>
<joey> If I don't edit this part out, </joey>
<joey> people are gonna comment about this </joey>
<joey> instead of the fucking video. </joey>
<joey> - And only comment about that </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. Its like, I just
wanna focus on the video. </connor>
<garnt> And it's so frustrating that
feel the need to point it out. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause it's like why? </garnt>
<connor> Right. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. I mean, I, I
know exactly how you feel </connor>
<connor> because I too have not been
too luckiest with my gene pool. </connor>
<connor> So, like literally, </connor>
<connor> - Joey I envy you, perfect hair. </connor>
<connor> - So Joey, like pretty much
everyone on my dad's side, </connor>
<connor> who's a male. </connor>
<connor> - Same with same. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. It's kinda sucks. </connor>
<connor> - I Mean it's something </connor>
<connor> that I knew was always going to happen. </connor>
<connor> - We don't think its gonna happen. </connor>
<connor> - I mean like as, as like when you're </connor>
<joey> when you're a teenager,
you're just like, Oh </joey>
<connor> it's like, I'm, I'm, I'm the exception. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - Cause your hair like, </garnt>
<connor> when you're like 18, your hair's like, </connor>
<garnt> - Its lash. </garnt>
<connor> - Fuck man, my hair is so thick. </connor>
<garnt> - Thick as fuck and like
you think I'm the exception. </garnt>
<garnt> And I remember, you know, I've seen </garnt>
<connor> like my entire family on my dad's side. </connor>
<connor> Everyone's bold, so I asked my dad, </connor>
<connor> I've seen like pictures of
my dad when he was young </connor>
<connor> and he had hair down to here, man. </connor>
<joey> - He's bad. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. He was </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh he had drip. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - But yeah, I, yeah, he had
a, he had a lushest of hair </garnt>
<garnt> and I saw what it looks like now. </garnt>
<connor> And I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> 'so dad, when did you
start losing your hair?" </connor>
<connor> Just out of curiosity. </connor>
<joey> So just so I can take a look
and take a look at my own hair </joey>
<joey> and he goes, "I guess,
late 20, 30 year old." </joey>
<garnt> And I asked this when
I was 28, I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Fuck dad, why the hell you
did not tell me earlier, </garnt>
<garnt> for fuck sake." </garnt>
<connor> - This is like, I can't,
I had a, I had a feeling </connor>
<connor> It's probably gonna happen to me. </connor>
<joey> But like, I didn't like quite know. </joey>
<joey> But then I realized, okay </joey>
<joey> my older brother is like
10 years older than me. </joey>
<joey> He's going bald. </joey>
<joey> And I was like, Oh shit! </joey>
<joey> Am starting to sweat a little bit. </joey>
<connor> - See the prior example. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And I like, you know what? </connor>
<connor> I totally get why kids
think it's funny to like </connor>
<connor> mock hair lines because
you just think like </connor>
<connor> its never gonna happen to me. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. I've got hair. </connor>
<connor> My hair is fucking luscious right now. </connor>
<connor> That's never gonna happen. </connor>
<connor> But it does. </connor>
<connor> Oh yeah. </connor>
<connor> What is it like fucking two
out of three, especially </connor>
<connor> if you're whining. </connor>
<joey> I think two out of three
men get like some signs </joey>
<joey> of hair loss or what happened. </joey>
<joey> But I remember like I thought, okay, </joey>
<joey> if it happens to me at 30, no biggie </joey>
<joey> by then I'll probably be chilling out. </joey>
<connor> I'll be settling down when
I was like 21 or like 20 </connor>
<connor> I started to notice just a little bit </connor>
<joey> it's getting a little
bit thin and I'm like, </joey>
<joey> what's going on there huh? </joey>
<connor> Am gonna put time out to that. </connor>
<connor> - So, even when I was like 20, </connor>
<connor> I started like trying to
do things to like help it </connor>
<connor> and just, you know, doing
those, like, you know </connor>
<connor> taking it all the fucking FDA
approved, all that bullshit. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> But unfortunately </joey>
<joey> for some people it is
purely just genetics. </joey>
<connor> You just fucked. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. You just like some
people that helps and like </connor>
<connor> you know, you do a lot of
research, you look into it </connor>
<connor> some guys you might be
in a place where maybe </connor>
<joey> the building you're living
in is like really bad case </joey>
<joey> of like damp or something. </joey>
<joey> Its fucking with like your hair or stuff. </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<connor> - So some people who, you
know, their living condition </connor>
<connor> is the reason why they
are losing their hair. </connor>
<connor> But yeah, no, unfortunately as much </connor>
<connor> as I wished I could do something about it </connor>
<connor> it was just kinda like whatever. </connor>
<connor> And it's it's yeah. </connor>
<connor> I guess the, the main reason
why I just thought fuck it. </connor>
<connor> I'll just talk about it. </connor>
<connor> Cause it's like, I've
gotten to the point now </connor>
<garnt> where I just don't really give a anyway. </garnt>
<connor> - It's it's like, it's not gonna stop. </connor>
<joey> I feel like if we just say something </joey>
<joey> especially with the audience, right? </joey>
<garnt> Like it's going to come
into being like, Oh </garnt>
<connor> this is the inside meme, but okay. </connor>
<joey> I'll add onto it for the millionth time. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah Cause you know, </joey>
<joey> It's like unfortunately, </joey>
<joey> it's just kind of a
thing of like, you know. </joey>
<connor> It's just something that I
can't really do anything about. </connor>
<connor> And unfortunate people are gonna see it. </connor>
<connor> Cause I'm not like I'm not </connor>
<connor> unfortunately am not gonna, </connor>
<joey> - You're not gonna wear a hat every day. </joey>
<connor> - Just me statically
in front of the camera. </connor>
<connor> In my head. </connor>
<garnt> - You can't go anything further
than like a 90 degree angle. </garnt>
<connor> Otherwise that's a red zone. </connor>
<garnt> - It was like </garnt>
<joey> so when I dyed my hair
blonde, it wasn't that bad. </joey>
<joey> Cause my scalp is like white. </joey>
<connor> So it didn't look that bad. </connor>
<connor> But it's when it stops scale Brown </connor>
<connor> and certain lighting,
especially studio lighting </connor>
<connor> fucking reflects that shit
where it doesn't look too bad. </connor>
<connor> If you look at me like normally </connor>
<connor> in like video where the
lighting is washed out </connor>
<connor> it looks fucking awful. </connor>
<connor> And it's like, I see it on video. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, fuck! Its that bad? </connor>
<connor> I check it. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, Oh, it's not too bad. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. But I'm pretty
much at peace with it. </connor>
<connor> And I'll pretty shave it at some point. </connor>
<connor> Cause I kind of want to see how it looked. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. I reckon you good. </garnt>
<joey> You have you, have you lucked
out though in that regards? </joey>
<garnt> Because the one thing no, no, no. </garnt>
<garnt> Like the one thing is like,
you know, like the fact </garnt>
<garnt> that you've already accepted
that you're probably </garnt>
<garnt> gonna go bold and then you
probably get to go to whatever. </garnt>
<garnt> But the at least the
good thing is is that you </garnt>
<joey> can grow a beard. </joey>
<garnt> Yeah. There was nothing weirder </garnt>
<joey> than a dude who is bald
and has a clear face. </joey>
<connor> - Bro, why are you pointing
my boy, Johnny Shim, man. </connor>
<connor> Come on, man. </connor>
<connor> Let's go. </connor>
<joey> The biggest Dick in the unit. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, sure. </joey>
<connor> And you know, and that's
why he looked like, you know </connor>
<connor> I can't say that in front
of Johnny shims right. </connor>
<connor> Cause he probably smack
the dick across my face. </connor>
<joey> But like, you know, at
least like, you know </joey>
<joey> a beard on a bald guy </joey>
<connor> usually nine times out of
10, it looks fucking great. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. True, true. </connor>
<joey> Your card is fine. </joey>
<connor> - Dude. I appreciate you trying
to gas me up here Jay. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But like, it's weird
because like, you know, you </connor>
<connor> you said like, you know,
I'm jealous of you Joey </connor>
<connor> but like I actually had
the opposite because like, </connor>
<connor> - I have too much hair. </connor>
<garnt> - Too much hair, what a problem guys. </garnt>
<joey> (laughing loudly) </joey>
<joey> - No, hear, Cause like your
entire dad's side. Right? </joey>
<connor> - Like, I think my dad
was born like fucking 20. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. See, my mom's
side is exactly the same. </joey>
<connor> Cause my granddad went bald at like 24. </connor>
<connor> So for the longest time
in my like early twenties, </connor>
<joey> my mom and my sister would
just egg me on being like, </joey>
<garnt> when you gonna get that hair? </garnt>
<garnt> You better enjoy that hair </garnt>
<garnt> while you still have it on your head boy. </garnt>
<garnt> - All that hairline's receding a bit. </garnt>
<garnt> - I would like. </garnt>
<garnt> I remember when I was like 18 </garnt>
<garnt> I asked my granddad being like </garnt>
<connor> how old were you when
you like started to fall? </connor>
<connor> And he was like, Oh, like, like 23. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, I was like five years. </connor>
<connor> . But you know, obviously I </connor>
<connor> at that point I was like,
look, if I go to bald, fuck it. </connor>
<connor> I'll just accept it. </connor>
<connor> You know? </connor>
<joey> Like I rather just like
shave it all off, then </joey>
<joey> like leave it half-assed or
I, so I'm just like, fuck it. </joey>
<connor> - The more I thought about
it and the more cause I </connor>
<connor> I can't actually get any surgery, even </connor>
<connor> though I wanted to cause
like a blood condition </connor>
<connor> the more I thought
about, I was like, do I, </connor>
<connor> do I really want to
just fucking desperately </connor>
<connor> cling onto this? </connor>
<connor> Like at the end of the day, I was like </connor>
<connor> I don't really think I
give that much for a fuck </connor>
<joey> where I think I need my hair to function. </joey>
<joey> Like I think I'll still
be fine without it. </joey>
<joey> - That's the thing. </joey>
<joey> Right? It's like people </joey>
<joey> like, I don't understand
why people are so, </joey>
<joey> - Well people make it seem
like, if you lose your hair, </joey>
<joey> its gone because it's
like a bold person, right? </joey>
<garnt> I sleep. </garnt>
<garnt> So I'm a full hair, I sleep. </garnt>
<garnt> Balding free real estate for bullying. </garnt>
<garnt> - Come over. </garnt>
<garnt> - Come over its where its happening. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause people, I feel like
people just wanna have like </garnt>
<joey> at least some comments out there. </joey>
<joey> I feel like, then need to
have like a one-up on you. </joey>
<connor> They don't feel </connor>
<connor> like they can mock you in some way. </connor>
<connor> - But they keep mentioning it like, </connor>
<connor> if you lose your hair,
you're not funny anymore. </connor>
<connor> - Since when was making
fun of like certain </connor>
<connor> to do like genetics. </connor>
<connor> Its like a fucking slam
dunk to me, I was like, </connor>
<garnt> - It's like you know, you take
the piece out someone's look. </garnt>
<joey> No, no, no too far, balding </joey>
<joey> oh free real estate. </joey>
<joey> (laughing loudly) </joey>
<joey> Like he gets the same thing </joey>
<connor> When you taking a piece
someone was born with like </connor>
<connor> I do notice like as, you know </connor>
<connor> as someone who went through
the phase of, you know </connor>
<garnt> like just accepting that
they were balding, you know </garnt>
<garnt> you do go through that five stages. </garnt>
<connor> - First few, I think year
or two where it's happening. </connor>
<connor> You're like, no, I can,
I could reverse this. </connor>
<connor> I can, I can reverse this. </connor>
<joey> - The five stages of balding group. </joey>
<joey> I think you do, right? </joey>
<joey> - The five stages of acceptance. </joey>
<connor> First is like, what's
the word am looking for? </connor>
<connor> - Denial. </connor>
<connor> - Denial. </connor>
<joey> First you like no,no,no </joey>
<joey> - And I'm sure this conversation
where he hits quite close </joey>
<connor> to home to a lot of our
viewers because all audiences </connor>
<connor> mainly dudes. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. If it is happening to
you, don't give a fuck, man. </connor>
<garnt> Just whatever.
just whatever. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, you can do whatever you want. </garnt>
<garnt> - Its not like society
fucking rejects you. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because you are bald. </garnt>
<connor> - I, you know, I feel like,
you know, some people are </connor>
<connor> you know, I, I, for one, I
have been bald before and I, </connor>
<connor> I do, I do want it man. </connor>
<connor> But I do like my hair and
you know, I am putting </connor>
<connor> in steps to </connor>
<connor> you know, I, I don't
expect to this forever, but </connor>
<connor> I would like to elongate
it for as long as I can. </connor>
<connor> You know, I'm still, I'm,
self-aware enough to know that </connor>
<connor> you know, once it's
past the point it's gone </connor>
<connor> but at least right now,
when I still have this hair </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna be like, okay, you know </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna lose this
eventually, but I am gonna try </connor>
<connor> and do my best at this
point to just keep it. </connor>
<connor> And I don't think there's
anything particularly </connor>
<connor> wrong about it. </connor>
<connor> There's no, there's
nothing particularly wrong </connor>
<joey> with either direction that you go to. </joey>
<joey> I think it's more just, you
know, I, some, some people, I </joey>
<joey> you know, I like the
feeling of having hair. </joey>
<joey> I like the feeling. </joey>
<joey> I like the feeling of, you
know washing your hair. </joey>
<joey> And my God. </joey>
<joey> Especially fucking one
thing that nobody tells you </joey>
<joey> about being bald, right? </joey>
<joey> - It's getting old, right. </joey>
<joey> - It's fucking cold. </joey>
<joey> - Okay. You're either cold. </joey>
<garnt> Or if you're in a hot humid country </garnt>
<garnt> like Thailand, mosquitoes,
it's free real estate. </garnt>
<garnt> There's an extra surface
area for the mosquitoes. </garnt>
<garnt> Just go fucking mental. </garnt>
<garnt> - I do it just like a park. </garnt>
<joey> Its like, oh shit! </joey>
<joey> - I won't lie, I do you like the idea </joey>
<connor> of being able to optimize
my bathing experience, </connor>
<joey> which is like, </joey>
<joey> - Your bathing time is like cut by half. </joey>
<connor> - Am like, when you get out,
bro you're immediately dry. </connor>
<connor> That sounds amazing. </connor>
<connor> You know how, like in a hurry, I am. </connor>
<joey> - Single wipe. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - And also like ,do you use the, </connor>
<joey> I mean, shampoo is irrelevant, right? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah yeah. Shampoo is irrelevant. </connor>
<joey> - You save so much money. </joey>
<connor> - Dude what the fuck? </connor>
<connor> - You know I hate like
organic fucking shampoo </connor>
<joey> that isn't like full of
like sulfates assumptions. </joey>
<joey> Cap it. </joey>
<joey> I mean </joey>
<joey> Yeah. As well, I did have this thought. </joey>
<joey> I was like, you know what? </joey>
<joey> It's like, I don't know </joey>
<joey> if this is creepy or what to some people </joey>
<connor> but I think it's kind of cool that like, </connor>
<connor> my whole adult life is like
captured in like YouTube. </connor>
<connor> Like you can see like my
whole, like, there'll be like, </connor>
<garnt> - You can see the progress. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, like 19 year
old me that's like spots </joey>
<joey> and like fucking pepperoni face. </joey>
<joey> And then in like 10
years, you'll see me like, </joey>
<joey> - Its the glow. </joey>
<joey> - Actually, I think, I think
it's kind of like, I dunno. </joey>
<joey> I think it's kind of fascinating
that I can have like a, </joey>
<garnt> you know as cringy as it might be. </garnt>
<garnt> I can have like a backlog that I can </garnt>
<connor> - Cause what I, what I
find interesting right. </connor>
<connor> Is, you know, I don't know what
it was like for your parents </connor>
<connor> but my parents were like
pretty old right now. </connor>
<connor> So there's not too many photos </connor>
<garnt> of when they were younger
and like my age especially. </garnt>
<joey> So, you know, I'd see
photos here and there </joey>
<joey> and you're just like, </joey>
<joey> damn! That's what you
looks like, like, okay. </joey>
<joey> But for you, you know, when we have kids </joey>
<connor> we have like our entire
life just like documented </connor>
<connor> but that's, that's true
for most people, like, even </connor>
<connor> above like being YouTube
was you got Facebook photos </connor>
<joey> going back to like, my,
my kid will definitely </joey>
<joey> know my entire life up to like university. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, there are some uni
photos where I'm just like, </joey>
<connor> damn son or daughter. </connor>
<garnt> I don't know if I wanna go through this. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't know if it's
a good or bad thing. </connor>
<connor> I lost a lot of my photos
pre 18, like on Facebook. </connor>
<connor> I post most of them. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Because I hated how I looked in them. </connor>
<connor> So I was like fuck it. </connor>
<joey> I mean, no one likes having those. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, but, and I thought,
should I keep them? </connor>
<joey> And I was like, no, I'm
getting rid of them. </joey>
<connor> So I actually, I've lost a lot of them. </connor>
<connor> I pretty much have, like, I
would say an average amount </connor>
<joey> of like that anyone would
have someone who took photos. </joey>
<joey> Right? Yeah. </joey>
<connor> But I think it's cool as an adult </connor>
<connor> I can make the choice to be
like, I'm fine with having most </connor>
<connor> of my like adult life
essentially be documented. </connor>
<connor> I think that's kind of cool. </connor>
<connor> I mean, whether my future kids think so. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah He's like, </garnt>
<connor> - That's up to them. </connor>
<connor> - I'm I'm sorry for
any future kid who goes </connor>
<garnt> through my Twitter timeline,
God, I'm so fucking sorry. </garnt>
<connor> - Am sure Twitter at some point, </connor>

<joey> I like, </joey>
<joey> like you said, </joey>
<connor> when it comes to online media, </connor>
<connor> I kind of act like a hoarder right? </connor>
<connor> (chuckles) </connor>
<connor> Like I don't know what I can look back. </connor>
<joey> Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> I don't know what I could
look back in, in a few years </joey>
<joey> and be like, yeah, I tweeted
that back in 2008 or two. </joey>
<garnt> I couldn't remember when
I started my Twitter, man. </garnt>
<garnt> It's been, it's been a while. </garnt>
<garnt> - Didn't even know that
Twitter was that old honestly. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah. Because I have, </garnt>
<joey> I have this thing on, I
don't know if you have it. </joey>
<joey> I think you do right where,
like I have this thing </joey>
<joey> on my Twitter where like,
if the tweet is older </joey>
<joey> than two months, then
it automatically delete. </joey>
<connor> - I think that might
set like two years just </connor>
<connor> cause like every time I look back </connor>
<connor> at myself two years, I'm
like, fuck I was crunchy. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> I'm like that six months ago. </joey>
<garnt> So I'm just like... </garnt>
<joey> - I didn't look. </joey>
<garnt> I like the ability to look back </garnt>
<garnt> and be like, man, I was fucking cringy. </garnt>
<garnt> I like the ability to
look back and go, man </garnt>
<garnt> what the fuck was, this was
this anime zone hairstyle? </garnt>
<garnt> What the fuck man. </garnt>
<garnt> - I got that on YouTube. </garnt>
<joey> - That's what YouTube channel is for. </joey>
<joey> - For Twitch clips, you
know, all that shit. </joey>
<joey> That's what that's for you. </joey>
<joey> - I already have like one website to like </joey>
<joey> remind me of how cringey I used to be. </joey>
<joey> I want like multiple
websites to remind me how </joey>
<joey> cringey I used to be. </joey>
<garnt> - I wanna know what
cringey thoughts I had. </garnt>
<joey> So, you know, that's,
that's not just pictures. </joey>
<garnt> I want everything. </garnt>
<joey> I don't wanna go back to like </joey>
<joey> my personal Facebook and
big go back to like 2010 </joey>
<garnt> and being like, Oh God, </garnt>
<garnt> why the fuck did I tweet
shit out like that? </garnt>
<joey> Or message shit out like that. </joey>
<garnt> - No, cause going back
to the bald conversation. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah. And like rock rocking </garnt>
<garnt> and style and everything like that. </garnt>
<garnt> So I remember I had to, I had to go </garnt>
<garnt> through this exact process
when I finished being a monk </garnt>
<joey> and I was just, I was just bald, right? </joey>
<joey> - And we talked about
before, how, you know </joey>
<joey> you can't, you can't really, </joey>
<joey> it's hard to rock a bald style </joey>
<joey> when you don't have a beard or anything. </joey>
<joey> I feel like it's especially
hard as an Asian as well. </joey>
<joey> So like initially all I
did was just like wear, </joey>
<joey> like wear a beanie. </joey>
<joey> And the thing, the thing about
this like frail Asian kid </joey>
<joey> wearing a beanie walking, right. </joey>
<joey> You look like a cancer patient. </joey>
<joey> Like that's, that's, you know, that's, </joey>
<joey> that's, that's kind of
like what I look like </joey>
<joey> On the outside. </joey>
<joey> So I was like, I'm tired Of this. </joey>
<joey> You know, I want at least change my style. </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> - So I was thinking, well,
what can I possibly do? </joey>
<joey> And the only other style I
can think of is like, what </joey>
<joey> what do you think of when you think, </joey>
<joey> you know, bald head shaved? </joey>
<joey> - You think you kinda, you kinda think </joey>
<joey> of like somebody who just
like a delinquent, right? </joey>
<joey> - Someone's like a skinhead. </joey>
<connor> - You like, it's like a skinhead, right? </connor>
<connor> So I tried to go for that look </connor>
<connor> and I have a picture actually. </connor>
<connor> I dug this up during the break. </connor>
<connor> Let me see if I can get it. </connor>
<connor> But yeah, I went for, I
went for the skinhead look. </connor>
<connor> And for the first, for the
first and only time in my life. </connor>
<garnt> I looked like a complete, </garnt>
<garnt> - Whoa! </garnt>
<joey> - I look like I just came out of prison. </joey>
<connor> - You look like Asian Jason Statham. </connor>
<connor> (laughing loudly) </connor>
<connor> - That's fucking awesome. </connor>
<connor> - I kinda love that. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - That's dope. That was dope as fuck. </garnt>
<garnt> - If I saw someone walking the streets. </garnt>
<garnt> - Its Garnt. </garnt>
<garnt> - I have never felt like it. </garnt>
<joey> It's the glasses and the scarf. </joey>
<garnt> - Okay. This is the first
and only time in my life </garnt>
<garnt> where I felt dangerous. </garnt>
<connor> - Right. I would, I would be
like, I'll be walking down </connor>
<connor> - Move away from me. </connor>
<connor> - Because I was living in
China at this time, right? </connor>
<connor> And so I would be walking down the streets </connor>
<connor> and sometimes if it,
if it was it was dark, </connor>
<connor> I could see like groups of girls </connor>
<connor> or groups of anyone just
like subtly cross the road. </connor>
<connor> Whenever I was, I was okay. </connor>
<connor> And this, this one time. </connor>
<connor> So I was with some friends there </connor>
<connor> and it took me like to this local bar </connor>
<connor> who's run by this like
frail, you know, you know </connor>
<connor> one of the old Asian ladies
who run this local bar. </connor>
<connor> And so we walk in and
she dead ass looks at me </connor>
<connor> and I could see her have like a mini </connor>
<connor> a mini fucking heart attack. </connor>
<connor> She's like, "What?" </connor>
<connor> And then she goes to my mate </connor>
<connor> and goes, "I'm sorry,
we're closed right now." </connor>
<connor> And my mates, like, no, I
I've been here quite often. </connor>
<connor> I, you know, I know this
place is open as she did. </connor>
<connor> I says to him, I'm just not
looking for trouble right now. </connor>
<connor> - Garnt is the kind of
guy who you would say </connor>
<connor> am not looking for trouble. </connor>
<joey> - I mean look, I don't blame you, man. </joey>
<joey> Like if I, if I was that frail old lady </joey>
<joey> I feel like I would </joey>
<joey> I would look at that and be
like, Oh, that's Chinese mafia. </joey>
<connor> - Were you wearing the sunglasses? </connor>
<garnt> And the scarf as well? </garnt>
<garnt> - I was wearing the scarf. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. That's Chinese mafia dude. </garnt>

<joey> - Yeah. The scarf says like, it's Louie, </joey>
<connor> but I mean, you know, I
kill as well you know. </connor>
<joey> - The scarf says I'm hiding tasks. </joey>
<joey> That's what that say. </joey>
<joey> You don't wanna see the
tasks I have underneath. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. Looking like this

<joey> that meme with that guy
in the party being like </joey>
<garnt> they don't know him a fair load on me. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> I kill people. </garnt>
<connor> (laughing loudly) </connor>
<connor> - It's like the big coat as well. </connor>
<joey> It's like, yeah, I might
be concealing a weapon </joey>
<garnt> but I'll never say. </garnt>
<joey> - This is honestly the first time </joey>
<joey> I ever like tried wearing a leather jacket </joey>
<connor> and I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> "Tom, you know what?" </connor>
<joey> - Actually you look
good in leather jacket. </joey>
<garnt> - I love leather jacket. </garnt>
<joey> - Is that why you wear leather
jackets a lot nowadays. </joey>
<joey> - Ever since this is where it started. </joey>
<garnt> - Actually looks good on you. </garnt>
<garnt> - The only one I know where it's like, </garnt>
<joey> damn, he fucking kills a leather jacket. </joey>
<joey> up who will like, Oh, you know, I want to </joey>
<joey> I want to get back into
like the whole like eighties </joey>
<joey> like street wear spirit and you know </joey>
<joey> the punk spirit and like
wear a leather jacket. </joey>
<joey> And it just, it looks so lame. </joey>
<garnt> - Some people do look </garnt>
<garnt> like they're just wearing
the dad's clothes. </garnt>
<joey> Jackets. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. I tried to once
and I was like, nah, </joey>
<joey> it's not for me. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. For me, the one piece </garnt>
<garnt> of clothing I find really
hard to rock is a good suit. </garnt>
<garnt> I dunno. </garnt>
<garnt> I dunno what it is about a suit, right? </garnt>
<connor> - I love wearing suits. </connor>
<connor> I know you love wearing. </connor>
<connor> You use every opportunity
you can to just rock </connor>
<connor> up when you were jojo suit. </connor>
<garnt> - Going to the grocery store, suit up </garnt>
<joey> - Suit up. </joey>
<connor> - Why not? </connor>
<connor> Suits is so fun to wear, man. </connor>
<garnt> It is really fun. </garnt>
<connor> - You feel like you commend a presence </connor>
<connor> when you're wearing your suit. </connor>
<connor> You know, like when I,
when I leave my house </connor>
<connor> around the Jojo suit, like, like, you know </connor>
<connor> like I go on the train, I'm
like, yeah, I'm wearing it. </connor>
<garnt> - Cause like, for me, I
like, I can rock a suit </garnt>
<garnt> but it really needs to be tailor-made. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause like anything else,
if most like my entire life </garnt>
<connor> if I just buy like this
stormy too, you know, it feels </connor>
<connor> it just feels like, and
where my dad's clothes, I </connor>
<connor> I look like five years younger
and I, and that's not a good </connor>
<garnt> it's not a good five years
younger than it looks I'm back </garnt>
<garnt> to being a teenager or
something like that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. I don't know. </garnt>
<connor> Especially as well here,
if you were anything other </connor>
<connor> than the standard businessman
suit here, which is like </connor>
<connor> what? The Navy </connor>
<joey> - Like the Navy blue,
white t-shirt on today. </joey>
<connor> - It's like nobody made
it, it's like dark Navy. </connor>
<joey> Like they all wear the same goddamn suit. </joey>
<joey> So when I, you know, when
I whip out my little light </joey>
<joey> burgundy, what color is it like beige? </joey>
<joey> The Jojo beige suit. </joey>
<garnt> Stands out so fucking much. </garnt>
<garnt> Am like, yeah bitch! </garnt>
<connor> - Like I forget. </connor>
<connor> Sometimes you have, you
bought two jojo suits </connor>
<garnt> because you only wear that one. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, cause the other one,
it's like way more formal. </connor>
<connor> So it's a little harder to wear it. </connor>
<connor> Like on just kind of like
not super serious things. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah have got the other one, the, </joey>
<connor> the butcher ADI one, the Navy blue </connor>
<joey> like kind of double standard. </joey>
<joey> - It's also like a crossover. </joey>
<joey> And I feel like the crossover is </joey>
<joey> like more mafia or like super serious. </joey>
<connor> Whereas the German one, cause
it's just like super chill. </connor>
<connor> It's like Bay, beige
is not a serious color. </connor>
<connor> No people who wear beige
don't do serious things </connor>
<connor> but you look good, look good </connor>
<joey> - Explain serious thing. </joey>
<connor> - Like you see someone wearing this suit. </connor>
<connor> - Like people, mafia men can wear beige. </connor>
<joey> - Here's the Giordano suit. </joey>
<joey> Here's the Bruichladdich suit, right? </joey>
<connor> The Butchuaratty suit looks </connor>
<joey> like you've you are killing people. </joey>
<joey> You're trading </joey>
<joey> in stocks that can't be
bought by public citizens. </joey>
<joey> You know, the journal one
looks like, you know, like </joey>
<joey> like you have fun times. </joey>
<joey> You go out for nice meals,
you know, it's, you know </joey>
<joey> it's a different kind of atmosphere. </joey>
<joey> - I go to the gold bar every now </joey>
<joey> and then it's a different kind </joey>
<joey> of atmosphere that it gives off. </joey>
<garnt> - Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like wearing a three piece. </garnt>
<connor> You can't just casually
wear a three piece. </connor>
<garnt> - You look so good in the three-piece </garnt>
<garnt> because I did something, you
know, I like how men's fashion </garnt>
<garnt> no matter how, how much time has passed. </garnt>
<garnt> Right. A suit and a three-piece
just always looks good. </garnt>
<garnt> It's just something that is timeless. </garnt>
<garnt> And I don't know what it is. </garnt>
<garnt> They've just like, we, we
optimize how good guys could look </garnt>
<garnt> like hundreds of years ago. </garnt>
<garnt> And then it just hasn't
changed since then. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. The standard has
always been the same. </joey>
<connor> - I don't really spend
much money on clothes </connor>
<joey> but obviously suits quite expensive. </joey>
<joey> And then you only bought, bought a suit </joey>
<joey> Will know that. </joey>
<joey> - Like a nice suit. </joey>
<joey> Yeah. Like a nice suit right? </joey>
<joey> Like, yeah. </joey>
<joey> You can go to prime Mark and
get the $20 here or whatever. </joey>
<joey> And it doesn't look bad. </joey>
<joey> Actually. It doesn't. </joey>
<joey> I remember I was telling,
like I was talking about on </joey>
<joey> on Twitch, I was talking
about the Jojo suits </joey>
<joey> I'm bringing out new Jojo suits. </joey>
<joey> And I was like, yeah, I'm
going to buy them all. </joey>
<joey> And they were like, </joey>
<joey> Powerful ones right? </joey>
<connor> Yeah. And then like the
like 500 bucks each. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, listen guys for a suit </connor>
<connor> 500 bucks is not that much. </connor>
<connor> Especially if you can go in there and get </connor>
<connor> they tailored a little bit
to you like this, come on. </connor>
<connor> Come on, these suits are fucking gold </connor>
<joey> - Especially as an adult as well. </joey>
<joey> Like that's just gonna to last. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah bro. </connor>
<joey> You think I'm only ever wearing
those job Jojo suits now </joey>
<joey> - Like one time thing </joey>
<joey> - Never wearing. </joey>
<joey> I'm never wearing any other suits ever. </joey>
<joey> I'm in a pretty well, but I mean </joey>
<joey> I'm gonna get my money's worth, right? </joey>
<connor> And also the nice things
that luxurious man </connor>
<connor> you gotta like, you know, a good suit. </connor>
<joey> You can't cheap out. </joey>
<connor> If you go to a job interview
wearing a cheap-ass suit </connor>
<connor> come on, come on. </connor>
<connor> I mean, </connor>
<connor> - You go to a job interview
wearing Jojo suit? </connor>
<connor> - Bro they're like, </connor>
<connor> - Instant application. </connor>
<connor> - Presents has been commended you know. </connor>
<connor> You walk in right. </connor>
<joey> - This boy is serious and he's beige. </joey>
<connor> - Nevermind. He's got a Jojo suit. </connor>
<garnt> - He's got a beige suit on he's. </garnt>
<garnt> He's good. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean that's the thing about the suit, </garnt>
<connor> is that it's one of, it's one </connor>
<garnt> of the few things that you
really can't cheap out on them. </garnt>
<connor> You can try it. </connor>
<garnt> I mean like, you know, you can go </garnt>
<garnt> to places like get a pretty cheap suit </garnt>
<connor> in somewhere like Thailand. </connor>
<connor> That's like tailor made
and everything like that. </connor>
<connor> But if you don't have
that luxury of buying </connor>
<connor> of going to a place where
it can be made for cheap </connor>
<connor> then a cheap suit really
shows like most like no </connor>
<connor> - When you wear it as
well, what's a good suit. </connor>
<connor> You feel like damn, I'm powerful. </connor>
<connor> It comes off in the
aura that you give off. </connor>
<connor> It's like some Hunter,
Hunter, Nan stuff, right? </connor>
<connor> People feel your presence. </connor>
<connor> When you, when you're in a good suit </connor>
<connor> people know you are in a good suit. </connor>
<connor> They feel it </connor>
<connor> in the way I'm telling you,
man, it's not bullshit. </connor>
<joey> That's what, that's what I do. </joey>
<connor> - When I go buy a suit,
I'm just like, excuse me. </connor>
<connor> It's the aura tailor. </connor>
<connor> - Honestly. It's an option though. </connor>
<joey> - You know it's to tailor-made
when they're asking questions </joey>
<connor> you're like, what the
fuck you talking about? </connor>
<connor> They're like, they're asking you stuff. </connor>
<connor> Like, how would you like this or that? </connor>
<connor> And I'm like </connor>
<connor> I've never been asked
that question in my life. </connor>
<connor> What is that? </connor>
<connor> Doesn't they show you like, I don't care. </connor>
<connor> What do you think? </connor>
<connor> You're the tailor you tell me? </connor>
<connor> It's like </connor>
<connor> - Would you like two centimeters </connor>
<connor> or three centimeters off your coffee? </connor>
<joey> I don't know. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. Like when they ask like </joey>
<garnt> do you want the leg rolled up
at the bottom of the steps? </garnt>
<connor> And I'm like, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> - She didn't tell me what looks good. </connor>
<connor> I literally have no, what do you tell me? </connor>
<connor> - Cause I remember like the
first time I wore a suit was </connor>
<garnt> for like my high school
prom or something like that. </garnt>
<joey> - I think that was the first
time for like everybody. </joey>
<connor> - That's when you get
like the prime marks. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I'm going to find you a good suit. </connor>
<connor> Cause you're not gonna get me any value </connor>
<garnt> out of that little shit. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<joey> And everyone, everyone does look like </joey>
<joey> they're wearing their dads suit. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> I think it's possible.
- Its like lets go dads. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> - Its like the oversized suits. </joey>
<joey> Oh God. </joey>
<joey> - It looks so unnatural. </joey>
<joey> - The good old days where just... </joey>
<connor> (chuckles) </connor>
<joey> - Why is it that every like 16 year old </joey>
<connor> who goes to like the first
prom in a suit just looks like, </connor>
<connor> they're just like, </connor>
<connor> - Cause you not comfortable in it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. But like, it's, it's so funny. </connor>
<connor> How like every photo of ever
seen either off myself or </connor>
<joey> of my friends, or just
complete random strangers </joey>
<connor> out their proms, </connor>
<joey> they all look like the T-posing. </joey>
<joey> You know what I mean? </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> they are like, they all like
there's a standing like, </joey>
<joey> yes, we are at a prom. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> - A suit it's like 50% the suit, </connor>
<connor> 50% how comfortable
you feel wearing these. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Can you embody what a suit is? </connor>
<connor> You know, you can't just
put on a suit and be like, </connor>
<connor> I guess I'm, I guess I'm
kinda like attractive now. </connor>
<connor> No. You've got to believe that
when you put that suit on, </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I'm hot. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - You got to give off that aura. </garnt>
<garnt> You got to have faith. </garnt>
<garnt> - But like, okay, there's
always, this there's always like </garnt>
<garnt> every time I wear a suit, right. </garnt>
<garnt> There's always this countdown of like </garnt>
<joey> when am I going to take this jacket off? </joey>
<joey> Cause inevitably when you
go to like any celebrations </joey>
<joey> or something, you're gonna
get too hot on that side. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Of course.
- Of course. </joey>
<joey> - And I feel like, you know,
if you're gonna take pictures </joey>
<joey> or do anything get it right at
the beginning of the nights. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Because there's nothing more messy </joey>
<joey> than like just the suit that, you know </joey>
<joey> has just been battered and damage. </joey>
<joey> And like you can tell
it's not the suit itself. </joey>
<joey> It's the tie, right? </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Its like at the beginning
you're like, you got </joey>
<joey> your buttoned up right to the top button. </joey>
<joey> (Joey gasping for air) </joey>
<joey> Your tie is tight. </joey>
<joey> You look fucking suave. </joey>
<garnt> - [Conner] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Five hours in, </garnt>
<garnt> God, you're a sweaty mess. </garnt>
<garnt> That Tie has taken a beating. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, it's like
halfway down your chest. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> - One thing, Japan is like
advanced technology and is like </connor>
<joey> that business shirts are like next level. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like I've, I don't
know how they've done it. </joey>
<joey> But Japan is like, optimize
the fuck out of like, shirts. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like business shirt. </garnt>
<garnt> - Of course they have. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause everyone, </garnt>
<garnt> - Everyone's wearing.
- Everyone wearing. </garnt>
<garnt> - Every person here is a salary man. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. I mean, I put
this thing on at first, </garnt>
<garnt> and it was a little pricey. </garnt>
<connor> I thought, you know, I
mean, I guess, you know, </connor>
<connor> from buying a nice suit,
I buy a nice shirt. </connor>
<connor> - Even. I it's always an after thought </connor>
<connor> cause I always think if
it's wide, who gives a fuck? </connor>
<connor> Then I put this thing on, </connor>
<connor> and I'm like, Whoa, it
breathes, is stretches </connor>
<connor> It looks clean. </connor>
<connor> It washes super-easy. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And I'm like, Whoa, I've
never like appreciated a shirt </connor>
<connor> until Japan. </connor>
<joey> - I remember, I remember I saw
an ad, for like last summer. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - When it was like, you
know that fucking heat wave. </connor>
<connor> - It doesn't matter if
it's like 40 degrees </connor>
<connor> or it's four degrees. </connor>
<connor> People are wearing a suit. </connor>
<connor> - The materials feels amazing. </connor>
<connor> - But I remember I saw an ad,
which dead are said, like this </connor>
<garnt> this business shoulder has
self cooling technology. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughing loudly) </garnt>
<garnt> - I get it </garnt>
<garnt> - Cooling technology. </garnt>
<garnt> Like it's a, it's a piece of cotton. </garnt>
<connor> - Some of them like
have like a stretchiness </connor>
<joey> to it that makes it like,
feel really like air rated. </joey>
<joey> I don't know what it is. </joey>
<joey> Okay. If you come to Japan, right. </joey>
<joey> And you like your, your shirts. </joey>
<joey> Yeah. Dead ass, you know,
bringing my animate figures </joey>
<joey> get some Japanese shirts </joey>
<joey> go to like perfect suit factory here. </joey>
<joey> And just go and put, get </joey>
<garnt> go and get some biceps, self cooling. </garnt>
<connor> They legit. </connor>
<connor> They good. </connor>
<connor> I feel like whenever Japan </connor>
<connor> - Like advertisers as
new fancy technology is </connor>
<connor> though it's it's it's hit or miss </connor>
<connor> because sometimes you get good things </connor>
<joey> like the heat tech here </joey>
<joey> the Heat tech when you go
to Uniqlo and it's winter, </joey>
<joey> those are fucking great. </joey>
<joey> - The cool shirts, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - The cool shirts are obviously great. </joey>
<joey> I remember though
recently, like Uniqlo also </joey>
<joey> released the, they,
you know, this was deep </joey>
<connor> during the pandemic. </connor>
<connor> It was debriefing during
quarantine and they released </connor>
<connor> like their own Arizona masks
or something like that. </connor>
<connor> That was meant, that was
meant to like be more </connor>
<connor> breathable fabric or something like that. </connor>
<connor> And, and it, it got so
high that it's sold out </connor>
<connor> on the first day immediately,
people were queuing </connor>
<connor> up to buy these masks. </connor>
<connor> And I think about three months
into it, I was at Uniqlo </connor>
<connor> and miraculously. </connor>
<connor> They were just back on sale day. </connor>
<connor> They just come back into stock. </connor>
<garnt> So I was like, you know what,
I'm gonna give this a try </garnt>
<connor> because this has been sold out. </connor>
<garnt> And I'm tired of my, you
know, of like of my masks. </garnt>
<garnt> So let's, let's, let's see
how breathable this is. </garnt>
<garnt> And it literally, it literally
felt like you'd just worn </garnt>
<garnt> like, you know, one of
those like anime knickers. </garnt>
<garnt> Anime masks. </garnt>
<connor> - Just like underwear. </connor>
<garnt> - It literally just felt like </garnt>
<garnt> you had underwear in your face. </garnt>
<garnt> And it was a fucking lie. </garnt>
<garnt> This thing was this thing, this thing felt </garnt>
<garnt> like he was going to give me asthma. </garnt>
<garnt> It was not breathable at all. </garnt>
<connor> - We have a lot of fats they're here </connor>
<connor> and his fat fad technology wasn't there </connor>
<garnt> - Like the, a necklace or
something was meant to prevent. </garnt>
<connor> - Literally I see some people
wearing it's called virus out. </connor>
<connor> Like literally just like a
necklace and everyone's wearing. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. Hockey made like an
entire video about like a bunch </joey>
<joey> of like Corona virus, scam items. </joey>
<joey> And one of them was that it's like, it's </joey>
<joey> like this fucking lucky charm
looking thing where it's like, </joey>
<connor> "Go away virus." </connor>
<connor> It was literally that energy. </connor>
<connor> - It's just like, it's just </connor>
<connor> it's just a car air
freshener around your neck. </connor>
<joey> - I'd rather you not care </joey>
<connor> than have that and be like I care. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. Cause, cause like at least </connor>
<joey> you not pretending at that point. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - The fact that they're like </garnt>
<joey> I saw a bunch of people who like, like </joey>
<joey> especially like older, like
women, you know, always believe </joey>
<joey> in that for some reason
who would like wear that </joey>
<joey> and be like, Oh, I don't
have to wear a mask anymore. </joey>
<joey> I'm I'm fully protected with this. </joey>
<joey> You know? </joey>
<joey> - I mean, it's the same
reason anti-vaccine </joey>
<connor> and stuff like exists. Right? </connor>
<connor> Because this kind of, you know, if </connor>
<connor> if you have a small, small
enough group who trade in </connor>
<connor> like trade information
within that group, then </connor>
<connor> they're just gonna stop
leaving the wall to sometimes. </connor>
<joey> And you know, it's a lot </joey>
<joey> of like the image globally is
that a lot of people, a lot </joey>
<joey> of this is confined to America,
but you know, it's all over. </joey>
<joey> It's all over the world. </joey>
<garnt> Like it is all over the place </garnt>
<garnt> as stupidity is not confined by one type </garnt>
<garnt> of like nationality or just
the big difference is like </garnt>
<garnt> it seems in America,
it's just more documented </garnt>
<connor> and its more widespread. </connor>
<garnt> - That's unfortunate. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause like, I mean like, like you said </garnt>
<garnt> like the stupid, I do agree. </garnt>
<garnt> They are stupid, but it's
been like proven, right? </garnt>
<joey> If you keep calling them stupid </joey>
<joey> it like makes them believe in it more. </joey>
<joey> Yeah. You're like, you're
like, you're a conspiracy. </joey>
<garnt> You're like </garnt>
<garnt> - Are you working with the government? </garnt>
<garnt> You're one of them. </garnt>
<garnt> But also at the same time </garnt>
<connor> - I don't wanna sit there
and humor stupid ideas. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. So it's like, yeah, I don't know. </connor>
<joey> I don't, I don't really talk about it. </joey>
<joey> I don't really get involved with it. </joey>
<connor> Cause I'm just like, I feel
like it's a lose, lose. </connor>
<connor> These people should know about. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. You know, I just like
to think that, you know, like </connor>
<connor> for example, if my mum one day
got into something like that </connor>
<joey> that I'd like to be able to think </joey>
<joey> that I could maybe talk her out of it. </joey>
<joey> Like mom. Come on. </joey>
<joey> Yeah. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> The PG tips is not poisoned. </joey>
<joey> - You can drink the tea mom. </joey>
<connor> (joy laughs) </connor>
<connor> I'm pretty sure we'd all be dead. </connor>
<garnt> You know, just give me a fake. </garnt>
<connor> It's unfortunate. </connor>
<connor> - Wasn't it like the England in England? </connor>
<connor> What? Like the 5G towers caused. </connor>
<connor> - That was embarrassing or whatever. </connor>
<garnt> Whatever it was, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - That was like huge in the UK. </joey>
<joey> The people would like
burning down these towers. </joey>
<joey> It's embarrassing. </joey>
<joey> You like, these are like </joey>
<connor> I live in the same
country with these people. </connor>
<connor> I went to the same schools as these people </connor>
<connor> who burned down fucking 5G towers. </connor>
<connor> - So that fact of like,
you know, you should </connor>
<connor> you shouldn't like when,
when footwear wireless </connor>
<joey> like Bluetooth headphones
first came out for your phone </joey>
<joey> be like, people should
use those because if you </joey>
<joey> if you're on the phone like
this, then the signal actually </joey>
<garnt> - I remember that. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah. I remember that. </garnt>
<garnt> And there were people,
at least in Australia, </garnt>
<garnt> like when I was growing up, there were </garnt>
<garnt> like, people dead ass being like, </garnt>
<joey> "shit, I have to go buy
some Bluetooth headphones. </joey>
<joey> You know, I don't wanna
get a tumor in my brain </joey>
<joey> from all these phone calls I'm taking." </joey>
<garnt> I'm like, "what are you on?" </garnt>
<garnt> - I think one of the most
interesting things I've like, </garnt>
<garnt> I've seen happen recently </garnt>
<garnt> that's happened right in front of my eyes </garnt>
<garnt> is the fucking toilet paper shortage. </garnt>
<garnt> Right? </garnt>
<garnt> Like, like I think back to that and like, </garnt>
<joey> - Why does that feel like 10 years ago? </joey>
<joey> - I know. </joey>
<garnt> I think back to that,
unlike our kids are gonna </garnt>
<joey> be reading about this or
like, they're gonna see like </joey>
<joey> isn't it, they're going to see
the Israeli historian video </joey>
<joey> like 20 years in the
future and, and be thinking </joey>
<garnt> like my generation, whenever
this stupid, it's like </garnt>
<joey> I'm just imagining like,
you know, 20 years from now </joey>
<joey> like our kids, right. </joey>
<connor> Will be like in fucking history class </connor>
<connor> like modern history being like class. </connor>
<connor> All right so class today
we're gonna be talking about </connor>
<connor> the 2020 great toilet paper shortage. </connor>
<joey> Like it's the same as the crank depression </joey>
<joey> - Blew my mind. </joey>
<connor> How in Japan, it happened as well. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, we literally have, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It blew my mind. </connor>
<garnt> What do you guys clean your ass with? </garnt>
<connor> - It blew my mind. </connor>
<connor> That happened worldwide. </connor>
<connor> It was literally like a
idea that spread worldwide. </connor>
<joey> Even though like nobody,
nobody knew where it came from. </joey>
<joey> It's the family in Australia. </joey>
<joey> Not proud of it </joey>
<joey> but like, like the thing
is nobody like another </joey>
<joey> countries really knew that
it came from Australia </joey>
<joey> cause they were just
like, Oh, toilet paper. </joey>
<garnt> I must buy. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know why, but everyone
else is buying toilet people. </garnt>
<garnt> Therefore I must buy a toilet paper. </garnt>
<connor> - It didn't occur to people
that maybe like, you know </connor>
<connor> if everyone just keeps using toilet paper </connor>
<connor> at the same rate that we've all been using </connor>
<connor> it it'll continue to be the same. </connor>
<connor> Right. </connor>
<garnt> - Cause I don't know why. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause he was out of every
household necessity that you </garnt>
<joey> think would happen that
you think people would </joey>
<joey> need an apocalypse food, water, I sleep. </joey>
<joey> Toilet paper. I wake. </joey>
<garnt> This is the real shit. </garnt>
<joey> - So what do people think that like </joey>
<joey> if you got COVID you also
got irritable bowel syndrome. </joey>
<joey> I'm like , </joey>
<connor> - In my mind as well, I'm like </connor>
<connor> do I really want to be an who just goes </connor>
<connor> and like takes everything in the shop. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, I mean, I'll
take like a little bit </connor>
<connor> of like pasta a little bit
of canned goods, like enough. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. Like we, like, we
stepped up, but we didn't </connor>
<connor> like be like, can I have
everything on that shelf </connor>
<garnt> from there to there? </garnt>
<garnt> No, we, we, we, we only stocked
up just because there was </garnt>
<garnt> a literal shortage and there
was a literal point where </garnt>
<connor> I had trouble wiping my
ass because there wasn't, </connor>
<connor> there was no toilet paper. </connor>
<connor> - The day gang rise up. </connor>
<joey> - I was gonna clean my
ass by the end of the day, </joey>
<connor> but I wasn't gonna step out with a wet ass </connor>
<connor> like fuck that shit. </connor>
<joey> - I just jiggle a little shake </joey>
<garnt> because it was the one piece of like </garnt>
<joey> everyday household equipment. </joey>
<joey> They, you know, you can
understand so, you know? </joey>
<joey> Okay. I understand if there
would be a shorter dish soap </joey>
<connor> I can understand hand sanitizer. </connor>
<connor> Of course. </connor>
<garnt> I understand why there
would be food and water </garnt>
<connor> - Food and water. </connor>
<garnt> There wasn't any </garnt>
<connor> - I'm like, do you know
how easy it is to live </connor>
<connor> off like rice or pasta? </connor>
<connor> Like you don't need much of that. </connor>
<joey> - But there was even a
shortage of like pasta as well. </joey>
<connor> Like I remember. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. I remember, I remember
the video of, I think it was </connor>
<connor> in Italy that there was like
all of those supermarkets </connor>
<connor> and the old guy was
like getting pissed off </connor>
<connor> cause there was no pasta
in the supermarket. </connor>
<connor> And he was like," people
weren't this obsessed during </connor>
<joey> world war two. </joey>
<joey> We had more pasta in world war two </joey>
<joey> than we do now, what
the fuck is going on?" </joey>
<connor> - I guess the problem is is that </connor>
<connor> like everyone's telling each other yeah. </connor>
<connor> You should panic. </connor>
<connor> Like in real time. </connor>
<connor> Right? Spread it out. </connor>
<connor> It's like, Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<connor> I had a bunch of cop ramen
and I was like, I'm pretty. </connor>
<connor> I think I'm good. </connor>
<connor> I'll see what happens. </connor>
<connor> Like I'm pretty sure the
stores aren't just gonna shut. </connor>
<garnt> - I like there would
be an exact point where </garnt>
<garnt> I would like start panicking. </garnt>
<garnt> And that exact point is </garnt>
<garnt> if I found out the company was closed. </garnt>
<joey> Cause like, I, I feel like,
Hey, if the company closes </joey>
<joey> you're going through some real shit. </joey>
<joey> - That is when I truly woke. </joey>
<joey> Are we really going through an apocalypse. </joey>
<garnt> Okay. I wake now. Am fucked. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like America, that like waffle house. </garnt>
<joey> And like you can judge on
like the disaster based </joey>
<joey> on where the wasp waffle
house is open or closed. </joey>
<connor> It's like, it's an actual </connor>
<connor> like study like thing where
like, even when there's </connor>
<joey> like hurricanes waffle house
in America is still open. </joey>
<joey> - Wow. Seriously? </joey>
<joey> Yes. You should look it up. </joey>
<connor> - Its really interesting. </connor>
<connor> - I like, I think, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> We didn't know which of big
natural disaster it was. </connor>
<connor> I think it must have
Katrina or something else. </connor>
<connor> It was still open. </connor>
<connor> - Cause they're all
equipment like generators. </connor>
<joey> Right? Why? </joey>
<joey> In case of disaster </joey>
<joey> - The like one of the
only things that like will </joey>
<joey> try their best to stay open. </joey>
<joey> Unless like, you know </joey>
<connor> the disaster is so bad when
waffle house in America... </connor>
<joey> - It's like damn, my
roof just got blown off </joey>
<joey> could kill for some waffles. </joey>
<connor> - Like windows and shit are broken. </connor>
<joey> I think they'd still continue to be open. </joey>
<joey> Like I'll let you in. </joey>
<joey> I I'm not, I'm not sure exactly. </joey>
<joey> It could be checking out my ass </joey>
<garnt> but this is as far as been there. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. Cause I </connor>
<garnt> I think what's this entire
situation has made me </garnt>
<garnt> realize is I remember like, Oh,
before, before 2020 watching </garnt>
<connor> like old school zombie movies
and something like that. </connor>
<connor> And you'd think to
yourself, man, they made the </connor>
<connor> they made the people really
stupid in this zombie movie. </connor>
<connor> This would never happen in real life. </connor>
<connor> And now I look back and I'm like, </connor>
<connor> - Oh its definitely gonna happen. </connor>
<connor> - I'm like they didn't
make them stupid enough. </connor>
<connor> Jesus Christ. </connor>
<connor> - People that like rounds
up people and feeds them </connor>
<joey> to the zombies because
they think it'll probably </joey>
<joey> appease the zombie or something. </joey>
<joey> Some shit like that. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. I look at something </connor>
<connor> like dead rising and I'm like,
well this is unrealistic. </connor>
<joey> There's still things inside
all of the stores to pay for. </joey>
<garnt> It's still what the there? </garnt>
<connor> Isn't a subgroup </connor>
<connor> of people praising the
zombie what's going on. </connor>
<connor> - I, I am curious for every
like zombie story and like every </connor>
<garnt> like every kind of like apocalyptic story </garnt>
<garnt> like would like how </garnt>
<garnt> if 2020 would have changed,
like how cliches and tropes </garnt>
<connor> - You get a million boring movies </connor>
<connor> about this current pandemic. </connor>
<connor> And </connor>
<connor> - Can you make an exciting
movie about the pandemic? </connor>
<joey> I mean, they tried to do with 2012. </joey>
<connor> Right. They made one like
in 2006 or seven were like </connor>
<connor> - Oh it was pandemic. </connor>
<connor> Right. That was </connor>
<connor> - Pandemic. There's like a few movies. </connor>
<connor> They're like, they're </connor>
<connor> like worryingly close
to like what happened? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. That was the, that
was the one that went viral. </joey>
<joey> I think I saw it last year. </joey>
<connor> Whereas I was like crazy. </connor>
<connor> Like </connor>
<joey> - In the movie there was like a pandemic. </joey>
<joey> That was like completely
obviously named something </joey>
<joey> completely differently
than the years before. </joey>
<joey> And, and I think it'd go
viral because people found it </joey>
<joey> on Netflix and started watching it. </joey>
<joey> And the dead, the plot is that there was </joey>
<joey> a virus that was started
in China through bats. </joey>
<joey> Really? </joey>
<joey> Yeah. And people like </joey>
<connor> - Some chef had it and they
shook hands with a businesswoman </connor>
<joey> - And then spread to America. </joey>
<joey> Like half of America died. </joey>
<joey> I think it was mad thing. </joey>
<joey> - Fucking mad thing. </joey>
<connor> I love you right here. </connor>
<joey> - People are like, Oh my God,
this is almost scarily similar </joey>
<joey> to what's actually happening right now. </joey>
<garnt> - Probably smarter because
people probably acted much </garnt>
<connor> a lot smarter in that movie. </connor>
<connor> - No, no, no, no. </connor>
<garnt> - In that movie as well </garnt>
<joey> they were just like instantly
die for some reason. </joey>
<joey> Matt Damon and his kid I think. </joey>
<joey> - Were immune.
- Were immune, </joey>
<joey> because of course Matt Damon. </joey>
<connor> I'm pretty sure if that happened. </connor>
<connor> Matt Damon and Tom cruise be
fucking immune to anything. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. Matt, Matt Dame. </joey>
<joey> I think Matt, the, in the movie </joey>
<joey> Matt Damon was like, I
quarantine, nevermind. </joey>
<joey> I'm immune now. </joey>
<joey> (laughing loudly) </joey>
<joey> He laid like dead. </joey>
<joey> I stayed inside of a room for two weeks. </joey>
<joey> And then the doctor was like </joey>
<connor> guess you're immune now
was a pretty good movie. </connor>
<connor> If you've watched it. </connor>
<connor> - I've just seen clips of it online </connor>
<connor> - Contagion. That's pretty good. </connor>
<connor> It's pretty fun watching
it now being like, yeah </connor>
<connor> that's fine. </connor>
<garnt> - It must be, it must be weird watching it </garnt>
<garnt> during the pandemic and
seeing being like, this is a </garnt>
<garnt> this is uncomfortably close
to what's happening now. </garnt>
<connor> - It makes you realize
how lucky we got that. </connor>
<garnt> It could have been way worse. </garnt>
<garnt> Like it could have just
immediately killed people. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> Cause I think, you know,
we, we've obviously gone </connor>
<connor> through a really harsh
period right now, but I feel </connor>
<garnt> like humanity really just got
like, we got the best warning. </garnt>
<garnt> So this was, this was
the best warning sign </garnt>
<garnt> that we could have gotten. </garnt>
<garnt> And I say this, obviously
knowing that, you know, it's </garnt>
<garnt> it's a tragedy </garnt>
<joey> how many people have died, but
get the, the scary thing is </joey>
<joey> that it could have been
so much worse than it was. </joey>
<joey> And this was, this was kind of
like the worst case scenario </joey>
<joey> for how easily transmittable
this virus could have been. </joey>
<joey> But in terms of like, in terms
of like its actual effect </joey>
<garnt> it could have been a lot worse. </garnt>
<garnt> And I say this </garnt>
<garnt> with the awful results
we've gotten so far. </garnt>
<joey> - And it's just, it's just
scary to think that, you know </joey>
<joey> if this had happened, you know, 50, </joey>
<joey> a hundred years prior, how much? </joey>
<joey> Probably much, much, much
worse it could have been. </joey>
<joey> You know </joey>
<garnt> - It's weird because
like, I I've been thinking </garnt>
<garnt> about this a lot because it's, it's been </garnt>
<connor> like a full year now, since,
since I remember thinking, Oh </connor>
<connor> this is gonna, this is
gonna last a few months. </connor>
<joey> Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - There's this quarantine thing, right? </joey>
<garnt> This is a, this is a little,
this is a, I came together. </garnt>
<joey> It's like, woo, woo bunk
up for like two months. </joey>
<garnt> And then, you know </garnt>
<garnt> we'll be able to go outside
and enjoy the summer. </garnt>
<garnt> - The joke was like, Oh, anime nuts </garnt>
<joey> ha I've found I was born for this. </joey>
<joey> And then I kind of realized pretty soon </joey>
<joey> that there's a big difference </joey>
<connor> between choosing to stay home
and being forced to stay home. </connor>
<connor> I don't know what it is </connor>
<garnt> but there's a big fucking difference. </garnt>
<garnt> - I saw a tweet that was like, man </garnt>
<connor> are people going to judge people
who have a time readapting </connor>
<connor> to social situations. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, "what? </connor>
<joey> What do you mean? </joey>
<joey> - What do you mean readapting ? </joey>
<connor> - Like people who have been like </connor>
<joey> living in the house for too long alone </joey>
<joey> they were like, I hope
we don't get judged. </joey>
<joey> - What they're suddenly gonna
go outside and being like </joey>
<connor> how do I interact with you? </connor>
<connor> I thought it was a little odd. </connor>
<joey> What do you think they were like? </joey>
<garnt> - [Meilyne] I agree. </garnt>
<connor> - You agree?
- You agree Meilyne? </connor>
<connor> - [Meilyne] I'm worried. </connor>
<joey> - You're worried
- You're worried. </joey>
<joey> (laughing loudly) </joey>
<joey> - Why? </joey>
<connor> You're the fucking socialite. </connor>
<connor> - [Meilyne] With you... </connor>
<garnt> (laughing loudly) </garnt>
<joey> - You guys aint people. </joey>
<joey> I've been in the joint for too long man. </joey>
<garnt> I do not have to re acclimate to society. </garnt>
<connor> - Just like, you know when you
see shit like that on Twitter </connor>
<joey> It was just read something </joey>
<joey> like it was like, they made it out. </joey>
<joey> Like it was way more serious </joey>
<connor> and like a big issue than it was. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, bro, it's
literally talking to people. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - What do you, what do you </joey>
<joey> how is this not second nature to you? </joey>
<connor> - You know, struggled to
socialize, but acting as </connor>
<connor> if like your life has just
been flipped upside down </connor>
<connor> and it's going to take so much readjusting </connor>
<connor> like you'd like to get over this. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, bro </connor>
<joey> - It's not like you're
trying to learn a language </joey>
<connor> that you stopped learning after work. </connor>
<joey> - Maybe shouldn't take, I don't know. </joey>
<joey> It could be a shitty take. </joey>
<connor> I, I was just like, what am I done? </connor>
<joey> - Well, you're obviously not part of that. </joey>
<joey> Right. There's a hashtag rolling </joey>
<connor> - I know am quite extroverted. </connor>
<connor> And I obviously can't sympathize </connor>
<connor> 100% with introvert problems. </connor>
<connor> He, he XD hashtag. </connor>
<joey> But like, you know, I
mean, to me, I was like </joey>
<joey> it kind of seemed like they
were trying to make it. </joey>
<joey> Like, I don't know. </joey>
<connor> Cause sometimes Twitter
does this where it's like </connor>
<connor> guys, guys, I have a problem, guys. </connor>
<connor> I need to tell you about my problem guys. </connor>
<joey> Please come on. </joey>
<joey> - I, I believe that I
believe that's called first </joey>
<joey> world problems where
it's like, the woe is me. </joey>
<garnt> - Well, I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> Like I can, </garnt>
<garnt> I can kind of understand. </garnt>
<garnt> But at the same time </garnt>
<garnt> how is it gonna be diff
like how are you gonna </garnt>
<garnt> how is that much different
from what you were like before? </garnt>
<connor> Like what's normal. </connor>
<connor> That's what I mean. </connor>
<connor> It's like, no </connor>
<joey> one's going to force you to
go outside after the pandemic. </joey>
<garnt> If anything, people are
probably about just go back </garnt>
<garnt> to being, we'll just go
back to the situation </garnt>
<connor> with people who are
choosing to be inside rather </connor>
<garnt> than taking a flight, going on a plane. </garnt>
<garnt> - Its like, If you will, </garnt>
<garnt> if you loved being inside
before the pandemic </garnt>
<connor> you're probably still going to be </connor>
<connor> inside after the pandemic. </connor>
<garnt> Let's be real. </garnt>
<garnt> No, it's like the police
aren't gonna come and be like </garnt>
<garnt> all right, you've been in
this room for too long. </garnt>
<garnt> All right. Get the fuck out. </garnt>
<connor> You gotta, you gotta </connor>
<connor> - He's missed your mouth. </connor>
<joey> It's been there. </joey>
<garnt> - I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> Do you think there are
going to be any big changes </garnt>
<garnt> once this pandemic safe? </garnt>
<garnt> Or are we just going to be like, huh? </garnt>
<garnt> That was a funny thing that
happened last year, right? </garnt>
<joey> I mean like in terms of
Japan, like, you know </joey>
<joey> because we're already such a
bomb, Japan, we're going to </joey>
<joey> stop wearing masks. </joey>
<joey> Now. Why? </joey>
<joey> Because before, you know,
it was still a socially </joey>
<joey> accepted norm for people
to wear masks, but not </joey>
<joey> everyone wore masks. </joey>
<joey> And now I feel like now it's
going to be so deeply ingrained </joey>
<joey> in the culture that I feel like 90 to 80% </joey>
<garnt> of people are just going
to be permanently masks. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yeah, of course. </garnt>
<joey> I mean, you know, like
people already wear masks </joey>
<connor> see you like, you know, during </connor>
<connor> especially this time of
year where like, you know </connor>
<connor> hay fever because you
know that kind of stuff. </connor>
<connor> And then, you know </connor>
<joey> you have like the influenza season in like </joey>
<joey> November where people are
getting sick all the time </joey>
<joey> everyone's wearing a mask and it's like </joey>
<joey> is your face a little
bit cold, wear a mask? </joey>
<garnt> - Do you know what I'm hoping? </garnt>
<garnt> And I think it's gonna
happen and I'm happy for it. </garnt>
<joey> People are gonna take care of the hygiene </joey>
<joey> during conventions. </joey>
<joey> That's good. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> - That's a total order. </joey>
<joey> I am hopeful that a global
pandemic will make nerds </joey>
<joey> care more about that hygiene
during a big social gathering. </joey>
<joey> I, I might, I might be
too hopeful for this. </joey>
<joey> I might be judged for this. </joey>
<garnt> - I feel, you know what? </garnt>
<joey> I feel if anything it's
gonna be like, listen, </joey>
<joey> we were all not gonna get each other sick. </joey>
<joey> Now. We've all, we've all gotten the shot. </joey>
<joey> And I've been, I've been forced to </joey>
<joey> use hand sanitizer and
bathe and wash my hands </joey>
<joey> for fuck far too long. </joey>
<joey> I am gonna go on a bathing strike. </joey>
<connor> - I think I'd like to just see the </connor>
<connor> like the alcohol stay in front. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. Hand sanitizer. </garnt>
<connor> I think if more people would just </connor>
<connor> especially at conventions
where you are shaking hands </connor>
<garnt> with so many fucking people
and you know, you know </garnt>
<connor> maybe wearing more masks </connor>
<connor> in convention does that's
not exactly a bad thing </connor>
<connor> because con flu is just an accepted part. </connor>
<connor> That is an accepted part </connor>
<garnt> of every convention you
go, you go to, right? </garnt>
<joey> - Well, it's more like say
here's the one thing I've never </joey>
<joey> understood about con-flu, right? </joey>
<joey> Like whenever you catch a cold, right. </joey>
<joey> It's usually from someone. </joey>
<joey> Yeah. Who's the fucker who's
going to a con with a cold? </joey>
<connor> - Because I mean, I got it, right? </connor>
<garnt> Like if, if they booked it, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> You've, already paid them off. </connor>
<connor> - You've already paid money. </connor>
<garnt> You've booked your hotel. </garnt>
<joey> Get a cough. </joey>
<joey> - But the least you can do is like, </joey>
<garnt> try and stay as hygienic as possible. </garnt>
<garnt> - Which is why can we,
can we change this please? </garnt>
<joey> - That's what am hoping. </joey>
<garnt> I'm hoping that I go </garnt>
<joey> to the next convention or maybe
like, not just the next one. </joey>
<joey> Cause obviously the next
one is going to be affected. </joey>
<joey> But maybe in like three years time </joey>
<connor> we still got the same
etiquette of, you know </connor>
<joey> if you know, maybe wearing
masks, isn't such a bad thing. </joey>
<joey> - Wear a mask, use hand
sanitizer, people having </joey>
<joey> hand sanitizers just like
easily readily available. </joey>
<joey> Like if I'm just like, Oh shit, </joey>
<joey> does anyone have any hand sanitizer? </joey>
<connor> And like three people </connor>
<connor> around me just be like,
yeah bro, I got your back. </connor>
<joey> I think that's the positive change. </joey>
<joey> Maybe, you know, maybe
the smell can change </joey>
<garnt> but that's fascist hopeful thing. </garnt>
<connor> - Can we make those ones
that like wet your hand </connor>
<garnt> to oblivion illegal? </garnt>
<connor> You know the ones when you
get it and it's just like </connor>
<connor> oil has been dropped on your hand. </connor>
<connor> That shit should be illegal. </connor>
<joey> - Where it's like way too sticky. </joey>
<joey> But it's like sticky. </joey>
<joey> - It's it's like, feels like </joey>
<joey> it's been hydrated to like 1000%. </joey>
<joey> Like its fucking weird. </joey>
<joey> Like why do they keep buying this shit? </joey>
<joey> Stop making them. </joey>
<garnt> - That's the potent, dude. </garnt>
<garnt> - Is it really though? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - I like the feeling of that one </garnt>
<garnt> cause your hands feel
clean because it's like </garnt>
<connor> - 10 in a tango one time and now he wants </connor>
<connor> - Listen, don't knock
it till you try it, bro. </connor>
<garnt> Fingering and tenure. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because like, sometimes you get like </garnt>
<garnt> you go to a restaurant here
and they're like, please </garnt>
<joey> please sign inside your hands. </joey>
<joey> And they give you like
this, they spray it. </joey>
<joey> Like the tiniest spray </joey>
<joey> on you mentally like make
this tiny spray last, like </joey>
<connor> like cover your entire, your Palm </connor>
<joey> before you can stretch it out. </joey>
<joey> And I'm just like, you know
that picture where it's </joey>
<joey> like the door that's
being held by the Cheetos </joey>
<connor> and like the SWAT team
breaking down the door. </connor>
<connor> That's what I feel is
like, when you think of </connor>
<joey> like that piddly little spray
on you and you're like, okay </joey>
<joey> I can see this does nothing </joey>
<garnt> but you're just doing it
because it's like regulations. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh my hand been feel like I've just like </connor>
<connor> dunked it in like a VAT of oil. </connor>
<connor> Like that's what it feels like sometimes. </connor>
<garnt> - I like the feeling
of like, like it's one </garnt>
<garnt> it covers your hands and
you can feel it evaporates. </garnt>
<garnt> So you get like a little
tingly cooling sensation. </garnt>
<joey> - I rather them go overboard
with the hand sanitizer than </joey>
<joey> under board. </joey>
<garnt> - Like I feel, I feel like
it's clean otherwise it is. </garnt>
<joey> It's like fucking sudden.. </joey>
<joey> - I know there is my hands
on the cleanest sanitize. </joey>
<garnt> That's the point of hand sanitizing. </garnt>
<joey> It fucking sanitizes your hand. </joey>
<joey> - That's 0. 1% of germs is clinging on </joey>
<connor> for dear life on my hands right now. </connor>
<garnt> - I just prefer to use
like soap, I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> I like the </garnt>
<garnt> - Phrase. You can't soap your hands. </garnt>
<garnt> - You kind of like a restaurant. </garnt>
<connor> You can just be like, all right,
spray a little bit on that. </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna go to the
toilet and clean my hands. </connor>
<garnt> - What?
- What? </garnt>
<connor> - So much more effort. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah but I like that is
the least optimize thing. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. Coming from a man who
optimizes everything in his life </connor>
<connor> - Aren't inherently an
optimized experiences so much. </connor>
<garnt> - Imagine the cue to the toilet. </garnt>
<connor> If that, if that was just
norm, not everyone could be </connor>
<connor> large brained like myself, you know. </connor>
<connor> - shut up. </connor>
<joey> Just shut up. </joey>
<joey> - What you have to do is buy this gel. </joey>
<connor> It sanitize your hands. </connor>
<garnt> - More like a strips your skin. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know why. </garnt>
<joey> You know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> - We gas up a Domus
apparently it is my weekend. </joey>
<connor> I love it when I could feel my bone. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. Cause some people know, some people </connor>
<garnt> some people just have
like really sweaty hands </garnt>
<joey> and it feels like, you know, that spray </joey>
<joey> that spray does nothing. </joey>
<connor> Some people need that sweater. </connor>
<garnt> Your hands. </garnt>
<joey> No, not my hands. </joey>
<joey> My hands are like, it's
the one that you handshake </joey>
<joey> at a con it's it's the moisture. </joey>
<garnt> It's the moist. </garnt>
<garnt> He fell to the moist hand for some reason. </garnt>
<garnt> The moist hand always cold as fuck. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing loudly) </garnt>
<garnt> It's like you feel the moistness </garnt>
<joey> you're literally a cold, wet fish. </joey>
<garnt> That's all it feels like. </garnt>
<joey> That's what, </joey>
<joey> - it feels like grabbing like a dead fish. </joey>
<joey> Right. And going to a
supermarket and like seeing one </joey>
<joey> of those fish in the fish
section, just grabbing it. </joey>
<joey> That's what it feels like. </joey>
<garnt> It is gross. </garnt>
<garnt> And you can never shake </garnt>
<joey> that feeling off after
it's like off your hand. </joey>
<garnt> - Apologies to anyone who
has cold wet hands, but </garnt>
<garnt> - Cold hands. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. A sham to shaking their fish </connor>
<garnt> at home and shaking their fish home. </garnt>
<joey> - How can we talking
about finding Nemo and? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. I mean, I would like to see </joey>
<connor> that from future columns,
but I mean, it's really </connor>
<joey> it's just a matter, when is the future? </joey>
<connor> - I have no interest in
going to digital conventions. </connor>
<connor> I couldn't think of a more boring thing. </connor>
<garnt> - It's just sad to me. </garnt>
<connor> Like they got to keep, they gotta do it. </connor>
<connor> But to me, to me, it
doesn't, it doesn't make me </connor>
<garnt> feel happy that they're
doing digital dimension. </garnt>
<garnt> It just makes me feel sad . </garnt>
<connor> - Unless I'm staying in
a scuffed hotel room, </connor>
<connor> that's fucked up from
every all everyone's shit. </connor>
<connor> Like it's just not the same. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> Its kinda the same as
like virtual concerts. </joey>
<connor> Like well, </connor>
<connor> that 411 was pretty cool
with like Travis Scott </connor>
<joey> did a whole thing for it though. </joey>
<joey> That's like a different experience </joey>
<joey> different experience
with like someone on zoom </joey>
<connor> just dancing in front of the
webcam being like, you know. </connor>
<connor> Hmm. </connor>
<joey> - Did you see the one that
post Malone did for Pokemon? </joey>
<joey> No. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> Post-mortem so like Pokemon
just recently announced, Oh </joey>
<joey> well pastor 25th anniversary
this year and post the Pokemon </joey>
<joey> the official Pokemon YouTube
channel did a virtual concert </joey>
<joey> with post melon and it is weird. </joey>
<joey> It is weird as fuck. </joey>
<garnt> - Did Pokemon reach out to post Malone </garnt>
<joey> or was that what it was like? </joey>
<joey> It was like, literally
like, think of, think </joey>
<garnt> of like the Travis Scott, the
least family friendly kind </garnt>
<garnt> of image you could go for
that I expect from Nintendo. </garnt>
<joey> It was this clip on Twitter
that went viral where </joey>
<joey> like one of the lyrics
to like post Malone song. </joey>
<joey> Like obviously, you know,
like a lot of your songs </joey>
<connor> you know, he swears and
writes, so they censored it. </connor>
<connor> But I guess they forgot to send </connor>
<connor> to this one line where he was like </connor>
<connor> it was just the sex though. </connor>
<joey> The sex though me, while this Lucia flying </joey>
<connor> in the test and learn
rapping, it was like, yeah. </connor>
<connor> So like he, they had like
the, the virtual model </connor>
<connor> of post Malone, but again,
it's like an, a Pokemon way. </connor>
<connor> Not even it's like, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> He was kind of halfway </connor>
<joey> between a Pokemon model and
just like a regular 3D model. </joey>
<joey> Okay. And it was really fucking weird </joey>
<joey> and especially weird
because like, when you think </joey>
<joey> of Pokemon and you think
of modern pop stars </joey>
<joey> post Malone is not the
first person you think. </joey>
<joey> - No. Right. </joey>
<joey> - And yet he, yeah </joey>
<joey> it was really weird just
being like at the end </joey>
<joey> of the concert, he's like,
thank you, Pokemon fans. </joey>
<joey> I love Pokemon. </joey>
<joey> - How did I not see that? </joey>
<joey> - I'm surprised you guys didn't see it </joey>
<joey> - Its like Kanye West
going on the Disney channel </joey>
<joey> like all these bitches. </joey>
<joey> (laughing loudly) </joey>
<joey> - You're such a fucking whore, </joey>
<garnt> I love it. </garnt>
<garnt> Thank you Disney. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like sometimes you just
see news nowadays and like </garnt>
<joey> you can't tell if it's
real when you use or just </joey>
<joey> a meme anymore. </joey>
<joey> Like the real news is the meme. Nowadays. </joey>
<garnt> Sometimes like post Malone and Pokemon. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, I like post Malone,
but it was just a very strange </joey>
<joey> like, I dunno if I enjoy
the very odd comment combo </joey>
<garnt> especially, especially
coming from Nintendo as well. </garnt>
<garnt> One of was tightening. </garnt>
<joey> I mean, it was, it was good. </joey>
<connor> Like if you're a post Malone or pear fan, </connor>
<connor> then it was like cool. </connor>
<connor> I don't know about like
Pokemon fans, but I mean </connor>
<connor> I saw it was like pretty
positively received. </connor>
<joey> So I mean good on postmark </joey>
<connor> - Pokemon, AMV to post Malone's music. </connor>
<connor> I don't even know </connor>
<joey> Like it wasn't a long concert either. </joey>
<joey> It was maybe about </joey>
<joey> You know, like 15, 20 minutes. </joey>
<joey> Maybe like he played, you
know, he maybe did like three </joey>
<joey> or four songs </joey>
<connor> - So where could you watch this? </connor>
<joey> It was on Twitter. </joey>
<joey> It's on the poker. </joey>
<joey> It's on the official
Pokemon YouTube channel. </joey>
<joey> Like if you look up post
Malone, Pokemon concert, </joey>
<joey> it'll come up. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. I just want to be in
my room, attending an event. </connor>
<garnt> - There's just something about the energy </garnt>
<connor> of having a crowd there </connor>
<joey> That's just that, that
you need that energy. </joey>
<garnt> It's, it's something
that you can't kind of </garnt>
<joey> like sadder than a virtual mosh pit. </joey>
<joey> That sounds so depressing. </joey>
<garnt> Oh my God. </garnt>
<joey> I'm just imagine what's
the virtual MOSFET. </joey>
<joey> It's just Twitch chat going insane. </joey>
<joey> Right? That's a virtual Marsh. </joey>
<joey> It's like, it's the same. </joey>
<joey> I love Twitch chat. </joey>
<joey> - I love interacting and I love streaming </joey>
<joey> but the second about it, when
it was supposed to be live. </joey>
<joey> Yeah. In-person when it goes to Twitch </joey>
<joey> it's just feels weird or weird. </joey>
<joey> I don't even know why
I'm like conventions. </joey>
<connor> I just think </connor>
<connor> aren't experience you inherently
just cannot experience. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, you go to
convention for the people </garnt>
<garnt> for the atmosphere. </garnt>
<connor> Otherwise everyone would be
going on their discord servers </connor>
<connor> and talking about animating cringey. </connor>
<joey> - Right? Exactly. </joey>
<connor> You go to be cringing and
person meet other cringy people. </connor>
<joey> It was like the whole reason
why you go to like concerts. </joey>
<connor> All right. </connor>
<connor> It's like, it's it's of
course to see whoever you're </connor>
<joey> seeing live, but it's also to
fucking see it with people. </joey>
<garnt> - There's something different
about seeing, you know </garnt>
<garnt> seeing a bland live as
opposed with other people </garnt>
<joey> as opposed to seeing it, you
know, listening to the album </joey>
<joey> or seeing music videos on my that. </joey>
<connor> There's just, there's just
an energy you can't capture </connor>
<connor> if you're watching it through a screen. </connor>
<connor> And I mean, that's, that's why I get why </connor>
<joey> people have to do virtual
events and everything </joey>
<joey> but I'm kind of, I'm kind
of, I just want to attend </joey>
<joey> I miss concerts. </joey>
<joey> I miss crowds. </joey>
<joey> And I never thought I would miss crowds. </joey>
<joey> Cause like, I hate crowds
so much, but like even like </joey>
<joey> it's not just even being
there in a crowd, but just </joey>
<joey> seeing an event and just
hearing that crowd scream </joey>
<joey> there's just something special. </joey>
<joey> There's just something
that brings the hype to it. </joey>
<joey> Like I get that. </joey>
<joey> I get that like the most
recent, like the most </joey>
<connor> recent event I can think of
is a league of legends worlds. </connor>
<connor> Right. Normally I'm like
super, super hype for worlds. </connor>
<connor> Cause as you would be for
any other sporting events </connor>
<connor> but there was just something
about seeing this game </connor>
<connor> play that just didn't have
the crowd role behind it. </connor>
<garnt> That just made it feel like
you were just watching a </garnt>
<garnt> Thailand one stream or
something like that. </garnt>
<connor> - Like watching an online tournament. </connor>
<garnt> Yeah. I remember the players,
they were saying as well. </garnt>
<joey> They were like, yeah, it's
not the same without a crowd. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, of course you get a win. </joey>
<connor> You know, when the crowd </connor>
<garnt> - When someone makes a amazing play </garnt>
<connor> and you hear the roar,
there's just something special </connor>
<connor> about that. </connor>
<connor> That even though I'm not there in person. </connor>
<connor> Cause I've, I've been to,
you know, I've been there </connor>
<connor> in person and the energy
there is fucking incredible. </connor>
<connor> But even just capturing a bit
of that energy and putting </connor>
<connor> like, just hearing that
crowd scream it's it's, it's </connor>
<joey> it's something that can't be replicated. </joey>
<joey> And like I know, and I
the I think it was China </joey>
<joey> that tried adding like that
tried the cans laughter effect </joey>
<joey> where they, they, they
added fake crowds attacks. </joey>
<connor> Yeah. So what to the legal legends. </connor>
<joey> Yeah. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> I think so. </joey>
<joey> I heard like, someone's
probably going to fact check </joey>
<connor> and call me out on this,
but I think I heard that. </connor>
<connor> And that just sound... </connor>
<connor> - I wouldn't be surprised </connor>
<garnt> - That sounds even
worse ,if they did that. </garnt>
<connor> - Just the Friends fucking
like soundtrack starts playing. </connor>
<joey> A sound base just comes in like </joey>
<joey> (chuckles) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. Because like, I remember like </joey>
<joey> you know, cause February
just passed and like </joey>
<joey> I love watching like the swimmer </joey>
<joey> and the Sumo season is
like during the winter. </joey>
<joey> Yeah. So just finished,
but like, of course </joey>
<joey> because it's a pandemic,
you can't have people </joey>
<joey> in the tiny, you know,
stadium watching the Summa. </joey>
<joey> So like, yeah. </joey>
<joey> It was really sad to see
this like massive Sumo </joey>
<joey> stadium only having maybe
like four people in it. </joey>
<joey> And it's just like, and you know </joey>
<joey> obviously after every wind, right. </joey>
<connor> Usually the crowd, you know </connor>
<connor> like claps or like cheers or something. </connor>
<connor> But instead it's like, someone
does this like Epic win </connor>
<garnt> and like three people are clapping. </garnt>
<garnt> It just sounds </garnt>
<garnt> like a cow just feels
like the zero stakes. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. If you can't hear anyone. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. It was really
interesting because the swimmer </garnt>
<joey> they were all wearing masks
before they got on stage. </joey>
<joey> It it's just funny seeing
them like, all right, we have </joey>
<joey> we have these precautions,
they take their masks off </joey>
<connor> they step up </connor>
<connor> and immediately just
put that faces together. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, yes. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. I don't know. </connor>
<joey> I don't know about this. </joey>
<joey> socially distanced. </joey>
<connor> (laughing loudly) </connor>
<connor> I don't give a shit. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. I'm just like,
you know, you pick one. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - It is funny how crowds can
play into sporting event hype </garnt>
<garnt> because I, so I've been
recommended a lot of, like </garnt>
<connor> since we did the chess
tournament, I've been </connor>
<garnt> like rec been recommended
way more chess clips </garnt>
<connor> and been watching my chest streamers </connor>
<connor> like Hikaru and everything like that. </connor>
<garnt> And there's just like,
there's just something </garnt>
<connor> about the image of had about
chess before that was boring. </connor>
<connor> And I feel a big part </connor>
<garnt> of that was just how bored everyone looks </garnt>
<garnt> in any big chess crowds. Right? </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, it's like people
playing a chess till one, </garnt>
<connor> during a coughing, coughing events </connor>
<garnt> and whatever, whatever, what I realized. </garnt>
<garnt> I like one thing I've realized </garnt>
<garnt> about how we could like have the </garnt>
<garnt> the image could be easily changed </garnt>
<garnt> was always recommended this
other events, like clips </garnt>
<garnt> of this other event
where it's just a bunch </garnt>
<garnt> of grandmasters who went,
who are just like shooting </garnt>
<garnt> shooting shit and having fun. </garnt>
<garnt> And they weren't like
having team tournament's </garnt>
<garnt> and just like, and like
trash talking each other. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm just like, dude, this
seems like legit fun events. </garnt>
<garnt> And this, this could have easily
changed the image of chess </garnt>
<garnt> which I think it's great. </garnt>
<garnt> Now that the image of chess is
being like slightly changed. </garnt>
<connor> - I no, no, not everyone will
agree with you Garnt there. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, that's, that's my opinion </garnt>
<connor> as a filthy casual chest player. </connor>
<garnt> - GM tweeted out being like, man </garnt>
<connor> it's such a shame that chess
is going in this direction. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And then everyone was just
like not serious direction </joey>
<joey> because know chess is a
lot of history behind it. </joey>
<joey> And there's a lot of people
who are like, it's, it's </joey>
<joey> you know, it's, it's big
brain, it's intelligent </joey>
<connor> and it's being watered
down for these common folk. </connor>
<connor> You know? </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, you are, you
are like an ex you know </garnt>
<joey> you've played chess for your country </joey>
<garnt> but how do you feel about it? </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, it doesn't really seem </garnt>
<joey> like you had that like purist view on it. </joey>
<connor> - Cause like I hated it because
like when I was doing it, </connor>
<connor> it was a bunch of, you
know, 60 year old white men </connor>
<connor> who would just be in charge
of everything and they talked </connor>
<connor> about it. </connor>
<connor> Like, you were like the night's God. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. Culture like that. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. Cause they, you know,
it was taken very seriously </connor>
<connor> in the UK and the history
behind it is like very long </connor>
<connor> and you know, whatnot. </connor>
<connor> But you know, I don't give a fuck. </connor>
<connor> I mean, you know, if, if, if the sports </connor>
<joey> you know, wants to have more
funding and be more popular, </joey>
<joey> I think it's a good thing
people get into chess. </joey>
<joey> I mean, yeah it's a good game. </joey>
<joey> I think that it's, you know,
one of the, probably the bad </joey>
<connor> better games your kid can get into. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. I mean, it's kind of
evolved to get with the times. </joey>
<connor> Right. And pure always. </connor>
<joey> Yeah. Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - You know, unfortunately
chess is probably </connor>
<joey> on its own, a bit boring. </joey>
<joey> Yeah. Let's be honest. Right? </joey>
<joey> Like I play it. </joey>
<connor> I could say that, but I think, you know, </connor>
<connor> adding these tournaments </connor>
<connor> that don't really take away anything </connor>
<connor> from the pro scene, you
know, if it gets yeah. </connor>
<connor> You know, if you look at
chess viewership on Twitch </connor>
<connor> you know, outside of like Polk
champs and stuff like that </connor>
<connor> the big chest dreamers
viewership has grown a lot. </connor>
<garnt> - How many street, how many
viewers does he carry again? </garnt>
<connor> - 25k. </connor>
<connor> - And it's, it's fucking great </connor>
<garnt> because before you literally
could not make money </garnt>
<garnt> play like playing chess. </garnt>
<garnt> - So many big chest streamers now. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah. And it's really Epic, Epic wine. </garnt>
<joey> Its pretty epic </joey>
<joey> That like, you know, </joey>
<garnt> there's room for like many chess streams </garnt>
<garnt> to make a living off this </garnt>
<garnt> and stream it and you know, </garnt>
<connor> and it makes sense. Right? </connor>
<connor> Like, </connor>
<connor> - It's really taught
me how important images </connor>
<garnt> in regards to like a
sports and stuff like that. </garnt>
<connor> Because you have to, you know,
there's, there's, there's </connor>
<connor> you know, you've got to respect the legacy </connor>
<connor> and the history and stuff
like that, but you get </connor>
<connor> to a point where it's a
modernized, it needs to modernize. </connor>
<connor> And these catch up with the times and I've </connor>
<connor> it's great because I've gotten way more </connor>
<connor> into chess simply because
it just, it just looks fun. </connor>
<connor> It looks way more fun. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. I mean, there's like,
like stuff like, you know </connor>
<joey> everyone thinks of sports,
like rules don't change. </joey>
<joey> Yeah. Like rules, like secret </joey>
<joey> but like stuff like basketball </joey>
<joey> I'm pretty sure that the
NBA changes the rules </joey>
<joey> have changed the rules a few times based </joey>
<joey> on what makes us more
fun viewing experiences. </joey>
<joey> Yeah. So it begs the question is </joey>
<joey> like what's more important
the sport or the audience? </joey>
<joey> Yeah. And so I think chess is </joey>
<joey> at that crossroads where
there's obviously people who </joey>
<joey> have been training their whole
life to be pros and whatnot. </joey>
<joey> And obviously, yeah, it sucks </joey>
<joey> that maybe your sport
is a little less serious </joey>
<joey> but on the other hand </joey>
<joey> you have way more opportunities,
way more money, you know </joey>
<connor> way more chance to have a
platform and do whatever you want </connor>
<connor> and be on the sidelines
being salty about it. </connor>
<joey> You're probably going to
be the one left behind. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. It's, it's, it's a
balance at the end of the day. </connor>
<joey> Right. You can't go too
far in either direction. </joey>
<garnt> - I feel, I, I feel that </garnt>
<garnt> like I remember when he carried got signed </garnt>
<joey> up for TSM and I was just
like, Holy shit, this is cool. </joey>
<joey> This is a park. </joey>
<joey> That is a like, like just,
just like imagine, imagine </joey>
<joey> if we had a chess tournament
where people showed up </joey>
<joey> in like e-sports gowns and
e-sports shots and stuff </joey>
<garnt> like that, that would be
pretty high for my opinion. </garnt>
<garnt> But obviously I'm a
filthy casual don't play. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't play chess out of
anything, but just casually. </garnt>
<garnt> So that's, that's just my opinion. </garnt>
<garnt> - I totally forgot. </garnt>
<connor> I played in chess tournament. </connor>
<connor> Like last week. </connor>
<connor> I totally forgot. </connor>
<connor> I did that. </connor>
<joey> Yeah. It was fine. </joey>
<connor> I mean, I had like one hour
sleep, so it's pretty brutal. </connor>
<connor> And I had to film, like I have
to go to somebody's phone. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, you say that </connor>
<garnt> but you're like, no,
knowing your schedule. </garnt>
<garnt> I kind of like, I was like kind of you are </garnt>
<joey> you're a Dick to apex back then. </joey>
<joey> Yeah. Still kind of did it to yourself. </joey>
<connor> - Oh I did. </connor>
<connor> I just, you don't you
just say yes to something </connor>
<joey> and you're like, you don't
really think about like how </joey>
<joey> it will actually fit into your schedule. </joey>
<connor> It's just sounds cool. </connor>
<joey> - Until it happens. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. So I got invited to
Twitch Rivals, which was like, </connor>
<connor> they wanted to do like a chess tournament </connor>
<connor> where you get padded
like a GM or something </connor>
<joey> and they tell you </joey>
<joey> which piece to move and
you have to choose which </joey>
<joey> of that piece. </joey>
<connor> If they say pawn, you
choose which of the eight </connor>
<connor> Pawns to move. </connor>
<joey> Right. And so it's pretty fun. </joey>
<joey> I mean, yeah. </joey>
<joey> I haven't played chess
since our tournament. </joey>
<joey> Yeah. So I was pretty
rusty and I'll see, not </joey>
<joey> having much sleep. </joey>
<joey> And so, yeah. </joey>
<joey> But it was good fun. </joey>
<joey> I like doing it. </joey>
<joey> It's fun. </joey>
<joey> I like playing chess, but
it's really annoying how </joey>
<joey> like there's some comments
as well that like bro Cornell </joey>
<joey> wasn't it kind of in play for? </joey>
<joey> Like when he was a kid, that's a lie. </joey>
<connor> He says now. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, bro, if you didn't play </connor>
<joey> for like seven years and
you played now, I bet </joey>
<joey> you probably wouldn't be out of that. </joey>
<joey> - You haven't heard of a gap? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. And also I think I'm
pretty like the same level </joey>
<joey> or pretty better as a child than I am now. </joey>
<joey> Yeah. We had to say </joey>
<joey> - I mean, it's the same logic. </joey>
<connor> It's like all you want
the quadratic equation </connor>
<connor> during school and you can't do it now. </connor>
<connor> You didn't learn it. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's also like, people
think like, you know </connor>
<connor> how good do you think that like 12 </connor>
<connor> 11 year olds are at this game? </connor>
<connor> I mean, there's some exceptions of amazing </connor>
<joey> - There was so many Magnus castles </joey>
<connor> right? Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And I was like, bro, I was
like the worst on my team. </connor>
<garnt> Just sneaked in. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like I remember when I was
talking about, you know, my </garnt>
<garnt> my masters and I was like, explain to you. </garnt>
<garnt> I couldn't remember what
equation I was talking about. </garnt>
<connor> It was second order
differential equations. </connor>
<connor> I remember that now. </connor>
<connor> And I kind of says, is it
integral you're thinking of? </connor>
<connor> And I guess I was like, </connor>
<connor> yeah I guess I was thinking integer. </connor>
<connor> - I should know too as well </connor>
<connor> cause I also have it in
engineering department. </connor>
<connor> And there was so many comments like, </connor>
<connor> Garnts wouldn't have written , </connor>
<garnt> Garnt didn't pass his masters. </garnt>
<garnt> Couldn't even remember that. </garnt>
<connor> Jesus Christ. </connor>
<connor> - If you don't use something,
surprisingly you forget it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. You'll have to understand that. </connor>
<joey> A lot of times during this podcast </joey>
<joey> a lot of us are just brain dead. </joey>
<joey> We're just, we're just chatting. </joey>
<connor> It's just like that. </connor>
<joey> - You know, it's the whole
vibe of the show where </joey>
<joey> we just talk, we don't
really plan anything. </joey>
<joey> None of the topics ever
planned beforehand, we just </joey>
<connor> we just kind of shoot the shit. </connor>
<connor> - We didn't plan to go into </connor>
<connor> the monsters topics of engineering. </connor>
<connor> - I'm sure, </connor>
<connor> If I applied for an engineering
job, I'm more qualified </connor>
<connor> than someone who is like,
hasn't got the degree </connor>
<connor> but might be studying that thing. </connor>
<connor> He probably knows more than
me at this current time. </connor>
<connor> But because I haven't done
anything for like three years. </connor>
<joey> Fuck I don't know. </joey>
<connor> - I mean, you </connor>
<joey> - Forget, you forget
it, forgot everything. </joey>
<connor> - I finally understand it at the time </connor>
<connor> but that's the thing I feel </connor>
<connor> like now I finally understand how </connor>
<joey> like my parents felt when
I would like go to them </joey>
<joey> and being like, can you help
me with this math equation? </joey>
<connor> It's like, you, you
finished school. Right? </connor>
<connor> You've done this before. </connor>
<connor> And my parents were like, I
don't know how to do this. </connor>
<joey> I'm like, what do you mean? </joey>
<joey> You don't know how you did this in school? </joey>
<joey> - I think, I can't even remember </joey>
<garnt> like having passed my
master's in engineering. </garnt>
<joey> I probably can't remember </joey>
<garnt> how to do basic trigonometry now. </garnt>
<garnt> - Dude if someone came </garnt>
<connor> with like some 10 year old
came up to me and was like </connor>
<garnt> can you help me solve this
long division equation? </garnt>
<joey> I'd be like fuck. </joey>
<joey> I don't know how the fuck to do this. </joey>
<connor> - I'd probably research real quick. </connor>
<joey> Am sure I can get the answer to you. </joey>
<garnt> - Let me Google it real quick. </garnt>
<joey> Like I totally get that now. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, because I remember
as a kid, you're just like, </garnt>
<connor> "how can you not know this? </connor>
<connor> You're an adult. </connor>
<connor> You know, everything you
learned this before." </connor>
<garnt> - You know how see the
fucking like Facebook quizzes </garnt>
<connor> that pop up, they're like you know, </connor>
<connor> it'd be like different tanks of water. </connor>
<connor> It'll be like, which
one will fill up first. </connor>
<connor> But that was like, literally
like part of my fluids exam. </connor>
<joey> We had stuff like that. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, </joey>
<joey> back in the day I'm sure
I can answer that too. </joey>
<joey> But right now I got no fucking idea </joey>
<joey> because I don't remember what
the fuck it was all about. </joey>
<joey> All right. </joey>
<connor> Well, I guess we have nothing else to talk </connor>
<connor> about today, boys. </connor>
<connor> So handed off to you, the host Garnt. </connor>
<garnt> - Or we just, we just, </garnt>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I can't remember how we ended up. </connor>
<connor> - I'm satisfied. </connor>
<connor> - I've seen enough Trash Taste time. </connor>
<connor> Am satisfied. </connor>
<connor> - To the patreons. </connor>
<connor> - I've talked enough. </connor>
<connor> I'm satisfied. </connor>

if your head, our face. </joey>
<garnt> - I just feel like Joey
does it so much better </garnt>
<garnt> than either of us, because he's just </garnt>
<garnt> like ingrained that
into, up into his head. </garnt>
<garnt> - I literally just like mentally. </garnt>
<connor> I just like press a button on a place. </connor>
<connor> - I just choose not to. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, Joey does it for me
every time and I'm just laying </garnt>
<garnt> and I just, just let,
just let Joey don't do it. </garnt>
<joey> - Hey man don't fix something
that isn't broken, you know? </joey>
<garnt> - Yes. Do everything that Joey says. </garnt>
<joey> And did, you mentioned </joey>
<garnt> that we have a Twitch channel as well? </garnt>

<joey> We haven't mentioned that. </joey>
<joey> We have a third channel now. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh yeah. </garnt>
<joey> Trash Taste After Dark. </joey>
<joey> It used to be unofficial. </joey>
<joey> And now it's official. </joey>
<joey> I know that confused a lot of people. </joey>
<garnt> - It's, it's very, it's very confusing </garnt>
<garnt> because there are some
channels out there that aren't </garnt>
<garnt> official and there are
some channels out there </garnt>
<garnt> that are official. </garnt>
<joey> I mean, we were like, let's
set the record straight. </joey>
<garnt> We have three channels. </garnt>
<garnt> We have this one that you're currently on. </garnt>
<joey> We have Trash Taste Highlights </joey>
<joey> and we have Trash Taste After Dark. </joey>
<joey> Anything else is unofficial. </joey>
<joey> - Where we will be
uploading our Twitch stream. </joey>
<connor> Basically after dark is literally </connor>
<garnt> just a VOD of outage, Twitch streams. </garnt>
<joey> - You know, there might
be other like, you know </joey>
<joey> bullshit content as well. </joey>
<joey> But for the time being
all of the Twitch Fords. </joey>
<joey> Oh yeah, by the way, follow
us on Twitter as well. </joey>
<joey> At Trash Taste podcast, </joey>
<joey> we'll be doing like semi-regular string. </joey>
<joey> I don't fucking know. </joey>
<joey> I don't know. </joey>
<connor> We have some stream ideas, no
promises, but it's just there. </connor>
<joey> - Just follow us there </joey>
<connor> - Anyway. That's it. </connor>
<garnt> Connor has been very tied today. </garnt>

<connor> And then I'm just like, bro hit me. </connor>
<garnt> - This is, this is how I've
seen you for the past week. </garnt>
<joey> Kinda of has been addicted to
apex for like the past month. </joey>
<joey> And every time I see him,
he doesn't just do himself. </joey>
<joey> Every time I see him, he </joey>
<joey> he just comes in and be like, guys </joey>
<connor> I was streaming till like 4:00 a.m. </connor>
<connor> - I wasn't streaming yesterday. </connor>
<garnt> I'm just tired. </garnt>
<connor> (laughing loudly) </connor>
<garnt> - Most of the time he doesn't even stream. </garnt>
<joey> He just plays and I'm just like fine. </joey>
