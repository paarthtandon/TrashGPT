<joey> - As you were talking earlier, </joey>
<garnt> I could literally see a giant bead of sweat. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's because I've got the fucking sun staring at me, </garnt>
<garnt> and we don't even fucking have the AC on. </garnt>
<connor> - [Connor] The price that we, you know- </connor>
<garnt> - [Joey] Evian water spray. </garnt>
<joey> Let's go! </joey>
<garnt> (chill music plays) </garnt>
<garnt> - Hello and welcome to another episode of "Trash Taste." </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know what episode number this is anymore </garnt>
<garnt> because it's probably gonna be out of order anyway. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm your host for today, Garnt, </garnt>
<garnt> and joining me once again are the boys. </garnt>
<garnt> You know who they are. </garnt>
<garnt> - What are you wearing, Garnt? </garnt>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, it's summer now, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> I need to bring the summer energy, okay? </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like channeling every dad during a barbecue right now. </garnt>
<joey> - You look like if Trevor from GTA V got a tan. </joey>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Like a dad with one too many camera lenses. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> And you're like, </connor>
<connor> ooh, I don't know what he's getting up to with these lenses. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> - Dad that goes "bird watching." </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Do you really need a 500 millimeter lens </connor>
<connor> that's like this long? </connor>
<connor> Like, is there a, come on. </connor>
<connor> - Plays GTA Vice City once, okay, I've got it now. </connor>
<connor> - Goes to Miami once. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<joey> - But how are you guys like surviving Japanese summer? </joey>
<joey> Like, how hot is it today? </joey>
<garnt> Jesus. </garnt>
<joey> - It's like 35, I think. </joey>
<joey> Or yesterday was 35. </joey>
<joey> - You know what? </joey>
<connor> Let me start off with something. </connor>
<connor> I hate it when you can't complain about the weather </connor>
<connor> where you're from. </connor>
<connor> It's like, you know- </connor>
<connor> - What? </connor>
<connor> - I said on Twitter, I was like, </connor>
<connor> "I can't, I'm dying, man. </connor>
<garnt> "It's 35 degrees." </garnt>
<connor> And then someone replies, like (scoffs) "It's like 42 here." </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, that is not something to be proud of. </connor>
<connor> You live in a fucking, like, the actual sun. </connor>
<garnt> Like, why are you bragging? </garnt>
<connor> - I fuckin' hate that shit. </connor>
<garnt> Like, no matter how hot it is where you are, </garnt>
<garnt> and you could be fucking dying in the Sahara Desert </garnt>
<garnt> or something, you get to like the nearest town. </garnt>
<garnt> You're like, "Fuck, man, I just survived the Sahara." </garnt>
<garnt> And someone from Texas or somewhere would be like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh, how hot was it? </garnt>
<garnt> "How hot was it?" </garnt>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> - "You didn't measure it? </connor>
<connor> "You didn't measure it? </connor>
<connor> "Why didn't you measure it? </connor>
<garnt> "Is it hotter where I am? </garnt>
<garnt> "You little bitch!" </garnt>
<garnt> - No, 'cause what I've realized, okay, </garnt>
<garnt> like living in Japan has made me change my opinion </garnt>
<connor> because before- </connor>
<connor> - On what? </connor>
<connor> - Okay, so before moving to Japan </connor>
<connor> or before like moving out- </connor>
<connor> - Something totally unrelated. </connor>
<connor> - Actually it's not totally unrelated </connor>
<connor> 'cause before moving to Japan or moving out of England, </connor>
<garnt> my favorite season was summer, okay? </garnt>
<joey> I was the summer kid. </joey>
<connor> - We've discussed this in the podcast before </connor>
<garnt> and we were like- </garnt>
<garnt> - Have we? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, or maybe it was just off camera. </connor>
<connor> - I think it was off camera. </connor>
<connor> - But I remember we were like talking about, </connor>
<garnt> 'cause I think you and I both like the winter, </garnt>
<garnt> like much, much more. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, winter's the worst season. </garnt>
<garnt> - Fuck off. </garnt>
<connor> - Winter is the worst season. </connor>
<connor> - Maybe this has just become a conversation </connor>
<connor> that we have every single year the summer turns around. </connor>
<garnt> And everybody's gonna be like, </garnt>
<garnt> "You guys spoke about this already." </garnt>
<connor> I'm like it's in my head, shut up. </connor>
<garnt> - No, because like, I didn't realize that, like, </garnt>
<connor> summers in England are actually pretty good. </connor>
<connor> And that's why summer was my favorite season. </connor>
<joey> - Well, how hot does it get in England? </joey>
<connor> - It's like 25 degrees Celsius. </connor>
<connor> - That's not summer. </connor>
<connor> - That's the thing, right? </connor>
<connor> That's the thing! </connor>
<connor> - No, no, it gets hotter than that, Garnt. </connor>
<garnt> - It gets hotter for like one week. </garnt>
<garnt> - The summer before we left, </garnt>
<connor> yeah, but that one week is pure hell </connor>
<connor> because the UK, we don't have air conditioning. </connor>
<connor> It just doesn't exist </connor>
<joey> in homes. - [Garnt] True. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, the one time I went to the UK, </joey>
<connor> it was during that week. </connor>
<connor> - It's horrible because, you know, </connor>
<connor> at least in Japanese summer, it's like, </connor>
<joey> oh shit, walking outside. </joey>
<joey> Fuck. </joey>
<connor> It's way worse. </connor>
<connor> But you can just go in any building anywhere. </connor>
<connor> And you're like, oh cool. </connor>
<joey> - Just instant hard nip. </joey>
<connor> - They've got the AC running at, like, full blast. </connor>
<joey> Like, it's good. </joey>
<joey> - It's like a fucking tundra inside the building. </joey>
<joey> - You have no escape in the UK. </joey>
<joey> It's like maybe the gym has AC, </joey>
<joey> the supermarket probably has it. </joey>
<joey> But, like, that's it. </joey>
<connor> Like, when you go home, you're like (gasps) </connor>
<connor> "Put on the TV." </connor>
<garnt> (Connor yells) </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, 'cause, like, what do you do to cool down in the UK? </garnt>
<garnt> - Have like nine fans on you. </garnt>
<connor> - So, you do have fans? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, but fans don't do shit. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, fans don't do shit. </connor>
<garnt> - Fans are like- </garnt>
<joey> - Fans just dissipate the hot air. </joey>
<joey> - Fans are placebos. </joey>
<joey> You're like, "Yeah, it's definitely doing something." </joey>
<connor> You're like, "Why am I still sweating so much?" </connor>
<joey> - It doesn't, because all it is is </joey>
<joey> just taking the stagnant hot air and just moving it around. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, occasionally I just like, you go up to it. </connor>
<connor> I put my shirt over the fan, and I'm like, </connor>
<connor> "This is true cooling." </connor>
<garnt> - That's the best feeling though. </garnt>
<connor> Maybe it's a nostalgia thing for me because growing up or </connor>
<connor> like spending my summers in Thailand, </connor>
<connor> you know, in Thailand we would try to save costs </connor>
<connor> as much as possible, you know? </connor>
<connor> So, like the AC is always like the last resort. </connor>
<connor> That's like when we are literally, like, </connor>
<connor> dying of heat stroke. </connor>
<connor> Any other time, it's just like, </connor>
<connor> "Come on, you can survive with the fan." </connor>
<connor> So, like, I spent most of my, like, </connor>
<connor> Thailand experience being cooled down by a fan </connor>
<connor> and AC was just like, "Okay, if we don't put the AC on, </connor>
<connor> "we're probably going to die here." </connor>
<connor> So, it's I think that's why it's, like, </connor>
<connor> kind of nostalgic to me. </connor>
<connor> Like, I kind of like the fan, </connor>
<connor> like, I kinda like the feeling of the fan on me. </connor>
<connor> But I admit like, if you're not used to it, </connor>
<connor> like, I felt sorry when you visited, </connor>
<connor> you and Aki visited us in the UK, </connor>
<connor> 'cause you had to sleep in my room. </connor>
<connor> And we, that was like- </connor>
<connor> - There was one fan in there. </connor>
<connor> - There was a single fan in like my entire house </connor>
<garnt> and we're like, "Joey, you can have the fan." </garnt>
<joey> And I was, like, </joey>
<joey> I don't think it actually did anything for you. </joey>
<joey> - It didn't do anything. </joey>
<joey> I was butt fucking naked in your bed. </joey>
<connor> I'm like, I'm still dying. </connor>
<joey> It sucked. </joey>
<connor> - It doesn't help, and it doesn't get cool during the night. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I get like the whole, like, </joey>
<joey> fan being nostalgic though </joey>
<connor> 'cause like I have that exact same thing at my grandma's- </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah, suffering is nostalgic for me. </connor>
<connor> - At my grandma's old place in the middle of nowhere </connor>
<connor> in the mountains, we didn't have AC. </connor>
<connor> Because the house was too big to have a single AC unit. </connor>
<connor> And, like, also all the doors were always open, </connor>
<connor> so it was always with a fan. </connor>
<connor> But it's nostalgic. </connor>
<connor> Is it good memories though? </connor>
<connor> No. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> - I love just dying slowly. </connor>
<connor> - I remember that time when I almost died of heatstroke </connor>
<connor> at my grandma's house. </connor>
<joey> Good times. </joey>
<connor> - You might be confusing nostalgia to like PTSD. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know. </connor>
<connor> I like the feeling of, like, I prefer the heat, </connor>
<joey> the feeling of summer over winter, </joey>
<joey> like, any day of the week. </joey>
<joey> - Why? </joey>
<joey> - I'm just depressed in winter. </joey>
<joey> Winter is just like, </joey>
<garnt> even like dying in this heat, </garnt>
<garnt> I still prefer what I'm experiencing now to winter. </garnt>
<joey> - What happens to you in the winter? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, what happens, bro? </connor>
<garnt> - Winter's just the worst season. </garnt>
<connor> - Like, a fucking "Game of Thrones" character right now </connor>
<connor> going on about this shit. </connor>
<connor> - It is, it is the worst season! </connor>
<connor> Okay, okay, okay. </connor>
<connor> I think it's, like, scientifically proven </connor>
<connor> that people are less happy, </connor>
<connor> people are more happy with more sunlight. </connor>
<joey> - I disagree. </joey>
<joey> - I think it's literally more healthier for you </joey>
<joey> to get more sunlight because you are literally happier. </joey>
<joey> - But there is sunlight in the winter. </joey>
<joey> - There's like barely any sunlight in the winter. </joey>
<joey> And okay, here's the thing that depresses me the most, okay? </joey>
<joey> Especially if you're working a nine to five job </joey>
<joey> and you have to commute to work, </joey>
<joey> you wake up. </joey>
<connor> You wake up maybe 7:00 AM or whatever. </connor>
<connor> If you have to commute long, it's like 7:00, 8:00 AM. </connor>
<connor> You wake up, it's dark. </connor>
<connor> You go to the office at 9:00, </connor>
<connor> and it's still just like the sun's just rising. </connor>
<connor> - I love that. </connor>
<connor> It's so fun. </connor>
<garnt> - No. </garnt>
<garnt> - It feels great, it's like you beat the morning. </garnt>
<connor> It's like, okay, I'm ahead of it. </connor>
<connor> - You stay inside, you stay inside literally all day. </connor>
<connor> You're just in the office with artificial light. </connor>
<garnt> You go out, it's 5:00 PM, and again, it's dark. </garnt>
<garnt> - I like that. </garnt>
<garnt> - I like the night. </garnt>
<connor> - How could you! </connor>
<garnt> How could you not want any sunshine in your life? </garnt>
<garnt> - You know, most of the time I have my curtains closed. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> It's too hot. </joey>
<garnt> - Even in my office now, I have them closed all the time. </garnt>
<connor> - And like the second thing. </connor>
<garnt> Everything's dead in the winter. </garnt>
<garnt> There's no color at all. </garnt>
<garnt> You look outside, everything's gray. </garnt>
<garnt> Everything's drab. </garnt>
<garnt> How can you be happy with, like, zero color? </garnt>
<connor> - I don't know. </connor>
<connor> I just think you're a boring person. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - Like, literally the only thing to look forward to </garnt>
<connor> in winter is Christmas. </connor>
<connor> Like, I'm pretty sure- </connor>
<connor> - I don't give a shit about Christmas. </connor>
<connor> - I'm pretty sure they invented Christmas </connor>
<connor> because if they didn't have Christmas, </connor>
<garnt> like everyone would just have nothing to look forward to. </garnt>
<joey> - Objection, I'm from Australia. </joey>
<garnt> We didn't have such thing. </garnt>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<joey> - Okay. </joey>
<connor> - It's like this for me. </connor>
<connor> - Everyone knows that Christmas was invented by Coca-Cola. </connor>
<connor> - Of course, of course. </connor>
<connor> - There was no Christmas before Coca-Cola. </connor>
<connor> Everyone knows that. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> You know, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> It's fun. </connor>
<joey> It's cozy. </joey>
<joey> You know, you get to- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it's cozy. </joey>
<joey> - Also, you get the most drip in winter, you know? </joey>
<connor> - I agree. </connor>
<connor> - You get no drip in the summer. </connor>
<garnt> - I wouldn't be wearing this drip in the winter. </garnt>
<garnt> - You get the best drip and you get the best sleep. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, true, sleep is clean. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't know. </connor>
<garnt> - Crack the window open a little bit sometimes, </garnt>
<connor> it's kinda chilly. </connor>
<connor> - It's like, you're kind of like, </connor>
<joey> it's kind of like just, it's not cold, </joey>
<connor> but it's like a little bit like, </connor>
<joey> ooh, okay, maybe I could put something light on. </joey>
<joey> But the moment you hop in that bed </joey>
<joey> and you put that blanket over you </joey>
<garnt> and you're just wrapped in a warm cocoon, </garnt>
<garnt> there's like, I'm unstoppable. </garnt>
<garnt> This sleep is on my side now. </garnt>
<garnt> And you just get the best fucking sleep. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, the mornings suck. </garnt>
<garnt> - The mornings do suck. </garnt>
<garnt> - But for me, all the mornings suck! </garnt>
<garnt> I can't wake up in the morning, </garnt>
<joey> so it doesn't make a fucking difference to me! </joey>
<garnt> - Okay, the only thing I will say is </garnt>
<joey> that I can wear turtlenecks in the winter. </joey>
<joey> - Exactly. </joey>
<connor> - It sucks 'cause your options are so limited in the winter. </connor>
<connor> It's like, you can't, </connor>
<connor> sorry, the summer. </connor>
<connor> You can't wear more than one layer ever. </connor>
<connor> Like, a jacket? </connor>
<connor> Oh, well that sucks. </connor>
<connor> No. </connor>
<connor> I love jackets. </connor>
<connor> Jackets are so fun. </connor>
<connor> - No jeans. </connor>
<connor> - Jumpers are gone. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, jeans. </connor>
<connor> I wear jeans still now, but I'm dying. </connor>
<connor> But that's because I hate shorts. </connor>
<garnt> - But that's why like British summers </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause what I realized is that British summers is </garnt>
<connor> just like a comfortable, </connor>
<garnt> like it's a comfortable temperature. </garnt>
<garnt> - Pre global warming? </garnt>
<garnt> Yes. </garnt>
<connor> It was good. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause this didn't used to happen. </connor>
<connor> And it was never like this in the UK where it was that bad. </connor>
<garnt> - I remember we always complain about British summers </garnt>
<garnt> to be, like, every British person I've met is just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh, you haven't experienced British summer. </garnt>
<garnt> "It's like, really, it rains sometimes, </garnt>
<connor> "it's cold sometimes." </connor>
<garnt> I'm just like, it actually slaps compared to other summers, </garnt>
<connor> compared to other places. </connor>
<connor> - I would have agreed with you until like two years ago </connor>
<joey> when for some reason two years in a row, </joey>
<joey> we just had horrible heat waves </joey>
<joey> that just ruined the summer for me. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause it was always fun in the UK. </joey>
<joey> The best part about it is I like it in summer </joey>
<connor> when the day is hot and the night gets cool. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But in Japan it doesn't get cool. </connor>
<joey> - No, it does. </joey>
<joey> - No. </joey>
<connor> - I think it does. </connor>
<connor> Compared to now, </connor>
<connor> like, 'cause you know, it's like what? </connor>
<connor> Fucking 2:00 PM right now. </connor>
<connor> It's like the hottest time of the day right now. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But compared to, </connor>
<connor> you all right? </connor>
<connor> - Carry on. </connor>
<connor> - But compared to that, </connor>
<connor> when the sun finally goes down at like what? </connor>
<connor> Like, 8:00 PM maybe, </connor>
<connor> and like around like 9:00 or 10:00, </connor>
<connor> it's like, it's pretty comfortable. </connor>
<connor> That's the kind of weather where I'm like, </connor>
<joey> "Okay, I'm really comfortable." </joey>
<joey> I can't concentrate with him. </joey>
<joey> - We're gonna cut. </joey>
<connor> - Mechs! </connor>
<connor> - You all right? </connor>
<connor> - What's wrong with you all of a sudden? </connor>
<garnt> - I don't know, guys. </garnt>
<garnt> I just want to suddenly ride a mech </garnt>
<garnt> and battle other people to prove </garnt>
<garnt> that I'm the best mech pilot ever. </garnt>
<garnt> How can I satisfy this sudden urge, you guys? </garnt>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Well, I'm glad you've asked. </connor>
<connor> I've got just the thing for you, Garnt. </connor>
<connor> Mech Arena! </connor>
<connor> It's the new casual mobile game shooter on Android and iOS. </connor>
<connor> Hop in your mech, play a game or two, </connor>
<connor> cause some chaos, and be out in just a few minutes. </connor>
<connor> Anyone can play it, </connor>
<connor> and you don't need to be a pro gamer to have some fun. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] I actually tried it out </joey>
<joey> and I really liked the Guardian mech. </joey>
<joey> You can shut down enemy abilities like shields or stuns. </joey>
<joey> and it forces the enemy to completely reload their weapons. </joey>
<joey> With just a push of a button the enemy is donzo. </joey>
<joey> - That sounds OP as F! </joey>
<connor> - It sure is, Garnt. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] My favorite mech is the Panther. </connor>
<connor> It has the ability called the stasis barrier. </connor>
<connor> Put down invincible wall that blocks enemy bullets </connor>
<connor> and slows anyone that passes through it. </connor>
<connor> If you'd like to maintain the distance </connor>
<connor> and snipe down your enemies, this mech is for you. </connor>
<joey> - That sounds like a very cool mech! </joey>
<joey> - And even better, Garnt. </joey>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<garnt> - Mech Arena sent us... </garnt>
<garnt> - What is that? </garnt>
<garnt> - A box. </garnt>
<connor> - What are those? </connor>
<connor> Open it up, Joey. </connor>
<connor> Open it up! </connor>
<garnt> - What are you waiting for? </garnt>
<joey> - First of all, we got to scan this QR code. </joey>
<joey> Once you scan that in, we have these character cards. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, okay, look at that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, I'm in like the room. </garnt>
<connor> Meilyne's in there. </connor>
<joey> - How did you get that? </joey>
<joey> - It's actually kind of cool. </joey>
<joey> - So apparently there's a poster that you can also scan. </joey>
<joey> - Oh! </joey>
<garnt> Oh, that looks cool. </garnt>
<garnt> That actually looks cool. </garnt>
<joey> - Well, while you guys are doing that, </joey>
<joey> let me check out some of the other things inside this box. </joey>
<joey> Oh my God, this thing's so heavy. </joey>
<joey> So, I assume this is a Mech Arena coaster. </joey>
<joey> That's got some weight to it. </joey>
<joey> - [Computer] Mech Arena is a new- </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<joey> - It's like a birthday card, but it's, like, </joey>
<joey> it's not only that. </joey>
<joey> It's like a legit screen. </joey>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Oh my God. </garnt>
<joey> - It's like an actual tablet inside. </joey>
<garnt> And it just stops when you close it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Let me see that, let me see that. </garnt>
<joey> Let me see that. </joey>
<garnt> All right, ready for it. </garnt>
<joey> Oh my God. - That's actually so cool. </joey>
<connor> We have also what looks like to be the Mech Arena art book </connor>
<connor> or a little art pamphlet that shows all of the concept art. </connor>
<connor> I guess you can just keep the tablet </connor>
<connor> because there's even a charger. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I think so. </connor>
<connor> - To what I assume is the tablet. </connor>
<connor> I think we just literally just got a free tablet. </connor>
<connor> Oh, and by the way, </connor>
<connor> that's not the coolest thing that's in here </connor>
<connor> because there's also one more thing. </connor>
<connor> If I can even get it out. </connor>

<garnt> - I'm getting in the robots right now! </garnt>
<garnt> Back to the episode. </garnt>
<garnt> But, like, I like that. </garnt>
<garnt> I like having as much, as I said, </garnt>
<garnt> as much sunlight as possible. </garnt>
<garnt> And I just, I feel like the best, </garnt>
<garnt> like my favorite time period of the entire year is about, </garnt>
<garnt> like, what's the word? </garnt>
<garnt> Like, dusk summertime when like the sun's setting, </garnt>
<connor> it's about 7:00, 8:00 PM, </connor>
<connor> and you're just watching the sunset. </connor>
<connor> Man, you feel like a fucking anime character </connor>
<connor> 'cause it's just like, </connor>
<connor> no, it's that fucking scene where you're just like- </connor>
<connor> - Bullshit do you watch the sun. </connor>
<joey> - In every opening where, like, </joey>
<joey> the protagonist is watching the sunset </joey>
<joey> and the wind's just blowing. </joey>
<joey> - How often do you- </joey>
<garnt> - You are not standing out on your fucking balcony </garnt>
<connor> being like, "That's a nice sunset." </connor>
<connor> - How often are you watching the sunset? </connor>
<connor> - [Navi] That's freaking Star Wars you're watching! </connor>
<garnt> - No, shut the fuck up! </garnt>
<joey> No, it's anime! </joey>
<joey> Shut the fuck up, Navi! </joey>
<joey> It's not Star Wars! </joey>
<garnt> - It's that scene on Tatooine </garnt>
<joey> where he's like watching the sun go down. </joey>
<garnt> - How often are you watching the sunset? </garnt>
<garnt> - Honestly, that's why I love my balcony. </garnt>
<garnt> That's why I have a hammock out there. </garnt>
<connor> - Fuck off, you're not watching the sunset every day. </connor>
<connor> - I'm not watching it every day. </connor>
<connor> - But that's the hottest time of the day in my opinion </connor>
<joey> because you're getting that like direct fucking sunlight. </joey>
<garnt> - The hottest time of the day is fucking now. </garnt>
<garnt> I can't stand out there for like 10 minutes. </garnt>
<joey> - It's hot until the sun goes down. </joey>
<joey> Like, the moment the sun rises, </joey>
<joey> it's the hottest time of the day. </joey>
<garnt> - No. </garnt>
<joey> I mean- </joey>
<joey> - I don't know, man. </joey>
<joey> I like going outside, </joey>
<joey> and I don't want to have to fucking, you know, </joey>
<joey> shed away my life expectancy just to go outside. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I guess that's why for me in Japan, </garnt>
<garnt> I think my favorite season is probably spring. </garnt>
<garnt> - For me, it's the autumn. </garnt>
<joey> - Autumn? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, around, like, October is probably my favorite time </garnt>
<garnt> of the year just because it's like, </garnt>
<connor> again, you have that variance in drip, right? </connor>
<connor> You can wear a jacket if it gets a little bit cold </connor>
<connor> in the night, but you can take it off </connor>
<connor> and, you know, rock a long sleeve. </connor>
<joey> But it's also not so cold that it's excruciating, </joey>
<joey> but it's not too hot either. </joey>
<garnt> - I feel like that's the same as spring though. </garnt>
<joey> And I like the whole, </joey>
<joey> have we talked about Hanami at all? </joey>
<joey> Like, the cheery blossom? </joey>
<joey> - I don't think so. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, like, so, </joey>
<joey> I mean, you know. </joey>
<connor> You watch anime, right. </connor>
<connor> You know what cherry blossoms are. </connor>
<connor> - The cherry blossoms! </connor>
<garnt> - You know what fucking cherry blossoms are. </garnt>
<garnt> - I won't lie, I was slightly disappointed </garnt>
<garnt> to find out the cherry blossoms are only around </garnt>
<connor> for like one week and then they fuck off </connor>
<connor> 'cause I'm like, hold up, </connor>
<connor> they're in all the anime all the time. </connor>
<joey> What's going on with that? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, they film all the anime in the same week. </joey>
<connor> - I realize it's like a cult in Japan. </connor>
<connor> Like, they're obsessed with this, the Hanami. </connor>
<joey> Like, everything revolves, </joey>
<joey> when Hanami's coming up, everything is happening. </joey>
<joey> - Well, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like, everything has to become cherry blossom. </joey>
<connor> It's like everyone just joins like a call- </connor>
<joey> - It's because there's a really extensive history. </joey>
<connor> - Right, right, right. </connor>
<joey> But it's like, it's nuts. </joey>
<connor> Like, it's, I understand why it's in anime so much now, </connor>
<joey> but when I got here I'm like, </joey>
<connor> wow, literally everything is decorated </connor>
<connor> like it's a Call of Duty gun skin. </connor>
<joey> It's like, everything's there. </joey>
<joey> It doesn't matter what it is, it gets a cherry blossom skin. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, not gonna lie, man, </joey>
<joey> like a good Hanami is fucking dope. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, but it's a bit disappointing it's only one week. </joey>
<garnt> What if you're like busy, you got shit going on that week, </garnt>
<garnt> you're like shit. </garnt>
<connor> - Wait 'til next year. </connor>
<connor> - I did miss Hanami this week. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, this year, this year. </connor>
<connor> - Oh sorry, sorry, this year. </connor>
<connor> - I didn't do anything this year, I totally forgot. </connor>
<connor> I didn't know when it was coming. </connor>
<joey> - I had one of the best Hanami's this year. </joey>
<connor> - Rub it in, Joey. </connor>
<connor> Fucking hell. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause we went to the fucking Hakone for it. </connor>
<connor> All along the Hakone River's </connor>
<joey> just like rows and rows of Sakura trees. </joey>
<garnt> - Want to explain what Hanami is to the viewers? </garnt>
<joey> - So, Hanami literally means flower watching in Japanese. </joey>
<connor> So, it's basically this kind of, </connor>
<connor> I wouldn't even say it's like a festival. </connor>
<joey> It's more like an event that happens. </joey>
<garnt> - Isn't it even a public holiday? </garnt>
<garnt> - No. </garnt>
<garnt> - I feel like it's a mutual agreement </garnt>
<connor> amongst everyone to get drunk in the park. </connor>
<connor> That's kind of what it is. </connor>
<joey> - Pretty much, pretty much. </joey>
<connor> - But it's like, </connor>
<connor> because the Sakura are only around for about a week </connor>
<connor> and maybe sometimes not even a week, a couple of days, </connor>
<connor> people go out and like celebrate </connor>
<joey> by just sitting under a tree, </joey>
<joey> having a picnic under the Sakura tree. </joey>
<connor> It's fucking great. </connor>
<connor> - Do you think it's worth? </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I know a lot of people who are like, </connor>
<connor> "I want to come to Japan during that time." </connor>
<connor> You think it's worth coming to Japan just for it? </connor>
<joey> - I think if it's the first time you're coming to Japan, </joey>
<joey> I think it's worth it. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think now, because we've lived in Japan for two years, </garnt>
<garnt> we're kind of like, </garnt>
<garnt> we're kind of like used to it. </garnt>
<garnt> But I feel like seeing Hanami for the first time </garnt>
<garnt> and seeing like all like the cherry blossoms </garnt>
<garnt> just like falling off the trees and you have, like, </garnt>
<garnt> the ground is literally covered in cherry blossoms. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, everywhere. </garnt>
<garnt> I think that's a pretty cool. </garnt>
<joey> - Couple of weebs just definitely just nutted </joey>
<garnt> to you saying that right now. </garnt>
<joey> "It's like in the anime!" </joey>
<joey> - Like, you literally walk through a park </joey>
<joey> and it is literally like every fucking anime scene </joey>
<joey> where like the fucking cherry blossoms- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, the cherry blossoms, like, fluttering down. </joey>
<joey> Still looks dope. </joey>
<connor> - It looks dope as fuck. </connor>
<connor> I don't know what it is that just is like so aesthetic. </connor>
<garnt> But it's just the perfect aesthetic. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, Japan is like kind of aesthetic all year round. </joey>
<joey> But I'd say like the most aesthetic is probably </joey>
<joey> during the Sakura season. </joey>
<joey> - I'd say if you are gonna do it, </joey>
<connor> definitely get out of Tokyo. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause like every single Hanami place in Tokyo, </connor>
<joey> like, every single park that has the cherry blossom trees </joey>
<joey> is crammed! - Packed as shit. </joey>
<connor> - You will be, </connor>
<connor> like, 'cause two years ago, we did like a small one. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And we had to get like a corner of dirt </connor>
<connor> in the park right next to the road. </connor>
<joey> Like, it was the only, </joey>
<connor> literally the only spot left in this massive park. </connor>
<joey> - Where'd you guys go? </joey>
<connor> Like, Shinjuku? </connor>
<connor> - No, we were in Saitama. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh, Saitama. </garnt>
<garnt> - And it was like, rammed as well. </garnt>
<connor> So it was so full. </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause what people normally do here in Japan is </garnt>
<garnt> during the cherry blossom week or season </garnt>
<connor> or when they're blooming, people go to the park, </connor>
<connor> they get like a kind of like a picnic area, </connor>
<connor> and then they just get fucking pissed in public. </connor>
<connor> It's great. </connor>
<connor> - I would say go like when you come to Japan, </connor>
<connor> definitely do like a week in Tokyo, </connor>
<connor> and then if you're, you know, </connor>
<connor> if it aligns with the Hanami, do a week somewhere else </connor>
<garnt> where you can then celebrate the Hanami. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I feel like doing, </garnt>
<joey> 'cause you can't really explore Japan in one week, </joey>
<joey> I don't think. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] No, you can't. </joey>
<joey> - You can't even explore Tokyo in one week. </joey>
<joey> - True. </joey>
<connor> I've been here for like two years now </connor>
<connor> and I've barely explored Japan. </connor>
<garnt> - How's Hanami in like Hakone you said? </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, it's great because, </joey>
<joey> I mean, Hakone is still, you know, </joey>
<connor> very much a tourist destination, </connor>
<connor> but I mean, compared to like Shinjuku or like Yoyogi Park. </connor>
<connor> it's like- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, you don't get any space at all. </connor>
<connor> - No, absolutely no space at all. </connor>
<connor> And I mean, like, I guess as well, </connor>
<connor> like, in Hakone and a lot of places in Hakone, </connor>
<connor> they have definitely like positioned a lot of, like, </connor>
<connor> own-sans and like yocons and stuff like that </connor>
<connor> around the Sakura </connor>
<connor> and like around all the aesthetic parts of Hakone. </connor>
<connor> So yeah, it was great. </connor>
<connor> I mean, like, we stayed in like an Airbnb </connor>
<connor> that was overlooking like a bunch of like Sakura trees </connor>
<connor> on the lake and in the distance you could see Mount Fuji. </connor>
<connor> And it was like the most like aesthetic fuckin' Hanami </connor>
<connor> that I ever had. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, you know what? </connor>
<connor> It's kind of worth to go all the way out there sometimes </connor>
<joey> to just, like, get a little bit of peace of mind. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause otherwise it's just be like, </joey>
<joey> you'd be rubbing shoulders with the person next to you </joey>
<joey> being like, "Look at the petal over there. </joey>
<joey> "Oh my God." </joey>
<joey> - It wasn't the people, </joey>
<garnt> it was like the fucking kids running around. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, like getting pissed is great. </garnt>
<connor> Getting pissed with like a bunch of, like, </connor>
<connor> five, six year olds running around you, like, </connor>
<connor> playing football or whatever (laughs) </connor>
<connor> it's not exactly like the best kind of vibes </connor>
<connor> to get piss drunk. </connor>
<garnt> - If you're sitting like where I am now, </garnt>
<joey> you are probably like this close to someone as well. </joey>
<joey> Someone else's like mat and picnic set. </joey>
<connor> You said you stayed in an Airbnb. </connor>
<connor> Have you stayed in many Airbnbs in Japan? </connor>
<joey> - Not really. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, 'cause like 90% of them got fucking axed. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, so for the Olympics, </connor>
<connor> the Japanese government changed the rules around Airbnbs. </connor>
<connor> Basically just gutting them and making it </connor>
<connor> so that you had to make it, you need to follow a lot of, </connor>
<connor> they basically made it so you had to follow hotel rules. </connor>
<connor> Like, they had to have like the fire escape </connor>
<connor> and like the floor lit up to the... </connor>
<connor> They basically made the rules impossible on purpose </connor>
<connor> where you couldn't turn a profit like reasonably. </connor>
<garnt> - Basically, 'cause I have stayed in an Airbnb- </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I stayed in one as well the first time I visited, </garnt>
<garnt> and it was super cheap. </garnt>
<garnt> You can get like, what did we get? </garnt>
<garnt> Me and Alan got the Airbnb for what? </garnt>
<connor> Like, it was really cheap, like 150 bucks. </connor>
<garnt> - But it was like a really, really small room I remember. </garnt>
<connor> - But it was right in Shinagawa. </connor>
<connor> - Oh! </connor>
<connor> Was that the one? </connor>
<joey> - That was the one I got really sick in. </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<garnt> - The one you threw up in! </garnt>
<garnt> - What I want to know, okay, so this was like, </garnt>
<connor> I think the first time you'd been to Japan? </connor>
<connor> - That was my very first time. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Your very first time. </connor>
<garnt> - I was so confused. </garnt>
<garnt> I just turned up in this place. </garnt>
<connor> I had the instructions for this Airbnb </connor>
<connor> that I didn't understand. </connor>
<connor> I had my luggage and I was like, </connor>
<connor> "What the fuck is going on?" </connor>
<connor> I was so confused. </connor>
<connor> Like, the other side of the world. </connor>
<connor> - And of course Connor flies over, </connor>
<connor> and the very first thing we do </connor>
<garnt> once Connor and Alan come over is that we go to karaoke </garnt>
<garnt> and we stay all night. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, we weren't going to. </garnt>
<connor> So what happened was is that- </connor>
<joey> - I took you guys to an izakaya. </joey>
<connor> - [Garnt] Oh yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I was only gonna meet, 'cause you guys were like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, we're too sleepy. </connor>
<connor> "We're probably just gonna go to bed." </connor>
<connor> And then I think me and Joey were like, </connor>
<connor> 'cause it was my first time going to Japan, </connor>
<connor> I was like (heavy breathing) </connor>
<connor> - Finally I can show this- </connor>
<connor> - I was like, "No, fuck this. </connor>
<garnt> "I'm not resting, let's go and get drinks." </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah 'cause I was like jet lagged, </connor>
<connor> and so was Connor I think. </connor>
<connor> I mean, you were jet lagged, </connor>
<connor> but you were running on the excitement of being in Japan </connor>
<connor> for the first time. </connor>
<garnt> - I was like, "Joey, show me around. </garnt>
<garnt> "Let's go, let's go drink." </garnt>
<garnt> So then Joey took me to like a very like... </garnt>
<joey> - I took you to (speaks Japanese) </joey>
<connor> And it was during the week day </connor>
<connor> where they have 100 yen beers. </connor>
<connor> And Connor's mind was just fucking blown. </connor>
<connor> - I was! </connor>
<joey> - "A dollar?" </joey>
<connor> - I was like, "This is insane. </connor>
<connor> "This is like 60P." </connor>
<connor> - This is like uni prices. </connor>
<connor> - Not even. </connor>
<connor> Uni prices don't even get this low. </connor>
<connor> This was insane. </connor>
<connor> "This is beer, right? </connor>
<connor> "Like legit?" </connor>
<connor> - Legit beer, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, we were drinking. </connor>
<garnt> And then while Me and Joey were getting drunk, </garnt>
<garnt> I think they, Garnt and- </garnt>
<garnt> - We had just landed. </garnt>
<garnt> - They were like, "You know what? </garnt>
<connor> "No, we don't wanna miss out." </connor>
<connor> So, then they came and start drinking </connor>
<connor> and then we went out to karaoke. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, we stayed- </connor>
<connor> - And I got very sick. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> - What I want to know, 'cause I know Joey, </connor>
<garnt> Joey got very sick, if you know what I mean </garnt>
<garnt> and had to stay around your place. </garnt>
<garnt> Who slept on the floor? </garnt>
<connor> - Alan did. </connor>
<joey> - Garnt's editor. </joey>
<joey> And so this was November. </joey>
<joey> November, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> No, January. </joey>
<joey> - I felt so bad. </joey>
<joey> - It was, like, basically it was fucking freezing. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it was really cold. </joey>
<joey> - And we had to have the AC running in the room. </joey>
<joey> Problem was is that there was a door, </joey>
<connor> there's literally no room for anyone else to sleep </connor>
<connor> in this room except two people. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, 'cause I remember going to your place, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just like, how the fuck did you fit three people in it? </garnt>
<garnt> It's literally a shoe box. </garnt>
<joey> - So, basically Alan had to sacrifice his bed for me. </joey>
<garnt> - And he slept in the hallway. </garnt>
<garnt> - Alan, the tallest motherfucker. </garnt>
<garnt> And by hallway it was literally like just a single, </garnt>
<garnt> like, very, like- </garnt>
<garnt> - He just slept on the floor. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was like a human sized corridor. </garnt>
<garnt> You could not like fit anything more </garnt>
<garnt> than just like a fucking human. </garnt>
<connor> - And it was like -5. </connor>
<connor> - It was really cold, yeah. </connor>
<connor> He was just like, like I, </connor>
<joey> 'cause I wasn't aware that Alan had given up the bed </joey>
<connor> and slept in the hallway. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I was out. </connor>
<connor> I was throwing up all night. </connor>
<connor> And it wasn't until I woke up that morning </connor>
<joey> and I kind of came to and I was like, </joey>
<joey> "Where the fuck am I?" </joey>
<joey> And then I saw Connor in his bed on the other side, </joey>
<garnt> and I was like, "Oh, okay I'm in their Airbnb." </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, "Where's Alan?" </garnt>
<connor> And then I just saw this like lump in the hallway. </connor>
<connor> Just like, just this lump of like blankets. </connor>
<connor> - He was so cold. </connor>
<connor> - And I was like, "Is that Alan? </connor>
<connor> "Is he dead?" </connor>
<connor> He literally slept in, like, </connor>
<joey> the fucking shivering hallway for me. </joey>
<joey> - He's that one friend who's like the nicest guy </joey>
<connor> when you're like sick or like when you drank too much. </connor>
<connor> He's always got your back. </connor>
<connor> I threw up one time and even though he was drunk, </connor>
<connor> he cleaned it all up, and I just went back to bed. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - That was the very first time- </garnt>
<connor> - First time I hung out. </connor>
<connor> First time I met him as well. </connor>
<connor> - First time you guys met, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, and he cleaned up my (laughs) throwing up. </connor>
<connor> That's how I know. </connor>
<connor> Like, from that point onwards, </connor>
<connor> I was like amazing friends with him. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I was like, this guy's got my back. </connor>
<connor> - No one else will do that. </connor>
<connor> - I would never do that for someone. </connor>
<garnt> I'm like, "I'm going back to bed. </garnt>
<connor> "You can deal with this tomorrow." </connor>
<connor> - I remember it was like kind of like a house party </connor>
<connor> we had in England where we kind of like rented out an Airbnb </connor>
<connor> and just like caught up with friends. </connor>
<connor> And you were like the new guy. </connor>
<garnt> - I was like 20 as well, so I was still like, </garnt>
<connor> "Yeah, let's drink way too much!" </connor>
<garnt> - I remember Alan telling the story of like, </garnt>
<garnt> I think everyone was passed out </garnt>
<garnt> and it was just you and Alan awake, </garnt>
<garnt> and you guys were like sleeping on the sofa or something. </garnt>
<garnt> And then like, I think he made eye contact with you </garnt>
<garnt> and you made eye contact with him, </garnt>
<garnt> and he just started laughing and then he just watched you </garnt>
<garnt> and you just like looked at him, laughed, </garnt>
<garnt> and just chundered everywhere. </garnt>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> - That sounds like me. </connor>
<connor> I remember 'cause, what was it? </connor>
<connor> He made some drink with like really budget energy drink. </connor>
<connor> And from that day on- </connor>
<connor> - Oh, Boost, Boost. </connor>
<joey> - I swore never to drink budget energy drink. </joey>
<connor> Even energy drink is bad enough, </connor>
<connor> but the budget one where it's like 50 cents </connor>
<joey> for two liters is like- </joey>
<joey> - What? </joey>
<joey> - It's like brake fluid. </joey>
<joey> Like, no wonder, </joey>
<joey> like of course you're gonna throw up drinking that stuff. </joey>
<joey> I'm glad I did because I didn't have to digest it. </joey>
<joey> - Exactly. </joey>
<joey> - Jesus. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, we have a mate from home who's now, like, </garnt>
<connor> discovered a new cocktail is what he calls it. </connor>
<connor> It's not a cocktail. </connor>
<connor> It's literally like, </connor>
<connor> okay, tell me how disgusting this sounds. </connor>
<connor> It's Boost. </connor>
<connor> So, a Boost energy- </connor>
<connor> - A budget energy drink. </connor>
<connor> - Budget Red Bull. </connor>
<connor> Boost and red wine. </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God. </connor>
<joey> That's, oh, Jesus. </joey>
<garnt> - Does he have like functioning like tastebuds? </garnt>
<joey> - And I'm just like, I thought we grew out of this </joey>
<garnt> in university, man. </garnt>
<garnt> - That can't be- </garnt>
<joey> - Not even uni students stoop that low. </joey>
<garnt> - I think if you did that in France, you'd be deported. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yes, Rick, I'm calling you out right now. </garnt>
<connor> It's disgusting. </connor>
<garnt> Stop trying to get me to drink it. </garnt>
<connor> - That's so vile. </connor>
<connor> - Ew. </connor>
<joey> What would that even taste? </joey>
<connor> Like, could you even taste the energy drink at that point? </connor>
<connor> 'Cause the flavor of red wine is so overpowering, I feel. </connor>
<connor> - There's some things where even if that tasted amazing, </connor>
<joey> I'm like, no, this is- </joey>
<connor> - Morally wrong. </connor>
<joey> - This is too broke for me. </joey>
<connor> Like, this is so broke. </connor>
<connor> And there's nothing wrong with that. </connor>
<connor> I just don't want to partake in it. </connor>
<connor> You could be broke. </connor>
<connor> - Nice follow up there. </connor>
<joey> - No, no, no, it's fine, it's fine. </joey>
<joey> It's not poor, it's broke. </joey>
<joey> It's different. </joey>
<joey> Broke is a mindset. </joey>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Poor is a lifestyle. </connor>
<connor> - Poor is your financial situation. </connor>
<connor> - Just don't be poor, just don't be poor. </connor>
<joey> - Being broke is the mindset of like, </joey>
<joey> I'm gonna live like an animal. </joey>
<connor> And I, you know, I don't partake in that, you know. </connor>
<joey> - You can be rich, but be broke at the same time. </joey>
<connor> - Listen, the reason why- </connor>
<garnt> - If you're homeless, just buy a house. </garnt>
<joey> - No, that's poverty, Garnt. </joey>
<joey> That's different. </joey>
<joey> There's a difference between poverty and broke. </joey>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> Big difference, Garnt. </connor>
<connor> Come on. </connor>
<joey> Trying to get me in a corner here saying being poor is bad. </joey>
<joey> Yes, it is, Garnt. </joey>
<connor> You want me to say it? </connor>
<joey> - You're not doing a very good job of, like, </joey>
<garnt> supporting your argument. </garnt>
<garnt> - Not my problem, not my problem. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like being like, </garnt>
<connor> oh, there's a difference between being ugly </connor>
<connor> and unattractive. </connor>
<connor> - You can clearly afford red wine </connor>
<connor> and you can clearly afford energy drink. </connor>
<connor> Why would you mix them? </connor>
<connor> That is, like, you're making yourself broke for no reason. </connor>
<garnt> - Is that broke? </garnt>
<connor> - That's broke, that's broke. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't drink energy drink period anymore. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know at what age it was where I was just like, </garnt>
<garnt> man, Red Bull kinds sucks. </garnt>
<garnt> - It doesn't do anything for me anymore. </garnt>
<connor> Actually, know what? </connor>
<connor> I drink those, I don't know if it counts. </connor>
<connor> Is it an energy drink? </connor>
<connor> The Oronamin C. </connor>
<joey> - Oh yeah, that's kind of weird. </joey>
<connor> I don't know if I count that as an energy- </connor>
<connor> - I love those things. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, it's like a vitamin drink. </joey>
<connor> - It's a vitamin drink that's definitely not healthy. </connor>
<connor> - But it's in the same like section as like Red Bulls. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh, you mean the Japanese ones. </garnt>
<connor> - It's like a glass thing. </connor>
<joey> It's got a really satisfying pop. </joey>
<joey> You pull this metal tab and it, a really nice pop. </joey>
<joey> - Oronamin C, I think it's called. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it's this on screen. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know what it means. </joey>
<joey> - Definitely if you kinda like sweet drinks. </joey>
<joey> I don't know who, </joey>
<joey> because I don't really drink energy drinks, </joey>
<joey> but I love this thing. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's so tasty. </joey>
<connor> - I feel that works better than an energy drink. </connor>
<connor> I don't know if it's placebo, but yeah. </connor>
<garnt> I mean, it definitely tastes a lot better for my body </garnt>
<garnt> than a Red Bull does. </garnt>
<joey> - I don't feel awful after drinking it. </joey>
<connor> - I think it was because now it's gotten to the point </connor>
<connor> where if I have an energy drink, </connor>
<connor> it's literally going to make me unable to sleep </connor>
<garnt> for that night, and it never used to be that way. </garnt>
<garnt> Normally I could like down five energy drinks or whatever </garnt>
<garnt> and like be fine the night. </garnt>
<connor> - See, I have the opposite problem. </connor>
<connor> I don't get anything from them anymore. </connor>
<garnt> - That's 'cause you drink, like, </garnt>
<garnt> fucking five cups of coffee a day. </garnt>
<connor> I'm not fucking surprised. </connor>
<connor> - Maybe. </connor>
<connor> I can quit any time, Garnt. </connor>
<garnt> - Can you? </garnt>
<joey> - I can quit any time. </joey>
<connor> - Said every drug addict. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<joey> - I could stop any time. </joey>
<joey> - Just replace coffee with energy drinks. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> - "I quit coffee." </connor>
<connor> - I normally just drink a lot of tea </connor>
<connor> when I stop drinking them. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, but tea also has caffeine. </joey>
<connor> - Not that much though. </connor>
<connor> - Doesn't tea have more caffeine? </connor>
<connor> - I don't know if that's an urban legend. </connor>
<garnt> - Tea without, like, </garnt>
<garnt> the tea itself if you just eat tea, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh, like, the tea leaves? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Eat tea? </joey>
<connor> - If you would just eat the tea leaves. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, okay. </connor>
<connor> - Like, if you would just eat it, </connor>
<connor> yeah, you'd be taking more caffeine, but no one does that. </connor>
<connor> - The way you said that was so. </connor>
<connor> "Eat tea?" </connor>
<connor> - British people would be like. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> - It's not a drink, it's a meal. </connor>
<connor> - Scrumptious. </connor>
<connor> - Sure, if you just like, </connor>
<garnt> fucking just like powder the coffee on your food </garnt>
<connor> or whatever. </connor>
<connor> Get a caffeine fix. </connor>
<garnt> - At what age did you start caring </garnt>
<connor> about what you're putting in your body? </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, I still don't care. </garnt>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<joey> - What? </joey>
<joey> Yes, you do. </joey>
<joey> Fuck off. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, I care when I can feel the effects. </joey>
<garnt> Does that make sense? </garnt>
<garnt> Does that make sense? </garnt>
<garnt> - No. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, I guess so. </joey>
<connor> - You mean, like, the immediate effects? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, like if- </connor>
<joey> - Like, oh, I have a tummy ache immediately afterwards, </joey>
<joey> I probably shouldn't put it in my body. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, so like- </connor>
<connor> - I can just tell we're about to get on an American talk. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> Like, I feel like America's got- </connor>
<connor> - I wasn't even thinking that. </connor>
<connor> - I was already thinking about it. </connor>
<garnt> - Connor was just like, "I feel it, I feel it. </garnt>
<joey> "My instinct is telling me to shit on America." </joey>
<joey> - Why is your brain like all the time just ready to reload? </joey>
<garnt> - Sorry, sorry, go ahead. </garnt>
<garnt> Just carry on. </garnt>
<connor> If it naturally goes that way, it'll naturally go that way. </connor>
<garnt> - No, like, there was a point I feel like </garnt>
<connor> where you could just put any shit in your body </connor>
<connor> and you could just not feel any like aftereffects at all. </connor>
<connor> It would just like go away after a while. </connor>
<connor> But now, like, I have gotten to a point where, for example, </connor>
<connor> I try to keep a healthy sleep schedule </connor>
<joey> because if I don't get a healthy sleep schedule, </joey>
<joey> I just feel like shit. </joey>
<joey> I don't know. </joey>
<joey> I just felt like there was a point </joey>
<joey> when I didn't care about sleep schedule </joey>
<joey> and it didn't matter. </joey>
<joey> - Man discovers sleep for the first time. </joey>
<connor> - I think your sleep schedule, you know, </connor>
<connor> when you've got shit to do, that's- </connor>
<garnt> - That's it, right? </garnt>
<connor> That's it. </connor>
<garnt> When you got shit to do and you want to be productive, </garnt>
<garnt> like waking up late actually affects that. </garnt>
<connor> And I'm just like, yo, I never thought about this </connor>
<connor> when I was a uni student </connor>
<connor> 'cause I did everything at 4:00 AM in the morning, </connor>
<connor> and I still got a passing grade. </connor>
<connor> - That's what I'm jealous of YouTubers who get canceled. </connor>
<joey> They just get to take a break. </joey>
<joey> They just get to like fuck off for four months. </joey>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<joey> - Benefits to getting canceled, you get a sleep schedule. </joey>
<connor> - I'm like, fuck off, man. </connor>
<joey> You canceled him. </joey>
<connor> He gets to take a four month paid vacation. </connor>
<connor> His videos are still getting views. </connor>
<connor> This is gonna come back in five months. </connor>
<connor> David Dobrik got two month vacation. </connor>
<connor> That's all he got. </connor>
<garnt> This is bullshit. </garnt>
<garnt> - So, what is the right amount of time </garnt>
<garnt> for like a YouTuber cancellation? </garnt>
<connor> - I don't know, mate. </connor>
<garnt> But the more, </garnt>
<connor> when I saw David Dobrik and he came back, </connor>
<connor> zero repercussions. </connor>
<connor> His video that he came back with </connor>
<joey> got the same amount of views. </joey>
<joey> Dislikes and likes were amazing. </joey>
<connor> Got amazing likes. </connor>
<connor> You know, I'm like, this man got a fucking month vacation. </connor>
<connor> This is bullshit! </connor>
<joey> And he got free articles about him. </joey>
<joey> He can get verified now on Twitter. </joey>
<joey> I'm kidding, he was already. </joey>
<joey> - As if he wasn't already. </joey>
<connor> - But I was like, what the fuck? </connor>
<connor> - He can get double verified. </connor>
<connor> - There was like, no repercussions. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, wow. </connor>
<connor> What point is it like, </connor>
<connor> damn, getting canceled doesn't look too bad right now. </connor>
<garnt> - Don't ask for it. </garnt>
<garnt> - If Logan Paul can literally come back </garnt>
<connor> from showing a dead body, I feel like anyone can come back. </connor>
<garnt> I mean, it's kinda the truth, you know. </garnt>
<connor> - Mr. Anime said the same thing. </connor>
<joey> - Joey! </joey>
<garnt> - I can come back from this. </garnt>
<garnt> - Joey finna get canceled right now. </garnt>
<connor> - What? </connor>
<garnt> For telling the truth? </garnt>
<garnt> - That was a joke. </garnt>
<garnt> Joey said a joke. </garnt>
<garnt> It is a joke. </garnt>
<connor> Please don't cancel Joey. </connor>
<garnt> But I was just thinking about it </garnt>
<connor> 'cause you saying that like, oh, </connor>
<connor> my mind made many jumps in logic there. </connor>
<connor> You were saying, oh yeah, when you got shit to do. </connor>
<connor> But when you, you know, when you, </connor>
<connor> as YouTubers, you always have shit to do. </connor>
<connor> There's no vacations. </connor>
<connor> You can't just take a month off. </connor>
<garnt> - People take a month off for a "mental health break." </garnt>
<garnt> Which is like, I say with inverted commas </garnt>
<garnt> because it's kind of become a cliche now, </garnt>
<connor> even though it's very important </connor>
<connor> and YouTubers do fucking need it. </connor>
<connor> - But you know, it's sad 'cause if you get canceled, </connor>
<garnt> you almost get a better vacation </garnt>
<connor> because there's people still talking about you </connor>
<garnt> while you're gone, </garnt>
<garnt> and people like searching about you </garnt>
<garnt> and making videos about you. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, I know this sounds awful, </garnt>
<garnt> and, you know, it's not great, </garnt>
<connor> but you are still getting way more traffic </connor>
<connor> than you would be just taking a break. </connor>
<connor> So if you do something kind of semi bad, you know, just- </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> Do something light, you know. </connor>
<connor> Just do something like, just, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> Just fart on a dog or something. </connor>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<connor> Just something that's, like, not too bad. </connor>
<connor> - Fart on a dog. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> - I don't know. </connor>
<connor> What's something that you'll get backlash for, </connor>
<connor> but isn't really that bad </connor>
<connor> that you can just come back from in a month? </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<joey> - Give your cat vodka. </joey>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> She was perfectly fine. </joey>
<joey> Starting to think I should get a pet. </joey>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> That's a joke. </connor>
<garnt> It's a joke, it's a joke. </garnt>
<garnt> - This is "Trash Taste" getting canceled speedrun. </garnt>
<connor> - I just thought about it. </connor>
<garnt> And I was like, hold on a second. </garnt>
<connor> All these people just get like basically paid vacation. </connor>
<connor> This is bullshit. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, I think it's like different severities. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, people get like quite severe, </connor>
<garnt> yeah, it's quite bad. </garnt>
<connor> But I'm noticing more and more, a lot of them just, </connor>
<connor> if they haven't really done anything criminal, </connor>
<connor> they just kind of like bounce back super easily. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, there are some people </joey>
<connor> who did criminal and still come back. </connor>
<connor> - David Dobrik's thing was kinda criminal to be fair, </connor>
<connor> let's be honest. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, it was kind of criminal. </garnt>
<connor> - Endangered someone's life. </connor>
<connor> Came back all right. </connor>
<connor> Like, it just amazes me. </connor>
<connor> It's like, it's like, Jesus Christ, a cult. </connor>
<garnt> - But then there's like examples, like EDP455. </garnt>
<garnt> And he's definitely not coming back. </garnt>
<connor> - That man is never coming back. </connor>
<connor> - He's trying real hard to come back though. </connor>
<connor> - EDP was a YouTuber who got caught trying to meet up </connor>
<connor> with 14 year olds. </connor>
<joey> - Didn't he, like, try to start his own website </joey>
<connor> or something? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, he did. </connor>
<connor> - Did he actually? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, he did. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> Because he got his YouTube banned, </connor>
<connor> and then he was like, "Finna go to Facebook." </connor>
<connor> - You know it's bad when Facebook bans you. </connor>
<connor> - And then his Facebook got banned. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, Facebook banned him. </connor>
<joey> - So he's like, "I'm gonna start my own website." </joey>
<joey> He's trying really hard, man. </joey>
<connor> - But yeah, the main point of this whole me going </connor>
<joey> on this tangent was that yeah, I feel like as YouTubers, </joey>
<joey> you don't really get a break. </joey>
<joey> I know we're complaining, oh boo hoo us. </joey>
<joey> Who cares? </joey>
<joey> I mean, we have an easy job, so, whatever. </joey>
<joey> But I mean it's yeah, </joey>
<connor> we don't really get like set vacations which sucks. </connor>
<connor> And I kinda miss, </connor>
<connor> you know, one thing I really do miss doing is </connor>
<connor> just being able to have two weeks off, </connor>
<connor> just play video games. </connor>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> Just catch up with shit. </joey>
<joey> Like, I don't even want to go places anymore </joey>
<connor> 'cause I travel anyway on like weekends </connor>
<connor> or whenever I find three days here and there. </connor>
<connor> That's fun, but it feels like you're still doing something. </connor>
<connor> But I just want that, </connor>
<connor> I miss that feeling of like, </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna take two weeks off, catch up to all the movies, </connor>
<garnt> catch up to all the manga, just play video games. </garnt>
<garnt> You know, might start Persona, probably won't. </garnt>
<garnt> Just buy it, just look at it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, so many games in my backlog </garnt>
<connor> that I just want to play. </connor>
<connor> Like, the new Mass Effect remaster got released, </connor>
<connor> and I'm just like, I want to play that. </connor>
<connor> But I haven't even played Persona V Royal yet. </connor>
<garnt> And fuck knows where I'm gonna get the time to do that. </garnt>
<connor> - I now have two wishlists. </connor>
<connor> I have the wishlist where I will actually use the thing </connor>
<connor> and the wishlist where this is just a wishlist </connor>
<connor> where it would be nice, but I won't use it. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, it's the canceled wishlist. </joey>
<garnt> - 'Cause like you said you had a day the other day </garnt>
<garnt> where you just woke up and you did nothing, </garnt>
<joey> and it was amazing. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I kinda just woke up one day, </joey>
<joey> and I was like, well, I don't really have any like videos </joey>
<garnt> to work on. </garnt>
<joey> I don't really have any like other side projects to work on. </joey>
<connor> And so I'm just like, you know what? </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna do a power move. </connor>
<connor> Not do anything. </connor>
<connor> Like, not do anything. </connor>
<connor> I didn't even like check my phone that day. </connor>
<connor> I was like, no, phone turning off. </connor>
<connor> I'm just gonna do shit around the house and just hang out. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, </connor>
<connor> damn, is this what like a weekend feels </connor>
<connor> for every other person? </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> Like, I'm literally experiencing a weekend </connor>
<connor> for the first time in my life. </connor>
<joey> I was like, oh my God, this is fun. </joey>
<joey> I should do this more often. </joey>
<garnt> Fuck. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like, I think for us, especially the last few months, </garnt>
<connor> have just been super fucking busy, </connor>
<connor> with us building this set </connor>
<connor> and having to like film a bunch of episodes to get ahead. </connor>
<connor> I remember we had like this two week period </connor>
<connor> where it was like, we finished building the set, </connor>
<joey> and then we'd film a "Trash Taste" episode every day </joey>
<joey> for like, it was like, </joey>
<joey> we have recording session with either "Trash Taste" </joey>
<joey> or like a Netflix shoot or some kind of, </joey>
<joey> some kind of other live stream every day for like two weeks </joey>
<connor> without any breaks or weekends or anything. </connor>
<joey> - That was brutal. </joey>
<joey> - That was like, I was like close to burnout. </joey>
<connor> - I do fill my schedule a lot on purpose. </connor>
<connor> - Like, I'm jealous of you. </connor>
<joey> I'm jealous of you the most because you view streaming </joey>
<joey> as a downtime. </joey>
<joey> And I'm just like, I wish my downtime could be work. </joey>
<joey> - I wish I could get paid for my downtime. </joey>
<garnt> - Like, I wish I could be paid for my downtime. </garnt>
<garnt> - I just enjoy it. </garnt>
<garnt> And that's why people always complain to me. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, "make a stream schedule." </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, nah, bro. </garnt>
<connor> 'Cause I just do it whenever I want, but I still, </connor>
<connor> I stream often. </connor>
<connor> Around the same times. </connor>
<connor> But people are like- </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, why do you need a stream schedule? </joey>
<joey> You literally stream like, what? </joey>
<joey> Three or four times a week? </joey>
<connor> - 'Cause I think to myself, most of the time </connor>
<connor> whether I decide to stream is normally on the day, </connor>
<connor> that's normally like if I've worked too much </connor>
<connor> or maybe I want to just chill out. </connor>
<connor> You know, maybe I got too much work to do. </connor>
<connor> So I don't want to do it </connor>
<joey> 'cause the moment I commit it to a schedule is </joey>
<joey> when it's work. </joey>
<joey> - Exactly. </joey>
<joey> - If I say I have to stream it this day, it's work. </joey>
<connor> And then that's where I won't start having fun. </connor>
<joey> - Well, I mean, like, I guess for you, </joey>
<joey> it's like good because you have that one game </joey>
<joey> that you can stream, which you also just play casually. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I think when you- </connor>
<joey> - Chess, right? </joey>
<joey> - No. </joey>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<garnt> It is right now. </garnt>
<connor> But like I'm, you know, I'm like, so I mean. </connor>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Probably by the time this out, </garnt>
<garnt> you would have found out the winner of the Tournament Arc 2 </garnt>
<garnt> which we are currently a part of. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, 'cause we are recording these in advance </connor>
<connor> 'cause me and Garnt have had to go to the UK </connor>
<garnt> as we've mentioned. </garnt>
<connor> So yeah, we're quite far ahead right now, </connor>
<connor> but yeah, we're in the middle of a chess tournament. </connor>
<connor> So, been playing a lot of chess recently </connor>
<connor> and really enjoying. </connor>
<connor> But yeah, no, I mean, it is, </connor>
<connor> I think when you are streaming, </connor>
<connor> it is very helpful to have at least one game </connor>
<connor> that you can come back to </connor>
<connor> when you're like running out of ideas. </connor>
<joey> - I think that's what I'm currently trying </joey>
<joey> to find right now is that one game where I'm just like- </joey>
<garnt> - The problem is my one game that I've just played a lot is </garnt>
<connor> just, like, not very popular </connor>
<connor> and whenever I play it- </connor>
<connor> - Shadowverse? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, whenever I play it, everyone's just like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, he's obviously doing this </connor>
<connor> "'cause it's a sponsored stream." </connor>
<garnt> And I'm just like, "No, I just enjoy the game. </garnt>
<garnt> "No one fucking plays this game, but I'll play it." </garnt>
<connor> - I did notice that when I started playing Apex, </connor>
<connor> 'cause Apex is probably the game I've streamed most, </connor>
<connor> that my viewership was quite much considerably lower </connor>
<connor> than normal, but I was like, "Well, no, fuck it. </connor>
<connor> "I like this game. </connor>
<connor> "I'm gonna keep playing it." </connor>
<connor> And then after time it actually like went up to the point </connor>
<connor> where if I stream new games now, </connor>
<connor> it's normally lower than Apex. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I've built up like the following. </connor>
<garnt> You have to stick through it. </garnt>
<connor> - I feel like you also got very lucky as well </connor>
<connor> 'cause Apex did just have a massive boom in general </connor>
<connor> because of like every V-Tuber under the sun playing it. </connor>
<connor> - Apex Raid of Shadows. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, Apex Raid of Shadows. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I don't know why that was not even intentional. </garnt>
<garnt> I was just playing it, </garnt>
<connor> and then I started seeing every V-Tuber playing. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, whoa, what the fuck? </connor>
<joey> - See, that's not gonna happen with my comfort game. </joey>
<garnt> 'Cause my comfort game is about 30 years old. </garnt>
<garnt> - What's your comfort game? </garnt>
<garnt> - Like, any Final Fantasy game. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So, I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> I can't like fucking stream Final Fantasy VI, </connor>
<garnt> even though that's one of my favorite games of all time </garnt>
<garnt> because no one's gonna fucking watch it. </garnt>
<joey> And it sucks, you know? </joey>
<garnt> - Well, would you even want to stream your comfort games? </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, yeah, because I think like, again, </joey>
<joey> it's like Apex with Connor where it's like, </joey>
<connor> it's just a comfort game, right? </connor>
<connor> Like, you don't necessarily have to see it as work </connor>
<connor> or like you don't have to necessarily be like entertaining </connor>
<connor> and wacky and goofy </connor>
<connor> and, you know, trying to hold an audience. </connor>
<connor> Like, you can just play a game casually </connor>
<joey> as you would normally do </joey>
<joey> and people would just be there to watch you play it, right? </joey>
<connor> - It's different. </connor>
<connor> It's very different to my normal streams as well, I'd say. </connor>
<connor> Depends on what I'm doing. </connor>
<joey> - You're a lot more quiet during your Apex streams. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, definitely. </connor>
<joey> 'Cause I'm focusing on the game. </joey>
<joey> So, it's like I talk in between stuff happening. </joey>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - So, it depends on what's going on. </garnt>
<garnt> But that's why like I like talking to Japanese people </garnt>
<connor> on there 'cause it's fun. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I'm trying to find more things that I want to watch. </garnt>
<garnt> That's like, I feel like I'm more like, </garnt>
<garnt> I like doing passive things rather than active things </garnt>
<connor> a lot of times in my downtime. </connor>
<connor> Like, the other day, like a few days ago, </connor>
<connor> I ended up watching all of "Loki," the new Marvel series. </connor>
<connor> It's actually really fucking good. </connor>
<connor> Like, I'm not that invested in the Marvel franchise, </connor>
<connor> so I was just like, oh, I'll just put on one episode, </connor>
<connor> just see what it's about, </connor>
<connor> and I just ended up binging the entire thing. </connor>
<connor> And I was just like, this is fucking amazing. </connor>
<connor> It was only six episodes, </connor>
<garnt> but every episode is 40 minutes long. </garnt>
<garnt> So, I basically just binged an entire season of anime. </garnt>
<garnt> That's how I think of things. </garnt>
<garnt> - But it wasn't anime. </garnt>
<garnt> - But it wasn't anime, and I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> damn, why can't I do this with anime anymore? </garnt>
<garnt> Fuck, man. </garnt>
<garnt> I missed that so much. </garnt>
<connor> - So busy now where I like dread good stuff coming out </connor>
<connor> 'cause I'm like, fuck, I gotta find time to watch this now. </connor>
<joey> - See, if only you could like watch "Loki" on Twitch. </joey>
<garnt> (Garnt laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> Just use that as your downtime. </garnt>
<joey> Just have people watching you. </joey>
<joey> - Honestly, I would love to have watch parties </joey>
<connor> with like different things I'm watching, </connor>
<connor> but obviously DMCA shit- </connor>
<joey> - Obvious reasons. </joey>
<joey> - Obvious reasons, can't do that. </joey>
<joey> But like, 'cause like I know Sydney, </joey>
<joey> her downtime thing is that she watches horror movies, </joey>
<garnt> and I don't know how she finds so many fucking horror movies </garnt>
<joey> to watch. </joey>
<joey> I didn't know this many horror movies existed. </joey>
<garnt> She watches at least three new horror movies every week. </garnt>
<joey> At least. </joey>
<joey> - The cesspool of horror movies is like never ending. </joey>
<joey> It's actually insane. </joey>
<garnt> - 'Cause I was never, I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> I was never big into horror movies. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't really like horror movies. </garnt>
<garnt> And I assume you guys aren't big fans either </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause none of it showed up on our three by threes. </garnt>
<garnt> Not a single one. </garnt>
<joey> - There's some good ones, but it's like, </joey>
<joey> it's not my favorite genre that's for sure. </joey>
<connor> - But she somehow finds so many- </connor>
<connor> - "The Shining." </connor>
<connor> - Huh? </connor>
<connor> - "The Shining" is really good. </connor>
<connor> - "Shining" is good. </connor>
<connor> I like "The Shining." </connor>
<connor> There's only a few horror movies that I really like. </connor>
<connor> "Shining" is one of them. </connor>
<connor> I've really, 'cause like, </connor>
<garnt> my taste in horror movies is really niche I think. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I like kind of Lovecraftian horror. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I don't like the usual, like, you know, jump scares, </garnt>
<garnt> ghost, paranormal stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, that's the problem. </garnt>
<connor> So much of horror is jump scares. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, it is. </garnt>
<connor> - It is cheap and reliable. </connor>
<connor> - I think that's why I'm such a big fan of, like, </connor>
<connor> Junji Ito and stuff like that. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause it's really like, </connor>
<connor> the horror that I like is really just the ones </connor>
<garnt> that really unsettle me. </garnt>
<joey> - Macabre horror. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - I'm exactly like that. </garnt>
<joey> Like, the kind of like Asian horror is like definitely </joey>
<connor> more my taste in horror. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause again, it's like, you see like, you know, </connor>
<joey> you watch one "Paranormal Activity," </joey>
<joey> you've basically seen them all. </joey>
<garnt> - How the fuck did "Paranormal Activity" get so big? </garnt>
<joey> - It's because Steven Spielberg greenlit it. </joey>
<connor> - Is that true? </connor>
<connor> - So I actually read up on it </connor>
<connor> 'cause I had the exact same thought. </connor>
<connor> I was like, I saw fucking the trailer </connor>
<joey> of a "Paranormal Activity 73." </joey>
<connor> And I was like, how? </connor>
<connor> Why are there so many? </connor>
<joey> - But I remember when it came out, </joey>
<connor> I was in school and everyone was like, </connor>
<connor> "This is the scariest movie ever. </connor>
<connor> "So scary." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I know, right? </connor>
<garnt> And everyone was like shitting their pants over it. </garnt>
<garnt> I remember 'cause I was in university at the time. </garnt>
<connor> And so I was like, all right, </connor>
<connor> I'll see what the hype's about </connor>
<connor> because back then my roommates had a watch party </connor>
<connor> and then we watched "Paranormal Activity," the first one. </connor>
<connor> And everyone was like jumping </connor>
<connor> at just like the fucking closet opening. </connor>
<connor> And I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> I can literally see the fucking string being used </connor>
<garnt> to open this fucking door. </garnt>
<garnt> How is this scary? </garnt>
<garnt> What is going on? </garnt>
<connor> - One remote press. </connor>
<connor> - I watched one that I thought wasn't bad. </connor>
<connor> What was it? </connor>
<connor> "The Invisible Man." </connor>
<connor> It wasn't that bad actually. </connor>
<connor> Is that what it's called? </connor>
<garnt> - Oh "The Invisible Man." </garnt>
<connor> The one about the- </connor>
<connor> - Invisible man. </connor>
<garnt> - Sydney showed me that one. </garnt>
<connor> It was all right. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I quite liked that one. </connor>
<connor> I watched it in the cinemas. </connor>
<connor> Pretty good. </connor>
<joey> I enjoyed that one. </joey>
<joey> - I watched the other day, </joey>
<joey> I finally watched, what is it? </joey>
<joey> "Hereditary." </joey>
<connor> - Oh. </connor>
<joey> - How was that one? </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause I missed out on it when it first came out, </joey>
<connor> so I kinda missed the initial hype on it </connor>
<connor> because I was like, eh, western horror, </connor>
<connor> it's whatever for me. </connor>
<connor> But then I think Felix showed me "Midsommar," </connor>
<connor> which is done by the same guy, Ari Aster. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, okay, this is very creepy, </connor>
<connor> but also kind of cool and experimental. </connor>
<connor> So I was like, all right. </connor>
<connor> I heard "Hereditary" was pretty good. </connor>
<connor> I watched it. </connor>
<connor> It's weird. </connor>
<connor> I almost wouldn't even call it a horror film. </connor>
<connor> It's like, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> You know what it feels like. </connor>
<connor> It feels like if David Lynch made a horror film, you know? </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Okay. </connor>
<garnt> - Where it's like, it's scary- </garnt>
<garnt> - As we established in the previous three by three, </garnt>
<connor> Joey, the big art snob. </connor>
<connor> David Lynch. </connor>
<garnt> - I feel like you just, </garnt>
<joey> to make a good horror movie, you have to be fucked up. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Just be completely fucked up. </connor>
<connor> - To make any horror content, </connor>
<joey> I feel you need to be fucked up in some aspect. </joey>
<garnt> - Actually me and Sydney watched, </garnt>
<garnt> we had a night the other day </garnt>
<connor> that we just kind of like binged part of, like, </connor>
<connor> the "Final Destination" series. </connor>
<connor> And the reason for that was </connor>
<connor> because I kind of remembered my very first- </connor>
<connor> - As a teenager, I loved those films. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> I remember the very first time </connor>
<connor> I watched "Final Destination," </connor>
<connor> and it was actually in school. </connor>
<connor> So I think it was like, </connor>
<connor> I think it was like middle school at the time. </connor>
<connor> So, I was like, I think around 12, 13 years old. </connor>
<garnt> And I don't know if the same thing for Australia, </garnt>
<garnt> but you know, like, at the end of term in school, right, </garnt>
<garnt> it's kind of like a free for all. </garnt>
<garnt> And the teachers, it's kind of like that period </garnt>
<garnt> where it's like the last two classes of the year </garnt>
<garnt> or something, teachers just let you do </garnt>
<garnt> whatever the fuck you want. </garnt>
<joey> Was that true in Australia? </joey>
<connor> - I definitely think, it depends on the school, but yeah. </connor>
<connor> I think most schools, it was kind of just like, </connor>
<joey> "I'm going on break in fucking three days, whatever." </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, so it was just like, in the school that I was in, </garnt>
<joey> you just had a week period </joey>
<garnt> where you just basically go to class </garnt>
<connor> and every teacher would put on a different film or like- </connor>
<joey> - Just roll in the TV, right? </joey>
<joey> - Just roll in the TV. </joey>
<connor> And everyone would watch a different film </connor>
<garnt> and like fucking 90% of the time it was "Shrek." </garnt>
<connor> It was fucking, it was just always "Shrek." </connor>
<connor> - I was about to say, we watched "Shrek" like every year. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, good, good to know that </connor>
<connor> that was just a nationwide thing. </connor>
<connor> - It's that time of year again. </connor>
<connor> - End of year, all right. </connor>
<connor> I guess it's "Shrek" again. </connor>
<connor> And I remember this one class, </connor>
<connor> one of my classmates brought in a DVD. </connor>
<connor> Because we were just, </connor>
<connor> because the teacher would ask, </connor>
<connor> what does everyone want to watch? </connor>
<connor> And so this guy, Samuel, </connor>
<connor> he brings out the DVD and he brings out "Final Destination." </connor>
<connor> And he was like, </connor>
<connor> "This is a film I think the entire class would want </connor>
<connor> "to watch." </connor>
<connor> And everyone's like, "Yeah, sure!" </connor>
<connor> - How old were you? </connor>
<connor> - I think we were like 12 at the time. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> - That is scarring for a 12 year old. </connor>
<joey> - I had not heard of "Final Destination" at the time, </joey>
<joey> but we were like, "Yeah, sure." </joey>
<joey> Like, 'cause, like, you know, </joey>
<joey> anything to get us away from "Shrek" or whatever </joey>
<joey> or whatever the usual films we were watching. </joey>
<connor> He was like, </connor>
<connor> "Miss, I think the classroom would want to watch this." </connor>
<connor> And nobody kind of like opposed it. </connor>
<connor> And the teacher had never heard of the film before. </connor>
<connor> So, she was like- </connor>
<connor> - That's dangerous. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] So she was like- </connor>
<connor> - This boy just had this DVD on him. </connor>
<connor> - I think he knew what he's doing. </connor>
<connor> And so the film starts off in "Final Destination" </connor>
<connor> and characters are, </connor>
<connor> like, I don't know what the rating was like back then, </connor>
<connor> but characters were already swearing. </connor>
<connor> But I think in PG films in like the UK, </connor>
<connor> even if you have like one or two swear words, </connor>
<connor> it can still be skewered towards like the lower ratings </connor>
<connor> if it's just like one or two swear words. </connor>
<connor> - I think so, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, so like characters, </connor>
<connor> so I remember the opening scene where the, like, </connor>
<connor> get on the plane and people start arguing or whatever, </connor>
<connor> it's kind of sus because you can hear people </connor>
<connor> obviously swearing and the teacher's just like, </connor>
<connor> "Samuel, is this suitable for this age range?" </connor>
<connor> He's like, "Yeah, Miss, don't worry. </connor>
<connor> "It's just the opening scene. </connor>
<connor> "Don't worry, Miss. </connor>
<connor> "Don't worry about it." </connor>
<connor> And she's like, "Okay, okay." </connor>
<connor> So, I remember the opening scene is where, like, </connor>
<connor> I think it's where the plane crashes. </connor>
<connor> That's the first "Final Destination." </connor>
<connor> I remember (laughs) so, a bunch of 12 year olds are </connor>
<connor> just watching this plane take off, </connor>
<connor> and then obviously the plane starts to crash, </connor>
<connor> the wing snaps, and everyone's fucking screaming. </connor>
<garnt> It's terrifying in the scene. </garnt>
<garnt> And then you see like blood splatter, </garnt>
<garnt> and then you see someone getting burned alive </garnt>
<garnt> and (laughs) immediately, like, </garnt>
<garnt> the teacher gets up aggressively gets off to the TV. </garnt>
<garnt> Doesn't even switch it off, unplugs the TV. </garnt>
<garnt> And goes, "Samuel, get outside now!" </garnt>
<garnt> And that was my very first experience </garnt>
<garnt> of "Final Destination." </garnt>
<garnt> - Absolute Chad Samuel. </garnt>
<joey> He was like, he probably walked out was like, "Worth it!" </joey>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> - I remember one of them put, like, it was in art class, </connor>
<connor> I remember this. </connor>
<connor> And like the teacher was not tech savvy at all. </connor>
<connor> And he put Meatspin on all the PCs, </connor>
<connor> and then took it, just unplugged all the mouse </connor>
<connor> and keyboards. </connor>
<joey> And the teacher's having a mental breakdown, </joey>
<joey> didn't understand why he couldn't just like, </joey>
<joey> he was like fucking hammering the keyboard. </joey>
<joey> Like, why wasn't it turning off? </joey>
<connor> And then started hitting the monitor, </connor>
<connor> and turned the monitor off. </connor>
<connor> I don't even think he knew how to turn it off. </connor>
<connor> And then he didn't know how to turn it off. </connor>
<connor> He didn't even think of unplugging it or anything. </connor>
<connor> So, this was still playing the whole time. </connor>
<connor> And then goes and gets another teacher to come. </connor>
<connor> And he's like, "Why don't you turn it off?" </connor>
<connor> He's like, "Oh, I didn't know how." </connor>
<connor> He presses the button to turn it off. </connor>
<connor> - Classic Meatspin. </connor>
<connor> - Meatspin, and it was like these poor girls as well. </connor>
<connor> I'd never seen it. </connor>
<connor> - Don't look it up if you don't know what that is. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause obviously we're all like 12. </connor>
<connor> Every guy had seen it. </connor>
<connor> We're all like, "Yeah, you seen Meatspin?" </connor>
<connor> If you're a guy and fucking idiot. </connor>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - I mean, it was like Meatspin, Lemon Party. </connor>
<connor> - Lemon Party, Goatsey. </connor>
<connor> - You didn't know what Goatsey was. </connor>
<connor> - I didn't know what Goatsey was. </connor>
<garnt> That was obviously like a few years past. </garnt>
<garnt> - Garnt, what was it? </garnt>
<garnt> You came in the office like, what? </garnt>
<garnt> Like a month ago? </garnt>
<connor> And was like, "I just found out what Goatsey is." </connor>
<connor> And we were like, "Oh, how did you find that out?" </connor>
<connor> How did you find out? </connor>
<garnt> - How do you find out about Goatsey in 2021? </garnt>
<joey> - You guys were the ones who told me about it. </joey>
<joey> - Were we? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, it was like literally recording a "Trash Taste." </connor>
<garnt> And you were just telling- </garnt>
<garnt> - Why was I talking about Goatsey? </garnt>
<joey> - In an episode? </joey>
<garnt> - No, this wasn't in an episode. </garnt>
<garnt> It was like before we started recording. </garnt>
<garnt> - You didn't know what it was? </garnt>
<garnt> - No, I didn't. </garnt>
<garnt> - And we were like you don't know what Meatspin was, </garnt>
<garnt> you don't know what Goatsey was? </garnt>
<joey> - I had to explain to Garnt what Goatsey was. </joey>
<joey> - Please don't look it up. </joey>
<connor> It's some man spreading his butt cheeks. </connor>
<garnt> - It's 2021. </garnt>
<connor> You don't need to know what Meatspin is or Goatsey. </connor>
<connor> - It's all just like websites </connor>
<connor> of people doing horrible things. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> Pretty sure we can find way worse stuff </connor>
<connor> on the internet now anyways. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah, of course you do. </connor>
<connor> - But back when we were growing up, </connor>
<garnt> this was just like the shit you like show your mates like. </garnt>
<joey> - "Hey, there's this really cool thing </joey>
<garnt> "if you Google Meatspin. </garnt>
<garnt> "Two girls one cup." </garnt>
<joey> Two girls one cup is still scarring to this day. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - I remember watching that. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, going back to horror movies. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, I would like to find... </garnt>
<garnt> A horror movie I really liked, </garnt>
<connor> has anyone seen "Annihilation?" </connor>
<connor> The one with Natalie Portman in it. </connor>
<connor> - I've heard of it. </connor>
<connor> - That sounds so familiar. </connor>
<connor> What happens in this? </connor>
<connor> Give us the plot breakdown. </connor>
<connor> - So the plot breakdown is that there's an alien artifact </connor>
<connor> or some artifact from space that crash lands </connor>
<connor> somewhere in the world, obviously, </connor>
<connor> and it creates this kind of force field barrier. </connor>
<connor> And you can easily enter the barrier, </connor>
<connor> but you can't get any like electrical signals </connor>
<connor> or any like communications. </connor>
<connor> - Who else does this feature? </connor>
<connor> - This features Natalie Portman. </connor>
<connor> - And? </connor>
<connor> Is it Hawkeye? </connor>
<garnt> - No, you're thinking of "Arrival." </garnt>
<connor> - That was the one, fuck. </connor>
<connor> - Which I really like "Arrival." </connor>
<connor> - I heard that was good. </connor>
<connor> - That was good. </connor>
<garnt> That's not a horror movie though. </garnt>
<joey> - I thought it was. </joey>
<joey> - It's just a sci-fi. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I just want more sci-fi stuff, </garnt>
<joey> which I think is why I was really into "Loki." </joey>
<connor> And so, (coughs) and so they can't get any (coughs) sorry. </connor>
<connor> They can't get any signals in there, </connor>
<connor> so they don't know what's going on in there. </connor>
<connor> And every team that they've sent in there </connor>
<connor> just never finds their way out. </connor>
<connor> So they literally don't know what's going on in there. </connor>
<connor> And this force field is slowly, slowly expanding, </connor>
<connor> so eventually it will cover the whole Earth. </connor>
<connor> So, they need to kind of stop it. </connor>
<connor> They need to kind of figure it out. </connor>
<connor> And so they send this team of scientists </connor>
<connor> to go investigate what's inside there. </connor>
<connor> And I kind of won't spoil it from there </connor>
<connor> because a lot of- </connor>
<connor> - Sounds good. </connor>
<connor> - A lot of weird things happen, </connor>
<connor> and it's not, </connor>
<connor> so what I liked about it is it was just, like, </connor>
<connor> really, it's really terrifying, </connor>
<connor> but not because of any jump scares. </connor>
<connor> Just some of the ideas within this, you know, </connor>
<connor> some of the ideas of what happens to the people </connor>
<connor> within this circle are just like really unsettling </connor>
<connor> and really terrifying. </connor>
<garnt> It is very much like a kind of like Junji Ito ideas </garnt>
<garnt> where it's just really weird kind of ideas that you don't, </garnt>
<garnt> you kind of have to have, like, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know what kind of minds you need to come up </garnt>
<garnt> with these things, but it's that, </garnt>
<garnt> I would like more horror like that. </garnt>
<garnt> And I dunno where to start with recommendations, </garnt>
<garnt> which is why, if anyone knows any, then I'm all open. </garnt>
<connor> - What was that film with Nicholas Cage? </connor>
<connor> And there's like numbers and there's a kid </connor>
<connor> who like has the number- </connor>
<connor> - "Knowing." </connor>
<garnt> - "Knowing?" </garnt>
<garnt> That's the one. - I don't know how I remember. </garnt>
<connor> - That's the one. </connor>
<connor> Have you seen that movie? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I've seen that movie. </connor>
<connor> - What is it? </connor>
<connor> - I can't remember. </connor>
<connor> but I remember it being really stupid. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<garnt> Nicholas Cage, like, he like stops like a plane crashing </garnt>
<connor> or something. </connor>
<garnt> - No, no, I think, 'cause I watched this as a kid. </garnt>
<garnt> I remember he, I think it's like- </garnt>
<garnt> - This needs to be a series </garnt>
<connor> where we just try to poorly recollect movies. </connor>
<connor> Like, what's this movie I watched? </connor>
<connor> That movie where like this thing happened? </connor>
<connor> - Okay, okay, I'm gonna try and recreate this movie </connor>
<connor> from what I remember. </connor>
<connor> - How do you remember this perfectly? </connor>
<connor> - Because, okay, so as a kid in the summer, </connor>
<connor> this is going on another tangent now. </connor>
<connor> So, my summers consisted of me going to Thailand </connor>
<connor> and me spending like six weeks in Thailand. </connor>
<connor> And obviously I wouldn't have something to do every day. </connor>
<connor> So, like part of my childhood experience is going </connor>
<connor> to the mall and just like </connor>
<connor> in basically every Southeast Asian country, </connor>
<connor> there'll be these stands </connor>
<connor> where you have these like DVD covers and you just like, </connor>
<connor> you just like flip through the covers </connor>
<connor> and just choose which movies you'd want to see. </connor>
<connor> And some of them weren't out on DVD yet officially. </connor>
<connor> So you just flip through them and you just want, </connor>
<connor> I want that one, I want that one, I want that one, </connor>
<connor> I want that one. </connor>
<connor> And then they'd ask you to go walk in the mall </connor>
<connor> for like a good half an hour to an hour. </connor>
<connor> And then they'll call you. </connor>
<connor> And tell you when your purchase is ready. </connor>
<connor> Which was 100% totally legal of course. </connor>
<connor> - We all know that Southeast Asia has </connor>
<connor> very strict copyright enforcement. </connor>
<garnt> - Yes, yes, yes. </garnt>
<garnt> So, like, my summer would just be basically watching </garnt>
<garnt> every blockbuster Hollywood movie that came out that year </garnt>
<garnt> because that, I looked forward to it </garnt>
<connor> because I could literally pick every film- </connor>
<connor> - To this day, "Knowing" is still the best. </connor>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - And to this day, I still remember "Knowing." </garnt>
<garnt> That's honestly why "5O First Dates" almost went </garnt>
<garnt> on my three by three because I'd watched that so many times. </garnt>
<connor> - I thought you were gonna say because of "Knowing" </connor>
<connor> or something. </connor>
<connor> I was like, what does this have to do with it? </connor>
<connor> - There's only one movie that tops "Knowing." </connor>
<garnt> "50 First Dates." </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, so like I've watched so many of these films, </garnt>
<connor> which are now what I classify as like airplane films. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause now I would not watch them in any other circumstances </connor>
<connor> unless I was on an airplane. </connor>
<connor> But "Knowing" was one of the films </connor>
<connor> that I was stuck inside indoors in Thailand, </connor>
<garnt> had nothing to do but just watch films. </garnt>
<garnt> And from what I remember, it was the, </garnt>
<garnt> I think it had to do with like a time capsule </garnt>
<garnt> that was buried ages ago. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, right! </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, that was it. </garnt>
<connor> And there was like a number, like, a cipher or something. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, there was some kind of cipher </garnt>
<connor> or something that like that, </connor>
<connor> like, predicted the apocalypse or something. </connor>
<joey> - Immediately sounds dumb. </joey>
<connor> - And Nicholas Cage was just like, "I see the future. </connor>
<connor> "I see what's going to happen." </connor>
<connor> - "The numbers!" </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> - And stuff, Nicholas Cage things happen. </connor>
<connor> And then the world literally ends. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I think it's a solar flare that kills everyone. </connor>
<connor> Spoilers if you ever wanted to watch "Knowing." </connor>
<connor> - I wanted to watch "Knowing." </connor>
<connor> - If you ever wanted to watch the masterpiece </connor>
<connor> that is Nicholas Cage's "Knowing." </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> How did we get on this topic? </connor>
<connor> - Just talking about movies. </connor>
<garnt> Talking about horror movies. </garnt>
<garnt> That was a horror. </garnt>
<garnt> - Is that a horror movie? </garnt>
<garnt> - I think it is horror. </garnt>
<connor> Supposed to be horror. </connor>
<connor> - As in it's horrible. </connor>
<connor> - I'm looking it up right now. </connor>
<garnt> Hey! </garnt>
<connor> I'm looking it up right now. </connor>
<connor> "Knowing" Nicholas Cage. </connor>
<garnt> - Can we take a break? </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I need to pee. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm very hot right now. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I find out it is a science fiction film, </connor>
<garnt> not a horror film. </garnt>
<garnt> But it was- </garnt>
<garnt> - It was pretty horror. </garnt>
<connor> - It felt like horror. </connor>
<joey> - Whatever happened to Nicholas Cage? </joey>
<garnt> - I don't know, he's just busy. </garnt>
<joey> - Kind of went off the rails, didn't he? </joey>
<joey> - A little bit. </joey>
<joey> I don't know. </joey>
<joey> I don't feel educated enough to talk about him. </joey>
<joey> (Connor laughs) </joey>
<connor> I don't really keep up with Nicholas Cage's life. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, how many Nicholas Cage films have you seen? </connor>
<garnt> - A fair amount. </garnt>
<garnt> - Too many. </garnt>
<connor> - Really? </connor>
<connor> - Probably more than I care to admit. </connor>
<connor> - I probably watched one and I was like- </connor>
<connor> - What? </connor>
<garnt> - One? </garnt>
<garnt> - You didn't watch "Con Air?" </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, "Con Air," I was about to say "Con Air." </joey>
<joey> - I've heard of that one. </joey>
<garnt> - Fucking classic. </garnt>
<joey> - I think I watched, </joey>
<joey> what was the one where he was in Vegas? </joey>
<connor> - "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas." </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas." </joey>
<joey> I watched that. </joey>
<garnt> - The film with Las Vegas in the title. </garnt>
<garnt> - Did that have Nicholas Cage in it? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, that was Nicholas Cage. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, had no idea. </connor>
<connor> - I watched "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas," </connor>
<joey> and I was like, all right. </joey>
<joey> - Wait, is that a remake? </joey>
<joey> Is it a remake? </joey>
<connor> I feel like it is. - I think it is. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> I watched that and I saw his like, you know, </joey>
<connor> the scene where he like fucking loses it in the casino? </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah! </connor>
<connor> That one! </connor>
<joey> - And I was like, all right. </joey>
<joey> I just got like, at that moment I was like, </joey>
<connor> I understand Nicholas Cage now. </connor>
<connor> And then everything else I've seen from Nicholas Cage has </connor>
<joey> just been like YouTube clips from other movies that he's in. </joey>
<garnt> - Honestly, that's all you need </garnt>
<joey> to like experience Nicholas Cage. </joey>
<garnt> - I feel like that is the best way </garnt>
<joey> to experience Nicholas Cage is out of context movie clips. </joey>
<garnt> - I think one of my favorite YouTube Nicholas Cage clips is, </garnt>
<garnt> there's a lot by the way. </garnt>
<garnt> There's a lot. </garnt>
<connor> But one of my favorites is just someone edited him </connor>
<connor> like during like a driving scene or something, </connor>
<connor> and it's just like, </connor>
<connor> it's just him like getting into a car, </connor>
<connor> and just, it out of context, </connor>
<connor> it looks like he's just play driving. </connor>
<connor> Like, it's so hard to describe, </connor>
<connor> but it's, you gotta watch it. </connor>
<connor> And another thing is just Nicholas Cage </connor>
<connor> slowly losing his mind as well. </connor>
<connor> Have you seen that one? </connor>
<connor> Where it's just like him slowly getting more and more crazy </connor>
<connor> as the clip goes to the soundtrack of Requiem of Dreams. </connor>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> It's absolutely fucking amazing. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't think I've seen this one. </garnt>
<garnt> - I got to show you afterwards. </garnt>
<joey> - [Navi] "Fear and Loathing" is not a remake. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, it's not a remake? </garnt>
<garnt> - [Navi] It's a screenplay adaptation of a novel, I think. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh, okay, okay. </connor>
<connor> - It's not a remake. </connor>
<garnt> - But yeah, what happened to Nicholas Cage? </garnt>
<garnt> We could use more Nicholas Cage films honestly. </garnt>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<joey> I don't know. </joey>
<garnt> I can't remember how we got onto the topic of Nicholas Cage. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh no, I lied. </joey>
<joey> I've seen that other film with Nicholas Cage. </joey>
<joey> The, not the bees one. </joey>
<garnt> What the fuck was that called again? </garnt>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<connor> What the fuck is the name of that movie? </connor>
<garnt> - I have not seen the bees one. </garnt>
<connor> - I've not seen that movie, but I've seen- </connor>
<garnt> - I've seen the clips. </garnt>
<garnt> - "Wicker Man." </garnt>
<joey> I saw that. </joey>
<joey> I watched "Wicker Man" just because that, you know, </joey>
<joey> the fucking "not the bees!" one was like, </joey>
<joey> it was a meme for the longest time. </joey>
<garnt> So I'm like, well, I mean. </garnt>
<garnt> It was a funny meme, </garnt>
<joey> but I kind of want to see this scene in context. </joey>
<garnt> I just got really curious. </garnt>
<joey> I was like, I want to see- </joey>
<joey> - Do you need to see the scene in context? </joey>
<joey> - So, I watched it in context. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, did you? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, makes just as much sense out of context honestly. </joey>
<connor> It was the first time where I watched it </connor>
<connor> and then I instantly recognized the meme. </connor>
<connor> I was like, oh, this is the scene. </connor>
<joey> Finally, I'll be able to understand why they pour the bees </joey>
<joey> in the basket. </joey>
<joey> And I watched it, I was like, </joey>
<joey> nope, I don't know. </joey>
<joey> Did I like pass out for like five minutes or something. </joey>
<joey> It just suddenly went to the scene. </joey>
<garnt> I was like, wait, I don't understand why, </garnt>
<joey> this is kind of unnecessary. </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<garnt> - What's that film even about? </garnt>
<joey> - I don't even remember. </joey>
<garnt> The only scene I remember is the bee scene. </garnt>
<garnt> I think everybody who watched "Wicker Man" </garnt>
<connor> only remembers that scene. </connor>
<joey> - The bees scene. </joey>
<joey> - The bees scene. </joey>
<connor> - Is there any other scene in the movie? </connor>
<connor> It's just that. </connor>
<joey> - Nothing that's notable, no. </joey>
<joey> Nothing that's worth putting to memory. </joey>
<garnt> - My God. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, like on the topic of horror films, </garnt>
<garnt> one thing that always like fascinated me as a kid </garnt>
<garnt> that I don't think is around anymore is, like, </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like part of the, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> the blockbuster or rental DVD experience </garnt>
<connor> for me was going to the rental, like the Blockbuster </connor>
<connor> and just seeing like the fucking horrific DVD covers </connor>
<connor> of like every horror movie. </connor>
<connor> I don't know why. </connor>
<connor> Like, those fascinated me as a kid. </connor>
<connor> - Were they bad? </connor>
<garnt> Or like, what do you mean horrific? </garnt>
<connor> Like, scary? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, they were like really fucking terrifying. </joey>
<garnt> - I was like, 'cause the Blockbuster near my house, </garnt>
<garnt> well, that's not there anymore obviously. </garnt>
<connor> It was separated into aisles for different genres. </connor>
<connor> All of the action blockbusters were in one aisle, </connor>
<connor> all the romance were in one aisle. </connor>
<connor> And then right on like the far left of the Blockbuster </connor>
<connor> there was the aisle for all the horror films. </connor>
<connor> I was so scared to walk down that aisle. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> Just because, like, just in my periphery, </connor>
<connor> you just see this like terrifying looking movies. </connor>
<connor> And it's, like, usually it's got like a really scary face </connor>
<connor> that's like looking right in front. </connor>
<connor> I'm just like- </connor>
<connor> - You were scared of seeing the horror? </connor>
<connor> - Honestly, I'm like, I'm kind of a pussy honestly. </connor>
<connor> When it comes to films, I'm kind of a pussy. </connor>
<joey> - I'm a proud pussy. </joey>
<connor> - I will happily admit that, like, </connor>
<joey> Sydney tries to get me to watch horror film. </joey>
<garnt> I'm like, no, Sydney, I am too scared. </garnt>
<connor> - I think 'cause I had an older brother, two older brothers, </connor>
<connor> I think I just saw the covers laying around a bunch. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause they were like, you know, my oldest brother was like, </connor>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<connor> I actually don't know how many years older he is than me. </connor>
<joey> I can't keep track. </joey>
<joey> - I can actually remember that- </joey>
<connor> - Like five or six. </connor>
<connor> - I can actually remember the time </connor>
<connor> where I realized I hated horror films is because. like, </connor>
<connor> I think I was like five or six years old. </connor>
<connor> And I was in the living room </connor>
<connor> and my parents were watching "The Ring." </connor>
<connor> - Oh. </connor>
<connor> - And like, obviously, you know, </connor>
<connor> I was kind of just hanging around </connor>
<connor> while they were just watching that movie. </connor>
<connor> But I remember I looked over at the TV and it was the scene </connor>
<connor> where comes out of the TV. </connor>
<connor> And that was the moment where I was like, I hate this. </connor>
<connor> I hate this. </connor>
<connor> I hate anything that is like this. </connor>
<joey> I hate any film that is like blue gradient. </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<garnt> - Blue gradient! </garnt>
<garnt> The VHS. </garnt>
<garnt> - The true horror is </garnt>
<garnt> when you're like 14 watching a film with your parents </garnt>
<garnt> and a sex scene comes on. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my God. </garnt>
<connor> - #Relatable. </connor>
<connor> - And you're like, I don't know what this is. </connor>
<joey> I have no idea what's going on. </joey>
<connor> - Even a kiss scene for me was like- </connor>
<connor> - Really? </connor>
<connor> You're like. </connor>
<connor> - Like, a way too dragged out kiss scene. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> It's not like a peck. </connor>
<connor> It's like a make-out scene. </connor>
<connor> It doesn't go to the sex scene. </connor>
<connor> It's just stopped. </connor>
<connor> It's probably like a PG film or something. </connor>
<connor> It's just a really long make-out scene. </connor>
<garnt> I'm just like, guys, we get it. </garnt>
<garnt> Get a fucking room. </garnt>
<joey> All right, please. </joey>
<joey> My parents are here. </joey>
<garnt> Stop it. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause like I remember back way back </garnt>
<connor> when the age of like teen comedy flicks </connor>
<connor> with stuff like "American Pie" and stuff like that. </connor>
<garnt> I don't know why- </garnt>
<connor> - "American Pie" was always on TV in the UK. </connor>
<garnt> - Really? </garnt>
<garnt> - On ITV2. </garnt>
<garnt> It was always on. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, it was always on. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was always on at like 10:00 to 11:00. </garnt>
<connor> For some reason they play all the "American Pie" films </connor>
<garnt> all the time. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, everyone in the UK has seen "American Pie." </garnt>
<garnt> - It was always uncut as well. </garnt>
<connor> It was the closest thing we had like to- </connor>
<connor> - They showed boobs and stuff. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, whoa, whoa, it's 11:00 PM. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> - And of course your parents would have to walk in </connor>
<connor> during every fucking nude scene, </connor>
<connor> every fucking make-out scene. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I remember my parents walked in </connor>
<garnt> when I was watching "American Pie 2," </garnt>
<garnt> and of course there was like the lesbian make-out scene. </garnt>
<garnt> And of course that was the scene </garnt>
<garnt> that they had to walk through. </garnt>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - Have those movies aged well? </connor>
<garnt> I don't think they've aged- </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't think they've aged well at all. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I haven't seen "American Pie" in a while. </garnt>
<joey> - I think all those kinds of, like, </joey>
<joey> teenage comedy films have just not aged well. </joey>
<garnt> Like, "Scary Movie" has not aged well. </garnt>
<connor> - "Scary Movie" was never funny. </connor>
<joey> - It's less funny now. </joey>
<connor> - One time I was watching something and it was, like, </connor>
<connor> I think there was drugs and sex in it </connor>
<connor> and I was just playing my GameBoy. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - While this was going on. </connor>
<connor> They were like, oh, </connor>
<connor> I remember I was like 12 or something, </connor>
<connor> my parents were like, "Oh, don't worry. </connor>
<connor> "He doesn't understand anything." </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, I'm like, I think I do. </connor>
<connor> I'm just pretending like I'm not paying attention. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> They were like, "I think it's fine. </connor>
<connor> "I don't think he gets it. </connor>
<connor> "I don't think he understands what's happening." </connor>
<joey> And I'm like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah." </joey>
<garnt> - Meanwhile you're like, "Damn." </garnt>
<connor> - I'm like, "Whoa, this is weird." </connor>
<connor> - Did your parents ever say anything </connor>
<connor> during like those fucking awkward scenes </connor>
<connor> or was it just like the awkward silence. </connor>
<garnt> - It was just silent. </garnt>
<joey> That would make it awkward. </joey>
<joey> - I always used to like get up and be like, </joey>
<connor> "I gotta go to the bathroom." </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Did you actually? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I did. </connor>
<connor> - If one of my parents didn't do it, </connor>
<connor> I was like, "All right, </connor>
<joey> "I'll be the one to go to the bathroom then." </joey>
<joey> - You know what film I remember watching at like age 10 </joey>
<joey> with my parents? </joey>
<connor> I think this is why they played it </connor>
<connor> 'cause I was so young where they thought, </connor>
<connor> he's not gonna understand anything, </connor>
<connor> was "Brokeback Mountain." </connor>
<connor> - Nice. </connor>
<connor> - You'd like my parents. </connor>
<connor> - Okay. </connor>
<connor> - I don't remember what happened in it </connor>
<connor> 'cause I was 10. </connor>
<connor> But I do remember there was gay things happening. </connor>
<joey> - It's just Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger having </joey>
<joey> a lot of sex. </joey>
<joey> - I remember. </joey>
<connor> But that's yeah, I was like, oh, okay. </connor>
<connor> I don't understand what's happening. </connor>
<connor> But my parents were like, for some reason they were like, </connor>
<connor> "Yeah, let's watch Brokeback Mountain with our son." </connor>
<joey> - It's so unfortunate though </joey>
<joey> because that's actually a really fucking good movie. </joey>
<connor> - No, 'cause I went back and watched it after I was like, </connor>
<connor> I think 18 'cause I had watched "The Dark Knight," </connor>
<connor> and I was like, "Whoa, this Heath Ledger guy can act good." </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> And then obviously 'cause I found out about his death. </connor>
<joey> Well, I got to watch everything he's in. </joey>
<connor> And I was like, "Wow, this is good. </connor>
<connor> "I think I remember watching this." </connor>
<connor> But I couldn't remember when. </connor>
<joey> And I was like, oh. </joey>
<joey> - The PTSD kicked in. </joey>
<joey> - Like, flashback. </joey>
<connor> I remember now. </connor>
<connor> But I remember I was speaking to my friend, </connor>
<connor> and he was like, "Yeah, do you ever just feel awkward </connor>
<joey> "when sex scenes come on when you're with your friends." </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, no. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, no, not at all. </joey>
<joey> - When you're with your friends, it's different. </joey>
<joey> - Why would I feel awkward with a sex scene with my mates? </joey>
<connor> It's just weird, isn't it? </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, no. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't think I've ever watched a sex scene with my mates </garnt>
<garnt> now that I think about it. </garnt>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<joey> - Is that like a thing you have to check off? </joey>
<connor> - I don't know. </connor>
<connor> - You never watched a film with your friends </connor>
<connor> that has a sex scene in it? </connor>
<connor> - I'm trying to think. </connor>
<connor> - I think I've watched like funny porno plots </connor>
<joey> with my friends. </joey>
<joey> Like, fake taxi with my friends. </joey>
<joey> - I've just watched porn with my friends. </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<joey> - I think I have watched, </joey>
<connor> I've been like, "Let's watch this funny porno," you know? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, of course. </garnt>
<joey> Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - I don't think I've ever gone through that, no. </garnt>
<joey> - That's like my favorite pastime is </joey>
<joey> like watching cursed porn with my friends. </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<connor> - I had a friend as well who was like, </connor>
<connor> he can watch normal movies with straight sex in it, </connor>
<connor> but he couldn't watch normal movies </connor>
<connor> with gay sex scenes in it with his friends </connor>
<connor> 'cause he was like just super uncomfortable. </connor>
<joey> - That's just a bit of macho insecurity. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - That sounds a bit insecure to me. </garnt>
<garnt> - I was like, "I don't know, man. </garnt>
<garnt> "This all sounds like you're a little insecure." </garnt>
<garnt> He's like, "No, no, no, no. </garnt>
<garnt> "I just don't like it." </garnt>
<connor> I'm like, "Why don't you like it?" </connor>
<connor> And then he was like, "I'm not homophobic." </connor>
<connor> I'm like, oh, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> - "I'm not homophobic, but..." </connor>
<connor> - What's wrong with a little guy on guy action? </connor>
<connor> I'm like, frankly, as a man, I enjoy watching other dudes. </connor>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<connor> I think there's nothing manlier than being able to sit there </connor>
<joey> and enjoy that, you know, come on, man. </joey>
<joey> What's wrong? </joey>
<joey> - Just blokes hanging out, isn't it? </joey>
<garnt> - He's like lads, lads? </garnt>
<garnt> - I feel like, yeah, </garnt>
<connor> a lot of guys are like that in the UK though, you know? </connor>
<joey> - There's always one guy like that </joey>
<joey> I feel in every guy group. </joey>
<garnt> - I feel like lads culture is definitely like a thing </garnt>
<garnt> in the UK, which is like kind of- </garnt>
<joey> - Same in Australia, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, do you guys have lads culture in Australia? </garnt>
<joey> - Do you have friends who would be like that if you try- </joey>
<connor> - Oh yeah, absolutely. </connor>
<connor> You know, like, 'cause I went to a boys school as well, </connor>
<connor> so it was even more so where it's like </connor>
<garnt> just macho insecurity everywhere where it's like, you know, </garnt>
<joey> you'd be out after school. </joey>
<joey> - It's kinda toxic. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, you'd be out after school and there'd just be </garnt>
<connor> like a girl from like a nearby girls school. </connor>
<connor> "You should totally smash her, bro. </connor>
<connor> "You should totally smash her." </connor>
<joey> And I'm just like, I'm not- </joey>
<connor> - You know, I try not to be confrontational </connor>
<connor> because they're your friends, but I also try and, </connor>
<connor> I'm not gonna sit there and be like, </connor>
<connor> "Dude, that's pretty, you know, that's pretty not okay." </connor>
<garnt> - This is pretty fucked. </garnt>
<connor> - I've had arguments with my friends about it as well </connor>
<connor> where I'll just be like, "Yeah, that's kind of homophobic." </connor>
<garnt> I don't know if you realize it is, but that is homophobic. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> - Do you think because we spend so much time on the internet </connor>
<garnt> that we've just had like more awareness </garnt>
<garnt> about this kind of culture and stuff? </garnt>
<connor> - I think so because, you know, </connor>
<connor> a lot of my friends would never be like, </connor>
<connor> I don't think they would ever be like, </connor>
<connor> "I hate gay people" or anything like that. </connor>
<connor> But also you have to understand where that comes from </connor>
<connor> if there's something where you can watch a normal sex scene, </connor>
<connor> but you can't watch a gay sex scene. </connor>
<connor> Like, why is that? </connor>
<connor> Like, what's going on there? </connor>
<connor> Like, if you're a normal person surely </connor>
<connor> who doesn't give a fuck, </connor>
<connor> you'd have no problem to either, right? </connor>
<connor> Maybe you would find one hotter than the other, </connor>
<connor> but surely you wouldn't have a problem. </connor>
<connor> I don't know if this is too much for "Trash Taste" viewers. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, like, just because you're okay </joey>
<joey> with watching a sex scene doesn't mean you need to be, like, </joey>
<connor> into it. </connor>
<connor> - No, that's what I mean. </connor>
<connor> That's what I'm saying. </connor>
<joey> - There's a difference between being into it </joey>
<connor> and just watching it. - That's what I was saying. </connor>
<connor> That's what I was trying to be like. </connor>
<joey> I was like, yeah, you don't have to actively dislike it, </joey>
<joey> but like you don't have to like turn it off </joey>
<connor> or like go into the other room. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> Like, you can just sit there and be like, </connor>
<connor> all right, it's not for me, </connor>
<joey> but I'm not gonna be disgusted by it. </joey>
<joey> - It's part of the story. </joey>
<joey> It's like, whatever. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that's what I was saying. </joey>
<joey> I was like, you know, if it's part of the plot, </joey>
<joey> it's what it is, man. </joey>
<joey> Like, they're like, "Oh, I don't know. </joey>
<joey> "It's just kinda weird, isn't it?" </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "Is it weird? </joey>
<connor> "Explain how it's weird." </connor>
<connor> - Don't watch "Brokeback Mountain" if that's the case. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> That's literally what that movie's about. </connor>
<connor> - I was like, "That's the problem though. </connor>
<connor> "You think it's weird." </connor>
<connor> Like it's not like, it's not weird that people fuck! </connor>
<connor> - I think the problem is that it's just a lot of the times, </connor>
<garnt> especially like in lads culture, </garnt>
<garnt> people just have never thought about this too deeply. </garnt>
<connor> 'Cause that's- </connor>
<garnt> - They have these, </garnt>
<garnt> yeah, I'm not saying that someone is, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> I totally agree. </connor>
<garnt> Go ahead. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, no, 'cause like this is what I feel </garnt>
<connor> every time I go back to my hometown </connor>
<connor> and I see some of, like, my hometown friends who like, </connor>
<connor> I very much grew up in like lads culture, </connor>
<connor> hanging out with like lads, lads, lads. </connor>
<connor> And they still like fucking go to, </connor>
<connor> every fucking summer go to Ibiza </connor>
<joey> and try to smash as many birds as possible. </joey>
<joey> - That's what it is. </joey>
<connor> - That kind of like lads culture. </connor>
<connor> And I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> as I've grown older, I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> oh this is a kind of a toxic mindset in a lot of ways. </connor>
<connor> You know, it's very much... </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I think the problem is </connor>
<connor> that they don't really talk about it. </connor>
<connor> They don't really talk about their feelings </connor>
<connor> or like really think about things too deeply </connor>
<connor> because that's not a lads thing to do. </connor>
<connor> - That's considered weak. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, that's considered weak. </connor>
<connor> You're not an alpha male </connor>
<garnt> if you talk about your feelings and shit. </garnt>
<garnt> - And also, you know, </garnt>
<connor> they don't really have conversations like this. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, they don't. </garnt>
<joey> - So normally when it's been something I've spoken about </joey>
<connor> with people it's, like, especially in like where I'm from, </connor>
<connor> it's not the first person who's ever been like, </connor>
<garnt> "Now why do you feel that way about this?" </garnt>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> "Now why is it that it makes you uncomfortable?" </garnt>
<garnt> You know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> - So, what do you mean by that? </garnt>
<garnt> It's just like. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I've had like confrontations about it </garnt>
<joey> 'cause it's, like, they get very defensive about it </joey>
<joey> 'cause they feel like, "Oh, shit, wait. </joey>
<joey> "Is he trying to say that I'm in the wrong </joey>
<joey> "for feeling this way?" </joey>
<joey> And it's like, well, no, I'm not trying to. </joey>
<joey> But it's, like, why are you feeling that way? </joey>
<joey> Maybe just think about it. </joey>
<connor> - Just want to have a discussion about it. </connor>
<connor> - Maybe look at what's going on there. </connor>
<connor> - It's funny because, like, </connor>
<connor> some of the most kind of insecure people I've ever met are </connor>
<connor> like, some of the like biggest lads I've ever seen. </connor>
<garnt> Like, the proper like gym bros who... </garnt>
<connor> - Sometimes it's insecurity. </connor>
<connor> Sometimes it's toxic masculinity. </connor>
<garnt> Sometimes it's homophobia. </garnt>
<connor> It's, like, whatever it is, </connor>
<connor> it's like get to the core of it. </connor>
<connor> That's what's bothering you. </connor>
<connor> You can't watch "Brokeback Mountain" </connor>
<connor> without being disgusted. </connor>
<connor> - It's a great movie. </connor>
<connor> - All I'm saying is if you're a guy don't be afraid to talk </connor>
<connor> about your feelings with other guys. </connor>
<connor> I feel like I didn't have that when I was growing up </connor>
<connor> because I thought that it was the mentality </connor>
<connor> where if I did this with my bros, that I was the weak one. </connor>
<connor> You know, that's not what bros do to each other. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, you know, I wouldn't say we're like SJW </connor>
<garnt> or anything like that. </garnt>
<garnt> I just, I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> I just don't want to discriminate. </garnt>
<connor> Why should you, you know? </connor>
<connor> Just my personal opinion. </connor>
<connor> I'm sure that, </connor>
<connor> I'm no doubt there's some viewers of "Trash Taste" </connor>
<connor> being like, "I can't believe they've spoken </connor>
<connor> "about this issue," and stuff, but I mean- </connor>
<connor> - It's a sensitive topic. </connor>
<connor> - Stuff that I would talk about, </connor>
<connor> I mean, there's some things that are sensitive </connor>
<garnt> and there's some things where I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> no, that's just straight up wrong. </garnt>
<garnt> - Of course, of course, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I mean, there's some things where I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> I think we should talk about this, </connor>
<connor> and I think it's, you know, </connor>
<connor> I think it's not toxic at all </connor>
<connor> to at least start a conversation </connor>
<connor> because I think a lot of the times, </connor>
<connor> a lot of people just haven't really, </connor>
<connor> never really put any thought into it. </connor>
<connor> - A lot of time they don't. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, they grew up in a culture, </connor>
<connor> they grew up in a lifestyle, </connor>
<garnt> and that has just never put them in a position </garnt>
<garnt> that challenges the way they think. </garnt>
<connor> - And if someone does feel uncomfortable with us talking </connor>
<connor> about this topic or hearing that idea </connor>
<connor> that makes you uncomfortable, </connor>
<connor> I would say just like, don't get angry about it. </connor>
<connor> Don't react to it. </connor>
<connor> Just think like- </connor>
<joey> - Just turn off "Trash Taste," go watch </joey>
<joey> "Brokeback Mountain" maybe. - No, no, no. </joey>
<connor> Just think, why does it, like, why does it get you angry? </connor>
<connor> Like, what about it? </connor>
<connor> If that's like a whole religious thing. </connor>
<connor> All right, fine. </connor>
<connor> That's your problem with that. </connor>
<connor> Like, I don't know. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, 'cause, like, I just feel like it's better now </garnt>
<garnt> for at least people who are, like, I guess on the internet </garnt>
<garnt> and especially on social media </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause people are talking about this more often, </garnt>
<garnt> which is good, but I still like, there, </garnt>
<connor> you forget sometimes that we are not, </connor>
<connor> I don't even know if we're the majority, you know, </connor>
<connor> because every time I go home- </connor>
<connor> - I don't know. </connor>
<connor> Most people don't talk about it. </connor>
<connor> - It's hard to tell. </connor>
<connor> I'm like so ingrained in, </connor>
<connor> obviously our jobs are surrounded with the internet, </connor>
<connor> and surrounded with people who think like me, </connor>
<connor> that it's weird whenever you go to like, </connor>
<connor> go back home, see family, see friends from back home, </connor>
<connor> And you're just like, wow, everyone thinks exactly the same. </connor>
<connor> Everyone has not changed much at all </connor>
<connor> because they just there's no one in the community </connor>
<connor> or in this group of friends </connor>
<connor> that are exposed to the same thing as we are. </connor>
<connor> - No, totally. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause obviously on my channel I'm very pro LGBTQ, </connor>
<connor> but like obviously going back home, </connor>
<connor> it's not a thing that's spoken about much. </connor>
<connor> It is kind of. </connor>
<connor> It depends who you ask really. </connor>
<joey> - I think now more than before, definitely, </joey>
<joey> with how the world's just changing. </joey>
<joey> - My parents are pretty good with it. </joey>
<joey> I always try to educate them as well when I can. </joey>
<garnt> Try and tell them about it. </garnt>
<connor> - I would like to think most of the time </connor>
<connor> it is just pure ignorance and- </connor>
<connor> - Oh, totally. </connor>
<garnt> Especially in small towns. </garnt>
<garnt> You know, obviously not everyone is </garnt>
<garnt> on the internet all the time and everyone's in a big city, </garnt>
<garnt> you're surrounded by it, </garnt>
<garnt> so it's, you know, a lot of the time they </garnt>
<garnt> just don't come across it. </garnt>
<garnt> They're just like, "Oh, that guy's very funny on TV </garnt>
<connor> "and he's gay. </connor>
<connor> "Oh, really?" </connor>
<connor> That's what it's like. </connor>
<connor> That's what parents are like. </connor>
<connor> They're like, "You know, he's gay?" </connor>
<connor> - Cool. </connor>
<connor> - That's like a thing, you know? </connor>
<joey> But I mean, you know, it's, </joey>
<joey> I mean, it's everywhere now. </joey>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<connor> It sucks that it's one of those things </connor>
<connor> that it even has to be somewhat controversial to talk about. </connor>
<connor> And we haven't really spoke about it on "Trash Taste" </connor>
<connor> so I'm sure that some people will be alienated by it, </connor>
<connor> but it sucks that even has to be something </connor>
<connor> that alienates people. </connor>
<connor> It's just a fact. </connor>
<connor> People are gay. </connor>
<joey> Get over it. </joey>
<joey> - We just like "Brokeback Mountain," man. </joey>
<connor> What can I say? </connor>
<connor> - It's a great film! </connor>
<joey> - It's a fucking awesome movie. </joey>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Trash Taste Brokeback Mountain watch along. </connor>
<garnt> - Heath Ledger, Jake Gyllenhaal, fucking amazing job. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> You sometimes forget Heath Ledger's a fucking Australian </joey>
<garnt> in that movie. </garnt>
<garnt> - Is he Australian? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, he's an Aussie. </connor>
<connor> - Did you think he's British? </connor>
<connor> A lot of people think he's British. </connor>
<joey> - I have no idea. </joey>
<joey> - I think everyone thinks he's American. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, do they? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I thought he was American </garnt>
<garnt> because my first experience with Heath Ledger was </garnt>
<garnt> "10 Things You Hate About Me." </garnt>
<connor> - Wait, Heath Ledger is Australian? </connor>
<joey> - Heath Ledger is Australian. </joey>
<connor> - What? </connor>
<connor> - I didn't know that. </connor>
<connor> - Jake Gyllenhaal is American obviously. </connor>
<connor> - I thought you meant Jake Gyllenhaal. </connor>
<connor> - No, no, no. </connor>
<connor> Jake Gyllenhaal is American. </connor>
<connor> Heath Ledger is, </connor>
<connor> the Joker is Australian. </connor>
<connor> Just great actor. </connor>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> Yeah, I feel like a lot of, you know, </connor>
<garnt> if you're in Hollywood, </garnt>
<garnt> I think we've talked about this, haven't we? </garnt>
<garnt> How they're good at, like, </garnt>
<garnt> they're good at doing the American accent. </garnt>
<garnt> But you watch like some of like the worst attempts </garnt>
<connor> of people attempting a British accent, </connor>
<connor> it's comically bad. </connor>
<connor> - I love Keanu Reeves. </connor>
<connor> His British accent. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, him in like "Dracula." </connor>
<garnt> - So bad. </garnt>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - That was hilarious. </garnt>
<joey> - It's a tie between that and fucking, </joey>
<connor> at the end of "Django" when Tarantino appears, </connor>
<connor> and it's like in Australian. </connor>
<connor> - "What's goin' on, mates? </connor>
<connor> "What's goin' on?" </connor>
<connor> - I died on the inside when I saw that. </connor>
<connor> I was like, this movie was almost perfect </connor>
<connor> and then Tarantino- </connor>
<connor> - "Bollock!" </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> - I'm like, I'm glad he blew up at the end. </connor>
<connor> Someone needed to get rid of that. </connor>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<connor> - I'm sitting here like what do we title this episode? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, right? </connor>
<joey> - What have we even spoken about today? </joey>
<connor> - I don't know. </connor>
<garnt> - How did we even get onto this? </garnt>
<garnt> Oh, the summer is hot. </garnt>
<joey> The summer is hot. </joey>
<joey> - Summer block. </joey>
<garnt> "Trash Taste Summer Blockbuster." </garnt>
<joey> - Fuck no. </joey>
<joey> Fuck no. </joey>
<joey> - I love how like during the conversation earlier </joey>
<joey> about whatever the fuck it was just, </joey>
<joey> I was trying to listen to what you were saying, </joey>
<joey> but just from the outside, </joey>
<joey> I could just hear like a shit load of cicadas. </joey>
<garnt> - Cicadas? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Cicadas? </garnt>
<garnt> - Cicada. </garnt>
<joey> I say cicada. </joey>
<connor> - Cicadas? </connor>
<joey> - Isn't it cicadas? </joey>
<joey> - Cicadas. </joey>
<joey> - Am I the weird one? </joey>
<garnt> I say cicada. - It's cicada. </garnt>
<connor> - Okay, Google, how do you pronounce cicada? </connor>
<garnt> Sorry to anyone who, </garnt>
<garnt> fucking I probably just like- </garnt>
<connor> - We can't continue with the podcast 'til we find this out? </connor>
<connor> What does it say? </connor>
<joey> - Cicada king, rise up. </joey>
<garnt> - Cicada. </garnt>
<garnt> - It is cicada. </garnt>
<joey> - I don't even know. </joey>
<connor> - [Meilyne] Cicada. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah! </connor>
<connor> - Fuck off! </connor>
<connor> - Hell yeah! </connor>
<connor> - Wait, what, what- </connor>
<connor> - What site are you using? </connor>
<connor> - Does that say American or UK? </connor>
<connor> What is it? </connor>
<joey> - [Meilyne] Oh, America is cicada. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, I say cicada. </connor>
<connor> - Wait, are you kidding me? </connor>
<connor> - I'm correct! </connor>
<connor> - British say cicada and Americans say cicada? </connor>
<garnt> - [Navi] This is American so. </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] And the British say cicada. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Well, the thing is that we don't have them </joey>
<garnt> in the UK. </garnt>
<garnt> - My life is a lie. </garnt>
<garnt> My life is a fucking lie. </garnt>
<garnt> - You know, cicada's been one of those, </garnt>
<garnt> oh, I should say cicada now. </garnt>
<garnt> Cicada is one of those words </garnt>
<connor> that I've only heard Americans say </connor>
<connor> 'cause we don't have it in the UK. </connor>
<connor> No one says it in the UK. </connor>
<connor> - True, true. </connor>
<connor> - I've never heard any British person say- </connor>
<connor> - It literally sounds like something out of "Harry Potter." </connor>
<connor> No, it's cicada. </connor>
<connor> Cicada. </connor>
<connor> - Have you heard a British person say cicada? </connor>
<garnt> - No, I have never heard a British person say cicada. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm saying cicada now. </connor>
<connor> I'm getting it in my head now. </connor>
<connor> - You have to rewire your brain now. </connor>
<connor> - I remember 'cause we literally, </connor>
<connor> we literally had a Netflix shoot </connor>
<connor> where we had to talk about like summer anime things. </connor>
<connor> I thought cicada or cicada was spelled </connor>
<connor> C-I-R-C-A-D-A. </connor>
<connor> - He literally wrote circada. </connor>
<garnt> - Circada. </garnt>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<connor> I did circada. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, I thought cicada had an R in it this entire time </connor>
<joey> and apparently it doesn't. </joey>
<joey> - It's circada now. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, but, yeah I mean... </joey>
<joey> I've said this before, the Netflix shoot. </joey>
<joey> But I remember when I first moved to Japan, </joey>
<joey> and I literally had gone my entire life thinking </joey>
<joey> that every cicada sound effect in every anime was </joey>
<connor> just a stock sound effect. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause they all sound exactly the same. </connor>
<connor> You watch like one summer anime episode, </connor>
<connor> and you're like, </connor>
<connor> they're just using the same fucking sound effect </connor>
<connor> as the other anime. </connor>
<connor> And I didn't realize until I moved to Japan </connor>
<connor> that cicadas just all sound exactly the fucking same. </connor>
<garnt> I thought it was </garnt>
<garnt> just a fucking audio jungle stock sound effect. </garnt>
<garnt> No. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know how they sound so similar. </garnt>
<joey> - It's literally just been hardwired into their brain </joey>
<joey> to be like, sound like this at this exact interval. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, to the point where I was like sitting </garnt>
<garnt> at home one night or one day, </garnt>
<garnt> and I literally thought I had the TV on </garnt>
<garnt> playing a random anime. </garnt>
<garnt> I didn't realize that just the window was open. </garnt>
<garnt> I literally like went to my living room to turn off the TV </garnt>
<connor> because I was like, no one's watching anything. </connor>
<connor> And lo and behold, it was just the window. </connor>
<connor> And I couldn't tell the difference </connor>
<garnt> between a TV stock sound effect and the real life. </garnt>
<connor> - Man, have you seen them flying? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - They're fucking massive. </connor>
<joey> - They're terrifying. </joey>
<connor> - I was outside the "Trash Taste" office </connor>
<connor> and I was just walking, listening to music, just jamming, </connor>
<connor> and one flew in my fucking face. </connor>
<connor> I fucking smacked it. </connor>
<connor> I smacked it, and I felt really bad </connor>
<connor> 'cause it hit the woman in front of me. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<joey> On her back. </joey>
<joey> - You literally just tossed a cicada at her. </joey>
<garnt> - And she turned around, and I was like... </garnt>
<garnt> - Fucking playing ping pong with a cicada. </garnt>
<connor> - I just hit it 'cause I panicked. </connor>
<joey> I fucking smacked it. </joey>
<joey> - No, what's scarier is when they land on your balcony. </joey>
<connor> But you think they're dead. </connor>
<connor> - They just don't move, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - They just like kind of bump and just flop down. </connor>
<joey> You're like, oh, is he dead? </joey>
<joey> And then you touch it and it's like (yells) </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, there was one outside my door, </connor>
<connor> so I opened the door and it and I like (yells) </connor>
<joey> "What is that?" </joey>
<joey> - Scarier than any horror film. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause I just opened my door. </joey>
<connor> You don't expect them. </connor>
<joey> There's nothing in my door. </joey>
<joey> You never expect a jump scare at your door. </joey>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<joey> That's fucked up! </joey>
<joey> - I'm gonna use the last of my life to troll this human. </joey>
<connor> - It was literally like under the door. </connor>
<connor> So, I opened the door and it was just, </connor>
<connor> it got like, the door rubbed it or something </connor>
<connor> and you here like (crunches) </connor>
<connor> And I was like (yells) what is that? </connor>
<connor> I'd never seen one before either. </connor>
<connor> This is my first time seeing one. </connor>
<connor> - I had never seen one before either. </connor>
<connor> So, I had no idea what they look like. </connor>
<connor> And these fucking shit heads are so big. </connor>
<connor> They're fucking massive. </connor>
<garnt> - I just fucking yeeted back in my apartment. </garnt>
<garnt> I was like (yells) </garnt>
<connor> - They're terrifying. </connor>
<garnt> - And also another thing I didn't know is that, like, </garnt>
<connor> I had always assumed, </connor>
<connor> like, I remember the first time I came to Japan, </connor>
<connor> like these motherfuckers are loud. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Oh yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Like, you need to wear, </connor>
<connor> you need like noise canceling headphones </connor>
<connor> to like even survive outside. </connor>
<connor> - You think it's like a swarm of them, but it's just one. </connor>
<connor> - I walked past this tree and I'm like, man, these, </connor>
<joey> there are like a swarm of cicadas just in this tree. </joey>
<joey> And then it, like, it just like suddenly just stops </joey>
<joey> and I'm like, what's going on? </joey>
<joey> And then I realized </joey>
<joey> it's one motherfucker making all this sound. </joey>
<joey> One motherfucker makes so, it's so loud. </joey>
<joey> And it's actually like impressive </joey>
<joey> how fucking loud the cicada is. </joey>
<joey> Because, like, I'm on my balcony </joey>
<joey> and, like, I can hear what I think is a swarm of cicadas </joey>
<joey> on like the other side of the city or something. </joey>
<joey> And then I realize it's just one, </joey>
<joey> because it just like, it's so weird, like having like a, </joey>
<joey> it's so weird going outside </joey>
<joey> and just hearing like a fucking noise. </joey>
<joey> Like, it sounds like an alarm. </joey>
<joey> And then it just suddenly stops as well. </joey>
<garnt> And then it just suddenly stops. </garnt>
<connor> - Why do they make noise? </connor>
<joey> What are they trying to, to mate or something? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it's a mating call. </joey>
<joey> - Fuck's sake. </joey>
<connor> Why are they so fucking loud? </connor>
<joey> - Don't they like rub their legs together to make that sound </joey>
<connor> or something? </connor>
<connor> - Like, a violin? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, like the world's shittiest violin. </garnt>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, 'cause apparently they can only mate </joey>
<garnt> during like a very short period of their life. </garnt>
<joey> - During the summer. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, during the summer. </joey>
<joey> So they're like fucking horny as fuck, man. </joey>
<joey> They need to fuck. </joey>
<joey> - They're the lads of the insect world. </joey>
<joey> - And then they fuck once and they die. </joey>
<joey> And then that's it. </joey>
<joey> That's just their entire life. </joey>
<connor> They live for that one fuck, and then they die. </connor>
<connor> - They make as much noise as possible to get that one fuck. </connor>
<joey> - "Sorry, I came to early," dies. </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<connor> - Imagine nutting and then immediately dying. </connor>
<connor> - Honestly- </connor>
<connor> - The best way to go. </connor>
<garnt> - Sometimes I've nutted and I wanted to die right after, </garnt>
<connor> you know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> - Honestly, I can think of worse ways to die </connor>
<connor> than having like a nut so amazing that you're like, </connor>
<connor> "All right, life is peach now." </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> Death initiate. </connor>
<connor> - Some people die from cows. </connor>
<garnt> - For fuck sake! </garnt>
<connor> - I'm bringing this back </connor>
<connor> because after that I realized, </connor>
<connor> Garnt was like, "How do people die from cows?" </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Garnt, they're like four tons. </connor>
<connor> 'What do you mean, how do people die from cows?" </connor>
<connor> - So many people in the suburbs reminding Garnt. </connor>
<garnt> - You can die from cows, Garnt! </garnt>
<garnt> - You can die from anything </garnt>
<garnt> that's like four fucking tons, </garnt>
<garnt> from any like heavy animal. </garnt>
<connor> - That's why. </connor>
<connor> So don't make me look like an idiot </connor>
<connor> for saying a cow can kill you. </connor>
<connor> A cow can fucking kill you. </connor>
<garnt> - Just because a cow can kill you doesn't mean that, </garnt>
<garnt> you know, probably if you get killed by a cow, </garnt>
<garnt> you're doing something stupid. </garnt>
<garnt> That's just my opinion. </garnt>
<garnt> You'd have to try really fucking hard to die from a cow. </garnt>
<connor> - Most ways people die are from stupid ways, Garnt. </connor>
<joey> Believe it or not. </joey>
<joey> - I remember I saw a statistic in Japan </joey>
<joey> where it's like more people in Japan die </joey>
<connor> from vending machines than they do shark attacks. </connor>
<connor> - Well, that makes sense, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Wait, how? </connor>
<joey> - From shaking the vending machine </joey>
<joey> and it landing on you and dying. </joey>
<garnt> - Okay, well that's just idiots being idiots. </garnt>
<garnt> - You deserve that if you're shaking a vending machine. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's what I mean. </garnt>
<garnt> It's the same thing with a cow. </garnt>
<connor> You're not gonna be walking through the fucking paddock </connor>
<connor> and then suddenly a cow's like, </connor>
<connor> "Let me come and squish you!" </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> - I think they can bite you as well. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah. </connor>
<joey> They kick you as well. </joey>
<joey> - Also, if you're strong enough to push a vending machine </joey>
<joey> on yourself, why are you wasting all that talent? </joey>
<joey> You know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> Like, how do you get the vending machine to fall on you? </joey>
<connor> It can't be easy. </connor>
<connor> Do you jump on it? </connor>
<connor> Like, how are people doing this? </connor>
<connor> - I don't know. </connor>
<connor> - You cannot. </connor>
<connor> Have you tried moving a vending machine? </connor>
<connor> It is not easy. </connor>
<connor> Like, you really have to be committed to the stupid act. </connor>
<connor> You really are admitting like, </connor>
<garnt> all right, I'm breaking a sweat today. </garnt>
<garnt> - This is how I'm gonna go. </garnt>
<garnt> - Taking off the Yeezys for this one. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's what I'm saying about dying from cows, you know? </garnt>
<connor> Why fucking try, like, lying under a cow </connor>
<connor> or just like standing behind a cow. </connor>
<garnt> Just go swim in shark infested waters apparently! </garnt>
<connor> - You know, I think you've more chance of dying </connor>
<connor> via the cow honestly. </connor>
<connor> Have you not seen enough LiveLink videos </connor>
<connor> of people fucking with animals to realize? </connor>
<connor> - Do you just casually sit down and watch LiveLink. </connor>
<joey> I think I'd rather watch a horror film. </joey>
<joey> - Sometimes you're on Facebook or Twitter, </joey>
<connor> and one gets on there somehow and- </connor>
<connor> - How? </connor>
<connor> - I don't know, it just happens. </connor>
<connor> - On Twitter? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> You just see like a, you know, </connor>
<connor> like a monkey punching a man or something. </connor>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Wait, what? </connor>
<joey> - What accounts are you following? </joey>
<joey> - Justin. </joey>
<connor> - True, he does retweet some of those. </connor>
<connor> - You just see shit, </connor>
<connor> and then like, people like fucking around with monkeys </connor>
<connor> and then the monkey just beats them up. </connor>
<garnt> - Honestly, like if I see the LiveLink logo, </garnt>
<garnt> that's like a, I should probably not- </garnt>
<connor> - There is a worrying amount of people who think that like, </connor>
<connor> they can just like do whatever they want near animals. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But it's normally, like, third world countries. </connor>
<connor> And it's, like, scary. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause they're like fucking with like a monkey </connor>
<connor> and then the monkey just beats them up, </connor>
<connor> and you're like, well, I mean, fair enough. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, what did you expect? </connor>
<joey> - Kinda had the right. </joey>
<connor> Innocent, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You're literally fucking with the smartest animal. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, 'cause like I'm just very wary </connor>
<joey> whenever I see anything LiveLink </joey>
<garnt> because I've seen enough fucked up shit on the internet. </garnt>
<connor> - LiveLink is also a meme. </connor>
<connor> I've seen people put LiveLink on like the meme. </connor>
<garnt> So, now I'm like, I'm not sure if it's a meme or not. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like playing a game of like Reddit 50/50 or whatever. </garnt>
<joey> - That's the only time I've seen enough LiveLink to know </joey>
<connor> where I'm just like, no. </connor>
<joey> Nothing good comes out of LiveLink. </joey>
<joey> - Sometimes it comes on and you're like, </joey>
<joey> this is intriguing enough </joey>
<connor> where I don't think I can stop watching now. </connor>
<connor> The premise, I'm hooked. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know, man. </connor>
<connor> I quickly pull the plug. </connor>
<connor> - You have more willpower than me. </connor>
<connor> - This ain't worth it. </connor>
<connor> - When I see the premise </connor>
<connor> for the first one second of the video, </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Damn, I can't turn it off now." </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> Is that wrong of me? </connor>
<garnt> I feel like that's bad. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, I'm just wired to clickbait. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, monkey brain activates. </garnt>
<garnt> - Your curiosity gets the best of you. </garnt>
<garnt> - Speaking about you spelling cicada incorrectly. </garnt>
<garnt> - Circada. </garnt>
<garnt> - I realized like the other day, </garnt>
<connor> I'm like, shit, I can't spell shit </connor>
<connor> without autocorrect anymore. </connor>
<connor> - What? </connor>
<connor> - My spelling is so bad without autocorrect. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, that's pretty much me as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - I realized now when it's not on, </garnt>
<garnt> I just kind of like type shit </garnt>
<garnt> and I know that it will fix it for me. </garnt>
<joey> - That's a bad habit. </joey>
<garnt> - I just type fast. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, I got something similar as well </garnt>
<garnt> where I'm like, I can't do mental arithmetic anymore. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, I literally like, </garnt>
<garnt> like, I'm just like, oh, what's nine times eight? </garnt>
<connor> And I'm just like, let me get out the calculator. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> I'm so reliant on- </connor>
<connor> - I can do it, but it'll take me like 20 Seconds. </connor>
<connor> - I can do it, but it requires thinking and I don't, </connor>
<garnt> I'm not all about that, man. </garnt>
<garnt> - Nine times eight? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, that's easy though. </connor>
<joey> - I was gonna say. </joey>
<connor> - Think about it, Garnt. </connor>
<connor> - Wait... </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> 72. </connor>
<connor> - There you go. </connor>
<garnt> - I had to think about it! </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, done for graduating middle school. </garnt>
<garnt> - Masters in engineering by the way. </garnt>
<connor> - What was your method of getting that? </connor>
<connor> - I don't... </connor>
<joey> - 'Cause the nine times tables is the easiest. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that's what I would've done. </joey>
<joey> I would have the nine times nine is 81 </joey>
<joey> then just minus eight. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, that's way too complicated. </joey>
<connor> - There's an even easier way. </connor>
<joey> Anything times nine is super fucking easy. </joey>
<garnt> - No, I mean, I don't really have a system. </garnt>
<connor> It's just figuring it out. </connor>
<garnt> - It's whatever your brain is wired to do fast, right? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, well, for me, if it's nine times eight, </joey>
<joey> then it's, like, well eight. </joey>
<joey> So, it starts with a seven </joey>
<joey> because whatever your timesing by nine is </joey>
<connor> always one digit below. </connor>
<joey> And then the two digits sums up to nine. </joey>
<joey> Seven plus two is nine. </joey>
<joey> - You know how every time you would ever have </joey>
<joey> like a new math teacher, </joey>
<connor> they would always teach you </connor>
<connor> that weird way of solving a plus and a minus? </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> They were like, "Right, so we're gonna add 425 to 522." </connor>
<connor> And then they're gonna do, </connor>
<connor> "Right, so we're gonna add the four to the five, easy." </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, do we really need to write this down? </connor>
<connor> Can we just like, can we just... </connor>
<joey> - And then there's always like just the really obscure ways </joey>
<connor> to do it as well </connor>
<connor> where it's like there's got to be an easier way. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's like, "All right, so when you bring the one over, </connor>
<connor> "pull out your dictionary." </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<joey> - Or it would ne like dividing by. </joey>
<connor> And they would have this weird ass timetable </connor>
<joey> or something to do it. </joey>
<connor> And I'm like, this feels so convoluted. </connor>
<connor> Why not just like figure out some other method. </connor>
<joey> - It's like, teacher when am I ever gonna divide 973 by 67? </joey>
<joey> Like, I'm never going to. </joey>
<garnt> - I'm never gonna go and count down. </garnt>
<connor> I didn't need to know this shit. </connor>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - Every single, like, yeah, it is great that you, </connor>
<joey> if you can do that with your mind, </joey>
<joey> but there's- - Great party trick. </joey>
<joey> - There's absolutely no setting </joey>
<joey> where you are ever not gonna be using a calculator. </joey>
<connor> And even if you are, </connor>
<connor> they will not allow you to do that </connor>
<connor> because they won't trust you. </connor>
<connor> You should be using a calculator for good practice. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> - Even if you could divide insane numbers, </connor>
<joey> people would be like, "No, that's not it." </joey>
<connor> - It's good for like estimates </connor>
<connor> when you're talking engineering terms. </connor>
<connor> You're like, "Okay, well, can we maybe try this much? </connor>
<connor> "No, I don't think, just off the top of my head, </connor>
<connor> "that doesn't seem right." </connor>
<connor> That's good. </connor>
<connor> But in general, like, you know, there's exams, you know- </connor>
<garnt> - It's just funny how like mental arithmetic has </garnt>
<joey> just become kind of like a party trick. </joey>
<joey> There's always like, you always see that one guy </joey>
<joey> every so often where you get like the bill </joey>
<garnt> and they can just like divide exactly the right amount </garnt>
<garnt> in their head before- </garnt>
<joey> - But it's also like the shittiest type of party trick </joey>
<joey> because it's the party trick that you do </joey>
<joey> and nobody believes you. </joey>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - People would check it anyway, right? </garnt>
<joey> - It's like, "Nah, let me pull the calculator out." </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<connor> "Oh, it is right, wow, very good." </connor>
<connor> - Five times five is 25. </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<connor> - Bullshit, let me check that. </connor>
<garnt> - I just work via round numbers now. </garnt>
<connor> That is just my life. </connor>
<connor> But yes, exactly the same as spelling now </connor>
<garnt> where I just, I could not live without autocorrect. </garnt>
<garnt> And I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like it's- </garnt>
<connor> - Do you have those words that you just, </connor>
<connor> you know what they look like, but you're like, </connor>
<garnt> I just can't be bothered to learn how to spell it right. </garnt>
<garnt> - How do you spell necessary? </garnt>
<connor> - I was literally about to say that. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> That is the one where I'm like, </connor>
<connor> I honestly cannot remember, is it two Cs, two Ss? </connor>
<joey> - Two Ss, right? </joey>
<connor> - I don't know. </connor>
<connor> I'm pretty sure it's- </connor>
<connor> - The one for me that always fucks me up </connor>
<connor> that I still never get right is guaranteed. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I'm like is the U in there? </connor>
<connor> Is there an A in this? </connor>
<joey> Is it gwaranteed or is garanteed? </joey>
<joey> - This is why, I don't care. </joey>
<joey> I haven't like... </joey>
<joey> Yeah, necessarily. </joey>
<joey> I'm just like, I'm pretty sure it's two Ss. </joey>
<joey> No, it's not, is it? </joey>
<joey> - It's two Ss. </joey>
<connor> - I don't know, maybe it is. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, N-E-C-E-S-S-A-R-Y, right? </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah, I'm pretty sure it is. </connor>
<connor> - Hold on, let me check. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Let me get out the autocorrect. </connor>
<garnt> - I just type and then click, yeah, it's that one. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - But the thing about spelling is that it doesn't, </garnt>
<connor> at the end of the day- </connor>
<garnt> - Spelling is irrelevant. </garnt>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - At the end of the day, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> you can spell a word wrong </garnt>
<garnt> and people will still get like the meaning of the word </garnt>
<connor> most of the time. </connor>
<connor> Isn't there- </connor>
<joey> - Like phonetics. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I mean, haven't you seen like the video </joey>
<joey> where if you put the first letter right </joey>
<connor> and the last letter right, and just mix it up. </connor>
<garnt> - Everyone on the internet has seen that. </garnt>
<joey> Have you seen the ballerina </joey>
<joey> that spins the other way too, Garnt? </joey>
<joey> - Have you seen the dress that's blue and gold? </joey>
<garnt> - Oh yeah. </garnt>
<connor> I remember that. </connor>
<garnt> Oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> I completely forgot about that. </garnt>
<joey> - The internet was on fire for a week unnecessarily </joey>
<joey> over a fucking dress. </joey>
<joey> - I remember meme culture. </joey>
<garnt> I remember when that was the hot thing back in the day. </garnt>
<joey> - I knew that dress meme went too far when people were like, </joey>
<joey> "All right, so I went into Photoshop </joey>
<joey> "and I got the color draw, </joey>
<joey> "and I can confirm the hex digits </joey>
<joey> "that it is in fact blue and gold." </joey>
<garnt> - Wasn't there that like audio kind of- </garnt>
<joey> - Yanny and Laurel. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, that one. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah! </connor>
<garnt> I remember that. </garnt>
<joey> - I just saw that, I was like, who cares? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I felt like after the whole dress debacle, </connor>
<joey> it felt like everyone was looking for the next thing </joey>
<joey> to interpret differently. </joey>
<connor> And I just didn't give a fuck. </connor>
<joey> - That was a nice meme that lasted three days. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I remember like the only, what would they call it? </garnt>
<garnt> The audio... </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like- </garnt>
<garnt> - Audio illusion. </garnt>
<connor> - Audio illusion! </connor>
<connor> That's it. </connor>
<connor> Actually, it's not really an audio illusion. </connor>
<connor> It's just, did you ever, </connor>
<connor> did you guys ever do like the frequency test </connor>
<connor> where you have to like test your frequency? </connor>
<connor> And, like, I remember I was, </connor>
<connor> I remember my frequency was like so fucking good as a kid. </connor>
<connor> And I thought I'm never gonna lose this. </connor>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<connor> Like, as a kid, did you ever get that point </connor>
<connor> where a grown up told you that this is gonna happen to you </connor>
<connor> when you grow up, </connor>
<connor> and as a kid, you're just like, </connor>
<connor> that's never gonna happen to me. </connor>
<connor> That's never gonna fucking happen to me. </connor>
<connor> I remember the first time I felt old </connor>
<connor> was the first time I did, </connor>
<connor> the second time I did a frequency test </connor>
<connor> when I was like mid 20s, </connor>
<garnt> and I'm just like, this isn't the same number </garnt>
<garnt> as I remember as a kid! </garnt>
<garnt> The grown ups were right, I'm getting old! </garnt>
<joey> - Wait, so is the frequency test </joey>
<joey> like the how much you can hear? </joey>
<joey> Is that the one? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, so like the better your hearing is </garnt>
<garnt> the higher the frequency. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Generally when you get around to 30, </garnt>
<joey> it starts to get a lot worse. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, like, who the fuck needs to hear </joey>
<connor> like the high kilohertz? </connor>
<joey> - I mean, I immediately felt that, </joey>
<connor> like, 'cause you know, in like some arcades in Japan </connor>
<connor> they have mosquito tone - Yeah, I have that too. </connor>
<garnt> - that like stops like animals from coming in. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And every time we walk past like an arcade </garnt>
<connor> with like a bunch of friends and they'd be like, "Oh, fuck!" </connor>
<joey> I'll be like, "What?" </joey>
<garnt> I legitimately don't hear anything. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's actually an advantage here. </garnt>
<connor> 'Cause Sydney can hear it and I can't anymore. </connor>
<joey> Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Apparently it hurts. </joey>
<joey> I'm just like, I don't- </joey>
<joey> - Apparently like in a lot of shops in Japan, </joey>
<garnt> they just play this like high, </garnt>
<connor> I can't describe it actually. </connor>
<connor> - Isn't to stop like teenagers? </connor>
<connor> Doesn't it stop teenagers from like loitering. </connor>
<joey> - [Navi] To stop people from loitering in front. </joey>
<joey> - I've also heard it's to stop birds from flying. </joey>
<joey> - [Navi] And cats. </joey>
<garnt> - Can you hear it, Connor? </garnt>
<garnt> - I can hear it. </garnt>
<connor> - Okay, what does it sound like? </connor>
<connor> I was gonna describe what it was, </connor>
<connor> and then I realize that- </connor>
<connor> - I can't hear it. </connor>
<garnt> - I just realized I've never heard it. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's just an uncomfortable ring in your ear. </garnt>
<garnt> - An uncomfortable ring in your ear? </garnt>
<joey> - It doesn't particularly feel good. </joey>
<connor> It kind of hurts. </connor>
<joey> I don't know, it just hurts. </joey>
<connor> - It looks like it hurts. </connor>
<garnt> - That's what it's designed to do, to hurt. </garnt>
<connor> - But what I don't understand is is that </connor>
<garnt> if they've just put this high frequency alarm or ring </garnt>
<garnt> to stop birds? </garnt>
<garnt> Mosquitoes? </garnt>
<joey> - Animals and loitering. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, okay. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't know which one it's actually for. </connor>
<connor> - Is it for humans or animals? </connor>
<connor> - I don't know. </connor>
<garnt> - Apparently it's for both </garnt>
<joey> 'cause humans can hear it as well. </joey>
<connor> - Probably should have picked a lower frequency then, </connor>
<connor> because it doesn't work, </connor>
<connor> if you've just got shit hearing, </connor>
<connor> then you're just immune to it. </connor>
<connor> - It's meaning to stop like kids loitering. </connor>
<connor> So, that's the idea. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, okay, okay. </joey>
<garnt> - I've never been able to hear it though </garnt>
<joey> even when I was a kid. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, but you've been listening to like music for- </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I've probably been to too many concerts </connor>
<joey> where my years just got fucked. </joey>
<connor> - You're gonna be like 40 and be like, "What? </connor>
<connor> "What did you say to me, Garnt?" </connor>
<connor> - I'm still like that. </connor>
<connor> - True, you are. </connor>
<connor> Your hearing is really bad. </connor>
<joey> - No, but I talked about it on the podcast, remember? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause when we went to go do the health checkup, </joey>
<connor> and I got an aid for my hearing and then I realized, </connor>
<connor> oh, I don't have bad hearing, I just don't listen. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> - You're just fucking dumb. </connor>
<connor> - I just don't care about what you say sometimes </connor>
<connor> that I just shut it out. </connor>
<connor> - True, true, true. </connor>
<joey> - That's what it is, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - You boys have any fun plans for the summer? </connor>
<garnt> - You know what I miss? </garnt>
<garnt> This is like the first time in my life </garnt>
<garnt> where I've just not lived near a body of water. </garnt>
<connor> - You're surrounded by water. </connor>
<connor> What do you mean? </connor>
<joey> - We're literally an island country. </joey>
<garnt> - No, but, like, we're in Tokyo. </garnt>
<connor> And I think the closest thing is like Tokyo Bay. </connor>
<connor> Like, part of the summer experience for me is </connor>
<connor> just going to the beach somewhere </connor>
<garnt> and just like having a nice chill, </garnt>
<garnt> you know, beer or something. </garnt>
<garnt> And haven't been able to do that for the past two years. </garnt>
<garnt> And I've really missed that experience. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, it doesn't really matter </joey>
<joey> because like the beaches have been closed from lockdown. </joey>
<garnt> - Exactly. </garnt>
<joey> It doesn't matter anyway </joey>
<joey> 'cause I can't go to the beaches anyway. </joey>
<joey> And like Okinawa is on lockdown, so I can't go there. </joey>
<connor> So, I just, it doesn't feel like, </connor>
<connor> I've had the worst part of the summer experience </connor>
<garnt> which is just the fucking blistering heat. </garnt>
<garnt> And haven't been able to just enjoy the nice parts. </garnt>
<garnt> - Trapped in a concrete jungle. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, basically. </garnt>
<connor> - So, what are you gonna do for your summer then, Garnt? </connor>
<garnt> - I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> What can I do for the summer? </garnt>
<joey> - Is there anything fun you can do in the summer </joey>
<joey> that doesn't involve a beach or a pool or any body of water? </joey>
<connor> - Stay inside and play video games. </connor>
<joey> - Sounds pretty fucking good. </joey>
<garnt> - That's what you do in winter though, right? </garnt>
<connor> - Both seasons. </connor>
<connor> All seasons. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause another thing is that we get mosquitoes here </connor>
<connor> in Japan and we don't- </connor>
<connor> - Do we? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, we do. </garnt>
<connor> - I haven't seen any. </connor>
<connor> - Do you not get bitten? </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<connor> - Lucky. </connor>
<connor> - How do you not get bitten? </connor>
<joey> - I get eaten alive. </joey>
<joey> - Maybe my blood doesn't taste good. </joey>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<connor> I've never had a mosquito bite. </connor>
<joey> - Apparently it does depend on your blood type. </joey>
<garnt> - Okay, I think it does because I get bitten to shit </garnt>
<garnt> whenever a mosquito's around. </garnt>
<connor> - They don't go for me. </connor>
<connor> I can be in an area where someone will get bit a ton, </connor>
<connor> I won't have any on me. </connor>
<garnt> - I literally- </garnt>
<joey> - God, I wish that was me. </joey>
<joey> - I literally laid outside on my balcony </joey>
<joey> for like half an hour, </joey>
<garnt> came inside and I had like 10 bites on my back. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm not even joking. </garnt>
<joey> - I'm exactly the same. </joey>
<joey> - I don't get bit. </joey>
<garnt> I've never even. </garnt>
<connor> I didn't even know they had them here. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah 'cause normally- </garnt>
<connor> - I don't get bitten. </connor>
<connor> - Are you serious? </connor>
<connor> - Serious. </connor>
<connor> I thought they didn't have them here' cause I don't get bit. </connor>
<garnt> - That's another reason I love British summers is </garnt>
<garnt> that we just don't have any bugs that are annoying because- </garnt>
<garnt> - You guys don't have mosquitoes? </garnt>
<garnt> - No. </garnt>
<garnt> - Do you not remember when we were just chilling out </garnt>
<garnt> in England in my garden? </garnt>
<joey> - I just thought I got lucky. </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<connor> I just thought like, oh, </connor>
<joey> there's a stronger blood type somewhere in the vicinity </joey>
<connor> that they're going for. </connor>
<connor> - There's no mosquitoes. </connor>
<connor> - No, I'm just that guy, 'cause like, </connor>
<garnt> I'm just that guy who like, I'm the bait. </garnt>
<connor> - The meme of like the blades falling down </connor>
<connor> and the guy covering. </connor>
<connor> It's Garnt, everyone else at the party. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, 'cause like, </connor>
<connor> if people hang out with me in Thailand or Japan or whatever, </connor>
<connor> they get bitten less because I'm there. </connor>
<connor> I'm the bait. </connor>
<connor> I am what every mosquito goes for, and I don't know why. </connor>
<connor> - Garnt the martyr. </connor>
<connor> - Because in Thailand we have this saying </connor>
<connor> where normally it's the mosquitoes go for the foreign people </connor>
<connor> because it's the foreign people who have the sweet blood </connor>
<connor> because the mosquitoes aren't used to their blood. </connor>
<connor> - So that was a lie. </connor>
<connor> - So that was a fucking lie. </connor>
<connor> Well, technically I didn't grow up in Thailand, </connor>
<connor> so maybe there's some kind of truth to it. </connor>
<connor> But apparently if you have never been beaten, well- </connor>
<connor> - Beaten by a mosquito. </connor>
<garnt> - The mosquito's fucking, what's going on, huh? </garnt>
<connor> Come in our neighborhood. </connor>
<garnt> I've never get bitten by mosquitoes. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm so fucking jute. </connor>
<connor> - Is it like a blood type thing? </connor>
<connor> I don't even remember my- </connor>
<joey> - Apparently it's like a blood type thing. </joey>
<connor> It's also like a skin thing as well. </connor>
<connor> Like, certain skin. </connor>
<connor> Like, if you have like oily skin, </connor>
<connor> you're more likely to get bitten. </connor>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<connor> There's lots of theories out there. </connor>
<connor> I think it's literally just like, </connor>
<connor> if you're unlucky, you're unlucky kind of thing. </connor>
<connor> - Beer? </connor>
<garnt> Beer? </garnt>
<connor> - Oh yeah, no, apparently you're more likely to get stung </connor>
<joey> if you're drunk. </joey>
<connor> - Is that true? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, apparently. </connor>
<garnt> - Does that not make the mosquitoes drunk? </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know. </garnt>
<joey> - That's probably why. </joey>
<joey> They're like, "Eh, my guys time for a sesh." </joey>
<garnt> Because they get drunk off the blood, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Maybe. </garnt>
<connor> I've still never been bitten drinking, </connor>
<connor> so I don't know what's going on. </connor>
<connor> - Lads, lads, lads! </connor>
<connor> - Is there a reason why the mosquitoes go for people more </connor>
<connor> or less? </connor>
<joey> - [Navi] Yeah, there's like seven reasons why. </joey>
<connor> - I don't know if any of that has actually been, like, </connor>
<connor> scientifically confirmed. </connor>
<connor> I feel it's just like, </connor>
<connor> it might be like a little like coincidence. </connor>
<connor> - I'm just not tasty enough. </connor>
<connor> What the fuck? </connor>
<joey> - [Navi] Might be your blood type as well. </joey>
<connor> - It's probably blood type. </connor>
<connor> - What if I'm not tasty? </connor>
<connor> What? </connor>
<joey> - I want to be tasty. </joey>
<garnt> - What? </garnt>
<joey> - No, you don't want to be tasty. </joey>
<connor> - You don't want to be tasty. </connor>
<joey> - I want to be tasty, that's bullshit. </joey>
<joey> - Mosquitoes are fucking, they're the worst. </joey>
<connor> They're the fucking cunts of the fucking insect world. </connor>
<connor> Nobody likes mosquitoes. </connor>
<garnt> There could be like the biggest animal lover in the world </garnt>
<garnt> and they see a mosquito and, like, fuck that little shit. </garnt>
<joey> - Isn't like the mosquito, I think I read somewhere, </joey>
<joey> isn't the mosquito like the only animal </joey>
<joey> in like the food chain where if you got rid of them, </joey>
<joey> it just wouldn't change the food chain? </joey>
<garnt> - I don't know if that's an urban legend, </garnt>
<garnt> but I hope it's true. </garnt>
<joey> - I think it's something like that 'cause I remember seeing, </joey>
<joey> 'cause like I think I looked it up 'cause I was like, </joey>
<connor> 'cause in Australia we have a shit ton of flies </connor>
<connor> during the summer. </connor>
<connor> Like, it's fucking horrible. </connor>
<connor> Especially if you're like out in the desert, </connor>
<connor> nothing but flies. </connor>
<connor> It's disgusting. </connor>
<connor> And I think, I just thought to myself, like, man, </connor>
<connor> I really just wish all flies just disappeared. </connor>
<connor> And then one of my friends was like, oh no, </connor>
<connor> like flies are like really important to the food chain. </connor>
<connor> Like, there's a lot of animals that eat flies. </connor>
<connor> And thought like, is there an animal where if we just, </connor>
<garnt> it just disappeared one day, </garnt>
<joey> would the food chain still be intact? </joey>
<joey> And I think mosquitoes was one of them. </joey>
<connor> - Humans probably. </connor>
<joey> - Oh yeah, that too. </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<connor> - I think they'd be grateful actually. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Just called myself out there. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<joey> - We like to think of that- </joey>
<garnt> - You got me, animals, you got me. </garnt>
<garnt> - We're the problem all along. </garnt>
<garnt> - We were the virus all along, right? </garnt>
<garnt> ♪ Do, do, do, do ♪ </garnt>
<garnt> - But yeah, I mean, </garnt>
<garnt> I hope mosquitoes are fucking useless things because- </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, they just fucking carry diseases. </joey>
<joey> Like, that's all they really do. </joey>
<garnt> - All they do is like give malaria to people, right? </garnt>
<joey> - Amongst other things. </joey>
<joey> - There's probably one like really obscure species of spider </joey>
<joey> or something that could only feed on mosquitoes </joey>
<joey> that would die out. </joey>
<joey> - That is integral to the food chain. </joey>
<garnt> It's always like that. </garnt>
<connor> It's like, no, no, there's one animal </connor>
<joey> that specifically eats this thing. </joey>
<connor> - How would you even eradicate mosquitoes? </connor>
<connor> How would you even go about that? </connor>
<garnt> - I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> Don't ask the Aussie. </garnt>
<garnt> They've they've had like enough problems trying </garnt>
<garnt> to eradicate a certain- </garnt>
<connor> - Oh yeah, the cane toad? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> So we have a lot of sugarcane in Australia </connor>
<connor> during like the 1800s, </connor>
<connor> and then cane flies were introduced, </connor>
<connor> which are these specific breed of flies </connor>
<connor> that only eat sugarcane </connor>
<connor> and which completely wiped out our sugarcane. </connor>
<connor> And we're like, well, fuck. </connor>
<connor> We gotta get rid of these flies </connor>
<connor> because our food is getting fuck up. </connor>
<connor> And then someone was like, I've heard overseas, </connor>
<connor> there was a specific type of toad called the cane toad </connor>
<connor> that specifically only eats cane flies. </connor>
<connor> Someone thought, oh that's brilliant. </connor>
<connor> That's gonna solve all of our problems. </connor>
<connor> Let's introduce it. </connor>
<connor> So, they introduced it. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, all the cane flies disappeared. </connor>
<joey> But then somebody realized, shit, nothing eats cane toads. </joey>
<joey> And they're literally poisonous, </joey>
<connor> and they're killing our native animals. </connor>
<connor> So, now we just have a cane toad outbreak. </connor>
<garnt> - And you just can't get rid of it, right? </garnt>
<joey> - And we just can't get rid of it. </joey>
<connor> - Dude, it's like me playing chess. </connor>
<connor> They only thought one move ahead. </connor>
<connor> They didn't plan anything else. </connor>
<connor> Like, this feels like a vast oversight </connor>
<joey> in like possible downsides. </joey>
<connor> No pros and cons lists. </connor>
<connor> Someone was like, bro, I got one, bring it over. </connor>
<connor> Let's just test it out. </connor>
<garnt> - It sounds like the beginning </garnt>
<garnt> of like an "Always Sunny" skit, right? </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> Like, you're just like, oh, let's bring over the cane toads. </garnt>
<connor> And you just see like the fucking intro title. </connor>
<connor> Gang introduces cane toads to the food chain. </connor>
<connor> - And then again, Australia, </connor>
<joey> hasn't had very much luck with animals. </joey>
<joey> I mean, we had an emu war and we lost. </joey>
<garnt> - What the fuck is that about? </garnt>
<garnt> Like, I hear every Australian say that. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm just like, that just sounds like- </garnt>
<connor> - The great emu wars. </connor>
<connor> - The dumbest shit ever. </connor>
<connor> They went to war against emus. </connor>
<garnt> - And they lost? </garnt>
<connor> - And we lost. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, do you want to explain that? </connor>
<joey> - Dude, have you seen an emu? </joey>
<joey> - No. </joey>
<joey> - They're fucking terrifying. </joey>
<garnt> - Can they kill you? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> It's Australia! </joey>
<garnt> Everything can kill you! </garnt>
<connor> - Should have known that one. </connor>
<garnt> Should have saw that one coming. </garnt>
<garnt> - Were they eating crops? </garnt>
<connor> They were ruining crops, right? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, they were ruining crops. </joey>
<connor> And, again, like they kind of just like overbred themselves </connor>
<connor> to the point where there was just a shit ton of emus </connor>
<connor> and just not enough space. </connor>
<connor> So, they started invading farmland. </connor>
<connor> Obviously farmers got pissed off about it, </connor>
<connor> so they tried to get them out of it. </connor>
<connor> But obviously it's one man </connor>
<connor> versus a fucking two and a half meter bird </connor>
<connor> that can literally just kick you in the chest and kill you. </connor>
<connor> So, I think it went on for like a month or something. </connor>
<connor> I don't know how long it was. </connor>
<joey> It was a very short, it was a very short war. </joey>
<connor> - They wasted so much money on like ammunition and time. </connor>
<joey> - Ammunition? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - They were shooting them. </connor>
<joey> Trying to gun them down. </joey>
<connor> But they could like- </connor>
<joey> - But the emus were literally like the Spartans </joey>
<joey> and they were like, </joey>
<joey> it was like, we were like Xerxes army </joey>
<joey> and the emus were the Spartans. </joey>
<connor> They're like, oh, shit. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause they would like, they were fighting them. </connor>
<connor> But they would they just kept getting away. </connor>
<joey> It was like a "Loony Tunes" skit. </joey>
<joey> They couldn't kill them. </joey>
<joey> - It was just like the Benny Hill theme </joey>
<joey> for like a month straight. </joey>
<joey> - They had to wait and ambush them. </joey>
<joey> That's how they- </joey>
<joey> - Are you serious? </joey>
<joey> - They travel in flocks. </joey>
<joey> They go together in flocks, </joey>
<connor> and they were trying to ambush them. </connor>
<joey> - And they're also extremely fast. </joey>
<connor> They can run like 60, 70 Ks an hour. </connor>
<joey> - The moment they started opening fire on them, </joey>
<joey> they just ran away, and they would only kill like, you know- </joey>
<joey> - A couple of them maybe. </joey>
<joey> - But they'd wasted like 100 grand in ammo. </joey>
<joey> Like, ammo isn't cheap. </joey>
<connor> I feel like because we're so used to war, </connor>
<connor> you think that ammo is like affordable. </connor>
<connor> Like, ammo is super expensive. </connor>
<connor> So, they were just wasting hundreds of thousands of dollars </connor>
<joey> on bullets. </joey>
<joey> - Especially when that war was happening, </joey>
<connor> it was probably even more expensive. </connor>
<connor> And then one day someone was like, it's not worth it, is it? </connor>
<connor> Just wave the white flag. </connor>
<connor> And then they just retreated and- </connor>
<connor> - It's embarrassing. </connor>
<garnt> It was like a huge embarrassment. </garnt>
<connor> - So what was the outcome of this war? </connor>
<connor> - The emus won. </connor>
<connor> - The emus won and they're just roaming the land now? </connor>
<connor> - Yep. - Yep. </connor>
<connor> They just failed miserably. </connor>
<garnt> - What is going on in Australia? </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm sure everyone who's watched internet videos has heard </garnt>
<garnt> about this. </garnt>
<connor> This is a very internet video topic. </connor>
<garnt> - It sounds like an Internet Historian skit, you know. </garnt>
<joey> - I'm surprised he hasn't made a video on it yet </joey>
<joey> to be honest. </joey>
<joey> It's great material. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I mean, it sounds like on the same level as like, </joey>
<joey> you know, the 4chan Tumblr wars or something like that. </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<garnt> We need an Internet Historian breakdown. </garnt>
<joey> - It just doesn't sound like it really happened. </joey>
<connor> - It just feels like the laziest strategy of killing them. </connor>
<joey> You know? </joey>
<joey> - There were people who died as well </joey>
<connor> during the great emu war. </connor>
<connor> - I just feel like nobody thought this plan through. </connor>
<connor> Surely there was a better way of getting them. </connor>
<joey> You know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> Like, that's what pisses me off the most. </joey>
<joey> It was the laziest solution. </joey>
<joey> They're like, "Firing squad. </joey>
<joey> And they were like, "Yeah, okay." </joey>
<joey> Like, nobody thought, "Is this really the best idea?" </joey>
<joey> - Because someone probably took one look </joey>
<joey> at the fucking shotgun they had and they were like, </joey>
<joey> "We got this. </joey>
<joey> "Easy dub." </joey>
<garnt> - We need a fucking Hollywood breakdown on this. </garnt>
<garnt> Where's the Hollywood summer blockbuster </garnt>
<garnt> of the Australian emu war? </garnt>
<garnt> Come on, come on. </garnt>
<garnt> Come on, Hollywood, get it together. </garnt>
<garnt> There's a storyline there somewhere. </garnt>
<garnt> - Man versus emu. </garnt>
<garnt> - Zack Snyder, come on. </garnt>
<garnt> This is the next Zack Snyder film. </garnt>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like a 300 spinoff. </garnt>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<joey> - It's like "Planet of the Apes" </joey>
<joey> from the perspective of the emus. </joey>
<joey> - Planet of the Emus. </joey>
<joey> - Emus together strong. </joey>
<connor> I would watch it. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, it's about the emus winning. </connor>
<joey> Perspective of the emus. </joey>
<connor> One of them voiced by Raymond from "Everyone Loves Raymond." </connor>
<garnt> - Get back Nicholas Cage, come on. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, Nicholas Cage is the main role. </connor>
<connor> And the supporting role is Raymond. </connor>
<joey> - And he goes insane as the emus win. </joey>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> - There's a part where Raymond dies, </connor>
<connor> you know, gets shot and then Nicholas- </connor>
<joey> - Nicholas Cage loses his mind. </joey>
<joey> - He was freaking out. </joey>
<connor> "I can't go on," but he has to. </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God. </connor>
<joey> - And ends with a climatic scene where they- </joey>
<garnt> - What's the summer experience in Australia? </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause like Australia, it's like winter there. </garnt>
<garnt> - Christmas. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like, I always here about like summer is like winter </garnt>
<garnt> in Australia. </garnt>
<garnt> But like what is winter for Australia? </garnt>
<garnt> Is it actually cold? </garnt>
<garnt> Or- </garnt>
<connor> - Do you like swap them? </connor>
<connor> Do you just refer to our summer as winter? </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<connor> - Like July? </connor>
<joey> Is July winter? </joey>
<connor> - July is the coldest time of year in Australia. </connor>
<connor> - But is it winter? </connor>
<connor> Is July winter? </connor>
<connor> - It depends where you are. </connor>
<connor> So in Sydney, it doesn't get cold enough to snow. </connor>
<joey> But if you drive for like two hours into Cambra, </joey>
<joey> it snows like a motherfucker. </joey>
<connor> - I have been always under the impression </connor>
<connor> no matter the temperature that winter is the time of year. </connor>
<joey> Like, winter is always November to January. </joey>
<joey> Sorry, sorry, November to February. </joey>
<joey> That is winter. </joey>
<connor> Is it the same in Australia where you would refer </connor>
<connor> to that period as winter? </connor>
<joey> - No, that's summer. </joey>
<connor> - But everyone else around you is- </connor>
<joey> - The hottest day of any year is always New Year's Eve. </joey>
<connor> - I always thought that it was like, </connor>
<connor> okay, no matter what country you're in, this is winter. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, that's what I thought as well. </connor>
<joey> - It doesn't matter if the temperature- </joey>
<joey> - What are you talking about? </joey>
<joey> Winter is the coldest time of year. </joey>
<joey> For us that's May to August. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I know. </connor>
<connor> I just thought that winter as a concept was a time period </connor>
<connor> not the season. </connor>
<joey> - No, it's definitely a season for us. </joey>
<joey> Because like, at least from my memory, </joey>
<joey> the hottest day of any year is always the last day </joey>
<joey> of the year. </joey>
<connor> So, our family always used to go to that one mate's place </connor>
<connor> who had that giant swimming pool in his backyard </connor>
<connor> because you're in that pool 'til about two in the morning </connor>
<connor> 'cause it's so fucking hot. </connor>
<connor> I remember the hottest experience I've ever had in my life, </connor>
<connor> it was New Year's Eve, and it was 45 degrees. </connor>
<connor> Obviously 45 degrees, everyone's in the pool. </connor>
<connor> Even after the sun went down, it was like 41 degrees. </connor>
<connor> And it was so hot that I remember I went home like </connor>
<connor> that morning, it was like 5:00 AM, </connor>
<joey> and the fridge had just exploded from the heat. </joey>
<joey> Like, the fridge just stopped working. </joey>
<garnt> - The fridge is like, all right guys, I'm out. </garnt>
<joey> Have a nice day. </joey>
<connor> - The fridge is like. </connor>
<connor> Happy new year, lads. </connor>
<connor> - My final message to the world. </connor>
<joey> - So, I remember when my parents got super pissed off </joey>
<joey> because they just like literally first day of the year, </joey>
<joey> they went to the electronics store and bought a new fridge </joey>
<joey> because it just got busted from the heat. </joey>
<connor> - The fridge is one of those appliances though </connor>
<connor> that I'd be excited to get a new one. </connor>
<connor> I'd be like, wow, we can really mix it up </connor>
<connor> with the fridge this time. </connor>
<joey> - Well, yeah, but like, you know, </joey>
<joey> I think it's good when you can buy a fridge </joey>
<joey> on your own accord. </joey>
<joey> - I disagree. </joey>
<connor> I prefer it when my appliances break </connor>
<connor> 'cause then I'm like, oh, I have to spend money. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, woe is me. </connor>
<joey> - I guess I have to get the most expensive one, geez. </joey>
<connor> But when you're upgrading, you're like, oh, fuck. </connor>
<connor> I've got a perfectly good one. </connor>
<connor> I don't really need... </connor>
<garnt> - You start with a cockroach fridge </garnt>
<connor> or washing machine or whatever or whatever it is. </connor>
<connor> - Because if it was a good appliance- </connor>
<connor> - Your standard of an upgrade is quite low. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> We're going from cockroaches to no cockroaches. </connor>
<joey> - It's all uphill from there. </joey>
<joey> - There's some appliances where I'm like, </joey>
<connor> it literally doesn't need anything fancy. </connor>
<connor> Like, a microwave does not need to be fancy. </connor>
<connor> A microwave just heats. </connor>
<connor> Heat thing up good, thank you. </connor>
<connor> - It literally vibrates water molecules. </connor>
<garnt> Literally how would you do that differently? </garnt>
<joey> - Because I'm using Joey's old one. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause Joey just gave me his one </joey>
<joey> 'cause he wanted to get an- </joey>
<joey> - Microwave oven, </joey>
<connor> - Microwave oven, which I don't believe in. </connor>
<garnt> I think that's nonsense. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I got the kettle from Joey. </garnt>
<garnt> When did Joey give you the microwave? </garnt>
<garnt> Was it when you moved here? </garnt>
<joey> - Why do you guys keep taking my hand me downs? </joey>
<garnt> - 'Cause you were like, "Do you want a microwave?" </garnt>
<connor> And I was like, "Sure." </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause I remember when, </connor>
<connor> 'cause this was literally in the first week </connor>
<connor> when we moved here and we were just like settling in, </connor>
<connor> whatever, and you were just like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, do you want a kettle? </connor>
<connor> "You can have a free kettle." </connor>
<connor> - They were making it out to be a gift. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Fuck off, this is not a gift. </connor>
<connor> This is not a gift. </connor>
<connor> - I remember thinking at the time, </connor>
<connor> "Oh my God, such a good mate. </connor>
<connor> "He's just helping me. </connor>
<garnt> "Like, he's just helping me like decorate the house </garnt>
<joey> "and give me appliances." </joey>
<joey> - I was using those oldest sibling skills. </joey>
<connor> - 'Cause I remember Aki was like, </connor>
<joey> "Do you want to just take the microwave?" </joey>
<joey> I was like, "Why, why would I, </joey>
<joey> "why were you saying that? </joey>
<connor> "Why would I just take the microwave?" </connor>
<connor> They're like, "Oh, like a gift." </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "It's not a fucking gift." </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> I'll take it, but don't preface that it's a gift. </connor>
<joey> - Because we were gonna buy an oven. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, you wanted to. </connor>
<connor> - And then we realized, oh, it's not just an oven. </connor>
<joey> It's a microwave oven. </joey>
<joey> - I remember that Aki was like, "It's a gift." </joey>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> It's not a gift, it's not a gift. </connor>
<connor> - Now living in Japan, </connor>
<joey> I know getting rid of appliances is a fucking nightmare. </joey>
<joey> - It's the worst. </joey>
<joey> - It's a fucking nightmare. </joey>
<joey> So I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> that motherfucker just wanted to get rid of his appliances </joey>
<connor> that he wants to replace and he framed it as a fucking gift. </connor>
<connor> - Welcome to Japan, here's the kettle I don't use anymore. </connor>
<connor> - Here you go. </connor>
<connor> I'm such a good mate. </connor>
<connor> I'm literally giving you free stuff. </connor>
<connor> - You're British, you like kettles, right? </connor>
<joey> - I do, I do. </joey>
<joey> Actually don't use my kettle anymore. </joey>
<joey> I use the hot pot thing. </joey>
<joey> Like thermos pot, whatever it's called. </joey>
<joey> - Thermo pot? </joey>
<joey> - Where you just put like two liters of water in a pot </joey>
<joey> and it keeps it boiling the whole day. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's more energy efficient. </joey>
<joey> - Ooh, fancy. </joey>
<joey> - But yeah, in Japan, </joey>
<connor> if you want to get rid of your appliances, </connor>
<connor> this is something that you should definitely be aware of, </connor>
<connor> because if it's over like, if it's a big appliance, </connor>
<connor> so like I think a hairdryer or bigger is considered </connor>
<joey> as a big appliance, you have to call- </joey>
<joey> - So, literally all appliances. </joey>
<joey> - Literally any appliance. </joey>
<garnt> - You have to call up the local government in your area </garnt>
<joey> and tell them you want to get rid of it </joey>
<connor> and then you have to schedule it, right? </connor>
<joey> - I actually just finished doing that the other day </joey>
<joey> 'cause we had to get rid of our old dining table </joey>
<joey> and our old like cabinet that had all of our dishes in it. </joey>
<connor> - Wait, why didn't your old moving company do it? </connor>
<connor> Why didn't you have a moving company do it? </connor>
<joey> - We just kind of forgot it. </joey>
<joey> - Oh. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> We just kind of forgot. </joey>
<connor> 'Cause I originally wanted to, </connor>
<connor> I originally had the old kitchen table that we have </connor>
<connor> on my balcony because I thought, </connor>
<connor> oh, I could use this if I'm like barbecuing </connor>
<connor> or doing something outside </connor>
<connor> and I need something to like place it on. </connor>
<connor> But then I kind of didn't use it, it got hit in the rain, </connor>
<connor> I forgot to put like a lacquer on it, </connor>
<connor> so it just started rotting. </connor>
<joey> And I was like, all right, need to get rid of this now. </joey>
<connor> And it was, oh my God- </connor>
<connor> - Dining tables do that if you put them outside. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> But it's cool though because in my area </joey>
<joey> that you can like register it through like line. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, that's cool. </joey>
<connor> - But the sucky thing is had to wait about, I don't know, </connor>
<connor> four weeks to throw it out. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause they were like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, you have to schedule it ahead of time." </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "Oh, okay." </connor>
<connor> - Four weeks to throw things out. </connor>
<connor> - Maybe it's like next week or like this weekend </connor>
<connor> or something, you know, whatever. </connor>
<connor> It's like, "So yeah, </connor>
<joey> "the next open slot is 40 days from now." </joey>
<connor> - And you have to give them the precise measurements </connor>
<joey> of the thing. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, it's obviously I understand why, </joey>
<connor> but it's one of those things where it's like, </connor>
<connor> this is a hassle that I've never had to do in the UK before. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, it's like why am I measuring something </joey>
<joey> that I'm about to throw out? </joey>
<connor> It just doesn't make, </connor>
<connor> it's a bit ass backwards. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I made sure the moving company that I've hired </joey>
<connor> for my place, I'm like, "You throw things away, right? </connor>
<connor> "You throw them away?" </connor>
<joey> - Good thing about like things like fridges </joey>
<joey> or like washing machines and stuff like that is </joey>
<connor> that like there is usually service where, </connor>
<connor> when they bring the new one, they take away the old. </connor>
<connor> - That's true, that's true. </connor>
<connor> - Like, we just got a new washing machine and- </connor>
<garnt> - They take away the old one. </garnt>
<garnt> - And they take away the old. </garnt>
<joey> I was like, oh thank God. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> That's why, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> whoever sold you the fucking cockroach fridge, </garnt>
<connor> they were just like, man. </connor>
<connor> They were like 500 IQ. </connor>
<connor> "We got him to pay for this shit. </connor>
<connor> "We got him to pay for this." </connor>
<connor> - I got scammed. </connor>
<connor> That was a scam. </connor>
<connor> - Straight up scam. </connor>
<connor> - First time in Japan. </connor>
<joey> I got a gift. </joey>
<connor> - Welcome to Japan. </connor>
<connor> - What a warm greeting to a foreign country. </connor>
<connor> But yeah, I made sure the movie company like, </connor>
<connor> "You throw things away, right?" </connor>
<connor> And I was like, "Great. </connor>
<connor> "Everything needs to go. </connor>
<connor> "Get rid of everything." </connor>
<joey> I'm literally throwing away like nearly everything I own. </joey>
<joey> - It's time for an upgrade. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause I'm like, yeah, 'cause my bed was like 200 bucks </joey>
<connor> for like the bed and the mattress. </connor>
<connor> It's fucking terrible. </connor>
<connor> It's like, I'm sure like, you know, </connor>
<joey> prisoners in isolation get better beds than what I've got. </joey>
<joey> So I was like, you know, get rid of it. </joey>
<joey> - They get a whole padded room. </joey>
<joey> - It's an absolute nightmare. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause yeah (laughs) </joey>
<connor> Get the whole sound proofing too. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause if you want to do it myself, </connor>
<connor> I have to disassemble the bed and then like put it down </connor>
<connor> into the thing, schedule when they're gonna come get it, </connor>
<connor> and then kind of like schedule getting a new bed myself </connor>
<connor> in between the day I'm throwing it out. </connor>
<connor> It's a real nightmare. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> That was a nightmare for us. </connor>
<joey> And that's why like when we moved into our new place, </joey>
<connor> 'cause we threw our old bed away, </connor>
<connor> when we were waiting for the new bed, </connor>
<connor> we had to sleep on like a fucking blow up mattress </connor>
<connor> for like a week. </connor>
<connor> - Oh wow. </connor>
<connor> - Just because the timing was off. </connor>
<connor> But like yeah, because I'm thinking of like getting rid </connor>
<garnt> of my desk in my place. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, 'cause you're thinking </garnt>
<garnt> about getting the standing desk. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm just dreading having to like schedule a, </garnt>
<connor> I have to wait another month to like throw this thing out, </connor>
<connor> and then I have to take it down myself and disassemble it. </connor>
<joey> I'm just like (groans) </joey>
<connor> - It's a pain in the ass. </connor>
<joey> - It sucks. </joey>
<joey> Please make it better. </joey>
<connor> - You can get a service, right? </connor>
<joey> - That's what I'm thinking. </joey>
<joey> I'm just gonna like, I'm just gonna pay the money. </joey>
<joey> Just get someone to just come and get rid of it. </joey>
<garnt> - If you want to get rid of your appliances, </garnt>
<connor> it's probably gonna take like all day just to sort out. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I mean, if you can make, you know, </connor>
<connor> it's probably what? </connor>
<connor> An hour to disassemble? </connor>
<connor> Then you gotta fuck around with the calling the people, </connor>
<connor> taking it down, </connor>
<connor> figuring out when you got to do all that stuff. </connor>
<connor> Like, it's probably what? </connor>
<joey> Three hours of work? </joey>
<joey> You can probably make more than the money it would cost </joey>
<joey> to do that if you just worked. </joey>
<joey> So it's like I would rather, </joey>
<joey> 'cause I also don't, </joey>
<connor> it's sometimes not even the money it's, like, </connor>
<connor> I don't want to deal with the stress. </connor>
<connor> Like, this is a stressful thing </connor>
<connor> that I don't like dealing with. </connor>
<connor> And so I will pay a premium to not have to do that. </connor>
<joey> - Not only that, </joey>
<connor> but like I have to deal with it in this weather as well. </connor>
<connor> It's like, fuck that. </connor>
<connor> Disassembling that dining table in this heat was hell. </connor>
<connor> - I like fixing my electronics and like opening them up </connor>
<connor> and doing that stuff, 'cause I enjoy that, </connor>
<connor> but I don't enjoy disassembling furniture and desks. </connor>
<connor> - I don't think anyone does. </connor>
<connor> - I like assembling furniture. </connor>
<joey> I don't like disassembling furniture. </joey>
<connor> - Some people are like so good with that stuff </connor>
<garnt> and they enjoy it. </garnt>
<garnt> They just like. </garnt>
<connor> - But like disassembling furniture is </connor>
<connor> like the most depressing thing in the world. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause like at least if you're assembling furniture, </connor>
<connor> you have something to look forward to. </connor>
<connor> You get the final product. </connor>
<connor> What are you looking forward to </connor>
<connor> after disassembling the furniture? </connor>
<garnt> Nothing. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's why in the UK, </garnt>
<connor> I used to just put it on like websites </connor>
<connor> and I'd be like, "Who wants it for free?" </connor>
<joey> - We used a service for that </joey>
<connor> when we moved to get rid of our couch. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I'm like, "Who wants it?" </connor>
<connor> - We just like, there's a website where you can just like, </connor>
<connor> just put it up for like zero yen. </connor>
<connor> It's like, "Come and get it." </connor>
<connor> And some dude came to get it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, as long as you take it away, you deal with it, </connor>
<joey> you can have it. </joey>
<connor> That's what I did in the UK with all the stuff. </connor>
<joey> Like, I had a budget gaming chair that was just broken. </joey>
<joey> I was like, "Oh, if someone wants it, you gonna have it. </joey>
<joey> "It's kinda jank. </joey>
<joey> "It still works, but it's not great." </joey>
<joey> And then someone just came. </joey>
<joey> Some Russian guy turned up to my door. </joey>
<joey> "My son will love this chair." </joey>
<connor> And I was like, all right, cool. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I just don't want to do anything in this heat. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, if I'm not inside in an air conditioned place, </garnt>
<garnt> then I just don't want to be there. </garnt>
<connor> Like, me and Sydney tried to like schedule a date </connor>
<connor> the other day where we just go out and do something </connor>
<connor> and then we realized we just don't want </connor>
<connor> to fucking do anything outside. </connor>
<connor> Let's just try and find something inside </connor>
<connor> because it's literally impossible to do anything. </connor>
<connor> And especially now with inside activities kind of </connor>
<connor> on lockdown, it's really hard to find anything right now. </connor>
<joey> - Exactly. </joey>
<connor> - True, true. </connor>
<connor> Amen to that. </connor>
<joey> - You know who else hates the summer heat? </joey>
<joey> Our patrons. </joey>
<joey> - Ooh. </joey>
<garnt> - Probably, I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<joey> Actually, if our patrons were here, </joey>
<joey> they would definitely hate summer. </joey>
<joey> - They would hate summer. </joey>
<garnt> If you're British, I don't know if you hate summer or not. </garnt>
<garnt> - I can't stand this. </garnt>
<garnt> - I didn't until I moved outside. </garnt>
<connor> And now I hate the summer. </connor>
<connor> Not as much as the winter though. </connor>
<garnt> Winter sucks. </garnt>
<garnt> - Doesn't help that we record "Trash Taste" </garnt>
<connor> with these blasting lights on us. </connor>
<garnt> - I was sweating a lot of this episode </garnt>
<garnt> because we didn't turn on the air conditioning </garnt>
<garnt> in this fucking heat. </garnt>
<joey> - As you were talking earlier, </joey>
<joey> I could literally see a giant bead of sweat. </joey>
<garnt> - It's 'cause I've got the fucking sun staring at me </garnt>
<garnt> and we don't even fucking have the AC on. </garnt>
<connor> - The price that we, you know, </connor>
<garnt> you can't say that we don't care about you guys. </garnt>
<garnt> - Meilyne gave me the Evian facial spray </garnt>
<garnt> which I actually accepted. </garnt>
<garnt> And I realize that it did nothing. </garnt>
<connor> - How the tables have turned. </connor>

<garnt> - Yeah, and I guess that's this episode, </garnt>
<garnt> this summery themed episode of "Trash Taste," I suppose. </garnt>
<connor> Was it summery themed? </connor>
<connor> - Well, you're dressed for the occasion. </connor>
<connor> - I, you know- </connor>
<connor> - You're so dressed well for the occasion. </connor>
<connor> - I'm gonna start a barbecue after this. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Very dad of you. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, but anyway, </connor>
<connor> that's been this episode of "Trash Taste." </connor>
<connor> Hope you enjoy your summer, and we'll see you all next time. </connor>
<connor> Bye! - Bye! </connor>
<connor> (chill music plays) </connor>
