<SPEAKER_01> - As you were talking earlier, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I could literally see
a giant bead of sweat. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's because I've got the
fucking sun staring at me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and we don't even fucking have the AC on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] The price that we, you know- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Evian water spray. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Let's go! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (chill music plays) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Hello and welcome to another
episode of "Trash Taste." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know what episode
number this is anymore </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because it's probably gonna
be out of order anyway. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm your host for today, Garnt, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and joining me once again are the boys. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know who they are. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What are you wearing, Garnt? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, it's summer now, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I need to bring the summer energy, okay? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like channeling every dad
during a barbecue right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - You look like if Trevor
from GTA V got a tan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like a dad with one
too many camera lenses. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And you're like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ooh, I don't know what he's
getting up to with these lenses. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Dad that goes "bird watching." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do you really need a 500 millimeter lens </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that's like this long? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, is there a, come on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Plays GTA Vice City once,
okay, I've got it now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Goes to Miami once. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - But how are you guys like
surviving Japanese summer? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, how hot is it today? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Jesus. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like 35, I think. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Or yesterday was 35. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You know what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Let me start off with something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I hate it when you can't
complain about the weather </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where you're from. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, you know- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I said on Twitter, I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I can't, I'm dying, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> "It's 35 degrees." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And then someone replies, like
(scoffs) "It's like 42 here." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, that is not
something to be proud of. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You live in a fucking,
like, the actual sun. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, why are you bragging? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I fuckin' hate that shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, no matter how hot
it is where you are, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you could be fucking
dying in the Sahara Desert </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or something, you get to
like the nearest town. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You're like, "Fuck, man, I
just survived the Sahara." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And someone from Texas or
somewhere would be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh, how hot was it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "How hot was it?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - "You didn't measure it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "You didn't measure it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Why didn't you measure it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> "Is it hotter where I am? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "You little bitch!" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, 'cause what I've realized, okay, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like living in Japan has
made me change my opinion </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> because before- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - On what? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay, so before moving to Japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or before like moving out- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Something totally unrelated. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Actually it's not totally unrelated </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause before moving to Japan
or moving out of England, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> my favorite season was summer, okay? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I was the summer kid. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - We've discussed this
in the podcast before </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and we were like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Have we? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, or maybe it was just off camera. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think it was off camera. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But I remember we
were like talking about, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I think you and
I both like the winter, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like much, much more. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, winter's the worst season. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Fuck off. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Winter is the worst season. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Maybe this has just
become a conversation </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that we have every single
year the summer turns around. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And everybody's gonna be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "You guys spoke about this already." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like it's in my head, shut up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, because like, I
didn't realize that, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> summers in England are
actually pretty good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And that's why summer
was my favorite season. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, how hot does it get in England? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like 25 degrees Celsius. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's not summer. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's the thing, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's the thing! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, no, it gets hotter than that, Garnt. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It gets hotter for like one week. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The summer before we left, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah, but that one week is pure hell </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because the UK, we don't
have air conditioning. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It just doesn't exist </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> in homes.
- [Garnt] True. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, the one time I went to the UK, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it was during that week. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's horrible because, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at least in Japanese summer, it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> oh shit, walking outside. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Fuck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> It's way worse. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But you can just go in
any building anywhere. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And you're like, oh cool. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just instant hard nip. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - They've got the AC running
at, like, full blast. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, it's good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like a fucking
tundra inside the building. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You have no escape in the UK. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like maybe the gym has AC, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the supermarket probably has it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But, like, that's it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, when you go home,
you're like (gasps) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Put on the TV." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (Connor yells) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, 'cause, like, what do
you do to cool down in the UK? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Have like nine fans on you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - So, you do have fans? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, but fans don't do shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, fans don't do shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Fans are like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Fans just dissipate the hot air. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Fans are placebos. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You're like, "Yeah, it's
definitely doing something." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> You're like, "Why am I
still sweating so much?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It doesn't, because all it is is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just taking the stagnant hot
air and just moving it around. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, occasionally I
just like, you go up to it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I put my shirt over the fan, and I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "This is true cooling." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's the best feeling though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Maybe it's a nostalgia thing
for me because growing up or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like spending my summers in Thailand, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, in Thailand we
would try to save costs </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> as much as possible, you know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So, like the AC is always
like the last resort. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's like when we are literally, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> dying of heat stroke. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Any other time, it's just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Come on, you can survive with the fan." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So, like, I spent most of my, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Thailand experience being
cooled down by a fan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and AC was just like, "Okay,
if we don't put the AC on, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> "we're probably going to die here." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, it's I think that's why it's, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kind of nostalgic to me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, I kind of like the fan, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like, I kinda like the
feeling of the fan on me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I admit like, if
you're not used to it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like, I felt sorry when you visited, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you and Aki visited us in the UK, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause you had to sleep in my room. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And we, that was like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - There was one fan in there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - There was a single fan
in like my entire house </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and we're like, "Joey,
you can have the fan." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't think it actually
did anything for you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It didn't do anything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was butt fucking naked in your bed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, I'm still dying. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It sucked. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It doesn't help, and it doesn't
get cool during the night. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I get like the whole, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fan being nostalgic though </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause like I have that exact
same thing at my grandma's- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah, suffering is nostalgic for me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - At my grandma's old place
in the middle of nowhere </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> in the mountains, we didn't have AC. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because the house was too
big to have a single AC unit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And, like, also all the
doors were always open, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so it was always with a fan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But it's nostalgic. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Is it good memories though? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I love just dying slowly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I remember that time when
I almost died of heatstroke </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at my grandma's house. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Good times. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - You might be confusing
nostalgia to like PTSD. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I like the feeling of,
like, I prefer the heat, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the feeling of summer over winter, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like, any day of the week. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm just depressed in winter. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Winter is just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> even like dying in this heat, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I still prefer what I'm
experiencing now to winter. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - What happens to you in the winter? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, what happens, bro? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Winter's just the worst season. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, a fucking "Game of
Thrones" character right now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> going on about this shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It is, it is the worst season! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay, okay, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think it's, like, scientifically proven </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that people are less happy, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people are more happy with more sunlight. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I disagree. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think it's literally
more healthier for you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to get more sunlight because
you are literally happier. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But there is sunlight in the winter. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's like barely any
sunlight in the winter. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And okay, here's the thing that
depresses me the most, okay? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Especially if you're
working a nine to five job </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you have to commute to work, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you wake up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> You wake up maybe 7:00 AM or whatever. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If you have to commute long,
it's like 7:00, 8:00 AM. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You wake up, it's dark. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You go to the office at 9:00, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's still just like
the sun's just rising. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I love that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's so fun. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It feels great, it's
like you beat the morning. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, okay, I'm ahead of it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - You stay inside, you stay
inside literally all day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You're just in the office
with artificial light. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> You go out, it's 5:00
PM, and again, it's dark. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I like the night. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - How could you! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> How could you not want
any sunshine in your life? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know, most of the time
I have my curtains closed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's too hot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Even in my office now, I
have them closed all the time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - And like the second thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Everything's dead in the winter. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There's no color at all. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You look outside, everything's gray. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Everything's drab. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> How can you be happy
with, like, zero color? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just think you're a boring person. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like, literally the only
thing to look forward to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> in winter is Christmas. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, I'm pretty sure- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't give a shit about Christmas. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm pretty sure they invented Christmas </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because if they didn't have Christmas, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like everyone would just have
nothing to look forward to. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Objection, I'm from Australia. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> We didn't have such thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like this for me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Everyone knows that Christmas
was invented by Coca-Cola. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Of course, of course. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - There was no Christmas before Coca-Cola. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Everyone knows that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know, I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's fun. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It's cozy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know, you get to- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it's cozy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Also, you get the most
drip in winter, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I agree. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You get no drip in the summer. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I wouldn't be wearing
this drip in the winter. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You get the best drip
and you get the best sleep. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, true, sleep is clean. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Crack the window open
a little bit sometimes, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's kinda chilly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like, you're kind of like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it's kind of like just, it's not cold, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's like a little bit like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> ooh, okay, maybe I could
put something light on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But the moment you hop in that bed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you put that blanket over you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and you're just wrapped in a warm cocoon, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's like, I'm unstoppable. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This sleep is on my side now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And you just get the best fucking sleep. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, the mornings suck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The mornings do suck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But for me, all the mornings suck! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't wake up in the morning, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> so it doesn't make a
fucking difference to me! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, the only thing I will say is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that I can wear turtlenecks in the winter. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It sucks 'cause your options
are so limited in the winter. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, you can't, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sorry, the summer. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You can't wear more than one layer ever. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, a jacket? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh, well that sucks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> No. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I love jackets. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Jackets are so fun. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No jeans. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Jumpers are gone. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, jeans. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I wear jeans still now, but I'm dying. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But that's because I hate shorts. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - But that's why like British summers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause what I realized is
that British summers is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> just like a comfortable, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like it's a comfortable temperature. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Pre global warming? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> It was good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause this didn't used to happen. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And it was never like this in
the UK where it was that bad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I remember we always
complain about British summers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to be, like, every British
person I've met is just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh, you haven't
experienced British summer. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "It's like, really, it rains sometimes, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> "it's cold sometimes." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just like, it actually
slaps compared to other summers, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> compared to other places. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I would have agreed with
you until like two years ago </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> when for some reason two years in a row, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we just had horrible heat waves </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that just ruined the summer for me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause it was always fun in the UK. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The best part about it
is I like it in summer </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> when the day is hot and
the night gets cool. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But in Japan it doesn't get cool. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, it does. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think it does. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Compared to now, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like, 'cause you know, it's like what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Fucking 2:00 PM right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like the hottest
time of the day right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - But compared to, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you all right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Carry on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But compared to that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> when the sun finally
goes down at like what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, 8:00 PM maybe, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and like around like 9:00 or 10:00, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like, it's pretty comfortable. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's the kind of weather where I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> "Okay, I'm really comfortable." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I can't concentrate with him. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We're gonna cut. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Mechs! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You all right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What's wrong with you all of a sudden? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know, guys. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just want to suddenly ride a mech </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and battle other people to prove </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I'm the best mech pilot ever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> How can I satisfy this
sudden urge, you guys? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, I'm glad you've asked. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've got just the thing for you, Garnt. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Mech Arena! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's the new casual mobile game
shooter on Android and iOS. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Hop in your mech, play a game or two, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cause some chaos, and be
out in just a few minutes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Anyone can play it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you don't need to be a
pro gamer to have some fun. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] I actually tried it out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I really liked the Guardian mech. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You can shut down enemy
abilities like shields or stuns. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it forces the enemy to
completely reload their weapons. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> With just a push of a
button the enemy is donzo. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That sounds OP as F! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It sure is, Garnt. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] My favorite
mech is the Panther. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It has the ability called
the stasis barrier. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Put down invincible wall
that blocks enemy bullets </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and slows anyone that passes through it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If you'd like to maintain the distance </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and snipe down your enemies,
this mech is for you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - That sounds like a very cool mech! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And even better, Garnt. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Mech Arena sent us... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What is that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - A box. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - What are those? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Open it up, Joey. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Open it up! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - What are you waiting for? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - First of all, we got
to scan this QR code. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Once you scan that in, we
have these character cards. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, okay, look at that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, I'm in like the room. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Meilyne's in there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - How did you get that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's actually kind of cool. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So apparently there's a
poster that you can also scan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh, that looks cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That actually looks cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, while you guys are doing that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> let me check out some of the
other things inside this box. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh my God, this thing's so heavy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So, I assume this is a Mech Arena coaster. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's got some weight to it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Computer] Mech Arena is a new- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like a birthday
card, but it's, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's not only that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like a legit screen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like an actual tablet inside. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And it just stops when you close it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Let me see that, let me see that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Let me see that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> All right, ready for it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh my God.
- That's actually so cool. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> We have also what looks like
to be the Mech Arena art book </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or a little art pamphlet that
shows all of the concept art. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I guess you can just keep the tablet </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because there's even a charger. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I think so. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - To what I assume is the tablet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I think we just literally
just got a free tablet. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh, and by the way, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's not the coolest
thing that's in here </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> because there's also one more thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If I can even get it out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We got a little figure. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Ooh, look at that! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - A Mech Arena figure. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Look at that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Now you can
finally get in the robot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - And also we've got
the Mech Arena T-shirts. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Where's my T-shirt? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Where are our T-shirts? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Crew, throw us a T-shirt,
a Mech Arena T-shirt. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Assert dominance on the mechs </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with these Mech Arena T-shirts too. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm in the Mech Arena. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Mech Arena has
just launched globally. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They're running a huge celebration
event in game right now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with loads of awesome events, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as well as a great login reward program, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which you definitely
don't want to miss out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] It's completely
free to play right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And you can use the
link in the description </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or scan the QR code here to
get one Black Carbon skin, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 300 A-Coins, 50,000 credits
to help kickstart your game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - And if you're lucky, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you might even get to
team up with one of us </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and get to play a game or two together. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm getting in the robots right now! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Back to the episode. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But, like, I like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I like having as much, as I said, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as much sunlight as possible. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I just, I feel like the best, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like my favorite time period
of the entire year is about, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like, what's the word? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, dusk summertime when
like the sun's setting, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's about 7:00, 8:00 PM, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you're just watching the sunset. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Man, you feel like a
fucking anime character </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause it's just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no, it's that fucking scene
where you're just like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Bullshit do you watch the sun. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - In every opening where, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the protagonist is watching the sunset </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and the wind's just blowing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - How often do you- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You are not standing out
on your fucking balcony </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> being like, "That's a nice sunset." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How often are you watching the sunset? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Navi] That's freaking
Star Wars you're watching! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, shut the fuck up! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> No, it's anime! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Shut the fuck up, Navi! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's not Star Wars! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's that scene on Tatooine </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> where he's like watching the sun go down. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - How often are you watching the sunset? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Honestly, that's why I love my balcony. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's why I have a hammock out there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Fuck off, you're not
watching the sunset every day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm not watching it every day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But that's the hottest
time of the day in my opinion </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> because you're getting that
like direct fucking sunlight. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - The hottest time of
the day is fucking now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't stand out there
for like 10 minutes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's hot until the sun goes down. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, the moment the sun rises, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's the hottest time of the day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I like going outside, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I don't want to have
to fucking, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> shed away my life expectancy
just to go outside. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I guess that's
why for me in Japan, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think my favorite
season is probably spring. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - For me, it's the autumn. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Autumn? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, around, like, October
is probably my favorite time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of the year just because it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> again, you have that
variance in drip, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You can wear a jacket if
it gets a little bit cold </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in the night, but you can take it off </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and, you know, rock a long sleeve. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> But it's also not so cold
that it's excruciating, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but it's not too hot either. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like that's the
same as spring though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And I like the whole, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have we talked about Hanami at all? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, the cheery blossom? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't think so. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, like, so, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, you know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> You watch anime, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know what cherry blossoms are. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The cherry blossoms! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know what fucking
cherry blossoms are. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I won't lie, I was slightly disappointed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to find out the cherry
blossoms are only around </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> for like one week and then they fuck off </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I'm like, hold up, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're in all the anime all the time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> What's going on with that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, they film all the
anime in the same week. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I realize it's like a cult in Japan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, they're obsessed
with this, the Hanami. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, everything revolves, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when Hanami's coming up,
everything is happening. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like, everything has
to become cherry blossom. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like everyone just joins like a call- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's because there's a
really extensive history. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> But it's like, it's nuts. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, it's, I understand why
it's in anime so much now, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but when I got here I'm like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> wow, literally everything is decorated </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like it's a Call of Duty gun skin. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, everything's there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It doesn't matter what it is,
it gets a cherry blossom skin. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, not gonna lie, man, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a good Hanami is fucking dope. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, but it's a bit
disappointing it's only one week. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> What if you're like busy, you
got shit going on that week, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're like shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wait 'til next year. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I did miss Hanami this week. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, this year, this year. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh sorry, sorry, this year. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I didn't do anything this
year, I totally forgot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't know when it was coming. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I had one of the best
Hanami's this year. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Rub it in, Joey. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Fucking hell. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause we went to the
fucking Hakone for it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> All along the Hakone River's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> just like rows and rows of Sakura trees. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Want to explain what
Hanami is to the viewers? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - So, Hanami literally means
flower watching in Japanese. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> So, it's basically this kind of, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I wouldn't even say it's like a festival. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> It's more like an event that happens. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Isn't it even a public holiday? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like it's a mutual agreement </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> amongst everyone to get drunk in the park. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's kind of what it is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Pretty much, pretty much. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - But it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> because the Sakura are only
around for about a week </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and maybe sometimes not even
a week, a couple of days, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people go out and like celebrate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> by just sitting under a tree, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> having a picnic under the Sakura tree. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It's fucking great. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Do you think it's worth? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I know a lot of
people who are like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I want to come to
Japan during that time." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You think it's worth coming
to Japan just for it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think if it's the first
time you're coming to Japan, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think it's worth it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think now, because we've
lived in Japan for two years, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we're kind of like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we're kind of like used to it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I feel like seeing
Hanami for the first time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and seeing like all
like the cherry blossoms </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just like falling off the
trees and you have, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the ground is literally
covered in cherry blossoms. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, everywhere. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think that's a pretty cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Couple of weebs just
definitely just nutted </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to you saying that right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> "It's like in the anime!" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like, you literally walk through a park </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it is literally like
every fucking anime scene </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where like the fucking cherry blossoms- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, the cherry blossoms,
like, fluttering down. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Still looks dope. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It looks dope as fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know what it is that
just is like so aesthetic. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> But it's just the perfect aesthetic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, Japan is like kind
of aesthetic all year round. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But I'd say like the most
aesthetic is probably </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> during the Sakura season. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'd say if you are gonna do it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> definitely get out of Tokyo. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause like every single
Hanami place in Tokyo, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like, every single park that
has the cherry blossom trees </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is crammed!
- Packed as shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - You will be, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like, 'cause two years ago,
we did like a small one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And we had to get like a corner of dirt </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in the park right next to the road. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, it was the only, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> literally the only spot
left in this massive park. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Where'd you guys go? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, Shinjuku? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, we were in Saitama. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, Saitama. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And it was like, rammed as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> So it was so full. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause what people
normally do here in Japan is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> during the cherry blossom week or season </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> or when they're blooming,
people go to the park, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they get like a kind
of like a picnic area, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then they just get
fucking pissed in public. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> It's great. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I would say go like
when you come to Japan, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> definitely do like a week in Tokyo, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then if you're, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if it aligns with the Hanami,
do a week somewhere else </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> where you can then celebrate the Hanami. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like doing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause you can't really
explore Japan in one week, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't think. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] No, you can't. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You can't even explore
Tokyo in one week. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - True. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I've been here for like two years now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I've barely explored Japan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - How's Hanami in like Hakone you said? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, it's great because, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, Hakone is still, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> very much a tourist destination, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I mean, compared to like
Shinjuku or like Yoyogi Park. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, you don't get any space at all. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, absolutely no space at all. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I mean, like, I guess as well, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> like, in Hakone and a
lot of places in Hakone, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they have definitely like
positioned a lot of, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> own-sans and like yocons
and stuff like that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> around the Sakura </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and like around all the
aesthetic parts of Hakone. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So yeah, it was great. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, like, we stayed in like an Airbnb </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that was overlooking like a
bunch of like Sakura trees </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on the lake and in the distance
you could see Mount Fuji. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it was like the most
like aesthetic fuckin' Hanami </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I ever had. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like, you know what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's kind of worth to go all
the way out there sometimes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> to just, like, get a little
bit of peace of mind. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause otherwise it's just be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you'd be rubbing shoulders
with the person next to you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> being like, "Look at the petal over there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh my God." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It wasn't the people, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it was like the fucking
kids running around. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, like getting pissed is great. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Getting pissed with like a bunch of, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> five, six year olds
running around you, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> playing football or whatever (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's not exactly like
the best kind of vibes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> to get piss drunk. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - If you're sitting like where I am now, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you are probably like this
close to someone as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Someone else's like mat and picnic set. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> You said you stayed in an Airbnb. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Have you stayed in many Airbnbs in Japan? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Not really. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, 'cause like 90%
of them got fucking axed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, so for the Olympics, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the Japanese government changed
the rules around Airbnbs. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Basically just gutting them and making it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so that you had to make it,
you need to follow a lot of, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they basically made it so you
had to follow hotel rules. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, they had to have
like the fire escape </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and like the floor lit up to the... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They basically made the
rules impossible on purpose </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where you couldn't turn
a profit like reasonably. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Basically, 'cause I
have stayed in an Airbnb- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I stayed in one as
well the first time I visited, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it was super cheap. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You can get like, what did we get? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Me and Alan got the Airbnb for what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, it was really cheap, like 150 bucks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - But it was like a really,
really small room I remember. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - But it was right in Shinagawa. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Was that the one? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - That was the one I got really sick in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - The one you threw up in! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What I want to know,
okay, so this was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I think the first time
you'd been to Japan? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That was my very first time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Your very first time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was so confused. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just turned up in this place. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I had the instructions for this Airbnb </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I didn't understand. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I had my luggage and I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "What the fuck is going on?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was so confused. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, the other side of the world. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And of course Connor flies over, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the very first thing we do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> once Connor and Alan come
over is that we go to karaoke </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and we stay all night. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, we weren't going to. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> So what happened was is that- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I took you guys to an izakaya. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was only gonna meet,
'cause you guys were like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh, we're too sleepy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "We're probably just gonna go to bed." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then I think me and Joey were like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause it was my first
time going to Japan, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like (heavy breathing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Finally I can show this- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was like, "No, fuck this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> "I'm not resting, let's
go and get drinks." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah 'cause I was like jet lagged, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and so was Connor I think. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, you were jet lagged, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but you were running on the
excitement of being in Japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for the first time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was like, "Joey, show me around. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Let's go, let's go drink." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So then Joey took me
to like a very like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I took you to (speaks Japanese) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And it was during the week day </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> where they have 100 yen beers. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And Connor's mind was just fucking blown. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - "A dollar?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was like, "This is insane. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "This is like 60P." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is like uni prices. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Not even. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Uni prices don't even get this low. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This was insane. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "This is beer, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Like legit?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Legit beer, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, we were drinking. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And then while Me and
Joey were getting drunk, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think they, Garnt and- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We had just landed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - They were like, "You know what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> "No, we don't wanna miss out." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So, then they came and start drinking </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and then we went out to karaoke. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, we stayed- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I got very sick. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What I want to know, 'cause I know Joey, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Joey got very sick, if
you know what I mean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and had to stay around your place. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Who slept on the floor? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Alan did. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Garnt's editor. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so this was November. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> November, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> No, January. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I felt so bad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was, like, basically
it was fucking freezing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it was really cold. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And we had to have the
AC running in the room. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Problem was is that there was a door, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> there's literally no room
for anyone else to sleep </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in this room except two people. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, 'cause I remember
going to your place, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just like, how the fuck
did you fit three people in it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's literally a shoe box. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - So, basically Alan had to
sacrifice his bed for me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - And he slept in the hallway. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Alan, the tallest motherfucker. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And by hallway it was
literally like just a single, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like, very, like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - He just slept on the floor. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was like a human sized corridor. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You could not like fit anything more </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> than just like a fucking human. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it was like -5. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was really cold, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He was just like, like I, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I wasn't aware that
Alan had given up the bed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and slept in the hallway. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause I was out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was throwing up all night. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And it wasn't until I woke up that morning </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and I kind of came to and I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Where the fuck am I?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then I saw Connor in
his bed on the other side, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was like, "Oh, okay
I'm in their Airbnb." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, "Where's Alan?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And then I just saw this
like lump in the hallway. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Just like, just this
lump of like blankets. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He was so cold. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I was like, "Is that Alan? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> "Is he dead?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> He literally slept in, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the fucking shivering hallway for me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - He's that one friend
who's like the nicest guy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> when you're like sick or
like when you drank too much. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He's always got your back. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I threw up one time and
even though he was drunk, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> he cleaned it all up, and
I just went back to bed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - That was the very first time- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - First time I hung out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> First time I met him as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - First time you guys met, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, and he cleaned up
my (laughs) throwing up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's how I know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, from that point onwards, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like amazing friends with him. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause I was like, this guy's got my back. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - No one else will do that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I would never do that for someone. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, "I'm going back to bed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> "You can deal with this tomorrow." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I remember it was like
kind of like a house party </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we had in England where we kind
of like rented out an Airbnb </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and just like caught up with friends. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And you were like the new guy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was like 20 as well,
so I was still like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> "Yeah, let's drink way too much!" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I remember Alan telling
the story of like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think everyone was passed out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it was just you and Alan awake, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you guys were like sleeping
on the sofa or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then like, I think he
made eye contact with you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you made eye contact with him, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and he just started laughing
and then he just watched you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you just like looked at him, laughed, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and just chundered everywhere. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - That sounds like me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I remember 'cause, what was it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He made some drink with like
really budget energy drink. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And from that day on- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, Boost, Boost. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I swore never to drink
budget energy drink. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Even energy drink is bad enough, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but the budget one
where it's like 50 cents </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> for two liters is like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like brake fluid. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, no wonder, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like of course you're gonna
throw up drinking that stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm glad I did because I
didn't have to digest it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Jesus. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, we have a mate
from home who's now, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> discovered a new cocktail
is what he calls it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's not a cocktail. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> It's literally like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay, tell me how disgusting this sounds. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's Boost. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, a Boost energy- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - A budget energy drink. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Budget Red Bull. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Boost and red wine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> That's, oh, Jesus. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Does he have like
functioning like tastebuds? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I'm just like, I
thought we grew out of this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> in university, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That can't be- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Not even uni students stoop that low. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think if you did that in
France, you'd be deported. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yes, Rick, I'm calling
you out right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It's disgusting. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Stop trying to get me to drink it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's so vile. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Ew. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> What would that even taste? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, could you even taste the
energy drink at that point? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause the flavor of red wine
is so overpowering, I feel. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's some things where
even if that tasted amazing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, no, this is- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Morally wrong. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is too broke for me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, this is so broke. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And there's nothing wrong with that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just don't want to partake in it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> You could be broke. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Nice follow up there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, no, it's fine, it's fine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's not poor, it's broke. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's different. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Broke is a mindset. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Poor is a lifestyle. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Poor is your financial situation. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just don't be poor, just don't be poor. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Being broke is the mindset of like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm gonna live like an animal. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And I, you know, I don't
partake in that, you know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - You can be rich, but be
broke at the same time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Listen, the reason why- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - If you're homeless, just buy a house. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, that's poverty, Garnt. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's different. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There's a difference
between poverty and broke. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Big difference, Garnt. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Come on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Trying to get me in a corner
here saying being poor is bad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yes, it is, Garnt. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> You want me to say it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - You're not doing a
very good job of, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> supporting your argument. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Not my problem, not my problem. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like being like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> oh, there's a difference
between being ugly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and unattractive. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You can clearly afford red wine </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you can clearly afford energy drink. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Why would you mix them? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That is, like, you're making
yourself broke for no reason. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is that broke? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's broke, that's broke. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't drink energy
drink period anymore. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know at what age it
was where I was just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> man, Red Bull kinds sucks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It doesn't do anything for me anymore. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Actually, know what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I drink those, I don't know if it counts. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Is it an energy drink? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The Oronamin C. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah, that's kind of weird. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know if I count that as an energy- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I love those things. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it's like a vitamin drink. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's a vitamin drink that's
definitely not healthy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But it's in the same like
section as like Red Bulls. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, you mean the Japanese ones. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like a glass thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It's got a really satisfying pop. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You pull this metal tab
and it, a really nice pop. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oronamin C, I think it's called. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it's this on screen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know what it means. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Definitely if you
kinda like sweet drinks. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know who, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I don't really
drink energy drinks, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I love this thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's so tasty. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel that works better
than an energy drink. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know if it's placebo, but yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, it definitely tastes
a lot better for my body </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> than a Red Bull does. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't feel awful after drinking it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think it was because
now it's gotten to the point </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where if I have an energy drink, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's literally going to
make me unable to sleep </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> for that night, and it
never used to be that way. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Normally I could like down
five energy drinks or whatever </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and like be fine the night. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - See, I have the opposite problem. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't get anything from them anymore. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's 'cause you drink, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fucking five cups of coffee a day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not fucking surprised. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Maybe. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can quit any time, Garnt. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Can you? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I can quit any time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Said every drug addict. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I could stop any time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just replace coffee with energy drinks. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - "I quit coffee." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I normally just drink a lot of tea </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when I stop drinking them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, but tea also has caffeine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Not that much though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Doesn't tea have more caffeine? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know if that's an urban legend. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Tea without, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the tea itself if you just eat tea, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, like, the tea leaves? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Eat tea? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - If you would just eat the tea leaves. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, if you would just eat it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah, you'd be taking more
caffeine, but no one does that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The way you said that was so. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Eat tea?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - British people would be like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's not a drink, it's a meal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Scrumptious. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Sure, if you just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> fucking just like powder
the coffee on your food </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> or whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Get a caffeine fix. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - At what age did you start caring </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> about what you're putting in your body? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I still don't care. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yes, you do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Fuck off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, I care when I
can feel the effects. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Does that make sense? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Does that make sense? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, I guess so. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You mean, like, the immediate effects? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, like if- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like, oh, I have a tummy
ache immediately afterwards, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I probably shouldn't put it in my body. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, so like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I can just tell we're about
to get on an American talk. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, I feel like America's got- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I wasn't even thinking that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was already thinking about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Connor was just like,
"I feel it, I feel it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> "My instinct is telling
me to shit on America." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why is your brain like all
the time just ready to reload? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Sorry, sorry, go ahead. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just carry on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> If it naturally goes that way,
it'll naturally go that way. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, like, there was a point I feel like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> where you could just put
any shit in your body </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you could just not feel
any like aftereffects at all. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It would just like go away after a while. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But now, like, I have gotten
to a point where, for example, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I try to keep a healthy sleep schedule </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> because if I don't get a
healthy sleep schedule, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just feel like shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just felt like there was a point </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when I didn't care about sleep schedule </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it didn't matter. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Man discovers sleep for the first time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think your sleep schedule, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when you've got shit to do, that's- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's it, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> That's it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> When you got shit to do and
you want to be productive, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like waking up late actually affects that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm just like, yo, I
never thought about this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when I was a uni student </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I did everything
at 4:00 AM in the morning, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I still got a passing grade. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's what I'm jealous of
YouTubers who get canceled. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> They just get to take a break. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They just get to like
fuck off for four months. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Benefits to getting canceled,
you get a sleep schedule. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm like, fuck off, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> You canceled him. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> He gets to take a four
month paid vacation. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> His videos are still getting views. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is gonna come back in five months. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> David Dobrik got two month vacation. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's all he got. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> This is bullshit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So, what is the right amount of time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for like a YouTuber cancellation? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know, mate. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> But the more, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> when I saw David Dobrik and he came back, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> zero repercussions. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> His video that he came back with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> got the same amount of views. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Dislikes and likes were amazing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Got amazing likes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know, I'm like, this man
got a fucking month vacation. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This is bullshit! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> And he got free articles about him. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He can get verified now on Twitter. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm kidding, he was already. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - As if he wasn't already. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - But I was like, what the fuck? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - He can get double verified. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - There was like, no repercussions. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm like, wow. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> What point is it like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> damn, getting canceled doesn't
look too bad right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Don't ask for it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - If Logan Paul can literally come back </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> from showing a dead body, I
feel like anyone can come back. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, it's kinda the truth, you know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Mr. Anime said the same thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Joey! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can come back from this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Joey finna get canceled right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - What? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> For telling the truth? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That was a joke. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Joey said a joke. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It is a joke. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Please don't cancel Joey. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> But I was just thinking about it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause you saying that like, oh, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my mind made many jumps in logic there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You were saying, oh yeah,
when you got shit to do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But when you, you know, when you, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as YouTubers, you always have shit to do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's no vacations. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You can't just take a month off. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - People take a month off
for a "mental health break." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Which is like, I say with inverted commas </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because it's kind of become a cliche now, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> even though it's very important </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and YouTubers do fucking need it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But you know, it's sad
'cause if you get canceled, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you almost get a better vacation </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> because there's people
still talking about you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> while you're gone, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and people like searching about you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and making videos about you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, I know this sounds awful, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and, you know, it's not great, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but you are still getting way more traffic </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> than you would be just taking a break. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> So if you do something kind
of semi bad, you know, just- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Do something light, you know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Just do something like,
just, I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Just fart on a dog or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Just something that's, like, not too bad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fart on a dog. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What's something that
you'll get backlash for, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> but isn't really that bad </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you can just come
back from in a month? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Give your cat vodka. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> She was perfectly fine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Starting to think I should get a pet. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's a joke. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It's a joke, it's a joke. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is "Trash Taste"
getting canceled speedrun. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I just thought about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was like, hold on a second. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> All these people just get
like basically paid vacation. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is bullshit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I think it's
like different severities. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, people get like quite severe, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah, it's quite bad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> But I'm noticing more and
more, a lot of them just, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> if they haven't really
done anything criminal, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> they just kind of like
bounce back super easily. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, there are some people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> who did criminal and still come back. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - David Dobrik's thing was
kinda criminal to be fair, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> let's be honest. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it was kind of criminal. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Endangered someone's life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Came back all right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, it just amazes me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, it's like,
Jesus Christ, a cult. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - But then there's like
examples, like EDP455. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And he's definitely not coming back. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - That man is never coming back. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - He's trying real hard
to come back though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - EDP was a YouTuber who
got caught trying to meet up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with 14 year olds. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Didn't he, like, try
to start his own website </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> or something? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, he did. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Did he actually? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, he did.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because he got his YouTube banned, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then he was like,
"Finna go to Facebook." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know it's bad
when Facebook bans you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then his Facebook got banned. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, Facebook banned him. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - So he's like, "I'm gonna
start my own website." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He's trying really hard, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - But yeah, the main point
of this whole me going </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> on this tangent was that yeah,
I feel like as YouTubers, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you don't really get a break. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I know we're complaining, oh boo hoo us. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Who cares? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, we have an easy job, so, whatever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But I mean it's yeah, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> we don't really get like
set vacations which sucks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I kinda miss, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, one thing I
really do miss doing is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just being able to have two weeks off, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just play video games. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Just catch up with shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, I don't even want
to go places anymore </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause I travel anyway on like weekends </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or whenever I find three
days here and there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's fun, but it feels like
you're still doing something. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But I just want that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I miss that feeling of like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm gonna take two weeks off,
catch up to all the movies, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> catch up to all the manga,
just play video games. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know, might start
Persona, probably won't. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just buy it, just look at it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, so many games in my backlog </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that I just want to play. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, the new Mass Effect
remaster got released, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm just like, I want to play that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> But I haven't even played
Persona V Royal yet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And fuck knows where I'm
gonna get the time to do that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I now have two wishlists. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I have the wishlist where I
will actually use the thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the wishlist where
this is just a wishlist </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where it would be nice,
but I won't use it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it's the canceled wishlist. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause like you said you
had a day the other day </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where you just woke up
and you did nothing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and it was amazing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I kinda just woke up one day, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I was like, well, I don't
really have any like videos </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to work on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't really have any like
other side projects to work on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And so I'm just like, you know what? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm gonna do a power move. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Not do anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, not do anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't even like
check my phone that day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, no, phone turning off. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm just gonna do shit around
the house and just hang out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> damn, is this what like a weekend feels </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for every other person? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, I'm literally experiencing a weekend </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for the first time in my life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, oh my God, this is fun. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I should do this more often. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like, I think for us,
especially the last few months, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> have just been super fucking busy, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with us building this set </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and having to like film a
bunch of episodes to get ahead. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember we had like
this two week period </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where it was like, we
finished building the set, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and then we'd film a "Trash
Taste" episode every day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for like, it was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we have recording session
with either "Trash Taste" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or like a Netflix shoot or some kind of, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> some kind of other live stream
every day for like two weeks </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> without any breaks or
weekends or anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - That was brutal. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That was like, I was
like close to burnout. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I do fill my schedule a lot on purpose. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like, I'm jealous of you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm jealous of you the most
because you view streaming </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as a downtime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm just like, I wish
my downtime could be work. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I wish I could get paid for my downtime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like, I wish I could
be paid for my downtime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just enjoy it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And that's why people
always complain to me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, "make a stream schedule." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, nah, bro. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I just do it whenever
I want, but I still, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I stream often. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Around the same times. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But people are like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, why do you need a stream schedule? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You literally stream like, what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Three or four times a week? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause I think to
myself, most of the time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> whether I decide to stream
is normally on the day, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's normally like
if I've worked too much </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> or maybe I want to just chill out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know, maybe I got too much work to do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I don't want to do it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause the moment I
commit it to a schedule is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when it's work. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - If I say I have to stream
it this day, it's work. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And then that's where I
won't start having fun. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, I mean, like, I guess for you, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like good because
you have that one game </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you can stream, which
you also just play casually. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I think when you- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Chess, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> It is right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> But like I'm, you know,
I'm like, so I mean. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Probably by the time this out, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you would have found out the
winner of the Tournament Arc 2 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which we are currently a part of. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, 'cause we are
recording these in advance </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause me and Garnt
have had to go to the UK </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> as we've mentioned. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> So yeah, we're quite far ahead right now, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but yeah, we're in the
middle of a chess tournament. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, been playing a lot of chess recently </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and really enjoying. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But yeah, no, I mean, it is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think when you are streaming, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it is very helpful to
have at least one game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you can come back to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when you're like running out of ideas. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think that's what I'm currently trying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to find right now is that
one game where I'm just like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - The problem is my one game
that I've just played a lot is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> just, like, not very popular </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and whenever I play it- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Shadowverse? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, whenever I play
it, everyone's just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh, he's obviously doing this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "'cause it's a sponsored stream." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm just like, "No,
I just enjoy the game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "No one fucking plays this
game, but I'll play it." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I did notice that when
I started playing Apex, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause Apex is probably the
game I've streamed most, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that my viewership was quite
much considerably lower </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> than normal, but I was
like, "Well, no, fuck it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "I like this game. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "I'm gonna keep playing it." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then after time it actually
like went up to the point </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> where if I stream new games now, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's normally lower than Apex. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause I've built up like the following. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> You have to stick through it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel like you also
got very lucky as well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause Apex did just have
a massive boom in general </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because of like every V-Tuber
under the sun playing it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Apex Raid of Shadows. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, Apex Raid of Shadows. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I don't know why that
was not even intentional. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was just playing it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and then I started seeing
every V-Tuber playing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, whoa, what the fuck? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - See, that's not gonna
happen with my comfort game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause my comfort game
is about 30 years old. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What's your comfort game? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like, any Final Fantasy game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So, I'm just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can't like fucking
stream Final Fantasy VI, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> even though that's one of my
favorite games of all time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because no one's gonna fucking watch it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And it sucks, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, would you even want
to stream your comfort games? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, yeah, because
I think like, again, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like Apex with
Connor where it's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just a comfort game, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, you don't necessarily
have to see it as work </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or like you don't have to
necessarily be like entertaining </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and wacky and goofy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and, you know, trying to hold an audience. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, you can just play a game casually </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> as you would normally do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and people would just be there
to watch you play it, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's different. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's very different to my
normal streams as well, I'd say. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Depends on what I'm doing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - You're a lot more quiet
during your Apex streams. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, definitely. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I'm focusing on the game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So, it's like I talk in
between stuff happening. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - So, it depends on what's going on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But that's why like I like
talking to Japanese people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> on there 'cause it's fun. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I'm trying to find more
things that I want to watch. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's like, I feel like I'm more like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I like doing passive things
rather than active things </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> a lot of times in my downtime. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, the other day, like a few days ago, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I ended up watching all of
"Loki," the new Marvel series. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's actually really fucking good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, I'm not that invested
in the Marvel franchise, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so I was just like, oh, I'll
just put on one episode, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just see what it's about, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I just ended up
binging the entire thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was just like,
this is fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was only six episodes, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but every episode is 40 minutes long. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, I basically just binged
an entire season of anime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's how I think of things. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But it wasn't anime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But it wasn't anime, and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> damn, why can't I do
this with anime anymore? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Fuck, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I missed that so much. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - So busy now where I like
dread good stuff coming out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I'm like, fuck, I gotta
find time to watch this now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - See, if only you could
like watch "Loki" on Twitch. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just use that as your downtime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Just have people watching you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Honestly, I would love
to have watch parties </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> with like different things I'm watching, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but obviously DMCA shit- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Obvious reasons. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Obvious reasons, can't do that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But like, 'cause like I know Sydney, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> her downtime thing is that
she watches horror movies, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and I don't know how she finds
so many fucking horror movies </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> to watch. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I didn't know this many
horror movies existed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> She watches at least three
new horror movies every week. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> At least. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The cesspool of horror
movies is like never ending. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's actually insane. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause I was never, I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was never big into horror movies. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't really like horror movies. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I assume you guys
aren't big fans either </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause none of it showed
up on our three by threes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Not a single one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's some good ones, but it's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's not my favorite
genre that's for sure. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - But she somehow finds so many- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - "The Shining." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Huh? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - "The Shining" is really good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - "Shining" is good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I like "The Shining." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's only a few horror
movies that I really like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Shining" is one of them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've really, 'cause like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> my taste in horror movies
is really niche I think. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I like kind of Lovecraftian horror. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I don't like the usual,
like, you know, jump scares, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ghost, paranormal stuff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, that's the problem. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> So much of horror is jump scares. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It is cheap and reliable. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think that's why I'm
such a big fan of, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Junji Ito and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause it's really like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the horror that I like
is really just the ones </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that really unsettle me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Macabre horror. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm exactly like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, the kind of like Asian
horror is like definitely </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> more my taste in horror. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause again, it's like,
you see like, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> you watch one "Paranormal Activity," </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you've basically seen them all. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - How the fuck did "Paranormal
Activity" get so big? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's because Steven
Spielberg greenlit it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is that true? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - So I actually read up on it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause I had the exact same thought. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, I saw fucking the trailer </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> of a "Paranormal Activity 73." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, how? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Why are there so many? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - But I remember when it came out, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I was in school and everyone was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "This is the scariest movie ever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "So scary." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I know, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And everyone was like
shitting their pants over it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember 'cause I was
in university at the time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And so I was like, all right, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I'll see what the hype's about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because back then my
roommates had a watch party </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then we watched "Paranormal
Activity," the first one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And everyone was like jumping </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> at just like the fucking closet opening. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I can literally see the
fucking string being used </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> to open this fucking door. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> How is this scary? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What is going on? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - One remote press. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I watched one that I thought wasn't bad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> What was it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> "The Invisible Man." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It wasn't that bad actually. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Is that what it's called? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh "The Invisible Man." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> The one about the- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Invisible man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Sydney showed me that one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It was all right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I quite liked that one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I watched it in the cinemas. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Pretty good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I enjoyed that one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I watched the other day, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I finally watched, what is it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Hereditary." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - How was that one? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause I missed out on
it when it first came out, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> so I kinda missed the initial hype on it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because I was like, eh, western horror, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's whatever for me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But then I think Felix
showed me "Midsommar," </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> which is done by the same guy, Ari Aster. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like, okay, this is very creepy, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but also kind of cool and experimental. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> So I was like, all right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I heard "Hereditary" was pretty good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I watched it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I almost wouldn't even
call it a horror film. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> You know what it feels like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It feels like if David Lynch
made a horror film, you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Where it's like, it's scary- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - As we established in the
previous three by three, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Joey, the big art snob. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> David Lynch. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like you just, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> to make a good horror movie,
you have to be fucked up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just be completely fucked up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - To make any horror content, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel you need to be
fucked up in some aspect. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Actually me and Sydney watched, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we had a night the other day </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that we just kind of like
binged part of, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the "Final Destination" series. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And the reason for that was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I kind of
remembered my very first- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - As a teenager, I loved those films. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember the very first time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I watched "Final Destination," </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it was actually in school. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I think it was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think it was like
middle school at the time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, I was like, I think
around 12, 13 years old. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And I don't know if the
same thing for Australia, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but you know, like, at the
end of term in school, right, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's kind of like a free for all. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And the teachers, it's
kind of like that period </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where it's like the last
two classes of the year </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or something, teachers just let you do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> whatever the fuck you want. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Was that true in Australia? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I definitely think, it
depends on the school, but yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think most schools, it
was kind of just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> "I'm going on break in
fucking three days, whatever." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, so it was just like,
in the school that I was in, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you just had a week period </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> where you just basically go to class </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and every teacher would put
on a different film or like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just roll in the TV, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just roll in the TV. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And everyone would watch a different film </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and like fucking 90% of
the time it was "Shrek." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It was fucking, it was
just always "Shrek." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was about to say, we
watched "Shrek" like every year. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, good, good to know that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that was just a nationwide thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's that time of year again. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - End of year, all right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I guess it's "Shrek" again. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I remember this one class, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one of my classmates brought in a DVD. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because we were just, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because the teacher would ask, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what does everyone want to watch? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And so this guy, Samuel, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he brings out the DVD and he
brings out "Final Destination." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And he was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "This is a film I think
the entire class would want </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "to watch." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And everyone's like, "Yeah, sure!" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How old were you? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think we were like 12 at the time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That is scarring for a 12 year old. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I had not heard of "Final
Destination" at the time, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but we were like, "Yeah, sure." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, 'cause, like, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anything to get us away
from "Shrek" or whatever </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or whatever the usual
films we were watching. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> He was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Miss, I think the classroom
would want to watch this." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And nobody kind of like opposed it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And the teacher had never
heard of the film before. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, she was like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's dangerous. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] So she was like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - This boy just had this DVD on him. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think he knew what he's doing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And so the film starts
off in "Final Destination" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and characters are, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like, I don't know what the
rating was like back then, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but characters were already swearing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But I think in PG films in like the UK, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> even if you have like
one or two swear words, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it can still be skewered
towards like the lower ratings </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if it's just like one or two swear words. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think so, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, so like characters, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so I remember the opening
scene where the, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> get on the plane and people
start arguing or whatever, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's kind of sus because
you can hear people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> obviously swearing and
the teacher's just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Samuel, is this suitable
for this age range?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He's like, "Yeah, Miss, don't worry. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "It's just the opening scene. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Don't worry, Miss. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Don't worry about it." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And she's like, "Okay, okay." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, I remember the opening
scene is where, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think it's where the plane crashes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's the first "Final Destination." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember (laughs) so, a
bunch of 12 year olds are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just watching this plane take off, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then obviously the
plane starts to crash, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the wing snaps, and
everyone's fucking screaming. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It's terrifying in the scene. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then you see like blood splatter, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then you see someone
getting burned alive </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and (laughs) immediately, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the teacher gets up
aggressively gets off to the TV. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Doesn't even switch it
off, unplugs the TV. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And goes, "Samuel, get outside now!" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And that was my very first experience </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of "Final Destination." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Absolute Chad Samuel. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> He was like, he probably walked
out was like, "Worth it!" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I remember one of them put,
like, it was in art class, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I remember this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And like the teacher was
not tech savvy at all. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And he put Meatspin on all the PCs, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then took it, just
unplugged all the mouse </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and keyboards. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And the teacher's having
a mental breakdown, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> didn't understand why
he couldn't just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he was like fucking
hammering the keyboard. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, why wasn't it turning off? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> And then started hitting the monitor, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and turned the monitor off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't even think he
knew how to turn it off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> And then he didn't know
how to turn it off. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He didn't even think of
unplugging it or anything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So, this was still playing the whole time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then goes and gets
another teacher to come. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And he's like, "Why
don't you turn it off?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He's like, "Oh, I didn't know how." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He presses the button to turn it off. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Classic Meatspin. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Meatspin, and it was like
these poor girls as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'd never seen it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Don't look it up if you
don't know what that is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause obviously we're all like 12. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Every guy had seen it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We're all like, "Yeah, you seen Meatspin?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If you're a guy and fucking idiot. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, it was like
Meatspin, Lemon Party. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Lemon Party, Goatsey. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - You didn't know what Goatsey was. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I didn't know what Goatsey was. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> That was obviously like a few years past. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Garnt, what was it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You came in the office like, what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like a month ago? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And was like, "I just
found out what Goatsey is." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And we were like, "Oh, how
did you find that out?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> How did you find out? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - How do you find out
about Goatsey in 2021? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - You guys were the ones
who told me about it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Were we? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it was like literally
recording a "Trash Taste." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And you were just telling- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why was I talking about Goatsey? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - In an episode? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, this wasn't in an episode. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was like before we started recording. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You didn't know what it was? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, I didn't. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And we were like you don't
know what Meatspin was, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you don't know what Goatsey was? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I had to explain to
Garnt what Goatsey was. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Please don't look it up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> It's some man spreading his butt cheeks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's 2021. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> You don't need to know what
Meatspin is or Goatsey. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's all just like websites </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of people doing horrible things. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Pretty sure we can find way worse stuff </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on the internet now anyways. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah, of course you do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But back when we were growing up, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> this was just like the shit
you like show your mates like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - "Hey, there's this really cool thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> "if you Google Meatspin. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Two girls one cup." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Two girls one cup is still
scarring to this day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I remember watching that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, going back to horror movies. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, I would like to find... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> A horror movie I really liked, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> has anyone seen "Annihilation?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The one with Natalie Portman in it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've heard of it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That sounds so familiar. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What happens in this? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Give us the plot breakdown. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So the plot breakdown is
that there's an alien artifact </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or some artifact from
space that crash lands </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> somewhere in the world, obviously, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it creates this kind
of force field barrier. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And you can easily enter the barrier, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but you can't get any
like electrical signals </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or any like communications. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Who else does this feature? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - This features Natalie Portman. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Is it Hawkeye? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, you're thinking of "Arrival." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - That was the one, fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Which I really like "Arrival." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I heard that was good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That was good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> That's not a horror movie though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I thought it was. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's just a sci-fi. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I just want more sci-fi stuff, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> which I think is why I
was really into "Loki." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And so, (coughs) and so they
can't get any (coughs) sorry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They can't get any signals in there, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so they don't know
what's going on in there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And every team that they've sent in there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> just never finds their way out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So they literally don't know
what's going on in there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And this force field is
slowly, slowly expanding, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so eventually it will
cover the whole Earth. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, they need to kind of stop it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> They need to kind of figure it out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And so they send this team of scientists </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to go investigate what's inside there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I kind of won't spoil it from there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because a lot of- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Sounds good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - A lot of weird things happen, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's not, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so what I liked about
it is it was just, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really, it's really terrifying, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but not because of any jump scares. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just some of the ideas
within this, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> some of the ideas of what
happens to the people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> within this circle are
just like really unsettling </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and really terrifying. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It is very much like a kind
of like Junji Ito ideas </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where it's just really weird
kind of ideas that you don't, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you kind of have to have, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know what kind of
minds you need to come up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with these things, but it's that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I would like more horror like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I dunno where to start
with recommendations, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which is why, if anyone
knows any, then I'm all open. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - What was that film with Nicholas Cage? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And there's like numbers and there's a kid </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who like has the number- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - "Knowing." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Knowing?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's the one.
- I don't know how I remember. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's the one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Have you seen that movie? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I've seen that movie. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - What is it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can't remember. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I remember it being really stupid. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Nicholas Cage, like, he like
stops like a plane crashing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, I think, 'cause
I watched this as a kid. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember he, I think it's like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - This needs to be a series </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> where we just try to
poorly recollect movies. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, what's this movie I watched? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That movie where like this thing happened? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, okay, I'm gonna
try and recreate this movie </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> from what I remember. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - How do you remember this perfectly? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because, okay, so as
a kid in the summer, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is going on another tangent now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, my summers consisted
of me going to Thailand </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and me spending like
six weeks in Thailand. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And obviously I wouldn't have
something to do every day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, like part of my
childhood experience is going </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> to the mall and just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in basically every
Southeast Asian country, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there'll be these stands </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where you have these like
DVD covers and you just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you just like flip through the covers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and just choose which
movies you'd want to see. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> And some of them weren't
out on DVD yet officially. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So you just flip through
them and you just want, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I want that one, I want
that one, I want that one, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I want that one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then they'd ask you
to go walk in the mall </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for like a good half an hour to an hour. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then they'll call you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And tell you when your purchase is ready. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Which was 100% totally legal of course. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We all know that Southeast Asia has </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> very strict copyright enforcement. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yes, yes, yes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, like, my summer would
just be basically watching </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> every blockbuster Hollywood
movie that came out that year </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because that, I looked forward to it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> because I could literally pick every film- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - To this day, "Knowing"
is still the best. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And to this day, I
still remember "Knowing." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's honestly why "5O
First Dates" almost went </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on my three by three because
I'd watched that so many times. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I thought you were gonna
say because of "Knowing" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, what does
this have to do with it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's only one movie
that tops "Knowing." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> "50 First Dates." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, so like I've watched
so many of these films, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> which are now what I classify
as like airplane films. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause now I would not watch
them in any other circumstances </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> unless I was on an airplane. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But "Knowing" was one of the films </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I was stuck inside
indoors in Thailand, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> had nothing to do but just watch films. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And from what I remember, it was the, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think it had to do
with like a time capsule </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that was buried ages ago. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, right! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, that was it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And there was like a number,
like, a cipher or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, there was some kind of cipher </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> or something that like that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like, predicted the
apocalypse or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Immediately sounds dumb. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - And Nicholas Cage was just
like, "I see the future. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "I see what's going to happen." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - "The numbers!" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And stuff, Nicholas Cage things happen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then the world literally ends. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause I think it's a solar
flare that kills everyone. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Spoilers if you ever
wanted to watch "Knowing." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I wanted to watch "Knowing." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - If you ever wanted to
watch the masterpiece </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that is Nicholas Cage's "Knowing." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> How did we get on this topic? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just talking about movies. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Talking about horror movies. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That was a horror. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is that a horror movie? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think it is horror. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Supposed to be horror. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - As in it's horrible. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm looking it up right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Hey! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm looking it up right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Knowing" Nicholas Cage. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Can we take a break? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I need to pee. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm very hot right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I find out it is
a science fiction film, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> not a horror film. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But it was- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was pretty horror. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It felt like horror. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Whatever happened to Nicholas Cage? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know, he's just busy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Kind of went off the rails, didn't he? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - A little bit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't feel educated
enough to talk about him. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Connor laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't really keep up
with Nicholas Cage's life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, how many Nicholas
Cage films have you seen? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - A fair amount. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Too many. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Really? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Probably more than I care to admit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I probably watched one and I was like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - One? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You didn't watch "Con Air?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, "Con Air," I was
about to say "Con Air." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've heard of that one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Fucking classic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think I watched, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what was the one where he was in Vegas? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I watched that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - The film with Las Vegas in the title. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Did that have Nicholas Cage in it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah,
that was Nicholas Cage. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, had no idea. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I watched "Fear and
Loathing in Las Vegas," </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and I was like, all right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Wait, is that a remake? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Is it a remake? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like it is.
- I think it is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I watched that and I
saw his like, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> the scene where he like
fucking loses it in the casino? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That one! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I was like, all right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just got like, at
that moment I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I understand Nicholas Cage now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And then everything else I've
seen from Nicholas Cage has </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> just been like YouTube clips
from other movies that he's in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Honestly, that's all you need </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> to like experience Nicholas Cage. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like that is the best way </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> to experience Nicholas Cage
is out of context movie clips. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think one of my favorite
YouTube Nicholas Cage clips is, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's a lot by the way. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There's a lot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> But one of my favorites
is just someone edited him </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like during like a driving
scene or something, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just him like getting into a car, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and just, it out of context, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it looks like he's just play driving. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, it's so hard to describe, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it's, you gotta watch it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And another thing is just Nicholas Cage </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> slowly losing his mind as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Have you seen that one? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Where it's just like him slowly
getting more and more crazy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as the clip goes to the
soundtrack of Requiem of Dreams. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's absolutely fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't think I've seen this one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I got to show you afterwards. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Navi] "Fear and
Loathing" is not a remake. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, it's not a remake? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Navi] It's a screenplay
adaptation of a novel, I think. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, okay, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's not a remake. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - But yeah, what happened
to Nicholas Cage? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We could use more Nicholas
Cage films honestly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't remember how we got
onto the topic of Nicholas Cage. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh no, I lied. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've seen that other
film with Nicholas Cage. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The, not the bees one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> What the fuck was that called again? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> What the fuck is the name of that movie? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I have not seen the bees one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've not seen that movie, but I've seen- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've seen the clips. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Wicker Man." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I saw that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I watched "Wicker Man" just
because that, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the fucking "not the bees!" one was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was a meme for the longest time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> So I'm like, well, I mean. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was a funny meme, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but I kind of want to see
this scene in context. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I just got really curious. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, I want to see- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do you need to see the scene in context? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So, I watched it in context. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, did you? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, makes just as much
sense out of context honestly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> It was the first time where I watched it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then I instantly recognized the meme. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, oh, this is the scene. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Finally, I'll be able to
understand why they pour the bees </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the basket. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I watched it, I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> nope, I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Did I like pass out for like
five minutes or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It just suddenly went to the scene. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, wait, I don't understand why, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> this is kind of unnecessary. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - What's that film even about? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't even remember. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> The only scene I remember
is the bee scene. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think everybody who watched "Wicker Man" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> only remembers that scene. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - The bees scene. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The bees scene. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is there any other scene in the movie? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Nothing that's notable, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Nothing that's worth putting to memory. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - My God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, like on the topic of horror films, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one thing that always like
fascinated me as a kid </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I don't think is
around anymore is, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like part of the, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the blockbuster or rental DVD experience </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> for me was going to the
rental, like the Blockbuster </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and just seeing like the
fucking horrific DVD covers </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of like every horror movie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know why. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, those fascinated me as a kid. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Were they bad? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Or like, what do you mean horrific? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, scary? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, they were like
really fucking terrifying. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was like, 'cause the
Blockbuster near my house, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well, that's not there anymore obviously. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It was separated into
aisles for different genres. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> All of the action blockbusters
were in one aisle, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all the romance were in one aisle. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then right on like the
far left of the Blockbuster </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there was the aisle for
all the horror films. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was so scared to walk down that aisle. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Just because, like, just in my periphery, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you just see this like
terrifying looking movies. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's, like, usually it's
got like a really scary face </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's like looking right in front. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You were scared of seeing the horror? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Honestly, I'm like, I'm
kind of a pussy honestly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> When it comes to films,
I'm kind of a pussy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm a proud pussy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I will happily admit that, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Sydney tries to get me
to watch horror film. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, no, Sydney, I am too scared. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think 'cause I had an older
brother, two older brothers, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I think I just saw the
covers laying around a bunch. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause they were like, you know,
my oldest brother was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I actually don't know how many
years older he is than me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I can't keep track. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I can actually remember that- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like five or six. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can actually remember the time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where I realized I hated
horror films is because. like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I think I was like five or six years old. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was in the living room </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and my parents were watching "The Ring." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And like, obviously, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was kind of just hanging around </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> while they were just watching that movie. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But I remember I looked over
at the TV and it was the scene </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where comes out of the TV. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And that was the moment where
I was like, I hate this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I hate this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I hate anything that is like this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I hate any film that
is like blue gradient. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Blue gradient! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The VHS. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The true horror is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when you're like 14 watching
a film with your parents </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and a sex scene comes on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - #Relatable. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - And you're like, I
don't know what this is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I have no idea what's going on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Even a kiss scene for me was like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Really? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You're like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like, a way too dragged out kiss scene. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's not like a peck. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like a make-out scene. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It doesn't go to the sex scene. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just stopped. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> It's probably like a PG film or something. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's just a really long make-out scene. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just like, guys, we get it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Get a fucking room. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> All right, please. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> My parents are here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Stop it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause like I remember back way back </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> when the age of like teen comedy flicks </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with stuff like "American
Pie" and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know why- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - "American Pie" was
always on TV in the UK. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - On ITV2. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was always on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it was always on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was always on at like 10:00 to 11:00. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> For some reason they play
all the "American Pie" films </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> all the time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, everyone in the UK
has seen "American Pie." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was always uncut as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It was the closest thing we had like to- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They showed boobs and stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, whoa, whoa, it's 11:00 PM. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And of course your parents
would have to walk in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> during every fucking nude scene, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> every fucking make-out scene. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I remember my parents walked in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> when I was watching "American Pie 2," </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and of course there was like
the lesbian make-out scene. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And of course that was the scene </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that they had to walk through. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Have those movies aged well? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't think they've aged- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't think they've aged well at all. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I haven't seen
"American Pie" in a while. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think all those kinds of, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> teenage comedy films
have just not aged well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, "Scary Movie" has not aged well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - "Scary Movie" was never funny. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's less funny now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - One time I was watching
something and it was, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think there was drugs and sex in it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I was just playing my GameBoy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - While this was going on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They were like, oh, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember I was like 12 or something, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my parents were like, "Oh, don't worry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "He doesn't understand anything." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm like, I'm like, I think I do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm just pretending like
I'm not paying attention. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They were like, "I think it's fine. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "I don't think he gets it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "I don't think he understands
what's happening." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Meanwhile you're like, "Damn." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm like, "Whoa, this is weird." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Did your parents ever say anything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> during like those fucking awkward scenes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or was it just like the awkward silence. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was just silent. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> That would make it awkward. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I always used to like
get up and be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> "I gotta go to the bathroom." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Did you actually? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I did. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - If one of my parents didn't do it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, "All right, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "I'll be the one to go
to the bathroom then." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You know what film I remember
watching at like age 10 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with my parents? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I think this is why they played it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I was so young where they thought, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he's not gonna understand anything, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was "Brokeback Mountain." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Nice. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You'd like my parents. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't remember what happened in it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I was 10. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I do remember there
was gay things happening. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's just Jake Gyllenhaal
and Heath Ledger having </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a lot of sex. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I remember. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> But that's yeah, I was like, oh, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't understand what's happening. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But my parents were like, for
some reason they were like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Yeah, let's watch Brokeback
Mountain with our son." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's so unfortunate though </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because that's actually a
really fucking good movie. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, 'cause I went back and
watched it after I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I think 18 'cause I had
watched "The Dark Knight," </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I was like, "Whoa, this
Heath Ledger guy can act good." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then obviously 'cause I
found out about his death. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Well, I got to watch everything he's in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, "Wow, this is good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "I think I remember watching this." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But I couldn't remember when. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, oh. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The PTSD kicked in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like, flashback. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I remember now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But I remember I was
speaking to my friend, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and he was like, "Yeah, do
you ever just feel awkward </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> "when sex scenes come on when
you're with your friends." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, no, not at all. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - When you're with your
friends, it's different. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why would I feel awkward
with a sex scene with my mates? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just weird, isn't it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't think I've ever
watched a sex scene with my mates </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> now that I think about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is that like a thing
you have to check off? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You never watched a
film with your friends </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that has a sex scene in it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm trying to think. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think I've watched
like funny porno plots </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> with my friends. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, fake taxi with my friends. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've just watched porn with my friends. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think I have watched, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I've been like, "Let's watch
this funny porno," you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't think I've ever
gone through that, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's like my favorite pastime is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like watching cursed porn with my friends. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I had a friend as well who was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> he can watch normal movies
with straight sex in it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but he couldn't watch normal movies </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with gay sex scenes in it with his friends </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause he was like just
super uncomfortable. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's just a bit of macho insecurity. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - That sounds a bit insecure to me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was like, "I don't know, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "This all sounds like
you're a little insecure." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He's like, "No, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "I just don't like it." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, "Why don't you like it?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then he was like,
"I'm not homophobic." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, oh, I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - "I'm not homophobic, but..." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - What's wrong with a
little guy on guy action? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, frankly, as a man,
I enjoy watching other dudes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I think there's nothing manlier
than being able to sit there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and enjoy that, you know, come on, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What's wrong? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just blokes hanging out, isn't it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - He's like lads, lads? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like, yeah, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot of guys are like that
in the UK though, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's always one guy like that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel in every guy group. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like lads culture
is definitely like a thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in the UK, which is like kind of- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Same in Australia, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, do you guys have
lads culture in Australia? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do you have friends who
would be like that if you try- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah, absolutely. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> You know, like, 'cause I went
to a boys school as well, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so it was even more so where it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> just macho insecurity everywhere
where it's like, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you'd be out after school. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's kinda toxic. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, you'd be out after
school and there'd just be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like a girl from like
a nearby girls school. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "You should totally smash her, bro. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> "You should totally smash her." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm just like, I'm not- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know, I try not
to be confrontational </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> because they're your
friends, but I also try and, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm not gonna sit there and be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> "Dude, that's pretty, you
know, that's pretty not okay." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is pretty fucked. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've had arguments with
my friends about it as well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where I'll just be like, "Yeah,
that's kind of homophobic." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know if you realize
it is, but that is homophobic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Do you think because we spend
so much time on the internet </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that we've just had like more awareness </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about this kind of culture and stuff? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think so because, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot of my friends would never be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't think they would ever be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I hate gay people" or anything like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> But also you have to understand
where that comes from </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if there's something where you
can watch a normal sex scene, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but you can't watch a gay sex scene. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, why is that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, what's going on there? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, if you're a normal person surely </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who doesn't give a fuck, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> you'd have no problem to either, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Maybe you would find one
hotter than the other, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but surely you wouldn't have a problem. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know if this is too
much for "Trash Taste" viewers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, like, just because you're okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with watching a sex scene doesn't
mean you need to be, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> into it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, that's what I mean. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's what I'm saying. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's a difference
between being into it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and just watching it.
- That's what I was saying. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> That's what I was trying to be like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, yeah, you don't
have to actively dislike it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but like you don't have
to like turn it off </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> or like go into the other room. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, you can just sit there and be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all right, it's not for me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but I'm not gonna be disgusted by it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's part of the story. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, whatever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, that's what I was saying. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, you know, if
it's part of the plot, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's what it is, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, they're like, "Oh, I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "It's just kinda weird, isn't it?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, "Is it weird? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> "Explain how it's weird." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Don't watch "Brokeback
Mountain" if that's the case. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's literally what that movie's about. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was like, "That's the problem though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "You think it's weird." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like it's not like, it's
not weird that people fuck! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think the problem is that
it's just a lot of the times, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> especially like in lads culture, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people just have never
thought about this too deeply. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause that's- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - They have these, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah, I'm not saying
that someone is, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I totally agree. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Go ahead. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, no, 'cause like
this is what I feel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> every time I go back to my hometown </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I see some of, like, my
hometown friends who like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I very much grew up in like lads culture, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> hanging out with like lads, lads, lads. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And they still like fucking go to, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> every fucking summer go to Ibiza </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and try to smash as
many birds as possible. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's what it is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - That kind of like lads culture. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> as I've grown older, I'm just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> oh this is a kind of a toxic
mindset in a lot of ways. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know, it's very much... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause I think the problem is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that they don't really talk about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They don't really talk
about their feelings </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or like really think
about things too deeply </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> because that's not a lads thing to do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's considered weak. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, that's considered weak. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> You're not an alpha male </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> if you talk about your feelings and shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And also, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> they don't really have
conversations like this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, they don't. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - So normally when it's been
something I've spoken about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> with people it's, like,
especially in like where I'm from, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's not the first person
who's ever been like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> "Now why do you feel that way about this?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Now why is it that it
makes you uncomfortable?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So, what do you mean by that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I've had like
confrontations about it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause it's, like, they
get very defensive about it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause they feel like, "Oh, shit, wait. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Is he trying to say that I'm in the wrong </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "for feeling this way?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's like, well,
no, I'm not trying to. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But it's, like, why are
you feeling that way? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Maybe just think about it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just want to have a discussion about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Maybe look at what's going on there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's funny because, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> some of the most kind of
insecure people I've ever met are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like, some of the like
biggest lads I've ever seen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, the proper like gym bros who... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Sometimes it's insecurity. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Sometimes it's toxic masculinity. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Sometimes it's homophobia. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> It's, like, whatever it is, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like get to the core of it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's what's bothering you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You can't watch "Brokeback Mountain" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> without being disgusted. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's a great movie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - All I'm saying is if you're
a guy don't be afraid to talk </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about your feelings with other guys. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like I didn't have
that when I was growing up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I thought that
it was the mentality </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where if I did this with my
bros, that I was the weak one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, that's not what
bros do to each other. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, you know, I
wouldn't say we're like SJW </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> or anything like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just, I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just don't want to discriminate. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Why should you, you know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Just my personal opinion. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm sure that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm no doubt there's some
viewers of "Trash Taste" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> being like, "I can't
believe they've spoken </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "about this issue," and stuff, but I mean- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's a sensitive topic. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Stuff that I would talk about, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, there's some
things that are sensitive </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and there's some things where I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no, that's just straight up wrong. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Of course, of course, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I mean, there's some
things where I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think we should talk about this, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I think it's, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think it's not toxic at all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to at least start a conversation </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I think a lot of the times, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot of people just haven't really, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> never really put any thought into it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - A lot of time they don't. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, they grew up in a culture, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they grew up in a lifestyle, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and that has just never
put them in a position </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that challenges the way they think. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - And if someone does feel
uncomfortable with us talking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> about this topic or hearing that idea </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that makes you uncomfortable, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I would say just like,
don't get angry about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Don't react to it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just think like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just turn off "Trash Taste," go watch </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Brokeback Mountain" maybe.
- No, no, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Just think, why does it, like,
why does it get you angry? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, what about it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If that's like a whole religious thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> All right, fine. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> That's your problem with that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, 'cause, like, I just
feel like it's better now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for at least people who are,
like, I guess on the internet </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and especially on social media </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause people are talking
about this more often, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which is good, but I still like, there, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you forget sometimes that we are not, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't even know if we're
the majority, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because every time I go home- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Most people don't talk about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's hard to tell. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like so ingrained in, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> obviously our jobs are
surrounded with the internet, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and surrounded with
people who think like me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that it's weird whenever you go to like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> go back home, see family,
see friends from back home, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And you're just like, wow,
everyone thinks exactly the same. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Everyone has not changed much at all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because they just there's
no one in the community </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or in this group of friends </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that are exposed to the
same thing as we are. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, totally. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause obviously on my
channel I'm very pro LGBTQ, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but like obviously going back home, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's not a thing that's spoken about much. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It is kind of. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It depends who you ask really. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think now more than
before, definitely, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with how the world's just changing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - My parents are pretty good with it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I always try to educate
them as well when I can. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Try and tell them about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I would like to think most of the time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it is just pure ignorance and- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, totally. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Especially in small towns. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know, obviously not everyone is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on the internet all the time
and everyone's in a big city, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're surrounded by it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so it's, you know, a lot of the time they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just don't come across it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They're just like, "Oh,
that guy's very funny on TV </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> "and he's gay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh, really?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's what it's like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's what parents are like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> They're like, "You know, he's gay?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's like a thing, you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> But I mean, you know, it's, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, it's everywhere now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It sucks that it's one of those things </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that it even has to be somewhat
controversial to talk about. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And we haven't really spoke
about it on "Trash Taste" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so I'm sure that some people
will be alienated by it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it sucks that even has to be something </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that alienates people. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just a fact. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> People are gay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Get over it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We just like "Brokeback Mountain," man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> What can I say? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's a great film! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's a fucking awesome movie. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Trash Taste Brokeback
Mountain watch along. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Heath Ledger, Jake
Gyllenhaal, fucking amazing job. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You sometimes forget Heath
Ledger's a fucking Australian </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> in that movie. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is he Australian? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, he's an Aussie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Did you think he's British? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> A lot of people think he's British. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I have no idea. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think everyone thinks he's American. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, do they? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I thought he was American </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because my first experience
with Heath Ledger was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "10 Things You Hate About Me." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wait, Heath Ledger is Australian? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Heath Ledger is Australian. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - What? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I didn't know that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Jake Gyllenhaal is American obviously. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I thought you meant Jake Gyllenhaal. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Jake Gyllenhaal is American. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Heath Ledger is, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the Joker is Australian. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Just great actor. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, I feel like a lot of, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> if you're in Hollywood, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think we've talked
about this, haven't we? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> How they're good at, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they're good at doing the American accent. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But you watch like some
of like the worst attempts </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> of people attempting a British accent, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's comically bad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I love Keanu Reeves. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> His British accent. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, him in like "Dracula." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - So bad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - That was hilarious. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's a tie between that and fucking, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> at the end of "Django"
when Tarantino appears, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's like in Australian. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - "What's goin' on, mates? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "What's goin' on?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I died on the inside when I saw that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, this movie was almost perfect </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then Tarantino- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - "Bollock!" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm like, I'm glad
he blew up at the end. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Someone needed to get rid of that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm sitting here like what
do we title this episode? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - What have we even spoken about today? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - How did we even get onto this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh, the summer is hot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> The summer is hot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Summer block. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> "Trash Taste Summer Blockbuster." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Fuck no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Fuck no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I love how like during
the conversation earlier </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about whatever the fuck it was just, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was trying to listen
to what you were saying, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but just from the outside, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I could just hear like
a shit load of cicadas. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Cicadas? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Cicadas? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Cicada. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I say cicada. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Cicadas? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Isn't it cicadas? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Cicadas. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Am I the weird one? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I say cicada.
- It's cicada. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay, Google, how do
you pronounce cicada? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Sorry to anyone who, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fucking I probably just like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - We can't continue with the
podcast 'til we find this out? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What does it say? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Cicada king, rise up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Cicada. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It is cicada. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't even know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Meilyne] Cicada. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fuck off! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Hell yeah! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wait, what, what- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What site are you using? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Does that say American or UK? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What is it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Meilyne] Oh, America is cicada. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, I say cicada. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wait, are you kidding me? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm correct! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - British say cicada and
Americans say cicada? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Navi] This is American so. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] And the British say cicada. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Well, the thing
is that we don't have them </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> in the UK. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - My life is a lie. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> My life is a fucking lie. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know, cicada's been one of those, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh, I should say cicada now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Cicada is one of those words </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that I've only heard Americans say </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause we don't have it in the UK. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> No one says it in the UK. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - True, true. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've never heard any British person say- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It literally sounds like
something out of "Harry Potter." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> No, it's cicada. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Cicada. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Have you heard a
British person say cicada? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, I have never heard a
British person say cicada. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm saying cicada now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm getting it in my head now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - You have to rewire your brain now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I remember 'cause we literally, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we literally had a Netflix shoot </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where we had to talk about
like summer anime things. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I thought cicada or cicada was spelled </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> C-I-R-C-A-D-A. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He literally wrote circada. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Circada. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I did circada. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, I thought cicada had
an R in it this entire time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and apparently it doesn't. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's circada now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, but, yeah I mean... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've said this before, the Netflix shoot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But I remember when I
first moved to Japan, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I literally had gone
my entire life thinking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that every cicada sound
effect in every anime was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> just a stock sound effect. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause they all sound exactly the same. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You watch like one summer anime episode, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you're like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they're just using the
same fucking sound effect </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as the other anime. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I didn't realize
until I moved to Japan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that cicadas just all sound
exactly the fucking same. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I thought it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just a fucking audio
jungle stock sound effect. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know how they sound so similar. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's literally just been
hardwired into their brain </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to be like, sound like this
at this exact interval. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, to the point
where I was like sitting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at home one night or one day, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I literally thought I had the TV on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> playing a random anime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I didn't realize that
just the window was open. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I literally like went to my
living room to turn off the TV </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> because I was like, no
one's watching anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And lo and behold, it was just the window. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I couldn't tell the difference </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> between a TV stock sound
effect and the real life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Man, have you seen them flying? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - They're fucking massive. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - They're terrifying. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was outside the "Trash Taste" office </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was just walking,
listening to music, just jamming, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and one flew in my fucking face. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I fucking smacked it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I smacked it, and I felt really bad </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause it hit the woman in front of me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> On her back. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You literally just
tossed a cicada at her. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - And she turned around, and I was like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Fucking playing ping pong with a cicada. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I just hit it 'cause I panicked. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I fucking smacked it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, what's scarier is when
they land on your balcony. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> But you think they're dead. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They just don't move, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They just like kind of
bump and just flop down. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> You're like, oh, is he dead? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then you touch it
and it's like (yells) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, there was one outside my door, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so I opened the door and
it and I like (yells) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "What is that?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Scarier than any horror film. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause I just opened my door. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> You don't expect them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> There's nothing in my door. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You never expect a jump
scare at your door. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> That's fucked up! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm gonna use the last of
my life to troll this human. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was literally like under the door. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, I opened the door and it was just, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it got like, the door
rubbed it or something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you here like (crunches) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like (yells) what is that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I'd never seen one before either. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is my first time seeing one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I had never seen one before either. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, I had no idea what they look like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And these fucking shit heads are so big. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They're fucking massive. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just fucking yeeted
back in my apartment. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like (yells) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - They're terrifying. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - And also another thing I
didn't know is that, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I had always assumed, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like, I remember the first
time I came to Japan, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like these motherfuckers are loud. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, you need to wear, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you need like noise canceling headphones </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to like even survive outside. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You think it's like a swarm
of them, but it's just one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I walked past this tree
and I'm like, man, these, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> there are like a swarm of
cicadas just in this tree. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then it, like, it just
like suddenly just stops </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm like, what's going on? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then I realized </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's one motherfucker
making all this sound. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> One motherfucker makes so, it's so loud. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's actually like impressive </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how fucking loud the cicada is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because, like, I'm on my balcony </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and, like, I can hear what I
think is a swarm of cicadas </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on like the other side
of the city or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then I realize it's just one, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because it just like, it's
so weird, like having like a, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's so weird going outside </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and just hearing like a fucking noise. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, it sounds like an alarm. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then it just suddenly stops as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And then it just suddenly stops. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why do they make noise? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> What are they trying to,
to mate or something? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it's a mating call. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Fuck's sake. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Why are they so fucking loud? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Don't they like rub their
legs together to make that sound </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> or something? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like, a violin? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, like the world's shittiest violin. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, 'cause apparently
they can only mate </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> during like a very short
period of their life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - During the summer. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, during the summer. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So they're like fucking
horny as fuck, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They need to fuck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They're the lads of the insect world. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then they fuck once and they die. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then that's it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's just their entire life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> They live for that one
fuck, and then they die. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They make as much noise as
possible to get that one fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - "Sorry, I came to early," dies. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Imagine nutting and
then immediately dying. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Honestly- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The best way to go. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Sometimes I've nutted and
I wanted to die right after, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Honestly, I can think
of worse ways to die </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> than having like a nut so
amazing that you're like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> "All right, life is peach now." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Death initiate. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Some people die from cows. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - For fuck sake! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm bringing this back </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because after that I realized, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Garnt was like, "How do
people die from cows?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, "Garnt, they're like four tons. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'What do you mean, how
do people die from cows?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So many people in the
suburbs reminding Garnt. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - You can die from cows, Garnt! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You can die from anything </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's like four fucking tons, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> from any like heavy animal. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's why. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So don't make me look like an idiot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for saying a cow can kill you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> A cow can fucking kill you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just because a cow can
kill you doesn't mean that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know, probably if
you get killed by a cow, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're doing something stupid. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's just my opinion. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You'd have to try really
fucking hard to die from a cow. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Most ways people die are
from stupid ways, Garnt. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Believe it or not. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I remember I saw a statistic in Japan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where it's like more people in Japan die </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> from vending machines than
they do shark attacks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, that makes sense, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Wait, how? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - From shaking the vending machine </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it landing on you and dying. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, well that's just
idiots being idiots. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You deserve that if you're
shaking a vending machine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's what I mean. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's the same thing with a cow. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> You're not gonna be walking
through the fucking paddock </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then suddenly a cow's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Let me come and squish you!" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think they can bite you as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> They kick you as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Also, if you're strong enough
to push a vending machine </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on yourself, why are you
wasting all that talent? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, how do you get the
vending machine to fall on you? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It can't be easy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Do you jump on it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, how are people doing this? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You cannot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Have you tried moving a vending machine? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It is not easy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, you really have to be
committed to the stupid act. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You really are admitting like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> all right, I'm breaking a sweat today. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is how I'm gonna go. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Taking off the Yeezys for this one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's what I'm saying about
dying from cows, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Why fucking try, like, lying under a cow </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> or just like standing behind a cow. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Just go swim in shark
infested waters apparently! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know, I think you've
more chance of dying </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> via the cow honestly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Have you not seen enough LiveLink videos </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of people fucking with animals to realize? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Do you just casually sit
down and watch LiveLink. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I think I'd rather watch a horror film. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sometimes you're on Facebook or Twitter, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and one gets on there somehow and- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know, it just happens. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - On Twitter? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You just see like a, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like a monkey punching a man or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wait, what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - What accounts are you following? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Justin. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - True, he does retweet some of those. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - You just see shit, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then like, people like
fucking around with monkeys </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and then the monkey just beats them up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Honestly, like if I
see the LiveLink logo, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's like a, I should probably not- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - There is a worrying amount
of people who think that like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they can just like do whatever
they want near animals. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - But it's normally, like,
third world countries. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's, like, scary. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause they're like
fucking with like a monkey </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then the monkey just beats them up, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you're like, well,
I mean, fair enough. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, what did you expect? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Kinda had the right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Innocent, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're literally fucking
with the smartest animal. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, 'cause like I'm just very wary </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> whenever I see anything LiveLink </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> because I've seen enough
fucked up shit on the internet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - LiveLink is also a meme. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've seen people put
LiveLink on like the meme. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> So, now I'm like, I'm not
sure if it's a meme or not. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like playing a game of
like Reddit 50/50 or whatever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's the only time I've
seen enough LiveLink to know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> where I'm just like, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Nothing good comes out of LiveLink. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sometimes it comes on and you're like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this is intriguing enough </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> where I don't think I
can stop watching now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The premise, I'm hooked. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I quickly pull the plug. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You have more willpower than me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This ain't worth it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - When I see the premise </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> for the first one second of the video, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, "Damn, I can't turn it off now." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Is that wrong of me? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like that's bad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, I'm just wired to clickbait. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, monkey brain activates. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Your curiosity gets the best of you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Speaking about you
spelling cicada incorrectly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Circada. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I realized like the other day, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, shit, I can't spell shit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> without autocorrect anymore. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - My spelling is so bad
without autocorrect. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, that's pretty much me as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I realized now when it's not on, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just kind of like type shit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I know that it will fix it for me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's a bad habit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just type fast. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I mean, I got
something similar as well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where I'm like, I can't do
mental arithmetic anymore. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, I literally like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like, I'm just like, oh,
what's nine times eight? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm just like, let me
get out the calculator. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm so reliant on- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I can do it, but it'll
take me like 20 Seconds. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I can do it, but it
requires thinking and I don't, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm not all about that, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Nine times eight? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, that's easy though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was gonna say. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Think about it, Garnt. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wait... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> 72. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - There you go. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I had to think about it! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, done for graduating middle school. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Masters in engineering by the way. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - What was your method of getting that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause the nine times
tables is the easiest. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, that's what I would've done. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I would have the nine times nine is 81 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then just minus eight. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, that's way too complicated. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's an even easier way. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Anything times nine is super fucking easy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, I mean, I don't
really have a system. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just figuring it out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's whatever your brain
is wired to do fast, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, well, for me, if
it's nine times eight, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then it's, like, well eight. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So, it starts with a seven </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because whatever your timesing by nine is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> always one digit below. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And then the two digits sums up to nine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Seven plus two is nine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You know how every
time you would ever have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a new math teacher, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> they would always teach you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that weird way of solving
a plus and a minus? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They were like, "Right, so
we're gonna add 425 to 522." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then they're gonna do, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> "Right, so we're gonna add
the four to the five, easy." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, do we really
need to write this down? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Can we just like, can we just... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then there's always like
just the really obscure ways </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> to do it as well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where it's like there's
got to be an easier way. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like, "All right, so
when you bring the one over, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> "pull out your dictionary." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Or it would ne like dividing by. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And they would have
this weird ass timetable </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> or something to do it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, this feels so convoluted. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Why not just like figure
out some other method. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like, teacher when am
I ever gonna divide 973 by 67? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, I'm never going to. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm never gonna go and count down. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't need to know this shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Every single, like,
yeah, it is great that you, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> if you can do that with your mind, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but there's-
- Great party trick. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's absolutely no setting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where you are ever not
gonna be using a calculator. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> And even if you are, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they will not allow you to do that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because they won't trust you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You should be using a
calculator for good practice. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Even if you could divide insane numbers, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> people would be like, "No, that's not it." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's good for like estimates </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when you're talking engineering terms. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You're like, "Okay, well,
can we maybe try this much? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> "No, I don't think, just
off the top of my head, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "that doesn't seem right." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But in general, like, you
know, there's exams, you know- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just funny how
like mental arithmetic has </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> just become kind of like a party trick. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There's always like, you
always see that one guy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> every so often where you get like the bill </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and they can just like divide
exactly the right amount </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in their head before- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - But it's also like the
shittiest type of party trick </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because it's the party trick that you do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and nobody believes you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - People would check it anyway, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like, "Nah, let me
pull the calculator out." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh, it is right, wow, very good." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Five times five is 25. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Bullshit, let me check that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just work via round numbers now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> That is just my life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But yes, exactly the same as spelling now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> where I just, I could not
live without autocorrect. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like it's- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Do you have those words that you just, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know what they look
like, but you're like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I just can't be bothered to
learn how to spell it right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - How do you spell necessary? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was literally about to say that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That is the one where I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I honestly cannot remember,
is it two Cs, two Ss? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Two Ss, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm pretty sure it's- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The one for me that always fucks me up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> that I still never get
right is guaranteed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm like is the U in there? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Is there an A in this? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Is it gwaranteed or is garanteed? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is why, I don't care. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I haven't like... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, necessarily. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just like, I'm
pretty sure it's two Ss. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> No, it's not, is it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's two Ss. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know, maybe it is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, N-E-C-E-S-S-A-R-Y, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] Yeah, I'm pretty sure it is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Hold on, let me check. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Let me get out the autocorrect. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just type and then
click, yeah, it's that one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But the thing about
spelling is that it doesn't, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> at the end of the day- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Spelling is irrelevant. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - At the end of the day, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you can spell a word wrong </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and people will still get
like the meaning of the word </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> most of the time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Isn't there- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like phonetics. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I mean, haven't
you seen like the video </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where if you put the first letter right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and the last letter
right, and just mix it up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Everyone on the internet has seen that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Have you seen the ballerina </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that spins the other way too, Garnt? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Have you seen the dress
that's blue and gold? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I completely forgot about that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - The internet was on fire
for a week unnecessarily </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> over a fucking dress. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I remember meme culture. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember when that was the
hot thing back in the day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I knew that dress meme went
too far when people were like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "All right, so I went into Photoshop </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "and I got the color draw, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "and I can confirm the hex digits </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "that it is in fact blue and gold." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wasn't there that like audio kind of- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yanny and Laurel. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, that one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just saw that, I was like, who cares? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I felt like after
the whole dress debacle, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it felt like everyone was
looking for the next thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to interpret differently. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And I just didn't give a fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - That was a nice meme
that lasted three days. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I remember like the
only, what would they call it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The audio... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Audio illusion. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Audio illusion! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Actually, it's not
really an audio illusion. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just, did you ever, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> did you guys ever do
like the frequency test </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where you have to like
test your frequency? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And, like, I remember I was, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember my frequency was
like so fucking good as a kid. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I thought I'm never gonna lose this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, as a kid, did
you ever get that point </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where a grown up told you that
this is gonna happen to you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when you grow up, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and as a kid, you're just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's never gonna happen to me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> That's never gonna fucking happen to me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember the first time I felt old </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was the first time I did, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the second time I did a frequency test </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when I was like mid 20s, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm just like, this
isn't the same number </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as I remember as a kid! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The grown ups were right, I'm getting old! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Wait, so is the frequency test </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like the how much you can hear? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Is that the one? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, so like the better your hearing is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the higher the frequency. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Generally when you get around to 30, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it starts to get a lot worse. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, like, who the fuck needs to hear </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like the high kilohertz? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, I immediately felt that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like, 'cause you know, in
like some arcades in Japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they have mosquito tone
- Yeah, I have that too. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - that like stops like
animals from coming in. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And every time we
walk past like an arcade </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> with like a bunch of friends
and they'd be like, "Oh, fuck!" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll be like, "What?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I legitimately don't hear anything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's actually an advantage here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause Sydney can hear
it and I can't anymore. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Apparently it hurts. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just like, I don't- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Apparently like in a
lot of shops in Japan, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> they just play this like high, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't describe it actually. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Isn't to stop like teenagers? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Doesn't it stop teenagers
from like loitering. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Navi] To stop people
from loitering in front. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've also heard it's to
stop birds from flying. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Navi] And cats. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Can you hear it, Connor? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can hear it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay, what does it sound like? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was gonna describe what it was, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then I realize that- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I can't hear it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just realized I've never heard it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just an uncomfortable
ring in your ear. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - An uncomfortable ring in your ear? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It doesn't particularly feel good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It kind of hurts. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know, it just hurts. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - It looks like it hurts. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's what it's
designed to do, to hurt. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - But what I don't understand is is that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> if they've just put this
high frequency alarm or ring </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to stop birds? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Mosquitoes? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Animals and loitering. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know which
one it's actually for. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is it for humans or animals? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Apparently it's for both </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause humans can hear it as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Probably should have picked
a lower frequency then, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because it doesn't work, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if you've just got shit hearing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> then you're just immune to it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's meaning to stop
like kids loitering. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, that's the idea. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, okay, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've never been able to hear it though </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> even when I was a kid. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, but you've been
listening to like music for- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I've probably
been to too many concerts </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> where my years just got fucked. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're gonna be like
40 and be like, "What? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "What did you say to me, Garnt?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm still like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - True, you are. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Your hearing is really bad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, but I talked about it
on the podcast, remember? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause when we went to
go do the health checkup, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and I got an aid for my
hearing and then I realized, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh, I don't have bad
hearing, I just don't listen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're just fucking dumb. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just don't care about
what you say sometimes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I just shut it out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - True, true, true. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's what it is, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You boys have any fun
plans for the summer? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know what I miss? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This is like the first time in my life </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where I've just not lived
near a body of water. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're surrounded by water. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What do you mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - We're literally an island country. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, but, like, we're in Tokyo. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And I think the closest
thing is like Tokyo Bay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, part of the summer
experience for me is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just going to the beach somewhere </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and just like having a nice chill, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know, beer or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And haven't been able to do
that for the past two years. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I've really missed that experience. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, it doesn't really matter </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because like the beaches have
been closed from lockdown. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It doesn't matter anyway </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I can't go to the beaches anyway. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And like Okinawa is on
lockdown, so I can't go there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> So, I just, it doesn't feel like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've had the worst part
of the summer experience </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> which is just the fucking blistering heat. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And haven't been able to
just enjoy the nice parts. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Trapped in a concrete jungle. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, basically. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - So, what are you gonna do
for your summer then, Garnt? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What can I do for the summer? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is there anything fun
you can do in the summer </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that doesn't involve a beach
or a pool or any body of water? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Stay inside and play video games. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sounds pretty fucking good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's what you do in
winter though, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Both seasons. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> All seasons. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause another thing is
that we get mosquitoes here </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> in Japan and we don't- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do we? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, we do. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I haven't seen any. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Do you not get bitten? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Lucky. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - How do you not get bitten? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I get eaten alive. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Maybe my blood doesn't taste good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've never had a mosquito bite. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Apparently it does
depend on your blood type. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, I think it does
because I get bitten to shit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> whenever a mosquito's around. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - They don't go for me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can be in an area where
someone will get bit a ton, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I won't have any on me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I literally- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - God, I wish that was me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I literally laid outside on my balcony </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for like half an hour, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> came inside and I had
like 10 bites on my back. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm not even joking. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm exactly the same. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't get bit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I've never even. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't even know they had them here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah 'cause normally- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't get bitten. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Are you serious? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Serious. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I thought they didn't have them
here' cause I don't get bit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's another reason
I love British summers is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that we just don't have any
bugs that are annoying because- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You guys don't have mosquitoes? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you not remember when
we were just chilling out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in England in my garden? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just thought I got lucky. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I just thought like, oh, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> there's a stronger blood type
somewhere in the vicinity </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that they're going for. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's no mosquitoes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, I'm just that guy, 'cause like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just that guy who like, I'm the bait. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - The meme of like the blades falling down </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and the guy covering. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's Garnt, everyone else at the party. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, 'cause like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if people hang out with me in
Thailand or Japan or whatever, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they get bitten less because I'm there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm the bait. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I am what every mosquito goes
for, and I don't know why. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Garnt the martyr. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because in Thailand we have this saying </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where normally it's the mosquitoes
go for the foreign people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> because it's the foreign
people who have the sweet blood </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because the mosquitoes
aren't used to their blood. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So that was a lie. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So that was a fucking lie. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Well, technically I didn't
grow up in Thailand, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so maybe there's some kind of truth to it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> But apparently if you have
never been beaten, well- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Beaten by a mosquito. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - The mosquito's fucking,
what's going on, huh? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Come in our neighborhood. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I've never get bitten by mosquitoes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm so fucking jute. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is it like a blood type thing? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't even remember my- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Apparently it's like a blood type thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> It's also like a skin thing as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, certain skin. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, if you have like oily skin, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're more likely to get bitten. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There's lots of theories out there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think it's literally just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if you're unlucky, you're
unlucky kind of thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Beer? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Beer? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah, no, apparently
you're more likely to get stung </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> if you're drunk. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is that true? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, apparently. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Does that not make the mosquitoes drunk? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's probably why. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They're like, "Eh, my
guys time for a sesh." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Because they get drunk
off the blood, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Maybe. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I've still never been bitten drinking, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> so I don't know what's going on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Lads, lads, lads! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Is there a reason why the
mosquitoes go for people more </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> or less? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Navi] Yeah, there's
like seven reasons why. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know if any of
that has actually been, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> scientifically confirmed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel it's just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it might be like a
little like coincidence. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm just not tasty enough. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What the fuck? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Navi] Might be your blood type as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's probably blood type. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What if I'm not tasty? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I want to be tasty. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - What? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, you don't want to be tasty. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - You don't want to be tasty. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I want to be tasty, that's bullshit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Mosquitoes are fucking,
they're the worst. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> They're the fucking cunts
of the fucking insect world. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Nobody likes mosquitoes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> There could be like the biggest
animal lover in the world </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and they see a mosquito and,
like, fuck that little shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Isn't like the mosquito,
I think I read somewhere, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> isn't the mosquito like the only animal </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in like the food chain where
if you got rid of them, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it just wouldn't change the food chain? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know if that's an urban legend, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I hope it's true. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think it's something like
that 'cause I remember seeing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause like I think I looked
it up 'cause I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause in Australia we
have a shit ton of flies </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> during the summer. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, it's fucking horrible. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Especially if you're
like out in the desert, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> nothing but flies. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's disgusting. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I think, I just thought
to myself, like, man, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I really just wish all
flies just disappeared. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And then one of my
friends was like, oh no, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like flies are like really
important to the food chain. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, there's a lot of
animals that eat flies. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And thought like, is there
an animal where if we just, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it just disappeared one day, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> would the food chain still be intact? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I think mosquitoes was one of them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Humans probably. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah, that too. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think they'd be grateful actually. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just called myself out there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - We like to think of that- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You got me, animals, you got me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We're the problem all along. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We were the virus all along, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ♪ Do, do, do, do ♪ </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But yeah, I mean, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I hope mosquitoes are fucking
useless things because- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, they just
fucking carry diseases. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, that's all they really do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - All they do is like give
malaria to people, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Amongst other things. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's probably one like
really obscure species of spider </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or something that could
only feed on mosquitoes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that would die out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That is integral to the food chain. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It's always like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, no, no, there's one animal </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that specifically eats this thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - How would you even eradicate mosquitoes? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> How would you even go about that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Don't ask the Aussie. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They've they've had like
enough problems trying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to eradicate a certain- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah, the cane toad? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> So we have a lot of sugarcane in Australia </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> during like the 1800s, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then cane flies were introduced, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which are these specific breed of flies </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that only eat sugarcane </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and which completely
wiped out our sugarcane. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And we're like, well, fuck. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We gotta get rid of these flies </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because our food is getting fuck up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then someone was
like, I've heard overseas, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there was a specific type
of toad called the cane toad </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> that specifically only eats cane flies. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Someone thought, oh that's brilliant. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's gonna solve all of our problems. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Let's introduce it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, they introduced it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, all the cane flies disappeared. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> But then somebody realized,
shit, nothing eats cane toads. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And they're literally poisonous, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and they're killing our native animals. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So, now we just have a cane toad outbreak. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - And you just can't get rid of it, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - And we just can't get rid of it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Dude, it's like me playing chess. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> They only thought one move ahead. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They didn't plan anything else. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, this feels like a vast oversight </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> in like possible downsides. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> No pros and cons lists. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Someone was like, bro, I
got one, bring it over. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Let's just test it out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It sounds like the beginning </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of like an "Always Sunny" skit, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, you're just like, oh,
let's bring over the cane toads. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And you just see like
the fucking intro title. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Gang introduces cane
toads to the food chain. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then again, Australia, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> hasn't had very much luck with animals. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, we had an emu war and we lost. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - What the fuck is that about? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, I hear every Australian say that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm just like, that just sounds like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - The great emu wars. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The dumbest shit ever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> They went to war against emus. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - And they lost? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - And we lost. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, do you want to explain that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Dude, have you seen an emu? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They're fucking terrifying. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Can they kill you? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's Australia! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Everything can kill you! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Should have known that one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Should have saw that one coming. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Were they eating crops? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> They were ruining crops, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, they were ruining crops. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And, again, like they kind of
just like overbred themselves </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to the point where there
was just a shit ton of emus </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and just not enough space. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, they started invading farmland. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Obviously farmers got pissed off about it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so they tried to get them out of it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> But obviously it's one man </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> versus a fucking two and a half meter bird </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that can literally just kick
you in the chest and kill you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, I think it went on for
like a month or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know how long it was. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It was a very short, it
was a very short war. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - They wasted so much money
on like ammunition and time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Ammunition? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - They were shooting them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Trying to gun them down. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> But they could like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - But the emus were
literally like the Spartans </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they were like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was like, we were like Xerxes army </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and the emus were the Spartans. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> They're like, oh, shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause they would like,
they were fighting them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But they would they
just kept getting away. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It was like a "Loony Tunes" skit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They couldn't kill them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was just like the Benny Hill theme </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for like a month straight. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They had to wait and ambush them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's how they- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Are you serious? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They travel in flocks. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They go together in flocks, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and they were trying to ambush them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - And they're also extremely fast. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> They can run like 60, 70 Ks an hour. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - The moment they started
opening fire on them, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they just ran away, and they
would only kill like, you know- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - A couple of them maybe. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But they'd wasted
like 100 grand in ammo. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, ammo isn't cheap. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like because we're so used to war, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you think that ammo is like affordable. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, ammo is super expensive. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, they were just wasting
hundreds of thousands of dollars </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> on bullets. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Especially when that war was happening, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it was probably even more expensive. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And then one day someone was
like, it's not worth it, is it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Just wave the white flag. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then they just retreated and- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's embarrassing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It was like a huge embarrassment. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - So what was the outcome of this war? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The emus won. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - The emus won and they're
just roaming the land now? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yep.
- Yep. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> They just failed miserably. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - What is going on in Australia? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm sure everyone who's
watched internet videos has heard </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> This is a very internet video topic. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It sounds like an Internet
Historian skit, you know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm surprised he hasn't
made a video on it yet </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to be honest. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's great material. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I mean, it sounds like
on the same level as like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, the 4chan Tumblr
wars or something like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> We need an Internet Historian breakdown. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It just doesn't sound
like it really happened. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It just feels like the laziest
strategy of killing them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> You know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - There were people who died as well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> during the great emu war. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I just feel like nobody
thought this plan through. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Surely there was a better
way of getting them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, that's what pisses me off the most. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was the laziest solution. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They're like, "Firing squad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And they were like, "Yeah, okay." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, nobody thought, "Is
this really the best idea?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because someone probably took one look </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> at the fucking shotgun they
had and they were like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "We got this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Easy dub." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - We need a fucking
Hollywood breakdown on this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Where's the Hollywood summer blockbuster </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of the Australian emu war? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Come on, come on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Come on, Hollywood, get it together. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There's a storyline there somewhere. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Man versus emu. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Zack Snyder, come on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This is the next Zack Snyder film. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like a 300 spinoff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like "Planet of the Apes" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from the perspective of the emus. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Planet of the Emus. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Emus together strong. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I would watch it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, it's about the emus winning. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Perspective of the emus. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> One of them voiced by Raymond
from "Everyone Loves Raymond." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Get back Nicholas Cage, come on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, Nicholas Cage is the main role. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And the supporting role is Raymond. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - And he goes insane as the emus win. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - There's a part where Raymond dies, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know, gets shot and then Nicholas- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Nicholas Cage loses his mind. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - He was freaking out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> "I can't go on," but he has to. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - And ends with a
climatic scene where they- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - What's the summer
experience in Australia? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause like Australia,
it's like winter there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Christmas. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like, I always here about
like summer is like winter </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in Australia. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But like what is winter for Australia? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Is it actually cold? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Or- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Do you like swap them? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Do you just refer to our summer as winter? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like July? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Is July winter? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - July is the coldest
time of year in Australia. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But is it winter? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Is July winter? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It depends where you are. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So in Sydney, it doesn't
get cold enough to snow. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> But if you drive for like
two hours into Cambra, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it snows like a motherfucker. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I have been always under the impression </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no matter the temperature that
winter is the time of year. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, winter is always
November to January. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Sorry, sorry, November to February. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That is winter. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Is it the same in Australia
where you would refer </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to that period as winter? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, that's summer. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - But everyone else around you is- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - The hottest day of any year
is always New Year's Eve. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I always thought that it was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> okay, no matter what country
you're in, this is winter. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, that's what I thought as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It doesn't matter if the temperature- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What are you talking about? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Winter is the coldest time of year. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> For us that's May to August. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just thought that winter as
a concept was a time period </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not the season. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, it's definitely a season for us. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because like, at least from my memory, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the hottest day of any
year is always the last day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of the year. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> So, our family always used to
go to that one mate's place </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who had that giant swimming
pool in his backyard </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because you're in that pool
'til about two in the morning </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause it's so fucking hot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember the hottest experience
I've ever had in my life, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was New Year's Eve,
and it was 45 degrees. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Obviously 45 degrees,
everyone's in the pool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Even after the sun went
down, it was like 41 degrees. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it was so hot that I
remember I went home like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that morning, it was like 5:00 AM, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and the fridge had just
exploded from the heat. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, the fridge just stopped working. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - The fridge is like,
all right guys, I'm out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Have a nice day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - The fridge is like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Happy new year, lads. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - My final message to the world. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - So, I remember when my
parents got super pissed off </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because they just like
literally first day of the year, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they went to the electronics
store and bought a new fridge </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because it just got busted from the heat. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - The fridge is one of
those appliances though </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I'd be excited to get a new one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'd be like, wow, we can really mix it up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with the fridge this time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, yeah, but like, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think it's good when
you can buy a fridge </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on your own accord. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I disagree. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I prefer it when my appliances break </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause then I'm like, oh,
I have to spend money. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, woe is me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I guess I have to get the
most expensive one, geez. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> But when you're upgrading,
you're like, oh, fuck. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I've got a perfectly good one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't really need... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - You start with a cockroach fridge </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> or washing machine or
whatever or whatever it is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because if it was a good appliance- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Your standard of an
upgrade is quite low. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We're going from cockroaches
to no cockroaches. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's all uphill from there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's some appliances where I'm like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it literally doesn't need anything fancy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, a microwave does
not need to be fancy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> A microwave just heats. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Heat thing up good, thank you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - It literally vibrates water molecules. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Literally how would you
do that differently? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because I'm using Joey's old one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause Joey just gave me his one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause he wanted to get an- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Microwave oven, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Microwave oven, which
I don't believe in. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I think that's nonsense. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I got the kettle from Joey. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> When did Joey give you the microwave? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Was it when you moved here? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why do you guys keep
taking my hand me downs? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause you were like,
"Do you want a microwave?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, "Sure." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause I remember when, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause this was literally
in the first week </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when we moved here and we
were just like settling in, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> whatever, and you were just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, do you want a kettle? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "You can have a free kettle." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They were making it out to be a gift. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Fuck off, this is not a gift. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> This is not a gift. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I remember thinking at the time, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh my God, such a good mate. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "He's just helping me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> "Like, he's just helping
me like decorate the house </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> "and give me appliances." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was using those oldest sibling skills. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause I remember Aki was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "Do you want to just take the microwave?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, "Why, why would I, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "why were you saying that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> "Why would I just take the microwave?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They're like, "Oh, like a gift." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like, "It's not a fucking gift." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll take it, but don't
preface that it's a gift. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because we were gonna buy an oven. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, you wanted to. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then we realized,
oh, it's not just an oven. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It's a microwave oven. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I remember that Aki
was like, "It's a gift." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It's not a gift, it's not a gift. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Now living in Japan, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I know getting rid of appliances
is a fucking nightmare. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's the worst. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's a fucking nightmare. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I'm just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that motherfucker just wanted
to get rid of his appliances </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that he wants to replace and
he framed it as a fucking gift. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Welcome to Japan, here's the
kettle I don't use anymore. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Here you go. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm such a good mate. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm literally giving you free stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're British, you like kettles, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I do, I do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Actually don't use my kettle anymore. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I use the hot pot thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like thermos pot, whatever it's called. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Thermo pot? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Where you just put like
two liters of water in a pot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it keeps it boiling the whole day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's more energy efficient. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Ooh, fancy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But yeah, in Japan, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> if you want to get rid of your appliances, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is something that you
should definitely be aware of, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because if it's over like,
if it's a big appliance, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so like I think a hairdryer
or bigger is considered </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> as a big appliance, you have to call- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So, literally all appliances. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Literally any appliance. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You have to call up the
local government in your area </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and tell them you want to get rid of it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and then you have to schedule it, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I actually just finished
doing that the other day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause we had to get rid
of our old dining table </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and our old like cabinet that
had all of our dishes in it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wait, why didn't your
old moving company do it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Why didn't you have a
moving company do it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - We just kind of forgot it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We just kind of forgot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause I originally wanted to, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I originally had the old
kitchen table that we have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on my balcony because I thought, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh, I could use this
if I'm like barbecuing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or doing something outside </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I need something to like place it on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But then I kind of didn't use
it, it got hit in the rain, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I forgot to put like a lacquer on it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> so it just started rotting. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, all right,
need to get rid of this now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And it was, oh my God- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Dining tables do that
if you put them outside. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> But it's cool though because in my area </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you can like register
it through like line. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, that's cool. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - But the sucky thing is had
to wait about, I don't know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> four weeks to throw it out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause they were like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, you have to schedule
it ahead of time." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, "Oh, okay." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Four weeks to throw things out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Maybe it's like next
week or like this weekend </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> or something, you know, whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, "So yeah, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> "the next open slot is 40 days from now." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - And you have to give them
the precise measurements </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> of the thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, it's obviously I understand why, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's one of those
things where it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is a hassle that I've never
had to do in the UK before. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it's like why
am I measuring something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I'm about to throw out? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It just doesn't make, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's a bit ass backwards. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I made sure the
moving company that I've hired </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> for my place, I'm like, "You
throw things away, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "You throw them away?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Good thing about like
things like fridges </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or like washing machines
and stuff like that is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that like there is usually service where, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when they bring the new
one, they take away the old. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's true, that's true. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like, we just got a
new washing machine and- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - They take away the old one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And they take away the old. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, oh thank God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's why, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> whoever sold you the
fucking cockroach fridge, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> they were just like, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They were like 500 IQ. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "We got him to pay for this shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> "We got him to pay for this." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I got scammed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> That was a scam. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Straight up scam. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - First time in Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I got a gift. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Welcome to Japan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What a warm greeting
to a foreign country. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> But yeah, I made sure
the movie company like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "You throw things away, right?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, "Great. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Everything needs to go. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Get rid of everything." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm literally throwing away
like nearly everything I own. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's time for an upgrade. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause I'm like, yeah, 'cause
my bed was like 200 bucks </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> for like the bed and the mattress. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's fucking terrible. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, I'm sure like, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> prisoners in isolation get
better beds than what I've got. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I was like, you know, get rid of it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They get a whole padded room. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's an absolute nightmare. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause yeah (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Get the whole sound proofing too. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause if you want to do it myself, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I have to disassemble the
bed and then like put it down </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> into the thing, schedule when
they're gonna come get it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and then kind of like schedule
getting a new bed myself </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in between the day I'm throwing it out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's a real nightmare. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That was a nightmare for us. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And that's why like when we
moved into our new place, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause we threw our old bed away, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when we were waiting for the new bed, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we had to sleep on like a
fucking blow up mattress </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for like a week. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh wow. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just because the timing was off. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But like yeah, because I'm
thinking of like getting rid </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> of my desk in my place. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, 'cause you're thinking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about getting the standing desk. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm just dreading
having to like schedule a, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I have to wait another month
to like throw this thing out, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then I have to take it
down myself and disassemble it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just like (groans) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's a pain in the ass. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It sucks. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Please make it better. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You can get a service, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's what I'm thinking. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just gonna like, I'm
just gonna pay the money. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Just get someone to just
come and get rid of it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - If you want to get
rid of your appliances, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's probably gonna take like
all day just to sort out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I mean, if you can make, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's probably what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> An hour to disassemble? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Then you gotta fuck around
with the calling the people, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> taking it down, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> figuring out when you
got to do all that stuff. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, it's probably what? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Three hours of work? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You can probably make more
than the money it would cost </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to do that if you just worked. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So it's like I would rather, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I also don't, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it's sometimes not even
the money it's, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't want to deal with the stress. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, this is a stressful thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I don't like dealing with. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And so I will pay a premium
to not have to do that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Not only that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but like I have to deal with
it in this weather as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, fuck that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Disassembling that dining
table in this heat was hell. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I like fixing my electronics
and like opening them up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and doing that stuff, 'cause I enjoy that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> but I don't enjoy disassembling
furniture and desks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't think anyone does. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I like assembling furniture. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't like disassembling furniture. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Some people are like
so good with that stuff </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and they enjoy it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They just like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - But like disassembling furniture is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the most depressing
thing in the world. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause like at least if
you're assembling furniture, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you have something to look forward to. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You get the final product. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> What are you looking forward to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> after disassembling the furniture? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Nothing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's why in the UK, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I used to just put it on like websites </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'd be like, "Who wants it for free?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - We used a service for that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> when we moved to get rid of our couch. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I'm like, "Who wants it?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We just like, there's a
website where you can just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just put it up for like zero yen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, "Come and get it." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And some dude came to get it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, as long as you take
it away, you deal with it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you can have it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> That's what I did in the
UK with all the stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, I had a budget gaming
chair that was just broken. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, "Oh, if someone
wants it, you gonna have it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "It's kinda jank. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "It still works, but it's not great." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then someone just came. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Some Russian guy turned up to my door. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "My son will love this chair." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, all right, cool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I just don't want
to do anything in this heat. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, if I'm not inside in
an air conditioned place, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then I just don't want to be there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, me and Sydney tried
to like schedule a date </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the other day where we just
go out and do something </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then we realized we just don't want </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to fucking do anything outside. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Let's just try and find something inside </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because it's literally
impossible to do anything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And especially now with
inside activities kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on lockdown, it's really hard
to find anything right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - True, true. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Amen to that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - You know who else hates the summer heat? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Our patrons. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Ooh. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Probably, I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Actually, if our patrons were here, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they would definitely hate summer. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They would hate summer. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> If you're British, I don't
know if you hate summer or not. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can't stand this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I didn't until I moved outside. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And now I hate the summer. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Not as much as the winter though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Winter sucks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Doesn't help that we
record "Trash Taste" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> with these blasting lights on us. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was sweating a lot of this episode </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because we didn't turn
on the air conditioning </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in this fucking heat. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - As you were talking earlier, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I could literally see
a giant bead of sweat. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's 'cause I've got the
fucking sun staring at me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and we don't even fucking have the AC on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - The price that we, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you can't say that we
don't care about you guys. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Meilyne gave me the Evian facial spray </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which I actually accepted. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I realize that it did nothing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - How the tables have turned. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We suffer to make good
content for you guys. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - So, if you'd like to

<SPEAKER_03> this summery themed episode
of "Trash Taste," I suppose. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Was it summery themed? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, you're dressed for the occasion. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I, you know- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're so dressed well for the occasion. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm gonna start a barbecue after this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Very dad of you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, but anyway, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's been this episode of "Trash Taste." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Hope you enjoy your summer, and
