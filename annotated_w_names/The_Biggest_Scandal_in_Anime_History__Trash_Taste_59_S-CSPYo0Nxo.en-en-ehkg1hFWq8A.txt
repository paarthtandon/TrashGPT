<connor> - When I landed in San Francisco, I was like, </connor>
<connor> "Fuck, this air sucks." </connor>
<connor> I'm breathing it in, I'm like, </connor>
<garnt> "Oh my God, the pollution." </garnt>
<garnt> - How can you tell the pollution levels? </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, when you breathe in. </garnt>
<connor> When I land in the fucking country, I step off the plane, </connor>
<connor> I take a deep breath. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "This air's shit." </connor>
<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<connor> Why is this insane? </connor>
<joey> - It literally sounds like the stupidest superpower. </joey>
<joey> (gentle upbeat music) </joey>
<connor> - Gentlemen, I have the intro for this, all right. </connor>
<connor> - Gentlemen. </connor>
<connor> - What if I told you, </connor>
<connor> you could get anime for free? </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> For free, gentlemen. </connor>
<connor> - Wait, are we fucking jumping right into it? </connor>
<connor> - Because that's gonna be the first topic for today, </connor>
<connor> but right now, I have with me the boys, Garnt and Joey, </connor>
<connor> and I am monkey-brain Connor. - You didn't even say hello. </connor>
<garnt> You just fucking opened up with this like-- </garnt>
<connor> - That's what every good sales pitch does, bro. </connor>
<garnt> - Illuminati conspiracy theory. </garnt>
<connor> - Every good sales pitch starts with the hook. </connor>
<joey> - Literally reminded me of that Wolf of Wall Street, </joey>
<connor> like, "Sell me this pen." </connor>
<joey> - Because now, they're listening, they're intrigued. </joey>
<joey> "How can we get free anime?" </joey>
<joey> - What a hook, what a hook. </joey>
<garnt> - They don't wanna know about "Trash Taste." </garnt>
<garnt> They wanna know how they get free anime. </garnt>
<connor> - Did you just do the OG... </connor>
<connor> (Garnt stammers) </connor>
<connor> Did you just... </connor>
<connor> Oh my God. I can't fucking talk today. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, he did, he did. </garnt>
<garnt> - A natural salesman never stumbles on his words. </garnt>
<connor> I said free anime. </connor>
<connor> I wasn't stumbling. </connor>
<joey> - Tell me more, salesman, who's totally not shady. </joey>
<connor> - Well, if you just go to the Kickstarter page. </connor>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Oh, we're gonna talk about that. </joey>
<joey> We're gonna talk about that. </joey>
<joey> - Anime Tube, is that what it's called, Anime Tube? </joey>
<joey> - Anime Tube. - Well, </joey>
<joey> it's the first topic for today. </joey>
<joey> Two weeks ago, we wanted to talk about this last week, </joey>
<connor> but Chris came on, inconvenienced us again. </connor>
<connor> We would have spoken about this last week </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause we wanted to talk about Anime Tube. </garnt>
<joey> - We know Chris goes into fits when we talk about anime. </joey>
<joey> - So we got, so we're gonna be like three weeks late, </joey>
<connor> but the whole debacle is kind of finished now. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - We have all the info. - Well, it like, lived </garnt>
<garnt> and died within the span of a day, I think. </garnt>
<connor> - [Connor] Yes. </connor>
<garnt> - Pretty much. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was very interesting. </garnt>
<garnt> Essentially what happened is this thing called Anime Tube </garnt>
<joey> popped up on Kickstarter </joey>
<joey> and offered to give all the kind, anyone, really-- </joey>
<joey> - [Group] Free anime. </joey>
<joey> - Free anime? </joey>
<joey> - And you're probably thinking, "Well, </joey>
<joey> they probably only got like, you know, C-rate shows, </joey>
<joey> you know, really terrible. </joey>
<garnt> - What do they have? </garnt>
<garnt> They said they were going to, </garnt>
<garnt> they were in talks to get Evangelion, </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey gasps) </garnt>
<connor> Love Hina, which has been stuck in copyright Hell, </connor>
<connor> not copyright, licensing Hell. </connor>
<connor> - Specifically Love Hina. I dunno. </connor>
<connor> I dunno who just put specifically picks Love Hina </connor>
<connor> to be on the list, but. - Death Note, Attack on Titan. </connor>
<garnt> - Full Metal Alchemist. - Demon Slayer. </garnt>
<garnt> - Full Metal Alchemist. </garnt>
<garnt> Even though these were already all on </garnt>
<joey> streaming platforms already, you know. </joey>
<joey> And I imagine that-- </joey>
<joey> - And the ones that aren't have been out of print </joey>
<joey> for the past 20 years. - They say Re:Zero as well. </joey>
<garnt> - Ugh, I didn't, I didn't see the list. </garnt>
<joey> - They've got everything. It's Anime Tube. </joey>
<connor> - You know? I mean, you know, </connor>
<connor> and so I can't, </connor>
<connor> I don't know how much these properties are worth, </connor>
<garnt> but I can't imagine you getting Evangelion for less than </garnt>
<garnt> like a hundred million or something ridiculous. </garnt>
<garnt> It sounds absurd, but it's probably worth that much, right? </garnt>
<connor> So clearly these guys have big bucks to spend around. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, I'm just glad a company is giving </garnt>
<garnt> the power back to the people (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<joey> and taking on small indie companies like Sony. </joey>
<joey> - Fuck license holders, man! </joey>
<joey> - Taking on small indie companies like Sony and AT&T. </joey>
<joey> You know, someone's gotta take these indie companies </joey>
<connor> out of the field. - What were they gonna do? </connor>
<garnt> What were they gonna do with it? </garnt>
<garnt> So essentially this Kickstarter promised that </garnt>
<connor> and it raised in one day like $110,000. </connor>
<garnt> - Which is absurd. - It literally came out of </garnt>
<garnt> nowhere because I remember we were, </garnt>
<garnt> we literally came in the Trash Taste studio in the morning </garnt>
<garnt> and then it was just all over my Twitter timeline. </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, what the hell is going on? </garnt>
<joey> And we all looked at it and we were just like, </joey>
<joey> wait, this Kickstarter launched yesterday. </joey>
<joey> And it's raised over a hundred thousand dollars, </joey>
<joey> promising people free anime legally. </joey>
<joey> And I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> what is going on right now? </joey>
<garnt> It was an absolute disaster. </garnt>
<joey> - April was about three months ago, guys. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> You're a bit late to the joke right now. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. It was just a mess. </connor>
<joey> - It was hilarious, dude. </joey>
<joey> - It was a mess. </joey>
<joey> The, you know, </joey>
<joey> I think it's so many levels to it, </joey>
<joey> there's so many things that are really sad about it. </joey>
<joey> One, you know, I think it's safe to say that </joey>
<connor> this was either the most overambitious Kickstarter </connor>
<connor> of all time </connor>
<connor> or... </connor>
<connor> it was, they were lying. </connor>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<joey> - Or the most genius scam. </joey>
<connor> - No, yeah, I mean, you know, </connor>
<connor> you have to be careful when you say these gabs, </connor>
<connor> you can get sued. </connor>
<connor> So try not to get Trash Taste sued here, Joey. </connor>
<connor> But from what I saw, yeah, it's a scam. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> It's a scam. </connor>
<joey> - Well, I'm protecting myself. </joey>
<joey> I'm not going to say the S word, </joey>
<connor> but I'm going to say that it looked very sus. </connor>
<connor> I'll say the other S word. </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </connor>
<connor> - Little sussy scam. </connor>
<garnt> - It's a sussy baka is what it is. </garnt>
<connor> - You know, I genuinely wonder because, </connor>
<connor> you know, again, </connor>
<joey> they promised to have all these titles that there's </joey>
<joey> absolutely, you know, </joey>
<joey> not even Netflix or Amazon can get all of these shows, </joey>
<joey> right? </joey>
<joey> This is some serious amount of cash </joey>
<joey> and negotiating power, </joey>
<connor> that I doubt a Kickstarter would be able to convince </connor>
<joey> the Japanese investors. - If Netflix and Sony </joey>
<joey> can't even get the rights to some of these, </joey>
<joey> what suggests to anyone that </joey>
<joey> this Kickstarter group will be able to? </joey>
<connor> - Evangelion literally couldn't be-- </connor>
<joey> - Evangelion's been out of print for the past 20 years. </joey>
<joey> - You couldn't get the license for it </joey>
<joey> until Netflix somehow managed, </joey>
<connor> probably don't even want to know </connor>
<connor> how much Netflix played for that. </connor>
<joey> - Anno, the creator, didn't even have the rights to it </joey>
<joey> for the longest time </joey>
<joey> until he had to fucking fight with Gainax to get it back. </joey>
<joey> - It's insanity. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. I mean, the thing is, </joey>
<joey> I think there's, as you said, </joey>
<joey> there's so many layers to it because, you know, </joey>
<connor> in theory, it's a nice idea. </connor>
<connor> You know, </connor>
<connor> having somewhere where you can watch anime legally. </connor>
<connor> - Truly a utopian society. </connor>
<connor> - In this utopian world-- </connor>
<garnt> - One part of me feels bad. </garnt>
<joey> 'Cause we're like laughing at the, </joey>
<joey> imagine trying to take on the big guy "ha ha ha, funny." </joey>
<joey> But if it was a good attempt, I would be like, </joey>
<garnt> "Go for it, go for it!" </garnt>
<connor> - If it was a good attempt. </connor>
<garnt> But keep in mind you're taking on companies </garnt>
<garnt> like Sony, like Netflix, </garnt>
<garnt> you know, like people who, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> have a bit of dollar in their pocket, you know? </garnt>
<connor> - Just a bit. </connor>
<connor> - I don't think we're trying to be like, </connor>
<connor> yeah, we love corporations and stuff like that. </connor>
<connor> - I feel like a lot of this was driven by, </connor>
<connor> you know, the people's hatred towards corporations </connor>
<connor> and you know, I get it, you know. </connor>
<connor> If you don't want to support the big corporations </connor>
<connor> because of whatever reason, you know, I get it. </connor>
<garnt> There's a difference between </garnt>
<garnt> not wanting to support big corporations </garnt>
<garnt> and then supporting whatever this is. </garnt>
<connor> (Connor laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Blindly accepting anything that you want. </connor>
<garnt> - It's like not wanting to buy paracetamol </garnt>
<garnt> from your pharmacy, so you go to the local drug dealer. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I guess so, in some sense. </connor>
<joey> - It's like bidding in a horse race, </joey>
<joey> but the horse has two legs. </joey>
<connor> - That's why I felt so, kind of, just sad about it, really. </connor>
<connor> I felt sad that there was enough weebs out there </connor>
<joey> that were this desperate to stick it to the companies </joey>
<connor> that they would throw their money into a void. </connor>
<joey> - Dude, weebs want free shit, man, </joey>
<connor> at the end of the day. - That's the thing, </connor>
<joey> this is also what I don't understand, </joey>
<connor> is that we have weebs that are this dedicated </connor>
<connor> to say fuck you to companies </connor>
<connor> that they're willing to give money away. </connor>
<connor> But you could, they could just pirate it, </connor>
<joey> if they really want to really get it for free. </joey>
<joey> I'm not saying you should. I condone that, do not do it. </joey>
<joey> But... </joey>
<joey> if you're gonna </joey>
<connor> (Connor blubbers) </connor>
<connor> - I mean, it's also like, </connor>
<joey> with the money that they gave to this Kickstarter, </joey>
<joey> because there were a lot of people who were giving </joey>
<joey> hundreds of dollars to this Kickstarter. </joey>
<joey> And some people I saw were giving literally </joey>
<joey> thousands of dollars to this Kickstarter. </joey>
<connor> - When I looked, there was a thousand backers </connor>
<connor> giving a hundred thousand, so. </connor>
<joey> - Rough, on average, a hundred dollars each, right. </joey>
<connor> - They're giving a lot of money to this-- </connor>
<connor> - That's like a year's subscription to Netflix </connor>
<connor> or Crunchyroll or any of them. </connor>
<joey> - It's not about the money, Joey! </joey>
<connor> It's about the message I'm sending. </connor>
<joey> - It's about sending a message, the message of </joey>
<joey> "I got scammed." </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, it's the, </garnt>
<garnt> it's the thing is where, </garnt>
<joey> if anyone just literally used a single brain cell, </joey>
<joey> to think about the logistics of this-- </joey>
<joey> - The logistics! </joey>
<joey> - Just the logistics of why this would not work </joey>
<joey> in the first place or, you know. </joey>
<garnt> A hundred thousand seems like </garnt>
<garnt> a lot of money to any normal person. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like a drop in the fucking bucket </garnt>
<garnt> for anime licensing fees and all that stuff. </garnt>
<connor> - You can maybe license-- </connor>
<joey> - Half an episode. </joey>
<connor> - No, no, no, not even that. </connor>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<connor> - You can maybe license the thumbnail. </connor>
<joey> - Half an episode of like a C-tier anime. </joey>
<garnt> - Pretty much, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> What surprised me is that they were, </garnt>
<garnt> the shows that they were listing </garnt>
<joey> as the shows they were going for, </joey>
<garnt> were like the fucking triple A titles </garnt>
<garnt> that are worth millions and millions of dollars, right? </garnt>
<joey> I mean, God knows how much Netflix actually paid </joey>
<joey> to get Evangelion out of licensing hell. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause Evangelion was out of like, </joey>
<joey> couldn't be licensed by any Western company for like, </joey>
<joey> feels like a decade or something. </joey>
<joey> - Literally since it was made. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> Since ADV collapsed, </joey>
<joey> I can't think of any other </joey>
<garnt> company that has successfully licensed Evangelion. </garnt>
<connor> - And I think people like to think of anime </connor>
<connor> as still this kind of underground thing, </connor>
<garnt> but some of these shows are easily, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> worth over hundreds of millions of dollars. </garnt>
<connor> Just think of the merchandising of these shows as well. </connor>
<connor> The IP is so expensive. </connor>
<connor> - Think about the mega shows, </connor>
<connor> any of the Shonen Jump shows like My Hero. </connor>
<connor> - How much is Attack on Titan worth? </connor>
<garnt> - Fucking Demon Slayer. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, I mean, Demon Slayer is a billion dollar property. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, exactly! </garnt>
<joey> - It's already proven to be that. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's really, </joey>
<joey> I just, I don't understand. </joey>
<connor> Like every, none of this, </connor>
<connor> who were these thousands of people who gave money? </connor>
<connor> I legitimately want to know. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I legitimately want to know. </joey>
<connor> - It's obviously very young, impressionable anime fans, </connor>
<joey> right, who were just hoping for this utopian society? </joey>
<joey> - I wonder if some parts of it, </joey>
<joey> we're just completely oblivious about, </joey>
<joey> whether we take for granted some of them, </joey>
<joey> 'cause we, </joey>
<joey> I mean, we work with Japanese companies. </joey>
<joey> We know how these things are. </joey>
<joey> You can't go around saying you're in talks. </joey>
<joey> That is, </joey>
<garnt> that is like the biggest no-no in business. </garnt>
<garnt> And especially here, </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like it's never a done deal </garnt>
<garnt> until it's done deal in Japan. </garnt>
<joey> - Did you read the FAQ? </joey>
<joey> - What was the, what did they say? </joey>
<joey> Oh, okay. </joey>
<garnt> I've read some of it. What was the, </garnt>
<connor> do you remember the thing about licensing or something? </connor>
<garnt> - I remember one of the FAQ's, </garnt>
<garnt> one of the questions was, </garnt>
<joey> "Isn't anime licensing really expensive?" </joey>
<joey> - Yes. </joey>
<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<joey> And they legit went, </joey>
<joey> "Actually, anime licensing isn't as expensive </joey>
<joey> as everyone makes it out to be. </joey>
<joey> The only reason nobody does it </joey>
<garnt> and nobody talks about it is because of NDAs. </garnt>
<garnt> But we are in talks with real Japanese anime licenses. </garnt>
<garnt> And that was pretty much, </garnt>
<garnt> that was pretty much the answer to the question, </garnt>
<garnt> "Can they get anime licenses?" </garnt>
<joey> - They literally just shot themselves in the foot. </joey>
<connor> They didn't have to answer that question. </connor>
<joey> - You can't say you're talking to these companies. </joey>
<joey> It's all very secretive, you know, intentionally. </joey>
<connor> - All these companies are like, </connor>
<connor> "Do you know this guy?" </connor>
<joey> Well, yeah, 'cause if it was a guy, there was a, </joey>
<joey> so they also, </joey>
<joey> I think the person, I'm not sure if the CEO, </joey>
<joey> someone representing write staff. </joey>
<joey> Anime. </joey>
<joey> Which is the American company, I think. </joey>
<joey> which buys the licenses for, </joey>
<joey> again, I'm not sure. </joey>
<garnt> Either way, they buy licensing or they sell, </garnt>
<garnt> or they sell DVDs of anime. </garnt>
<garnt> They reached out being like, </garnt>
<garnt> "So apparently you've listed some of our titles, </garnt>
<garnt> and you say that we're in talks." </garnt>
<garnt> And the guy tweeted at him, saying that </garnt>
<garnt> "We've never been in talks." </garnt>
<connor> And then they replied saying, </connor>
<connor> "We sent you a message on LinkedIn. </connor>
<connor> That was there. We're in talks." </connor>
<connor> I'm in fucking talks with all the people that </connor>
<connor> email me about weird shit then, aren't I? </connor>
<joey> The fuck? </joey>
<garnt> - It's just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Bro, I DM'ed you. </garnt>
<garnt> Why didn't you DM back?" </garnt>
<joey> - "I sent you my LinkedIn DM, please respond. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<garnt> We're in talks now, right? </garnt>
<joey> Hundreds of millions of dollars are at stake </joey>
<joey> because of my LinkedIn DM." </joey>
<joey> - "I sent you a DM, please give me the anime license." </joey>
<joey> - "Please give me the IP." </joey>
<connor> That's how </connor>
<garnt> anime licensing works, right? - I'm in talks with </garnt>
<garnt> all my favorite succubuses from all the hentai. </garnt>
<garnt> I've sent them a message. </garnt>
<joey> They haven't responded yet, but we're in talks. </joey>
<connor> We're working on an arrangement. </connor>
<connor> It's just insanity. </connor>
<joey> - We're part of this one-sided conversation. </joey>
<connor> - It was just, </connor>
<connor> (Connor laughs) </connor>
<connor> I mean, it all burned down in flames, luckily, </connor>
<garnt> but it was just, oh my God, </garnt>
<connor> it was such a fucking mess. - It was just </connor>
<connor> so bizarre to see. </connor>
<garnt> And, you know, we knew it was gonna come down in flames. </garnt>
<connor> - [Connor] Hundred percent. </connor>
<connor> I mean, I think right now, </connor>
<garnt> it's been taken off Kickstarter, right? </garnt>
<connor> - As far as I know. </connor>
<garnt> - Can you check? </garnt>
<joey> - [Navi] It's still here. </joey>
<connor> - [Group] It's still there? </connor>
<connor> - [Navi] But the funding has stopped. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh. - Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> So, no one's giving them anymore funding. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's good. </garnt>
<connor> - [Navi] Okay, it does say "suspended." </connor>
<joey> - So, Kickstarter suspended the bitch. </joey>
<joey> - $111,000. </joey>
<garnt> I don't know how true this is, </garnt>
<garnt> but I did see a screenshot pop up on my timeline </garnt>
<garnt> the other day though, </garnt>
<garnt> that shows that they haven't given up. </garnt>
<garnt> They've started a newsletter, which you can, </garnt>
<garnt> which you can subscribe to for a dollar. </garnt>
<garnt> So for a dollar, </garnt>
<garnt> for this newsletter, </garnt>
<garnt> you can subscribe for updates. </garnt>
<joey> - These people are just taking your money. </joey>
<joey> - Updates of what? </joey>
<garnt> Talks in the anime industry? - I don't know! </garnt>
<garnt> I legit don't know. </garnt>
<joey> - "On this week's newsletter, </joey>
<joey> we're in talks with ADV." </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<connor> Trying to get the rights. </connor>
<connor> - It's just absolutely tragic. </connor>
<connor> It's obvious that, you know, </connor>
<connor> I'm not being funny, but there's a reason why </connor>
<connor> Netflix doesn't have its own Discord server as well. </connor>
<joey> They had their own Discord server, </joey>
<joey> and they started banning people. </joey>
<joey> And it's like, what is this? </joey>
<joey> This is a fucking YandereDev's game. </joey>
<joey> What is this? This is like, what's going on here? </joey>
<joey> And it's so obvious that they're just, </joey>
<garnt> 'cause they've done this like two times before apparently, </garnt>
<garnt> as well. </garnt>
<garnt> And they failed twice. - Oh, yeah! I saw they've made </garnt>
<garnt> other Kickstarters. - So they're trying to make </garnt>
<garnt> this Kickstarter. This is their third attempt of doing it. </garnt>
<garnt> And I think that another app similar to it popped up </garnt>
<garnt> on the Microsoft store and was taken down before as well. </garnt>
<connor> They have a history of doing this and failing and whatever, </connor>
<connor> but clearly, you know, every time it comes around, </connor>
<connor> it seems to get some money. So I guess, why not? </connor>
<joey> - They got some real balls to do it </joey>
<joey> like three or four times. </joey>
<connor> - No shame, man, if you get money. </connor>
<joey> - I'm sorry if you fucking gave money to that Kickstarter. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, I would say, </garnt>
<connor> I like the idea of it. - Noble intentions. </connor>
<joey> - Intentions aside, I like the idea of it. </joey>
<joey> - Everybody wishes for it. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, everybody wishes for it. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I feel like, you know, in the era we're in now, </joey>
<joey> I think we're past the golden age of streaming because </joey>
<joey> we're past the point in time where you could get every show </joey>
<joey> that you physically, feasibly watched on one platform. </joey>
<joey> And it's unfortunate that that's the case, </joey>
<joey> but it's kind of evolved into a similar era </joey>
<joey> to what the cable era was like. </joey>
<joey> But I mean, when pe-- </joey>
<joey> when corporations started to realize that </joey>
<joey> there was money in streaming, </joey>
<joey> this was going to be the way that things were gonna evolve, </joey>
<joey> unfortunately, </joey>
<joey> because unfortunately, money talks, you know. </joey>
<joey> And if there could be a platform </joey>
<garnt> where every anime you ever watched was on a single platform, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm sure someone would have done that already. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm sure someone with a lot of money </garnt>
<garnt> would have done that already. </garnt>
<joey> - Hate to be the bearer of bad news, </joey>
<joey> but anime is a business. </joey>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> Whether you like it or not. </connor>
<joey> - Streaming is one of those businesses where it's </joey>
<garnt> now on impossible to get into it, </garnt>
<connor> unless you've got massive investors. </connor>
<garnt> - Maybe like 10, 15 years ago. </garnt>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> Maybe, you know, </connor>
<joey> if you were at the start of the streaming age, </joey>
<joey> like when Crunchyroll first started, </joey>
<joey> but that time's passed now. </joey>
<garnt> You can't just be the little guy </garnt>
<garnt> taking on the big guy anymore. </garnt>
<connor> - Quibi as well had like, what, 6 billion dollars. </connor>
<garnt> - The fuck is Quibi? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly! You don't even know what Quibi is. </joey>
<joey> - Wait, what's Quibi? </joey>
<joey> It's a, it was made, </joey>
<joey> it was founded by the guy who </joey>
<joey> left Disney and founded DreamWorks. </joey>
<joey> I can't remember his name. </joey>
<joey> And made Quibi, a streaming service. </joey>
<joey> - Oh my god, </joey>
<connor> I remember that shit. - It was an absolute </connor>
<connor> dumpster fire, but it had </connor>
<connor> billions of dollars in investments. </connor>
<connor> It was insane. - Yeah, but it disappeared </connor>
<joey> after like two weeks, right? Or something. </joey>
<connor> - Well, it was like, you got a free trial </connor>
<joey> then you have to pay. </joey>
<joey> And it literally just tanked immediately. </joey>
<garnt> They paid for so many original shows as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - Who's on there? </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't fucking know. I didn't go on Quibi. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - Did anyone use Quibi? </connor>
<connor> - I didn't even know about this. </connor>
<joey> - Oh yeah. How'd you not know about this? </joey>
<garnt> - It was a couple of years ago, I think. </garnt>
<connor> - Was it a couple years ago? </connor>
<connor> - It was like two years ago, I think. </connor>
<joey> No, it was like a year ago. </joey>
<joey> - Was it? </joey>
<joey> - I think I might've-- </joey>
<joey> I don't even count last year. </joey>
<connor> Last year, frankly, just flew by. </connor>
<connor> I can't remember anything. </connor>
<joey> - Did it happen in 2019? It was a year ago. </joey>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </connor>
<joey> - I'm still 22 as far as I'm concerned. </joey>
<garnt> (all laugh) </garnt>
<garnt> - 2020 was just like fucking King Crimson existed in 2020, </garnt>
<garnt> and just fucking erased the entire year. </garnt>
<garnt> We just skipped it. </garnt>
<connor> - Literally felt like last month was April 2020. </connor>
<connor> This is really weird. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I mean we're already halfway through 2021, </joey>
<joey> which is terrifying. </joey>
<garnt> - Didn't Mixer die as well? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. Mixer died. </connor>
<garnt> - Man, fuck, I wish I got offered to move to Mixer. </garnt>
<garnt> I would've got a nice cash out. </garnt>
<garnt> - Ninja's just set for life. </garnt>
<garnt> He's the only reason anyone knows about Mixer, I think. </garnt>
<garnt> But yeah, I mean, even with those failed platforms, </garnt>
<garnt> they had millions and billions of dollars invested into them </garnt>
<garnt> by angel investors. </garnt>
<joey> - They definitely wouldn't start up a fucking Kickstarter. </joey>
<garnt> - And unfortunately, even if you have, what's, </garnt>
<joey> what would be the most successful Kickstarter of all time? </joey>
<joey> - I don't know. </joey>
<connor> - That's very telling that we can't think of one. </connor>
<garnt> - [Group] Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> I'm sure there is some good ones out there, I just, </joey>
<garnt> I've never been interested. </garnt>
<garnt> Any good Kickstarter, </garnt>
<connor> you could just buy the thing when it fucking comes out. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I'm just thinking of the money, </garnt>
<garnt> with the money that Kickstarter can be, </garnt>
<garnt> people can invest into Kickstarter. </garnt>
<garnt> Even the most successful Kickstarter of all time would </garnt>
<garnt> probably have trouble getting into the streaming field. </garnt>
<joey> - The only one I remember was those </joey>
<joey> sunglasses that had the built-in headphones into it. </joey>
<joey> Remember those? </joey>
<joey> - That was successful? - There was a Kickstarter, </joey>
<joey> I remember it because it was during my uni days, </joey>
<garnt> but there's this pair of sunglasses where on the brim here, </garnt>
<garnt> it was like this new technology and audio where </garnt>
<garnt> it would vibrate, and the vibrations would travel </garnt>
<joey> through your ears and the music would come into your ears. </joey>
<joey> And I remember it was a successful case </joey>
<joey> that was millions of dollars. </joey>
<connor> - That's not success. </connor>
<joey> - Is that the most successful </joey>
<garnt> Kickstarter of all time? - Wait, what the fuck is that? </garnt>
<connor> - The Ouya. </connor>
<garnt> - [Group] The Ouya? </garnt>
<garnt> - The Ouya is the most successful? </garnt>
<garnt> Are you kidding me, Navi? </garnt>
<joey> - [Navi] Number eight. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, number eight. </garnt>
<joey> The Ouya is the number-- </joey>
<joey> - Wait, how much money did the Ouya raise? </joey>
<joey> - [Navi] $8,596,000. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, but you gotta bear in mind, right, </connor>
<connor> even if someone raised-- </connor>
<connor> - [Navi] Most successful is actually Pebble </connor>
<joey> with 20 million dollars. </joey>
<connor> - [All] Pebble? </connor>
<joey> - [Man] The smartwatch. </joey>
<joey> - Oh! </joey>
<connor> - Even if somebody raised 200, 300 million dollars, </connor>
<connor> that doesn't mean shit for streaming. </connor>
<connor> You can't buy much with that. </connor>
<garnt> - No, that's what I'm trying to say. </garnt>
<garnt> Even with the most successful Kickstarters of all time, </garnt>
<connor> to get into this field, you need external investors. </connor>
<connor> If they really want to challenge the big guys, you know, </connor>
<connor> 'cause there's a lot of money in there right now. </connor>
<connor> - Most of us are broke! </connor>
<joey> - You could gather all the anime fans in the world </joey>
<connor> and it probably won't even be enough. </connor>
<connor> - I don't understand how people can invest in Kickstarter </connor>
<joey> after it's just, </joey>
<connor> track record's poorly. </connor>
<connor> - Have you ever donated to a Kickstarter? </connor>
<connor> - No! </connor>
<connor> - Why? You save like $20, </connor>
<connor> and you got to put a hundred in for some shit. </connor>
<connor> And it's like, I'll just wait 'til it comes out. </connor>
<joey> - I've done a few, </joey>
<connor> but not like the stupid amounts of money that some people-- </connor>
<connor> every time I look at a Kickstarter, </connor>
<connor> and I see, you know, the top tiers, </connor>
<joey> which are like a thousand, $10,000, </joey>
<joey> and you see one left, two left. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, who are these people </joey>
<joey> that are just dropping $10,000 on this? </joey>
<connor> - For stuff that genuinely needs the money, </connor>
<joey> I would be more inclined. </joey>
<joey> Like a game or something that I'm into. </joey>
<joey> I would, but I haven't though. </joey>
<joey> Most of the time, the stuff that gets the most </joey>
<connor> is just like fucking pre-orders, essentially. </connor>
<connor> The product's made, they know what they're doing, </connor>
<connor> and you're just pre-ordering. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, with Kickstarter, </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like if it's a small indie project </garnt>
<joey> or something that you can see </joey>
<joey> feasibly getting funded on Kickstarter, I would support it. </joey>
<joey> I think the last Kickstarter I supported was actually </joey>
<connor> the Trigger anime. </connor>
<connor> I think they funded the second OVA of </connor>
<connor> - [Joey And Garnt] Little Witch Academia. </connor>
<garnt> - I supported that. </garnt>
<connor> - That makes sense to me, that seems like, </connor>
<connor> this is why Kickstarter should exist. </connor>
<garnt> - But if you're coming in trying to change, </garnt>
<garnt> stir up an entire industry or whatever, </garnt>
<garnt> Kickstarter's just not going to do it anymore. </garnt>
<garnt> I think Kickstarter is really good for, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> a small indie team to do some kind of project, </garnt>
<garnt> but on like a fucking </garnt>
<garnt> industry changing project, you need something else. </garnt>
<joey> - Usually Kickstarter is for, you know, </joey>
<joey> kind of at a, </joey>
<joey> it stops at an artistic level, right? </joey>
<joey> It's not really the thing that you go into to be like, </joey>
<joey> I'm gonna cause a scene in the industry, you know? </joey>
<connor> - Fucking everything on Kickstarter is the same shit. </connor>
<connor> It's like, all right, </connor>
<connor> get the stock image of people running, </connor>
<joey> play the music mood and the, you know-- </joey>
<joey> - The ukulele one. </joey>
<joey> - That one or there's always some motivational thing. </joey>
<joey> And then it's just like, </joey>
<joey> have you ever had this problem that isn't a problem? </joey>
<joey> Well, now we can solve it. </joey>
<connor> And then it looks amazing. </connor>
<connor> And then you think about it and you're like, </connor>
<connor> it's all shit. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<joey> - It's always the same type of people </joey>
<joey> with a Kickstarter too, isn't it? </joey>
<joey> It's always the way too overly enthusiastic, like, </joey>
<connor> "Hi, my name is Kyle." </connor>
<connor> - It'll either be someone from California </connor>
<joey> or someone from Eastern Europe. </joey>
<joey> With a really thick accent explaining why </joey>
<joey> his fridge is the best fridge. </joey>
<joey> And it's like, okay, that's cool, that's fine. </joey>
<joey> I just don't want it. </joey>
<joey> - "With our last project, 'The Walking Fridge,' </joey>
<joey> we raised $200,000. </joey>
<joey> That's insane." </joey>
<garnt> - I just realized that Kickstarters </garnt>
<connor> are basically the modern infomercials. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Pretty much. </connor>
<garnt> - Pretty much. </garnt>
<connor> I just don't believe any single advertisement </connor>
<connor> where someone gives it to a random person </connor>
<joey> and they're like, "Whoa, it's amazing." </joey>
<joey> I just don't believe that. </joey>
<joey> Even if it actually happens, I just don't want to see it. </joey>
<connor> - I don't even believe it when </connor>
<garnt> there's the thing which says "not a paid actor." </garnt>
<joey> You sure about that? </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Going back to Anime Tube, </joey>
<joey> did you see the fucking testimonials they had </joey>
<connor> on the Kickstarter post page? - What were the testimonials? </connor>
<connor> - I think they just got some random people </connor>
<garnt> they found on Discord to give them testimonials </garnt>
<garnt> of their app or something like that. </garnt>
<garnt> - "It's good!" </garnt>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> - What were the testimonials? </connor>
<joey> - Let me see, let me see. </joey>
<joey> Let me see if I can bring it up right now, </joey>
<garnt> But... </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, I mean, it's all the same, right? </garnt>
<connor> It's literally-- </connor>
<connor> - Let's see. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's just like, you know, </connor>
<connor> I frankly don't really do, </connor>
<connor> I don't trust anyone who shows me their review. </connor>
<connor> Just let me see your reviews. I'll have a look. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] "It is routinely maintained, it's comfortable, </joey>
<joey> it's quite logical and ergonomic. </joey>
<joey> It's way beyond any competition. I like it." </joey>
<connor> - Of course it's beyond the fucking competition </connor>
<connor> when you can just take the licenses and rip them off a DVD. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] "The best app for on-hand anime. </joey>
<joey> I used to spend days looking up series, </joey>
<joey> but now I just use this app with ease." </joey>
<joey> Thank you, Robert. </joey>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Thank you, Stephan, Robert, and James. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] With the most rudimentary anime </garnt>
<joey> profile pictures. I've ever seen. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. I mean, it's just, </garnt>
<garnt> we're going to look back on this </garnt>
<garnt> and it's just going to feel like a fever dream, you know. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - It already does. </connor>
<connor> - It's fucking stupid. </connor>
<garnt> - Don't do that! </garnt>
<connor> - This episode is sponsored by Honey. </connor>
<connor> - Guys, we all shop online </connor>
<connor> and we've all seen that promo code field </connor>
<connor> taunt us at the checkout. </connor>
<connor> But thanks to Honey, </connor>
<connor> manually searching for coupons like a peasant </connor>
<connor> is the thing of the past. </connor>

<garnt> - All right, boys, hear me out, hear me out. </garnt>
<garnt> Imagine you're shopping on your favorite site, right? </garnt>
<garnt> And when you're at the checkout, </garnt>
<garnt> the Honey button drops down </garnt>
<garnt> and all you have to do is click Apply Coupons. </garnt>
<garnt> You wait a few seconds </garnt>
<joey> as Honey searches for its coupons it can find for that site, </joey>
<joey> and if Honey finds a working coupon, </joey>
<joey> you'll watch those prices </joey>
<joey> drop! (Connor and Garnt groan) </joey>
<garnt> - Joey, stop seducing me like this. </garnt>
<garnt> I can't hear these words right now. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm literally coming. </garnt>
<connor> - I recently bought a new pair </connor>
<connor> of noise canceling headphones, </connor>
<connor> and thanks to Honey, I saved twenty dollarinos. </connor>
<connor> And I'm not the only Honey member making savings. </connor>
<connor> There's over 17 million members </connor>
<connor> getting those sweet savings worth 2 billion dollars. </connor>

<joey> that's joinhoney.com/trashtaste. </joey>
<joey> Link's in the description below. </joey>
<connor> - Back to the episode. </connor>
<connor> I don't trust reviews on websites that aren't like </connor>
<connor> a third party's website. You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> - Even some third party websites, right? </connor>
<connor> - Even Amazon, they're all fucked, right? </connor>
<connor> And especially if it's on your website. </connor>
<connor> Bro, I don't trust your reviews. </connor>
<connor> Five stars? No way. It's on your website. </connor>
<joey> - I just don't trust Amazon reviews in general. </joey>
<joey> Especially in Japan. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, we've talked about this before, right, to be fair. </joey>
<joey> But I mean, that's why they have the certified seller thing. </joey>
<connor> A certified buyer bought it, which makes more sense. </connor>
<garnt> - We need more people like Meilyne. </garnt>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, Meilyne reviews-- </joey>
<joey> - Hit them with the hard opinions! No bullshit. </joey>
<connor> - Meilyne, Meilyne, </connor>
<garnt> the top 5% Google reviewer. - I just feel like </garnt>
<garnt> I'm a shit reviewer. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I don't really give a shit, </garnt>
<joey> as long as it does the thing. </joey>
<joey> I don't care, some people get so-- </joey>
<joey> - Have you ever written a review </joey>
<joey> for an Amazon thing or anything? </joey>
<joey> - I'm always five or one star. </joey>
<joey> I'm that guy, I'm that kind of guy. </joey>
<connor> Because to me, it either works or it doesn't. </connor>
<connor> And if it looks fine, fine, that's it. </connor>
<garnt> - If it does the thing I paid for it to do-- </garnt>
<joey> - Five stars. - That's great. </joey>
<joey> - You're not those assholes who are like, </joey>
<joey> "Two out of ten. The box was bruised." Or whatever. </joey>
<connor> - Well, people rate furniture and they're like, </connor>
<joey> "It was complicated to build. Two stars." </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, </joey>
<joey> but that's surely, that's just-- </joey>
<joey> - That's on you, bro. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I feel like that's an interpretation thing. </joey>
<joey> Is the thing good? </joey>
<connor> At the end of the day, you're only going to build it </connor>
<connor> for like one hour or two hours or three. </connor>
<garnt> - There are some times when I'm just like how, </garnt>
<joey> I'm pretty sure you need a PhD to translate </joey>
<connor> the instruction manual that they gave, right? </connor>
<garnt> - Every IKEA furniture. </garnt>
<garnt> - I know what you mean but at the same time, </garnt>
<garnt> okay, I have a coffee table right now. </garnt>
<garnt> that was so over-engineered </garnt>
<garnt> and the amount of screws and shit for it was totally stupid. </garnt>
<joey> That was three hours </joey>
<joey> out of the two years I've been using it. </joey>
<joey> I don't give a shit about those three hours </joey>
<joey> looking back now. </joey>
<joey> That's why I write the review like three months </joey>
<joey> after I get it, because then I'm like, </joey>
<joey> oh yeah, it's good. </joey>
<joey> - It's still standing. </joey>
<joey> - That's why I wait. If it breaks up after like one month, </joey>
<joey> all right, fine, that's one star. </joey>
<joey> It shouldn't have broke one month after I use it. </joey>
<joey> But when people who, </joey>
<joey> these people who write it and they're like, </joey>
<connor> "The cardboard box was slightly damaged, you know. </connor>
<connor> The furniture took a little longer than I'd like to. </connor>
<connor> Like, fuck off. </connor>
<joey> - "The delivery man had a bad attitude." </joey>
<joey> That's got nothing to do with anything. </joey>
<connor> - And then as well, even if it breaks, I'm like, </connor>
<connor> all right, how long, reasonably, did I expect it to last? </connor>
<joey> My bed's broken, </joey>
<joey> is that, </joey>
<connor> but it's two years, </connor>
<connor> is that-- </connor>
<connor> - You also spent, what, a hundred bucks on it? </connor>
<connor> - It was 300 bucks for the mattress and the bed. </connor>
<joey> - Which is very cheap for a bed of your size. </joey>
<garnt> - Considering how much we've spent on Amazon </garnt>
<garnt> to get our first furniture, </garnt>
<garnt> I think the furniture I have right now has lasted very well. </garnt>
<connor> - Well, my bed is like, </connor>
<connor> this design of this bed is, </connor>
<connor> when I was building it, I'm like, huh. </connor>
<joey> This doesn't seem super structurally stable. </joey>
<joey> I understand why it was three stars now. </joey>
<joey> Well, basically, you know that meme </joey>
<joey> with the Cheeto in the door, </joey>
<joey> holding the door closed? </joey>
<joey> There's a tiny plank, </joey>
<joey> like a piece of plywood that basically is holding up </joey>
<connor> the middle of the bed and all the way on it. </connor>
<joey> - That doesn't sound safe. </joey>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<connor> - If you stood on that and jumped on it, </connor>
<joey> it would just crack, right? </joey>
<connor> Well, one time, </connor>
<connor> I think I just like, </connor>
<connor> 'cause I don't know, </connor>
<joey> I wouldn't say I get into bed aggressively, </joey>
<joey> but I'm not polite about it. </joey>
<joey> - You're not gonna be like-- </joey>
<joey> - I'm not sneaking into my bed, you know, </joey>
<garnt> I just kinda like, you know. </garnt>
<connor> - Hop on, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Just fucking does a clothesline on the bed </connor>
<connor> or something like that. </connor>
<joey> - WWE Smackdown Arena! </joey>
<joey> No, so I just popped on my bed and I just heard the boom. </joey>
<joey> And then I looked under my bed </joey>
<joey> and this thing had just fucking went to the side. </joey>
<joey> And I was like, oh, that's all right. </joey>
<joey> - It's not even screwed in? </joey>
<joey> - No, no. It's literally just put in with the weight. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> There's just a plank of literally, like if this is the bed-- </joey>
<joey> (Connor mumbles) </joey>
<joey> It's just like this. </joey>
<joey> You just gotta center this piece of wood. </joey>
<joey> It's literally like this size as well. </joey>
<joey> And so when I looked and it was like this. </joey>
<joey> I was just like, oh, it's all right. </joey>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> So I do that every time it does it now. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, that works, right? </garnt>
<joey> - It's probably time for a new bed, man. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, probably time for a new bed. </joey>
<joey> I mean, you're moving soon, </joey>
<joey> gonna upgrade your breads, which-- </joey>
<joey> - Bread? My bread? </joey>
<joey> - Upgrading my breads. - I do have to </joey>
<joey> upgrade my bread. - From white to rye. </joey>
<connor> - You can feel the springs on it </connor>
<joey> and everything right now, can't you? </joey>
<connor> - I kinda like feeling the springs, though. </connor>
<connor> - Why? - Really? </connor>
<garnt> - It's got a nice feel to it, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't. Does no one else, </garnt>
<garnt> someone else is like that. </garnt>
<joey> I like feeling a little bit of a spring. </joey>
<garnt> - We're looking around the room, </garnt>
<garnt> not a single person is like, "Mhm!" </garnt>
<garnt> - Sounds like peasant talk to me. </garnt>
<connor> - Listen, okay. I'm-- </connor>
<garnt> Shut up. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - How dare you? </connor>
<connor> - No king wants to feel the springs on the bread corner. </connor>
<connor> - Stop saying bread! </connor>
<garnt> (all laugh) </garnt>
<garnt> - What is your obsession with bread? </garnt>
<joey> I don't want springs in my fucking bread, Garnt. </joey>
<joey> That'd be really awkward, trying to cut it. </joey>
<joey> - The knife keeps bouncing back! </joey>
<joey> - It's a slinky in my bread! </joey>
<joey> Well, I, </joey>
<joey> you know, when I go to a hotel, </joey>
<joey> I have their amazing, you know-- </joey>
<joey> Fucking whatever the little hippo is. </joey>
<joey> The brand, I don't know what it is. Sleepy's? </joey>
<joey> - The anti-gravity mattress </joey>
<joey> or whatever the fuck it's called. </joey>
<joey> - The hippo. It's Sleepy's, the brand. </joey>
<garnt> I think it's a hippo in the UK. </garnt>
<garnt> - Is that a brand? </garnt>
<garnt> - Anyway, it's some deluxe, divine, 10,000 sheet. </garnt>
<joey> I'm like, oh, it's pretty good, this. </joey>
<joey> It's great, that. </joey>
<joey> But also, those beds are ridiculous. </joey>
<joey> And I don't, </joey>
<connor> I don't think they're that much better than a shitty bed. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't know about that, man. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know about that one, chief. </garnt>
<joey> - You know a shit mattress when you're on it. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I had a memory foam one at my parents' house. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't like memory foam ones. </garnt>
<joey> Those ones, I don't like. </joey>
<garnt> - Really? I love those. </garnt>
<joey> - When I first-- </joey>
<joey> Well, yeah, it's 'cause you gotta break it in. </joey>
<connor> You really, </connor>
<connor> after like a year, it's amazing. </connor>
<joey> - It's like putty, you just kind of sink yourself into it. </joey>
<connor> - It takes months for it to actually get the right shape. </connor>
<connor> But then it's amazing. </connor>
<garnt> - No, I want to see, </garnt>
<garnt> feel some bounce in it. </garnt>
<garnt> With the memory foam one, </garnt>
<garnt> it feels like I'm sleeping in quicksand. </garnt>
<garnt> Where you just sink in and you just like-- </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, that's the thing though, </garnt>
<joey> the comfort envelops you. </joey>
<connor> - But the thing is, you know, I mean, </connor>
<connor> I feel like that's like admitting you're just single </connor>
<joey> if you get a memory foam one. </joey>
<joey> It's not an exciting bed, you know? </joey>
<joey> - What do you mean? </joey>
<joey> - What do you mean? </joey>
<joey> - Do I need to explain, Garnt? - Yeah, please. </joey>
<joey> - There's no bounce. </joey>
<joey> (Connor laughs) </joey>
<joey> - I gotcha. </joey>
<garnt> (all laugh) </garnt>
<garnt> - It's just depressing. </garnt>
<connor> It's like fucking on a beanbag, you know. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't use memory foam beds, so. </garnt>
<connor> - There you go, then, you know what I mean. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause I like the bounce. </connor>
<garnt> I like the bounce normally when I'm sleeping, you know. </garnt>
<joey> - What are you, fucking sleeping like this? </joey>
<connor> (Connor and Joey laugh) </connor>
<connor> - You can rebound them. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<joey> - I need some bounce when I'm fighting </joey>
<joey> my sleep paralysis demon. </joey>
<joey> Get off! </joey>
<connor> - Do I really need to explain this? Come on. </connor>
<connor> - I get it. I get it. </connor>
<connor> - Sometimes, you know-- </connor>
<joey> - Sometimes, you just wanna play a bit of basketball, right? </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<connor> - Sometimes you just wanna dribble some balls. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, sometimes, you need to dribble. </joey>
<joey> You know what I mean? </joey>
<garnt> Could you catch my drift guys? </garnt>
<connor> Use your imagination. </connor>
<garnt> - Spring breads are awful for that. </garnt>
<joey> - [Connor] No, you can use </joey>
<joey> the springs. - Stop saying bread! </joey>
<joey> - I said bed there, didn't I? </joey>
<joey> - You literally said, "Spring bread." </joey>
<garnt> - Oh my fucking God. </garnt>
<joey> (Connor laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Does Garnt go to the bakery and ask for a mattress? </joey>
<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<connor> - Give me your finest bed, please. </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God, what is this fucking convo? </connor>
<connor> - Have you ever slept on a waterbed before? </connor>
<connor> - I imagine that must be fun. - That sounds horrible. </connor>
<garnt> - That's really fun. It's like literally-- </garnt>
<garnt> - That must be. Is it actually fun? Is it comfortable? </garnt>
<garnt> - It's really, </garnt>
<garnt> I find it to be super fucking comfortable, </garnt>
<garnt> but that's because again, it's, </garnt>
<joey> but I find memory foam to be really comfortable. </joey>
<joey> So it's kind of like that because </joey>
<joey> the mattress kind of follows you as you're moving around. </joey>
<connor> - But then if you're in a-- </connor>
<joey> - It's like you become the mattress. </joey>
<joey> - If you get a double memory foam mattress, </joey>
<joey> you guys are never going to touch each other. </joey>
<garnt> You guys are going to be like, </garnt>
<connor> "We have our crevice. It is set. Goodbye." </connor>
<garnt> - That's what I don't like about memory foam mattresses. </garnt>
<connor> You just sink in, and there-- - It's a single bed thing. </connor>
<connor> - There's no movement. </connor>
<connor> I'm not seeing enough movement anywhere </connor>
<connor> on a memory foam mattress </connor>
<connor> You sink in and that's just it. </connor>
<connor> - That's what couples do when they agree that </connor>
<connor> they're just not having sex anymore. </connor>
<joey> It's true, I mean-- </joey>
<joey> - It's like, "Let me just sink into my crevice." </joey>
<connor> - Well, yeah, because you have your, </connor>
<connor> you literally, </connor>
<connor> if a memory foam is set, it's so uncomfortable </connor>
<connor> to move to a position where it isn't set. </connor>
<joey> - What about memory foam pillows? </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, I like the pillows. </joey>
<joey> - Do you like the pillows? </joey>
<garnt> - Nah, I like feeling that, </garnt>
<garnt> I like a little resistance, I like a little bounce. </garnt>
<garnt> On like whatever I'm sleeping-- </garnt>
<garnt> - You fucking the pillow, Garnt? </garnt>
<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<connor> - I like when the pillow fights back. </connor>
<connor> - Garnt's like suffocating Sydney. </connor>
<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<joey> - I like it when the pillow's hard to get. </joey>
<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<joey> - I think the pillow needs a little bit of firmness. </joey>
<joey> - I like it when the pillow's a tsundere, you know? </joey>
<garnt> - If you sink in too much, then-- </garnt>
<connor> - I do like being able to, </connor>
<connor> if I'm kind of just not happy with the pillow, </connor>
<joey> I can just like. </joey>
<joey> (Connor pants) </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Punch the shit of it. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, literally. </joey>
<connor> Until you're like, all right, it is refreshed. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, 'cause sometimes, </garnt>
<connor> you just gotta fucking tenderize the pillow, right? </connor>
<connor> Fucking get the fucking steak tenderized. </connor>
<garnt> You want to go like-- </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt grunts) </garnt>
<garnt> All right. Now it's puff. </garnt>
<connor> I used to... </connor>
<connor> I used to use two pillows exclusively, </connor>
<connor> but now for some reason I can't use two. </connor>
<connor> Is that getting old? Is that an old thing? </connor>
<joey> - No, I've actually gone the opposite. </joey>
<joey> I used to be able to just sleep on one pillow, </joey>
<joey> but now I need two. </joey>
<connor> - I can't do two anymore. It has to be one. </connor>
<joey> - Why? - I dunno. </joey>
<joey> Maybe 'cause my, </joey>
<joey> when I was a child, sorry, </joey>
<joey> my mom probably bought the shittest, thinnest pillows. </joey>
<connor> Maybe that was why. </connor>
<connor> So I was like, yeah, I always sleep with two, </connor>
<connor> and I'm like this. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<joey> Yeah, I always sleep with two pillows. </joey>
<joey> - No, I was the opposite. </joey>
<joey> I had the really, really thin pillows, right. </joey>
<joey> And we couldn't afford another pillow. </joey>
<joey> So I was just like, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I think that's why I had two. </joey>
<joey> - I was like, </joey>
<joey> why am I waking up with a headache every morning? </joey>
<connor> Oh, it's because all the blood is rushing to my head </connor>
<connor> from being like this. </connor>
<connor> - Japan has these pillows </connor>
<connor> that you get in hotels and stuff that I hate. </connor>
<joey> - Which ones? </joey>
<joey> - Like double-sided ones, but-- </joey>
<joey> - Double-sided? Aren't all pillows double-sided? </joey>
<joey> - No, no. </joey>
<joey> There's two different types of material on each side. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey and Garnt] Oh! </joey>
<joey> And one of them is literally like solid beanbag. </joey>
<joey> It's like a bean bag that you have to </joey>
<joey> physically move around to-- </joey>
<joey> - It's the sand one, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it's horrible. </joey>
<joey> - I love those ones. - And it's sticking into </joey>
<connor> your neck. </connor>
<joey> No, what? What? </joey>
<joey> - I love, you know, when you're sleeping on a futon, </joey>
<joey> the sand pillows that you get-- </joey>
<connor> - No, I hate those. Give me something soft. </connor>
<joey> - I love those because it, again, it gives me that </joey>
<joey> perfect height where it makes me sleep so well. </joey>
<garnt> - Did you just say sand pillows? </garnt>
<joey> - It feels like sand. </joey>
<garnt> - It's like a beads sand. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh! </connor>
<connor> - It's rock solid, though. </connor>
<joey> - It's like if you packed a bean bag a little, </joey>
<joey> with too much beans. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I stayed in a hotel one time. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, when I left, I was like, </connor>
<joey> fuck that, that fucking sand. It was horrible. </joey>
<joey> Oh, you could've just flipped it. I'm like, what? </joey>
<joey> - I didn't know that. </joey>
<joey> - Most of them are two-sided. </joey>
<connor> So the other side will be a normal pillow. </connor>
<joey> - Oh. I always just like go to the hotel, </joey>
<joey> just touch the sand side. I'm like, I'm satisfied. </joey>
<connor> I'll take that. - I hate the sand. </connor>
<connor> - Maybe 'cause I used to sleep with those </connor>
<joey> at my grandma's place. 'Cause that's all she had. </joey>
<connor> - It just makes me feel like I'm in a hospital. </connor>
<connor> I don't know why. </connor>
<joey> - Hospital? But the hospitals have super pillows </joey>
<joey> that kind of go around you like this. </joey>
<connor> You sink in and it's just like-- </connor>
<joey> - I don't know. </joey>
<joey> I don't think, </joey>
<connor> I've never stayed in a hospital. </connor>
<garnt> - You've never stayed in a hospital? </garnt>
<garnt> - No. </garnt>
<garnt> - I've stayed in a hospital once. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm trying to remember if I have. I definitely have. </garnt>
<connor> It's just, it's not a common occurrence obviously. </connor>
<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<connor> Maybe I have some time in my childhood. </connor>
<joey> - Just taking a weekly trip to the hospital, just, casual. </joey>
<connor> - It's a free hotel in the UK if you get injured. </connor>
<joey> - Have you ever injured your-- </joey>
<joey> have you ever been to the hospital, </joey>
<joey> with an injury and stuff like that? </joey>
<joey> Have we ever talked about that? </joey>
<joey> Like you've injured yourself so bad </joey>
<garnt> that you had to go to the hospital. </garnt>
<garnt> - No. </garnt>
<joey> - Like breaking a bone or anything. </joey>
<joey> - I've never had any bad injuries, I don't think. </joey>
<garnt> - No. You? </garnt>
<joey> I had once. I have stitches. </joey>
<joey> You can still kind of see it right there on my finger. </joey>
<joey> That was the only time. </joey>
<garnt> 'Cause I fell when I was two years old </garnt>
<garnt> and I landed kind of like my hands like that, </garnt>
<connor> and a piece of glass just went straight into there. </connor>
<connor> So they had to pull it out and give me stitches. </connor>
<connor> But that's about it, really. </connor>
<connor> - Damn, that was a boring-- - Yeah, that was boring. </connor>
<connor> - I was hoping you guys would have </connor>
<connor> hurt yourselves, you know? </connor>
<joey> - Connor's like, the time I fucking crashed a car. </joey>
<garnt> - I was like, guys, broken bone? Please, please? </garnt>
<garnt> - Guys, any injuries? </garnt>
<garnt> - Are we that boring, that we haven't injured ourselves? </garnt>
<garnt> - I have strong bones, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know what you're talking about. </garnt>
<connor> - I drink my milk, bro. </connor>
<joey> - I've had some pretty bad injuries. </joey>
<connor> But for some reason I just never had, </connor>
<connor> never been like, </connor>
<joey> I've always been like, walk it off, walk it off. </joey>
<joey> - It's just your arm falling off-- </joey>
<garnt> - I probably have broken my toe or something </garnt>
<connor> and just not known about it. </connor>
<connor> - That's pretty common, though. </connor>
<garnt> - I feel like it's pretty common. </garnt>
<garnt> - I've sprained my wrist. Did that. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's like the most boring injury of all time. </garnt>
<garnt> "Sprained my wrist, uh, yeah." </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. It was from like, </garnt>
<garnt> I think I told the story when I, </garnt>
<joey> I failed a jump skiing or snowboarding, right. </joey>
<joey> And that was fucking horrible. </joey>
<joey> I thought I was gonna die, but I was like, </joey>
<joey> I'll snowboard it off. I'll snowboard it off. </joey>
<joey> I just kept snowboarding, and I was winded as fuck. </joey>
<joey> - That's how you know we're inside kids, </joey>
<joey> when we haven't broken any bones or anything. </joey>
<garnt> - What are you expecting, Joey? </garnt>
<joey> - I don't know, man! </joey>
<connor> - We're fucking anime nerds and gamers. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I don't know. </garnt>
<connor> - I've been very lucky. </connor>
<joey> - Wanking yourself so hard </joey>
<joey> you dislocate your wrist or something, I don't know. </joey>
<connor> - I think about all the injuries I've had </connor>
<connor> and how I've just never had any damage from it. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, that's very lucky. </connor>
<connor> Tipped a quad bike, when I was like ten, on myself. </connor>
<connor> - And you didn't go to the hospital? </connor>
<garnt> - I wasn't injured at all. </garnt>
<garnt> - Tipped a quad bike on yourself. How'd you do that? </garnt>
<connor> - Well, I tipped a quad bike. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause you know, my mate owned a farm </connor>
<joey> and I loved going to his house </joey>
<joey> 'cause it was just basically like a free theme park. </joey>
<joey> Farms are great when you're ten, cause it's like-- </joey>
<joey> - Especially with a quad bike. </joey>
<joey> - He had a quad bike! </joey>
<joey> And his dad didn't give a shit. </joey>
<joey> He was just like, "You can just go on the quad bike." </joey>
<joey> So he just let us go on the quad bike. </joey>
<joey> And I was like one of those fucking danger addicts </joey>
<joey> when I was a 10 year old. </joey>
<joey> I just wanted to do dangerous things. </joey>
<joey> So my friend, he was used to going on the quad bike, </joey>
<connor> and he was just like, </connor>
<connor> "Yeah, it's all right. Just don't go too fast." </connor>
<connor> And I was like, all right. </connor>
<connor> Immediately went too fast. </connor>
<connor> I was just turning really, really fast. </connor>
<connor> And when I was going so fast, the bike just went like, oh. </connor>
<connor> It just flipped over, did like a barrel roll. </connor>
<joey> So, it tipped, but I think I was small enough where, </joey>
<joey> I don't know how it happened, </joey>
<joey> but it tipped, I didn't get hurt at all. </joey>
<joey> And I just got up, and the bar was a little fucked </joey>
<connor> on the thing, but we hit it into place and it was good. </connor>
<connor> And then I went back on it. </connor>
<joey> - You went back on it? - Yeah! </joey>
<joey> - I would not fucking go back on it if I flipped. </joey>
<joey> - I was like, yeah, dude, that was so fun. </joey>
<joey> Let's do it again! </joey>
<joey> - "Almost died, let's do it again!" </joey>
<garnt> - Have you guys had any near-death experiences before? </garnt>
<connor> - I've told the story about how I </connor>
<connor> got launched with a bounce castle, right? </connor>
<garnt> - Yes, yes, yes. - Oh, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - That was probably level one as well. </connor>
<connor> - I remember telling you this a few days ago, </connor>
<connor> but I think the nearest death experience I had was </connor>
<connor> probably the most lamest story I could tell, </connor>
<garnt> but it was during a snowball fight, right? </garnt>
<garnt> So, in university in England, we don't get a lot of snow. </garnt>
<connor> We get snow once or twice a year, right? </connor>
<connor> And so anytime it snows, </connor>
<connor> everyone takes the opportunity to play around in the snow. </connor>
<connor> And in university, what that means is </connor>
<joey> we just go out and have a bunch of snowball fights, right? </joey>
<joey> So it was one dorm versus another dorm. </joey>
<joey> And we were having a snowball fight </joey>
<joey> in the middle of this residential area in Bristol, right? </joey>
<joey> So it wasn't in the middle of a field or something, </joey>
<joey> it was literally on the roads and the pavements. </joey>
<joey> And I remember we were just throwing snowballs and </joey>
<joey> one fucker, right, </joey>
<joey> you know, you have the snowballs and some, </joey>
<joey> the common courtesy is you make the powder snowballs. </joey>
<joey> And you throw those. - Yes, of course, of course. </joey>
<joey> Of course. </joey>
<joey> - One fucker decided to make an ice ball. </joey>
<connor> You know what I mean. </connor>
<connor> The ones where it's like melted ice </connor>
<connor> and you fucking pack it in and-- </connor>
<joey> - On the side of the road. </joey>
<garnt> - On the side of the road where you just like-- </garnt>
<garnt> - At least he didn't put a stone in it. </garnt>
<garnt> People used to do that in my school. </garnt>
<garnt> - Seriously? - I had that as well. </garnt>
<joey> - I feel like ice balls are even worse </joey>
<joey> because you get the hardness of the ice </joey>
<garnt> and the coldness as well, which is numbing as well. </garnt>
<joey> - It's basically just getting a cold rock thrown at you. </joey>
<garnt> - So I was standing right by the side of the road </garnt>
<garnt> and I see the snowball coming </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm just like, it's a snowball, whatever. </garnt>
<garnt> Hits my fucking balls. </garnt>
<garnt> And then I realize, number one, </garnt>
<garnt> that is perfect aim because it literally hit my balls. </garnt>
<garnt> Number two, that is not a snowball I just felt. </garnt>
<garnt> That is a solid ice ball that just came full force, </garnt>
<garnt> right to my fucking balls. </garnt>
<joey> - I have a really similar story, but except total opposite. </joey>
<garnt> It was at the beach. </garnt>
<garnt> And my dad and I were at the beach, </garnt>
<joey> I think I was like maybe 11, 12 years old. </joey>
<joey> And my dad and I were kicking the rugby ball around. </joey>
<joey> One thing I really liked was trying to catch </joey>
<joey> the ball that gets kicked really high up, </joey>
<joey> and then you kind of get under it and grab it like that. </joey>
<joey> So we were doing that a couple of times. </joey>
<joey> I was practicing that. </joey>
<joey> And one time my dad just kicks it really fucking high up. </joey>
<joey> And I was like, all right, I got it. </joey>
<joey> Sun's in my eyes, but I got it. I think I got this. </joey>
<joey> And it comes down, </joey>
<joey> it misses my arm, </joey>
<joey> and it just perfectly flicks my knob. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<garnt> - It just flicks it. </garnt>
<garnt> That's worse! </garnt>
<garnt> - It didn't even land on my balls. It just flicked it. </garnt>
<garnt> It just went, "pow," like that on my knob. </garnt>
<garnt> And I just collapsed. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause if you're not a guy, if you're not a male, </garnt>
<joey> it's really hard to describe the pain you feel </joey>
<joey> when your knob gets flicked or some, </joey>
<garnt> you feel an impact on it. </garnt>
<joey> - It's not your dick or balls that hurt. </joey>
<garnt> It's above it that hurts. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's just the entire area. </garnt>
<connor> - It's the flick. The flick hurts the most for some reason. </connor>
<connor> - And so obviously this happened to me </connor>
<joey> and I was in total agony, right. </joey>
<joey> Because your mind just goes blank. </joey>
<joey> So I start walking forward and I didn't realize I was </joey>
<joey> walking right into the middle of the road, right. </joey>
<joey> - Jesus Christ! </joey>
<garnt> - Because I was just like, </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt groans) </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> And then the last thing I remember is my mate go, </garnt>
<garnt> "Garnt, what the fuck?" </garnt>
<garnt> And he grabs my bag and pulls me back, right. </garnt>
<joey> He full on pulls me back </joey>
<joey> and then I just see this fucking bus just going </joey>
<joey> (Garnt imitates bus screeching) </joey>
<joey> right in front of me. </joey>
<garnt> And yeah, that was the closest I've come to dying, I think. </garnt>
<garnt> - Imagine dying while grabbing your balls. </garnt>
<joey> - I think you actually just missed out </joey>
<connor> on your own Isekai story. </connor>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<garnt> - That was your chance. That was your one chance. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, that was literally an Isekai origin story. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, I got an ice ball in my balls. </garnt>
<joey> - Now I wanna watch an Isekai story </joey>
<garnt> that literally starts out like that, </garnt>
<garnt> where the protagonist gets smashed in the balls, </garnt>
<connor> and then gets transported to another world. </connor>
<connor> - Jesus Christ, that's scary. </connor>
<connor> I don't know if I've had any near-death experiences. </connor>
<joey> I had a really stupid accident one time. </joey>
<joey> We had one of those big trampolines, </joey>
<joey> like the... </joey>
<joey> the big ones. </joey>
<joey> There's two sizes, right? </joey>
<joey> The small and then there's a big one. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey And Garnt] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> Had one of those. </joey>
<joey> And I loved doing front flips, back flips, </joey>
<joey> all the works on it. </joey>
<joey> You name it, I jumped it, right. </joey>
<joey> - I jumped it. I flipped it. </joey>
<joey> - And one time, I was like, </joey>
<joey> I'm just gonna do it on my knees. </joey>
<joey> I was practicing doing tricks on my knees. </joey>
<joey> And one time I just did something, landed on my knees. </joey>
<joey> And instead of me jumping back, my back just went like, </joey>
<connor> while I was still on my knees, so my back just-- </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Oh, Jesus. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, </connor>
<connor> I've never had this pain in my life. </connor>
<connor> I wanted to throw up immediately, </connor>
<connor> and I couldn't move. </connor>
<joey> - Probably just winded yourself, right? </joey>
<connor> - I don't know what I did, but it was fucking horrible. </connor>
<connor> Scared the shit out of me. </connor>
<connor> I was so winded and it was horrible. </connor>
<joey> It was so horrible. </joey>
<joey> I was like twelve and I was like, what's happening? </joey>
<connor> Why do I wanna throw up? Oh God. </connor>
<connor> - That must've been scary for people watching you </connor>
<joey> where you, literally your back just goes-- </joey>
<connor> - No one was there. It was just me. </connor>
<joey> - Damn. You could've died </joey>
<garnt> on that trampoline. - Where was this trampoline? </garnt>
<joey> - It was at my house. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, you had a trampoline at your house? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - Your parents are like, "He's probably </joey>
<joey> having fun on the trampoline." </joey>
<joey> Meanwhile, he's like, </joey>
<joey> (Joey moans) </joey>
<connor> "Help!" </connor>
<connor> - Having a trampoline at your house was great </connor>
<connor> when your friends came over, </connor>
<connor> 'cause you can just fucking fight on it. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, we didn't have a backyard </joey>
<joey> big enough for a trampoline. </joey>
<joey> - I didn't have that much space. </joey>
<joey> - Our backyard's pretty big. </joey>
<connor> - Well, you're a country boy, aren't you? </connor>
<connor> - Well, it's Wales. </connor>
<connor> (all chatter) </connor>
<garnt> Most people have a pretty decent sized backyard. </garnt>
<joey> It was really good though. I mean, yeah, it's great. </joey>
<joey> We'd just fight on it and stuff. </joey>
<joey> - As you do. </joey>
<joey> - So in other news, Japan is back on lockdown. </joey>
<garnt> - No way! </garnt>
<joey> - Well, you know what, we had a pleasant two weeks. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, we had two weeks out of lockdown. </connor>
<joey> - What blows my mind is that they cancel spectators now </joey>
<joey> for the Olympics. </joey>
<connor> It's starting this month, right? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, in a couple weeks. </joey>
<joey> - What the fuck? </joey>
<joey> - Actually, by the time this is up, </joey>
<joey> it's probably already started. </joey>
<connor> - It's insane to me that they canceled it this, </connor>
<joey> the spectators this late when, you know-- </joey>
<joey> - But the athletes are still allowed in, right? </joey>
<joey> - I mean, I get that. </joey>
<joey> But as if they didn't know how bad the situation was, </joey>
<joey> it's like, "Whoa, shit, </joey>
<joey> it didn't get better suddenly? What the fuck?" </joey>
<joey> To me, it's insane that, </joey>
<joey> you know, it's also just irresponsible as well </joey>
<joey> because there's probably people who booked hotels, you know? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause even in Japan, right, </joey>
<joey> you can come from Hokkaido, wherever the fuck you are, </joey>
<joey> you can come and watch. </joey>
<joey> Poor people probably booked time off work, maybe, </joey>
<connor> probably booked some hotels. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, they use their limited pay leave. </joey>
<joey> - It's like the Cyberpunk release, </joey>
<joey> but just on a scale ten times that, you know. </joey>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> - If somebody booked time off work in Japan, </connor>
<garnt> they ain't playing around. </garnt>
<connor> That doesn't happen. </connor>
<connor> - The Japanese government just puts out a tweet, </connor>
<connor> which is just the fucking-- </connor>
<connor> - The yellow-- </connor>
<joey> - TwitLonger thing. </joey>
<connor> - We have delayed the Olympics again. </connor>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> - We have canceled spectators. We apologize. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, it's just, yeah, </joey>
<joey> unfortunately you're not, </joey>
<joey> we're going to have to wait even longer </joey>
<garnt> for the new Figure episode because we're still </garnt>
<garnt> under a new lockdown and it just feels like this entire year </garnt>
<garnt> has just been a lockdown. </garnt>
<garnt> But not really, for us. </garnt>
<garnt> It feels like now that the rest of the world </garnt>
<garnt> is kind of getting back to normal, </garnt>
<garnt> it's really weird seeing timelines </garnt>
<garnt> where people are having parties </garnt>
<garnt> and going out without masks and stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm just here like, yeah, this is just life. </garnt>
<garnt> - This is life, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - This is just life now for us, right. </connor>
<connor> - It's weird, 'cause it's like, </connor>
<connor> I know we spoke about this a lot before, </connor>
<connor> but it's because it's such an ongoing thing </connor>
<connor> and it changes throughout the time. </connor>
<connor> It's like, all right, restaurants open. </connor>
<joey> All right, okay, cool. </joey>
<joey> But now they close at 8:00. All right, okay. </joey>
<joey> But now they can serve alcohol. </joey>
<joey> Okay, but now they can't. </joey>
<joey> It's like, wait, what's going on. </joey>
<joey> What the fuck is going on? </joey>
<joey> It's just, I'm so confused. </joey>
<joey> - The limit is three. No, the limit is six. </joey>
<joey> The limit is four? </joey>
<joey> - And then it's like, all right. </joey>
<connor> And then Google Maps is completely unreliable now </connor>
<joey> because now all the opening and closing times </joey>
<joey> are a fucking lie. </joey>
<joey> It's totally dependent on the place </joey>
<joey> and whether they're doing it, and </joey>
<joey> most of the time, they're not the ones </joey>
<joey> updating their Google page. </joey>
<connor> So you don't even know if shit's open or not. </connor>
<joey> - The only thing that has stayed consistent </joey>
<joey> throughout this entire thing is comedy. </joey>
<joey> It's literally the only thing that stayed consistent. </joey>
<joey> - Pretty much. I mean, you want to go to a new place now, </joey>
<joey> you check out on Google Maps. </joey>
<joey> Oh, they're open. </joey>
<joey> You turn up at the door and they're not open. </joey>
<joey> And then you try to find another place </joey>
<joey> and it's just kind of like playing a roulette wheel </joey>
<joey> of just seeing what you can do. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause it's, </joey>
<joey> lockdown here has been really weird. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause we say lockdown, but it's just like, </joey>
<joey> you can still go out and work. </joey>
<joey> You just can't really do anything else but that. </joey>
<connor> I mean, the trains are still fucking packed as shit. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah. If you get an eight o'clock train, still, </connor>
<garnt> you know, you're fucked. </garnt>
<joey> You still get squeezed in. </joey>
<joey> There will be people pushing you in, still, </joey>
<joey> during all of this. </joey>
<joey> And that's why a lot of the experts say it's so worrying </joey>
<joey> in Tokyo because the density is insane. </joey>
<garnt> You can't just social distance anywhere </garnt>
<joey> in this fucking town. </joey>
<joey> And yeah, did you see that thing with the </joey>
<joey> Tokyo hotel or something, </joey>
<garnt> where it was like, </garnt>
<connor> the foreigners have to get a different elevator </connor>
<connor> from the Japanese one? - Yeah, yeah, I saw that. </connor>
<garnt> I saw that. </garnt>
<joey> - Classic Japanese xenophobia. </joey>
<joey> (Joey cheers) </joey>
<connor> - I heard that it was a misunderstanding. </connor>
<joey> I don't know if this is true. </joey>
<joey> - That's what they always fucking say. </joey>
<joey> - I heard this was a misunderstanding of, </joey>
<joey> it was supposed to be for people </joey>
<connor> who came from a foreign country. </connor>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<connor> Even though, realistically, right now, </connor>
<joey> you're probably safer if you've come from a foreign country. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. I think that was a lot of the, </connor>
<connor> even though </connor>
<connor> some people were trying to defend it, being like, </connor>
<connor> "No, no, they meant people who just came in from America," </connor>
<joey> or whatever, you know? </joey>
<joey> But a lot of people arguing. </joey>
<joey> Well, Japan has not handled this very well. </joey>
<joey> I don't think they're in the place to be able to, you know. </joey>
<joey> - I don't even think, what is it, </joey>
<joey> like less than 10% of the population's </joey>
<connor> got the vaccine, right? </connor>
<connor> - It's probably higher now by the time this comes out. </connor>
<connor> - But I mean, still, </connor>
<joey> it's nowhere near where it should be, </joey>
<joey> considering the Olympics is fucking starting. </joey>
<connor> - To me it just seems like, </connor>
<connor> why not just socially distance, in general, in the elevator? </connor>
<connor> Why not just let two people go in at a time </connor>
<connor> on the opposite end? </connor>
<connor> Why'd have to make it, </connor>
<connor> like the distinction? </connor>
<connor> Yeah, I dunno. </connor>
<joey> - I mean they could be-- </joey>
<connor> That's too logical. </connor>
<joey> That's too logical for the Japanese-- </joey>
<joey> - Japan is just a little, </joey>
<connor> you know the thing that sucks about Japan </connor>
<connor> is that they're just a little too quick </connor>
<joey> on the decision to make it harsh on foreigners. </joey>
<joey> They're a little too comfortable with making those rules. </joey>
<joey> - They're always-- - They're like a little too-- </joey>
<joey> (Connor laughs) </joey>
<connor> - It's like, "Is something wrong? </connor>
<joey> It's the foreigners!" </joey>
<connor> - They're just a little, </connor>
<connor> it's just the speed at which they'll be like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, maybe we should just maybe discriminate a little bit." </connor>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<joey> - I'm feeling a little discriminatory today. </joey>
<garnt> - It's like that image of that guy </garnt>
<garnt> who falls off the bicycle. </garnt>
<connor> And it's just like, "Oh, it's the foreigners!" </connor>
<connor> - Damn foreigners! </connor>
<garnt> - You know, the one time, you know, they, </garnt>
<garnt> people do try and justify it and all that. </garnt>
<connor> But it's just the ease at which sometimes Japan does it, </connor>
<joey> which bothers me the most. </joey>
<joey> Like we had that thing from the, </joey>
<joey> I think we did talk about it on the podcast, </joey>
<joey> the Ibaraki Prefecture. </joey>
<joey> - I don't think we have talked about that. </joey>
<joey> - The Ibaraki Prefecture gave a warning out </joey>
<joey> for people not to interact with foreigners. </joey>
<joey> - That's right, yeah, I remember. </joey>
<joey> - That was one of their warnings. </joey>
<joey> "Don't interact with any foreigners." </joey>
<joey> I think, again, people defended, </joey>
<joey> some people defended it being like, </joey>
<joey> well they don't mean people from a foreign country, </joey>
<joey> but there's no way for Japanese people to be able to </joey>
<joey> distinguish between </joey>
<joey> a person who came from a foreign country recently. </joey>
<joey> It was very obvious what they were trying to say, </joey>
<joey> which was just stay away from foreigners. </joey>
<joey> You know, which, </joey>
<connor> it's a massive yikes. </connor>
<garnt> - If this happened in literally any other country, </garnt>
<garnt> they'd just be called out for it, right? </garnt>
<garnt> By everyone. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, luckily though, in a sense, </joey>
<garnt> at least what I've seen on social media, </garnt>
<garnt> they have been called out. </garnt>
<joey> That's why they're so quick to retract and being like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh no, it was a misunderstanding." </joey>
<connor> - It was retracted very fast. </connor>
<joey> And I mean, you can imagine why. </joey>
<joey> It's supposed to be very, it's an-- </joey>
<joey> The hotel is quite a, </joey>
<joey> what's it, </joey>
<joey> notable hotel. </joey>
<joey> - It's a big franchise. </joey>
<connor> - It's generally an expensive chain. </connor>
<garnt> - Is it an expensive chain? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, the Tokyo hotel is a very, </connor>
<connor> quite pricey. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh, I thought it was just this really-- </garnt>
<garnt> - It's a premium hotel. </garnt>
<connor> And you know, normally for rich tourists. </connor>
<joey> - It's like if the Hilton was like, "No Asians." </joey>
<joey> It's that level. </joey>
<connor> - It's, you know, </connor>
<joey> it's just sad. </joey>
<joey> Very sad. </joey>
<joey> I forgot what, </joey>
<joey> I was going to say something. </joey>
<joey> I had a really good point, but I fucking forgot. </joey>
<joey> I'm dumb. - Must have been a good point. </joey>
<garnt> - It was such a riveting point, </garnt>
<connor> but oh well, lost to time. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, it's just like, it's, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> obviously we're grateful to be here, </garnt>
<garnt> but it's just, it's weird that we, </garnt>
<joey> it's not exactly that we feel discriminated against, </joey>
<joey> obviously. </joey>
<joey> It's just sometimes there's just a lot of little things </joey>
<joey> that we see and we feel, </joey>
<joey> and obviously hearing news like this, </joey>
<garnt> it kind of adds to that, little by little. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I mean, when I speak to someone my age, </connor>
<connor> I've never ever felt that in Japan at all. </connor>
<connor> I just feel that the government in, </connor>
<garnt> almost in every country, </garnt>
<garnt> it's just older people kind of out of touch. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, I feel that's the real problem here. </joey>
<garnt> - I feel it's especially prevalent in Japan </garnt>
<joey> because, again, the older population is, the majority. </joey>
<connor> - If it is, that's totally fine </connor>
<joey> because that's what the voters want. </joey>
<garnt> - Literally all the voters are old. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, wasn't it like, </joey>
<joey> one of the people on the Olympic committee, </joey>
<joey> just saying that women shouldn't-- </joey>
<joey> - Women shouldn't talk? Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Women shouldn't talk and just stay in the kitchen </connor>
<garnt> or something like that. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was something, </garnt>
<garnt> it was something along the lines of </garnt>
<garnt> women shouldn't be allowed to talk at meetings </garnt>
<garnt> because they talked too long. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh, that was it! </joey>
<connor> - At the Olympic meetings. </connor>
<joey> - And I'm like, that's what dudes in the fifties </joey>
<joey> used to say to their wives. </joey>
<connor> - But that was the ex prime minister of Japan. </connor>
<joey> - Was it? - It was the, </joey>
<connor> he was the prime minister of Japan, as far as I'm aware. </connor>
<connor> Can you Google it just to confirm that? </connor>
<garnt> But as far as I know, it was the ex prime minister of Japan, </garnt>
<garnt> which is just very telling. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm not saying, you know, the UK is much better, </garnt>
<joey> we're fucking awful with that shit. </joey>
<joey> But again, they're very quick to get called out by it. </joey>
<joey> But then people calling out the Japanese government </joey>
<joey> for a lot of the stuff, you know, </joey>
<connor> a lot of the time it is the younger people who are doing it. </connor>
<joey> - The social media generation. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, it was the ex prime minister of Japan. </connor>
<joey> - [Navi] Yoshiro Mori. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, Mori Yoshiro, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - But he's also like, what 91, years old or something? </connor>
<joey> And he's the fucking-- </joey>
<connor> - I'm not being funny, but no one 91 years old </connor>
<connor> should be making countrywide decisions. </connor>
<joey> I think at that point you are just so far out of touch </joey>
<joey> with the country. </joey>
<joey> - Absolutely. </joey>
<garnt> - You can't. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, it's just like, at that point, </garnt>
<garnt> you don't really, I mean, </garnt>
<garnt> you're 91, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Why would you care to change for society? </garnt>
<joey> Because, you know, </joey>
<joey> at that point, you already know who you are. </joey>
<joey> You're not going to put in the effort to change. </joey>
<joey> And it's just, </joey>
<connor> yeah, at that point, </connor>
<connor> you probably shouldn't be running a country, you know. </connor>
<garnt> - I'm like, should it be at 70 something? </garnt>
<garnt> But then, Bernie makes me always think like, </garnt>
<garnt> damn, okay, maybe old people, maybe they know what's up. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, yeah, I completely forgot. </garnt>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> - I guess this is our political, my political-- </joey>
<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<connor> - Shit. </connor>
<garnt> - Fucking too political on the show. </garnt>
<joey> - This is probably the most political </joey>
<garnt> we've ever gotten on the show. </garnt>
<joey> - What, just naming politicians? </joey>
<garnt> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </garnt>
<garnt> He said the name! </garnt>
<connor> - It's one of those things where it's like, I don't know. </connor>
<joey> It's just, </joey>
<connor> they're a little too comfortable with dishing that shit out. </connor>
<joey> - Whenever I hear stories like that, there's </joey>
<joey> a part of me that hears that kind of stuff happening, </joey>
<joey> and just makes me wish that young people in Japan </joey>
<joey> were a little more politically interested. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, they pretty much have no interest </connor>
<joey> or even if they do, they don't talk about it publicly. </joey>
<connor> - No, no. No one talks about it publicly. </connor>
<connor> Barely anyone has any interest. </connor>
<connor> No one believes in the government here. </connor>
<connor> They're just like, </connor>
<connor> "Yeah, whatever. They're just doing their thing. </connor>
<joey> As long as we're not in a war with another country, we good. </joey>
<connor> - The consensus seems to be, </connor>
<connor> from when I've spoke to people, </connor>
<connor> is that they're like, "Oh, I don't care. </connor>
<connor> As long as they don't ruin my life." </connor>
<joey> - There's a lot of young people </joey>
<joey> who don't even know who the prime minister is. </joey>
<joey> - Wow. </joey>
<joey> - It just goes to show they're that out of touch. </joey>
<connor> - But in Japan, you don't get to choose the prime minister. </connor>
<connor> - No. - You choose the party. </connor>
<connor> And then they choose the prime minister. </connor>
<connor> Whereas, you know, </connor>
<garnt> I think that's technically the same in the UK, </garnt>
<garnt> but it's not done like that at all. </garnt>
<garnt> We're promised who the person is when we're voting. </garnt>
<garnt> And that's how it is. </garnt>
<garnt> But in Japan, you vote for the party </garnt>
<connor> and you don't get a say who they pick. </connor>
<joey> - But, again, it's like, I've talked to young people, </joey>
<connor> you know, </connor>
<connor> some same age, a little bit older, a little bit younger. </connor>
<connor> And there's a lot of them who don't even know </connor>
<joey> what the political parties are or what they do. </joey>
<joey> They're just not interested in it whatsoever. </joey>
<joey> And it's like-- </joey>
<connor> - I kind of get the vibe that everyone is just like </connor>
<joey> so overworked. </joey>
<connor> They don't have time to care. </connor>
<joey> - It's the last thing they wanna worry about. </joey>
<garnt> - That's pretty much the vibe I get, is like </garnt>
<joey> everyone's just fucking fighting for their life as it is. </joey>
<joey> Everyone's just trying to get through the day. </joey>
<garnt> They don't have time to care about other issues, </garnt>
<garnt> a lot of the time. </garnt>
<joey> - I remember when they raised the GST from 8% to 10% </joey>
<connor> and there was all these mobs. </connor>
<connor> - I saw that. </connor>
<connor> - All these mobs of all these old people being like, </connor>
<connor> "How fucking dare you?" </connor>
<connor> Meanwhile, the young people are like, </connor>
<connor> "Understandable, have a nice day, I'll just work harder." </connor>
<connor> It's like, they just don't care. </connor>
<joey> It's like, "Oh, they made a new law? </joey>
<joey> Sick. I guess I'm just gonna have to </joey>
<joey> mold my life around this new law, now. </joey>
<connor> - Speaking of dumb Japanese laws, </connor>
<joey> you can be arrested in Japan if you mod games, </joey>
<joey> like save files. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that sounds about right. </joey>
<garnt> - Can you actually? </garnt>
<connor> - A guy in-- </connor>
<garnt> - The Skyrim community are sweating right now. </garnt>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </connor>
<joey> - A guy in Nagano, I think, </joey>
<joey> was arrested and fined 65,000 pounds, </joey>
<connor> about $100K in dollars, </connor>
<connor> for selling Breath of the Wild save files that were modded. </connor>
<connor> - Seriously? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, no joke. </connor>
<connor> And apparently, like I've read about it. </connor>
<connor> Apparently, one of the main reasons why this law was passed </connor>
<garnt> was because, </garnt>
<garnt> guess which company pushed for it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Nintendo. - Yeah! </garnt>
<garnt> - Of course they did. </garnt>
<joey> - But obviously they tried, </joey>
<joey> obviously that shit just, </joey>
<joey> America's like, "LMAO, no." </joey>
<joey> They're not passing that law in America </joey>
<joey> because you have the right to do whatever you want </joey>
<joey> with the products you buy. </joey>
<connor> But yeah, Nintendo somehow managed to push for a law. </connor>
<joey> - To be fair, I think the selling part was the problem. </joey>
<connor> If you just put it online-- </connor>
<connor> - But it's also illegal to even mod a Switch in Japan. </connor>
<connor> You can't mod a Switch in Japan. </connor>
<garnt> - But I think it was extra bad for the dude </garnt>
<joey> because he sold it for money. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, isn't it technically illegal </joey>
<garnt> everywhere to mod a Switch? </garnt>
<connor> - No, no, no. </connor>
<garnt> So, in the U.S., </garnt>
<garnt> it's counted as you bought a product, </garnt>
<garnt> and you're allowed to do whatever you want </garnt>
<garnt> with that product. </garnt>
<connor> You can do whatever you want. </connor>
<garnt> - So what's the illegal part, then? </garnt>
<garnt> Buying the games, getting the games? </garnt>
<connor> - Apparently. </connor>
<connor> So I think the way they've managed to pass the law is that </connor>
<connor> it's still an ongoing thing, like a service. </connor>
<connor> You don't actually own the game. </connor>
<connor> You own a copy of the game. </connor>
<connor> And by changing it, you're ruining or infringing-- </connor>
<joey> - If you buy a Nintendo product, Nintendo owns you. </joey>
<joey> There is no escape. </joey>
<joey> - Didn't Apple try-- </joey>
<connor> I don't know if it's illegal, again, </connor>
<joey> can you check it if it's illegal to jailbreak your phone? </joey>
<joey> I can't remember. </joey>
<joey> I'm pretty sure it's not-- </joey>
<joey> - I think it is illegal. - I think it is. </joey>
<garnt> - In every country? </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know. Is it, or does it just break warranty? </garnt>
<connor> - I thought it just broke warranty in the UK. </connor>
<connor> I can't remember though. </connor>
<joey> - [Man] It definitely at least breaks warranty. </joey>
<garnt> - I know that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Everyone knows that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Generally, you're allowed to do what the fuck you want </garnt>
<connor> with the stuff you own. </connor>
<joey> - I've never hard of anyone getting arrested </joey>
<joey> for jailbreaking their phone. </joey>
<connor> - Just the idea of a raid going on into some guy's house. </connor>
<joey> Like, "Get down! Stop! Drop the Legend of Zelda copies! </joey>
<joey> Put them on the floor!" </joey>
<joey> You know, in Japan, </joey>
<joey> The thing is in Japan, right-- </joey>
<joey> - Boys walk up with hazmat suits. </joey>
<joey> - When they arrest people in Japan, </joey>
<joey> they don't arrest you with two people. </joey>
<connor> They send like twenty fucking police officers, in Japan, </connor>
<connor> when they arrest you. </connor>
<garnt> - The send the boys down, man. </garnt>
<garnt> They got the whole squad coming. </garnt>
<joey> - [Navi] Overall, it's breaking your iPhone's warranty. </joey>
<joey> The legality, I think it differs between the country. </joey>
<joey> But in terms of Apple, it's like, you don't get-- </joey>
<connor> - No, no, no, yeah. </connor>
<connor> They're not gonna fucking sue you for doing it. </connor>
<joey> - [Navi] So, it's just your warranty's gone. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, that's understandable. </joey>
<joey> - Most products do that. </joey>
<joey> Like, "Hey, if you change this thing, </joey>
<garnt> we're not gonna fix it for you." </garnt>
<garnt> - If you break the seal that says, </garnt>
<garnt> "Breaking the seal breaks the warranty," </garnt>
<garnt> then generally, that breaks the warranty, right? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, but then I feel, you know, </joey>
<joey> you also have to understand that Japan </joey>
<joey> is falling a little bit short on most common sense laws, </joey>
<joey> like Fair Use, for example. </joey>
<joey> - Fair Use just isn't a thing here, </joey>
<connor> as we've found out many times. </connor>
<connor> - Just seeing all these videos of Nintendo fans </connor>
<joey> pleading with Nintendo to change their mind. </joey>
<joey> And then, after living here, I'm like, dude, it's-- </joey>
<joey> - It's not gonna happen. </joey>
<joey> - That's not how it rolls. </joey>
<joey> It's like, us pleading with Nintendo </joey>
<joey> is not gonna fucking do anything unless you're-- </joey>
<joey> - We should start a Kickstarter </joey>
<joey> to get them to change the laws! </joey>
<joey> - Unless you are fully 100% Japanese and in that </joey>
<garnt> boardroom meeting with them, isn't going to matter. </garnt>
<joey> - Unless you're Shigeru Miyamoto, it's not gonna change. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, definitely coming to live here </joey>
<joey> and seeing how it works on the inside, </joey>
<garnt> I'm just like, yeah, it's a lot of, </garnt>
<garnt> no matter how much noise gets made on Twitter, </garnt>
<garnt> I think most of the time it's going to fall on deaf ears. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, so the way that I've come to realize, </connor>
<connor> at least from living here, </connor>
<connor> you can say anything you want over an email. </connor>
<connor> You can explain everything as well as you want </connor>
<connor> through a different person. </connor>
<connor> But unless there is a Japanese guy there in the room </connor>
<connor> at the board meeting, </connor>
<connor> explaining something directly to the person, </connor>
<connor> it will not get changed. </connor>
<garnt> - You can't have a Zoom call, you can't send an email, </garnt>
<garnt> you can't send an angry tweet. </garnt>
<garnt> You know, you could fucking ratio the shit out of Nintendo, </garnt>
<garnt> they'll be like, "I don't give a shit." </garnt>
<garnt> You need to have someone there explaining to the person, </garnt>
<garnt> in person, speaking fluent Japanese, </garnt>
<garnt> and possibly having a Japanese passport, </garnt>
<garnt> before they take anything seriously. </garnt>
<joey> - Even then it's like, "Oh, so what company do you work for? </joey>
<joey> Who are your backers? Who are you representing?" </joey>
<connor> - I've worked at places where I've wanted to shoot there, </connor>
<connor> And I've had a friend tell them, who wasn't Japanese, </connor>
<joey> "Hey, can we shoot there? And they're like, </joey>
<joey> "No, I don't know about it." </joey>
<joey> But then you have a Japanese person do the exact same thing, </joey>
<joey> like if Kaho hits them up and is like, </joey>
<joey> "Hey, this is what we're doing." </joey>
<joey> And they're like, "Oh, okay, sure." </joey>
<joey> It's like, what? </joey>
<connor> It's just they don't believe you. </connor>
<joey> They think you're lying 'cause you're not Japanese. </joey>
<connor> Like you don't understand. You don't understand how I think. </connor>
<joey> - These sneaky foreigners trying to get around our ways. </joey>
<connor> - It's bizarre. It's really strange. </connor>
<connor> But that's just the way that it's, </connor>
<connor> businesses is done here. </connor>
<joey> And it's, you know, </joey>
<joey> it makes so much sense now why these companies do this </joey>
<joey> fucking stupid shit. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, oh, I totally get it now. </joey>
<joey> - And I'm kind of like sitting in that halfway point, right? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause if I don't open my mouth, they'll be like </joey>
<joey> "This fucking foreigner tryna get around me." </joey>
<garnt> The moment I open my mouth, they're like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh, you're Nihongo? Nihongo Jouzu? </garnt>
<garnt> All right, let's do it, boys." </garnt>
<garnt> - All right, let's do business, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Exactly. I rock up, let's do business. </garnt>
<joey> "No, you're a foreigner." </joey>
<joey> JK, I am Nihongo Jouzu actually. </joey>
<joey> And they're like, "All right, I'm sorry. </joey>
<garnt> All right. Let's do some business." </garnt>
<joey> I'm like, it's so fucking embarrassing. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. And I feel like companies in Japan are very, very, </connor>
<connor> what's the word? </connor>
<connor> They very much stick to the hierarchy of decisions. </connor>
<joey> And if you're not </joey>
<joey> the same level, you can't comment. </joey>
<joey> - Are you talking about the pyramid? </joey>
<joey> - The pyramid scheme. </joey>
<joey> - The pyramid scheme. </joey>
<garnt> - Well, if you're not in that meeting, </garnt>
<joey> your opinion doesn't matter no matter who you talk to. </joey>
<garnt> So I feel like when people are like, all right, </garnt>
<garnt> even if like, I don't know, </garnt>
<garnt> because Nintendo has a Nintendo of America. </garnt>
<garnt> I'd love to know how much Nintendo of America </garnt>
<garnt> has a say over what Nintendo, the Japan office, </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like-- </garnt>
<joey> - Probably not a lot. </joey>
<joey> I feel like people would, </joey>
<connor> yeah, I think it's probably not a lot. </connor>
<connor> Just based off like what I've seen from other companies here </connor>
<connor> where you would think that they would have an input, </connor>
<connor> but they don't. </connor>
<joey> - Doug Bowser is like, </joey>
<joey> "So can we change this thing?" </joey>
<joey> And they're like, "But we're in a Zoom call. </joey>
<joey> You're not in the office. So, I don't know about that." </joey>
<joey> - Again, it's all speculation, </joey>
<connor> but I imagine it's, if any, from what I've seen here, </connor>
<connor> it's very difficult to get things done </connor>
<connor> if you're not the same level. </connor>
<garnt> - Basically, the longer I live in Japan, </garnt>
<garnt> the more respect I have for Suzaku in Code Geass. </garnt>
<joey> 'Cause you watch Code Geass </joey>
<joey> and everyone wants to be the Lelouch, right. </joey>
<joey> Everyone wants to be the fucking Lelouch. </joey>
<joey> Bring down the system, fuck the corporations. </joey>
<joey> But then I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> yo, Suzaku's out there working his fucking ass off </joey>
<joey> to change shit, man. </joey>
<joey> He's the real one. He's the real one. </joey>
<connor> - He's climbing that pyramid, boys. </connor>
<garnt> - He's climbing the hierarchy, man. </garnt>
<joey> - If this was IRL, Suzaku would still be a fucking grunt-- </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> He's like, "Well, what do you mean, you're 22? </joey>
<connor> No permission for you." </connor>
<joey> - "Do you have work experience? Then stay the fuck down." </joey>
<garnt> - "Oh, you're an honorary Britannian? </garnt>
<joey> No, no. What the fuck is an honorary Britannian? </joey>
<connor> You're not one of the--" </connor>
<garnt> - Oh, yeah, he wasn't even one of them. </garnt>
<joey> There's no way he could pass. No, no, no. </joey>
<joey> He's the guy who changes the vending machines. </joey>
<connor> Come on, they wouldn't let him. </connor>
<connor> Garnt had to pee, so we're back. </connor>
<connor> What have you been up to, Garnt? How was your pee? </connor>
<connor> - It was great, it was great. </connor>
<connor> I mean, speaking about the rest of the world healing, </connor>
<joey> it's getting to the point now where I kind of meet </joey>
<joey> lots of people that are planning their journeys home. </joey>
<joey> And that includes us as well. </joey>
<joey> Or me and Connor, at least. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, you two are. </joey>
<joey> - You know what I was missing the other day? </joey>
<joey> And I know I must be fucking mental. </joey>
<joey> - What? </joey>
<joey> - I was missing a pub. </joey>
<joey> - What's wrong with that? </joey>
<connor> Pubs are great. </connor>
<connor> - I've talked about how-- </connor>
<joey> - But I mean, Garnt's talked about how he doesn't like pubs. </joey>
<connor> - I've talked about how pubs are-- </connor>
<connor> - But Garnt's a fucking idiot. </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </connor>
<connor> I mean, Garnt thinks the architecture here is great. </connor>
<connor> Garnt is a fake British person. </connor>
<garnt> - Maybe. - Yeah, he's Thai. </garnt>
<connor> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </connor>
<garnt> - I'm an honorary Britannian. </garnt>
<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<joey> - You got him there. </joey>
<joey> - I guess so. </joey>
<connor> - Got em! </connor>
<connor> - Got got. </connor>
<connor> - Came full circle. </connor>
<garnt> - But, yeah, I just had this overwhelming urge </garnt>
<garnt> to go to a fucking Wetherspoons, and I'm just like, </garnt>
<connor> what the fuck is wrong with me? </connor>
<connor> - Every week you should get that urge. </connor>
<garnt> (Joey snorts) </garnt>
<connor> The moment Friday takes over, you're like, </connor>
<connor> "Fuck, I want the Curry Club and a pint." </connor>
<garnt> It's great. You can get like a Curry, </garnt>
<garnt> a whole Curry meal </garnt>
<connor> and a full pint of your alcohol of choice, </connor>
<garnt> like 10 bucks. </garnt>
<garnt> - And then Fridays is fish and chips Fridays as well. </garnt>
<connor> - You know it is! You know it is! </connor>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> - "Now you're speaking my language!" </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I don't know, </joey>
<joey> now that we are in the process of being able </joey>
<joey> to go back to our countries, it's just like, </joey>
<joey> it feels good, and it feels like </joey>
<garnt> I get to kind of look forward to all the things that </garnt>
<garnt> have made me feel kind of homesick, I think. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause I didn't think I would feel too homesick about England </garnt>
<garnt> until I kind of moved out of it </garnt>
<garnt> and couldn't go back for a while. </garnt>
<joey> - I think this lockdown or pandemic has definitely </joey>
<joey> proven to people that like, "Oh, maybe I am homesick." </joey>
<joey> Just give me enough time before you're homesick. </joey>
<connor> - First year, I was like, it's all right, it's not that bad. </connor>
<connor> I was like, oh, okay, I can get used to this. </connor>
<joey> Then now I'm just going insane. </joey>
<joey> Now I'm like, nothing is open, I can't fucking do anything. </joey>
<joey> Can't film any cool videos half the time. </joey>
<garnt> Every single thing is like boring shit. </garnt>
<garnt> And then now I can't, I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> So we're booking a trip home. </garnt>
<joey> I don't even know what the fuck is happening </joey>
<joey> because every country keeps changing its mind </joey>
<joey> on what's happening. </joey>
<joey> So I'm like, wait, do I book the hotel for, </joey>
<joey> how many days is lockdown? </joey>
<joey> When will they get rid of it? </joey>
<joey> Are you? Are you getting rid of it? </joey>
<joey> Tell me if you're getting rid of it. I would like to know. </joey>
<connor> So it's really difficult right now. </connor>
<joey> - Isn't home quarantine an option though? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, in the UK, yeah. </connor>
<joey> You can quarantine in your own home or in a hotel. </joey>
<joey> And then Japan might be doing or is doing-- </joey>
<garnt> - Vaccine passports. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think that's to return to Japan, I think. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, to return to Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> - Which apparently, you could apply from the 26th, </garnt>
<joey> my birthday, woo. </joey>
<joey> - The ultimate birthday present. </joey>
<joey> - Which is when we get our second dose as well. </joey>
<connor> So yeah, I don't know what's happening. </connor>
<joey> I guess I'll figure it out. </joey>
<joey> - What's the first thing you're going to do </joey>
<garnt> when you go back to England? </garnt>
<garnt> - That's what I was going to ask as well. </garnt>
<joey> - Pub? </joey>
<joey> - I am going straight to the fucking pub. </joey>
<connor> - Check into the hotel, I guess? </connor>
<joey> I mean that's the practical answer, right? </joey>
<connor> - But after that. </connor>
<garnt> After you've settled down at the hotel room, </garnt>
<garnt> what's the first thing you want to go to? </garnt>
<connor> Tesco's? </connor>
<connor> - Tesco's meal deal. </connor>
<joey> - Actually, I want a fucking meal deal. </joey>
<joey> They'll probably have one at the airport. </joey>
<joey> So I'll probably get a meal deal at the airport. </joey>
<connor> Tesco's meal deal, banging. </connor>
<connor> Three pound, fuck, dude. </connor>
<connor> Choice of my favorite sandwich fillings. </connor>
<joey> - But if it's the airport, it's probably like seven pound. </joey>
<connor> - I guess it's like four. </connor>
<garnt> - It's just gonna be so weird going to a shop or a Tesco's. </garnt>
<connor> - I genuinely miss airports. </connor>
<garnt> I miss going to an airport. </garnt>
<garnt> - I miss-- </garnt>
<joey> - Just chilling at the airport waiting for my flight. </joey>
<joey> You get to watch so much shit when you're on a flight. </joey>
<joey> I've haven't been able to watch TV in so long, </joey>
<joey> 'cause I haven't been on a flight. </joey>
<joey> You know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> You get so much watching done when you're on a plane. </joey>
<joey> I'm chilling in the lobby, having a coffee. </joey>
<garnt> When you finally you've checked in, </garnt>
<garnt> your bags are in the thing, </garnt>
<garnt> it's actually kind of chill, that hour before your flight. </garnt>
<garnt> - I like the feeling of going on a long haul flight, </garnt>
<connor> just knowing-- </connor>
<joey> 'Cause it kind of like, </joey>
<joey> aside from the long haul part of the flight, </joey>
<joey> I just like the feeling of knowing, </joey>
<joey> it feels like I'm going on a holiday. </joey>
<joey> It feels like I'm going away for a while. </joey>
<joey> And it's, there's something about going to, </joey>
<joey> to the airport of your home country. </joey>
<joey> It just feels like, </joey>
<joey> you know, mum's cooking or something like that. </joey>
<joey> It just feels, I don't know. </joey>
<joey> It just, there's something about it. </joey>
<joey> - I know what you mean, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Because every time I go visit Thailand </joey>
<joey> and I step out and I see the Thai airport, </joey>
<joey> I'm just like, oh, I'm getting all nostalgic </joey>
<connor> and it's just the fucking airport. </connor>
<joey> It smells different. </joey>
<joey> - There's some guy shouting at you. </joey>
<joey> - No, no, no. Every country smells different. </joey>
<joey> And I don't know why it is. </joey>
<joey> - I totally get that. </joey>
<joey> - But I literally step out of the airport, go to the, </joey>
<joey> the Thai airport has this certain smell, </joey>
<joey> Gatwick and Heathrow has this certain smell. </joey>
<joey> And I'm just like, I can't describe what it is, but I just, </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> but it just feels comforting. </joey>
<joey> And I didn't know that airports smell different </joey>
<joey> until you go off the airplane and you're like, </joey>
<joey> damn, I recognize this. </joey>
<joey> - "I recognize this." </joey>
<garnt> - I dunno if this is the talk of a madman right now. </garnt>
<joey> - No, no, I get that whole smell thing. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I don't. </garnt>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<joey> - It's like when certain smells trigger certain memories. </joey>
<connor> - I just feel like it's the breathability of the country, </connor>
<joey> you know, like some-- </joey>
<joey> - That makes less sense. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Because when you land in Japan, </joey>
<joey> depending on which airport you land, the air is stuffy. </joey>
<connor> - When I landed in San Francisco, I was like, </connor>
<connor> "Fuck, this air sucks." </connor>
<connor> I'm breathing it in, I'm like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh my God, the pollution." </connor>
<joey> - You're literally just saying the same thing </joey>
<connor> as what he said but just rephrased. </connor>
<garnt> - No, he said smells. I'm like, pollution level. </garnt>
<garnt> Like Tokyo-- </garnt>
<connor> - How can you tell the pollution levels? </connor>
<connor> - Well, when you breathe in. </connor>
<connor> Can you not breathe the quality of air? You can't tell? </connor>
<joey> - I can, but-- </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, but I can't do it at different fucking airports. </garnt>
<connor> - I can. </connor>
<connor> - What are you, a fucking bloodhound? </connor>
<joey> - When I land in the fucking country, </joey>
<joey> I step off the plane, I take a deep breath, </joey>
<connor> and I'm like, this air's shit. </connor>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </joey>
<connor> - Why is this insane? </connor>
<connor> - He called me the fucking insane one. </connor>
<joey> - You literally breathe the air and you're like, </joey>
<joey> this air is polluted. </joey>
<joey> - It literally sounds like the stupidest superpower. </joey>
<joey> - When I went to-- </joey>
<joey> - I can tell pollution levels in the air I breathe. </joey>
<connor> - LA has horrible air, and San Francisco had-- </connor>
<joey> - Most big cities have horrible air. </joey>
<joey> - Depends. </joey>
<connor> - That's what makes up the city. </connor>
<joey> - I can't tell the air pollution differing from most cities. </joey>
<joey> I mean, for example, </joey>
<garnt> there's a difference between Bangkok and London, </garnt>
<connor> - Tokyo's awful. </connor>
<garnt> Tokyo's air is horrible. </garnt>
<garnt> - Tokyo's fine. It's fine. </garnt>
<garnt> What are you talking about? </garnt>
<garnt> - You don't know 'cause you've been here too long. </garnt>
<garnt> - What are you talking about? </garnt>
<garnt> Tokyo's fine. </garnt>
<connor> - It is not. It tastes like shit. </connor>
<connor> When I breathe it in, I don't like the smell. </connor>
<connor> I don't like the taste. </connor>
<joey> - [Navi] Jakarta is horrible. </joey>
<joey> - Anywhere in Southeast Asia is horrible. </joey>
<joey> - Literally go to anywhere in Southeast Asia, go to China. </joey>
<joey> - You're not selling me on it. </joey>
<joey> - [Man] Singapore is fine, though. </joey>
<connor> - Yo, fuck off. </connor>
<connor> - Singapore is not fine. </connor>
<connor> - You're literally surrounded by countries. </connor>
<connor> - I landed in Singapore Airport </connor>
<joey> and I was like, this is a really pretty airport. </joey>
<joey> God, it smells like shit, though. </joey>
<connor> - That's why the airport has so much plants. </connor>
<joey> With the first breath, it lies to you. </joey>
<joey> So you think, oh, it's actually good. </joey>
<joey> Then you leave the plant fucking-- </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I've seen their airport. </joey>
<connor> It's just full of plants and shit. That's why. </connor>
<joey> - It's a really pretty airport. </joey>
<garnt> - Out of every airport I've been to, </garnt>
<connor> Singapore Airport is by far the best fucking airport. </connor>
<joey> - A hundred percent. </joey>
<connor> And I have no idea why the Singaporean Airport-- </connor>
<connor> - You know which country has the best tasting air </connor>
<joey> upon landing in my experience so far? </joey>
<joey> Amsterdam had the best air. </joey>
<joey> When I got off that plane, I was like, </joey>
<joey> damn, this is some clean air. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I can agree with that. </joey>
<joey> - See, even you can agree. </joey>
<joey> When I got in Charles de Gaulle in Paris, </joey>
<joey> I was like, put me back on the fucking plane. </joey>
<connor> Get me outta here. It's bad enough I'm in Paris, </connor>
<connor> let alone having to fucking breathe this air. </connor>
<joey> - I was like that when I landed in JFK. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, my God. - In New York, I was like-- </joey>
<joey> (Joey retches) </joey>
<connor> - The New York air, you're like, "Bruh." </connor>
<connor> I don't even need studies to tell me this air is polluted. </connor>
<connor> This is what I'm saying! </connor>
<connor> You can tell, when you get off the plane, you breathe, </connor>
<connor> you're like, ooh, this is rough. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, but that's the same logic </joey>
<garnt> as what Garnt was saying about-- </garnt>
<garnt> - No, he was saying smell. </garnt>
<garnt> - It smells different to me. Maybe it's the same thing. </garnt>
<joey> - You're always biased about your hometown airport. </joey>
<garnt> You're always biased. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think that-- </garnt>
<garnt> - I guarantee people living in New York from New York </garnt>
<garnt> is like, JFK has the best smelling airport </garnt>
<joey> because it smells like home. Guaranteed. </joey>
<garnt> - Maybe I just don't know what fresh air is, </garnt>
<connor> 'cause I'm a city boy. </connor>
<connor> - I was saying to Garnt when I get the train </connor>
<joey> from London to Wales, like when I step off the train, </joey>
<joey> when the train opens and I breathe in Wales, I'm like, </joey>
<joey> holy shit, this is what actual air tastes like. </joey>
<joey> - That's because you're from there, though. </joey>
<joey> - I'm like, whoa. </joey>
<joey> - So there's probably a bias. </joey>
<joey> - It's not like super industrial. </joey>
<connor> There's just fucking fields everywhere. </connor>
<garnt> - Me and Connor were walking to the office </garnt>
<connor> and Connor was like, "God, this air tastes horrible." </connor>
<connor> And I'm just like, Connor, what the fuck? </connor>
<garnt> Tokyo air is great. I don't know what you're talking about. </garnt>
<connor> - What are you on about? It's like a mega city, bro. </connor>
<connor> The air is fucked here. </connor>
<garnt> - For a city, the Tokyo air is actually pretty good, I feel. </garnt>
<joey> - Could that possibly be the most wankerish thing </joey>
<garnt> that Connor has ever said? </garnt>
<joey> "Oh, the air tastes horrible here. Get this outta my face." </joey>
<connor> - I'm just saying, it tastes polluted. </connor>
<joey> - That could probably be the most privileged thing </joey>
<joey> you could have said in your life. </joey>
<connor> - "My air is better than yours." </connor>
<joey> - "My air is better." </joey>
<joey> - Bring me my fresh air, canister, won't you? </joey>
<garnt> - Connor's mum comes to visit from Wales </garnt>
<joey> and she just brings like a jar of air. </joey>
<joey> She's like, "Connor, breathe this in." </joey>
<garnt> What did Meilyne write? Did she write "incest" again? </garnt>
<connor> - She's giving me the air quality. </connor>
<joey> What is this? Is this the rating? </joey>
<connor> - Higher is better? </connor>
<connor> - [Meilyne] Lower is better. </connor>
<connor> - That's bullshit, there's no way. </connor>
<garnt> - Let me see this, let me see this. </garnt>
<joey> - Also, Rhyl is terrible. </joey>
<joey> - So, air quality index. </joey>
<joey> So, the higher it is, the more polluted it is. </joey>
<joey> Amsterdam, 69. Nice. </joey>
<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<joey> San Fran is 31. </joey>
<joey> - I hate the fact that we've got the whole fucking office </joey>
<garnt> to laugh at the number 69. </garnt>
<joey> - You know it. </joey>
<joey> San Fran air quality index is 31. </joey>
<connor> And then Wales is 68. </connor>
<connor> - This is Rhyl. Doesn't count. </connor>
<connor> Rhyl's a shithole. </connor>
<connor> - So basically, what Meilyne is saying is that </connor>
<joey> San Fran air quality is twice as better as Wales. </joey>
<joey> - That's fucking biased as fuck. </joey>
<connor> Meilyne's from San Francisco. </connor>
<connor> That's why Meilyne pulled that shit out. </connor>
<connor> - She just came up with a random number. </connor>
<garnt> - No fucking way. </garnt>
<connor> - She's like, </connor>
<garnt> "Facts don't care about your feelings, Connor." </garnt>
<connor> - Maybe they took that out in some vineyard somewhere, </connor>
<connor> where there's perfect air, but that city is fucking awful. </connor>
<joey> - Your nostrils are dirty. </joey>
<garnt> (all laugh) </garnt>
<joey> - Connor's got those dirty Welshmen nostrils. </joey>
<connor> - If you're born and raised in the city, </connor>
<connor> your nostril hair is longer. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> Did you know that? </connor>
<garnt> Google it, Google it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Where'd you get this piece of-- </garnt>
<joey> - On the next episode of Scientology. </joey>
<connor> - Because your nostrils need to filter more shit, </connor>
<connor> so it naturally just grows longer. </connor>
<connor> - I get that, but where the fuck did you read that? </connor>
<connor> - I don't know, I just heard it. </connor>
<garnt> I read it somewhere. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughs) </garnt>
<connor> It's true. Look it up. Google it. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, I believe the logic because it's just like-- </garnt>
<connor> - That's why Meilyne has these massive bushes going on. </connor>
<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<joey> She's gonna kill me. </joey>
<joey> I'm going to get a death threat after this. </joey>
<joey> While Navi looks it up, it's true. But, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> I don't know why I heard about that. </garnt>
<connor> - I dunno, man. </connor>
<connor> - [Navi] There is a research about it. </connor>
<garnt> - Is there actually research about this? </garnt>
<joey> - Called "How Climate Helped Shape Your Nose." </joey>
<joey> - Well, yeah, no, I get that, but nose hairs? </joey>
<joey> - Type in what I said. </joey>
<joey> - Nostril hair, I'm still searching. </joey>
<connor> - Type in "nostril hair length, </connor>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> correlation city." - I feel sorry for the person </joey>
<joey> who actually did a full-on study on this. </joey>
<joey> Who woke up one day and was just like, </joey>
<garnt> "You know what? I want to measure nostril hair length." </garnt>
<joey> - "My friend's nose hairs are longer than mine. </joey>
<connor> There has to be a reason behind that." </connor>
<joey> - We need to know these things. </joey>
<joey> We don't know enough about the human body. </joey>
<connor> We need to know everything. </connor>
<connor> So we can just tell what the fuck's going on. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, is this like when you were talking about </connor>
<garnt> fucking mouth breathers and all that shit? </garnt>
<connor> - Mouth breathers having no chin. </connor>
<joey> - I don't know if this is one of those lies or not. </joey>
<joey> It could be. </joey>
<garnt> But, in my head, it's one of those things where I'm like, </garnt>
<connor> I don't even care if this is bullshit, it makes sense. </connor>
<garnt> - Weren't you scared? Because you were going to the dentist </garnt>
<garnt> to get not retainers, but the-- </garnt>
<garnt> - The mouth guard. </garnt>
<garnt> - The mouth guard thing. And you were just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "I don't want to breathe--" </garnt>
<connor> - Generally, it's better to breathe </connor>
<joey> through your nose, anyway, just for air quality. </joey>
<joey> - Especially when it has to filter </joey>
<connor> through all those nose hairs. </connor>
<connor> - It has to fucking filter through. </connor>
<garnt> - All right, Navi. </garnt>
<garnt> - All right, Navi, what is it? </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, there is a study in like, </garnt>
<garnt> but it's a very old article. </garnt>
<garnt> - "Study," he says. </garnt>
<connor> - There is a study on Tumblr. </connor>
<garnt> - I could be chatting out of my ass for all I know. </garnt>
<joey> - I feel like you are, Connor. </joey>
<connor> - If there are any nose hair experts watching this, </connor>
<joey> could you leave it down in the comments, please? Thank you. </joey>
<joey> - [Navi] "The Nose Hair Indicator for Air Pollution." </joey>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> - That sounds like an Onion article. </connor>
<connor> That doesn't sound real. </connor>
<joey> - [Navi] I know, it doesn't sound real. </joey>
<connor> - The nose hair-- </connor>
<connor> - It would make sense, though, right? </connor>
<connor> If you were born in a place that was more polluted, </connor>
<connor> naturally, it would make sense that your body would want-- </connor>
<garnt> - I feel like that's something your mum says to be like, </garnt>
<joey> "It's a good thing you're not in the city, right? </joey>
<joey> They have long nose hairs in the city, Connor." </joey>
<joey> - "You don't have to trim your nose hairs, boy." </joey>
<connor> - It's like a wives' tale. </connor>
<connor> - I always felt like I had a long nose hair anyway. </connor>
<connor> So I'm like, fuck, imagine if I was born in the city. </connor>
<connor> I'd have Tarzan's crotch in my nose. </connor>
<joey> - [Navi] So, interactive indicator of poor air quality </joey>
<joey> using nose hair length as a rough metric </joey>
<joey> for just how much nasal fiber one would need to catch </joey>
<joey> and filter harmful particulate matter in ages over 10. </joey>
<connor> - That sounds like I'm right. </connor>
<connor> (Navi laughs) </connor>
<connor> - [Navi] But it sounds ridiculous, though. </connor>
<garnt> - I literally stopped listening </garnt>
<garnt> halfway through that sentence. </garnt>
<joey> Did you get that off WikiHow? </joey>
<joey> - Also, I don't know why, </joey>
<joey> I started getting recommended videos about </joey>
<joey> breathing from your mouth </joey>
<joey> and I dunno why I was getting recommended this stuff, </joey>
<joey> but I watched it. </joey>
<joey> - "Watched by other mouthbreathers." </joey>
<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<joey> - I watched it, and it was like, </joey>
<joey> it was one of those videos where it's like, this is, </joey>
<joey> this would be, </joey>
<joey> if I wasn't dumb as fuck, this would be so convincing. </joey>
<joey> It felt so manipulative, these videos. </joey>
<connor> They were like, "Look, there's twins. </connor>
<connor> One of them was allergic to hamsters </connor>
<connor> and they had a hamster in their room. </connor>
<connor> And thus he couldn't breathe through his nose </connor>
<connor> and look what happened to his chin. It's all gross." </connor>
<garnt> - What, they just showed a fucking picture of Leafy </garnt>
<connor> or something like that? </connor>
<connor> - Why you gotta do him like that, man? </connor>
<connor> That's bullying, bro. We'll get demonetized. </connor>
<connor> - One of them is Leafy and the other guy is like chin dude. </connor>
<connor> - It was like one had a clearly defined chin. </connor>
<joey> - It's like buff as shit Chad. </joey>
<joey> - One had a clearly defined chin </joey>
<joey> and one had the, I don't even know what you call it, </joey>
<joey> It's not really a chin. </joey>
<joey> It kind of like leads into it. </joey>
<joey> And that's generally believed to be unattractive </joey>
<joey> amongst Sigma male people. </joey>
<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<connor> - I love that as well. </connor>
<joey> - It's where your chin is getting swollen into your neck. </joey>
<joey> - Kinda, yeah. </joey>
<connor> And it's one of those things where you're like, huh, </connor>
<connor> everyone I did meet who I feel like had that kind of face, </connor>
<joey> did breathe through their mouth, I think. </joey>
<joey> And then it's one of those things where it kind of, </joey>
<joey> it builds on your ignorance of it </joey>
<joey> and your anecdotal evidence of it. </joey>
<joey> But then I, you know, </joey>
<joey> I saw more videos about it and I was like, you know, </joey>
<joey> the more I feel like it, the more this is like, </joey>
<joey> feels like some kind of Sigma male bullshit. </joey>
<joey> You know what I mean? I felt like I was getting fed, </joey>
<joey> but I don't know how accurate it is. </joey>
<joey> Because then I start watching videos about </joey>
<joey> apparently doctors who specialize in, </joey>
<joey> what they'll do is, they'll, fuck what do they do? </joey>
<joey> They'll do something so that when you sleep, </joey>
<joey> when you normally do it, </joey>
<joey> that you breathe through your mouth </joey>
<joey> and they'll go, "Look, it's fixed. </joey>
<connor> His chin is fucking normal." </connor>
<joey> - What, they're just like, "Here's some tape. </joey>
<joey> Put it on your mouth while you sleep." </joey>
<joey> - It was one of those things-- </joey>
<joey> - His chin is normal. </joey>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </joey>
<garnt> - I didn't particularly care to learn more about it </garnt>
<garnt> or check how real it was. </garnt>
<garnt> - But now it's in your head. </garnt>
<connor> And now you're just like, "But what if I do </connor>
<connor> breathe through my nose?" </connor>
<garnt> - I generally want to breathe through my nose anyway, </garnt>
<garnt> because it's just the whole of, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> when you breathe through your mouth, </garnt>
<joey> it isn't being filtered and shit. </joey>
<joey> I'd like to live as long as I can, </joey>
<garnt> so I can be as stubborn as I can for as long as I can. </garnt>
<garnt> Maybe I can become a Japanese politician </garnt>
<joey> and make life hell for all the young people. </joey>
<joey> Full circle, baby. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, I feel like you do breathe </joey>
<joey> through your nose most of the time. </joey>
<joey> You can only tell who the mouth breathers are, </joey>
<joey> because-- </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> No, no, no. Let me finish my sentence. </joey>
<joey> You can only tell who the mouth breathers are when you like, </joey>
<joey> you're in a hotel room. </joey>
<joey> And there's always the one snorer who is just like, </joey>
<joey> you know sometimes when you're bunking with-- </joey>
<joey> - I snore sometimes. </joey>
<joey> - Sometimes. When you're really tired, </joey>
<joey> but sometimes you are with a group of mates </joey>
<joey> and you know who the fucking snorer is, right. </joey>
<joey> And it's like a fucking time limit of just like, </joey>
<garnt> "All right, I've got literally half an hour to fall asleep </garnt>
<garnt> or I'm not sleeping tonight." </garnt>
<joey> - And it's not just the snorers, right? </joey>
<joey> Because there are the snores that do it through their nose </joey>
<joey> and then there's the snorers that do it through their mouth. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, you can tell when people snore through their mouth. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<garnt> - No, it's so weird, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I grew up breathing through my mouth. </garnt>
<connor> So I was a mouth breather when I would sleep, </connor>
<connor> when I was a kid. </connor>
<connor> But that's because I had like horrible hay fever, </connor>
<connor> so my nose was constantly blocked all the time. </connor>
<garnt> So I literally used to sleep-- </garnt>
<joey> - It sounds like a lowkey insult. </joey>
<connor> It's like, "I knew you were a fucking mouth breather, Joey." </connor>
<garnt> - It is. It's used as an insult. </garnt>
<garnt> - Is it? </garnt>
<joey> - It's used as predominantly an insult. </joey>
<joey> - A fucking mouth breather. </joey>
<joey> - Because it's-- </joey>
<joey> - By who? </joey>
<joey> - A lot of people use it as an insult. </joey>
<joey> - Not me. </joey>
<joey> - It's a pretty good descriptive insult </joey>
<joey> because I feel like, you know, as much as I wouldn't use it, </joey>
<joey> you get a very good picture of what they're trying to paint, </joey>
<joey> when someone calls you a mouth breather. </joey>
<garnt> (Garnt laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - It sounds funny, I don't know. </garnt>
<joey> - You fucking mouth breather. </joey>
<joey> - Fucking mouth breather, God damn it. </joey>
<garnt> - And I just became, </garnt>
<connor> for a little bit, I definitely became paranoid </connor>
<joey> that I was breathing through my mouth. </joey>
<joey> - Am I becoming a mouth breather? </joey>
<joey> - I remember that stage. </joey>
<joey> - I'd be like, oh my God, my breathing's off 10 seconds. </joey>
<joey> My fucking chin. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<connor> But then, because I feel like I have a semi-defined chin, </connor>
<garnt> I guess. I don't know. </garnt>
<joey> - Semi-defined chin. </joey>
<joey> - I haven't got this Chad level-- </joey>
<joey> - You have a nose breather chin. </joey>
<joey> - And I was like, yeah, I did breathe through my nose </joey>
<joey> as a kid, so it makes sense. </joey>
<joey> But then again, </joey>
<joey> I feel like it all goes on anecdotal evidence, </joey>
<garnt> you know, everything. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know how accurate it is. </garnt>
<garnt> it felt like pseudoscience when I was watching this shit. </garnt>
<garnt> - Pretty much. </garnt>
<connor> - It was enough to make me care, </connor>
<connor> even though I know I shouldn't. </connor>
<connor> - Now you've made a lot of people self-conscious. </connor>
<connor> Everyone watching this is gonna be like, </connor>
<joey> "Oh shit, do I breathe through my mouth?" </joey>
<joey> - 90% of people are just doing this like, </joey>
<joey> "Do I have a chin? Am I good? Am I good?" </joey>
<connor> - Isn't it sad that we give a shit about chins? </connor>
<joey> I don't care about chins. </joey>
<joey> - Why do we care about chins? </joey>
<garnt> - Dunno. </garnt>
<joey> - Did your parents ever tell you an old folk tale </joey>
<joey> or something to get you to do something as a kid? </joey>
<joey> - Oh, yeah, all the time. - I dunno, </joey>
<joey> I dunno what Japanese things there are </joey>
<joey> because in Thailand, it's like, </joey>
<joey> one of the things is if you eat on the bed, </joey>
<joey> then you'll get, </joey>
<joey> when you reincarnate in your next life, </joey>
<joey> you're gonna reincarnate as a snake. </joey>
<joey> And I'm just remembering this now. </joey>
<joey> - That sounds epic! </joey>
<connor> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </connor>
<connor> - I'm down, sign me up. </connor>
<connor> - And that was what I was told </connor>
<garnt> to not get me to eat on the bed. </garnt>
<garnt> And I don't, </garnt>
<garnt> I guess it worked because I hate eating on the bed now. </garnt>
<joey> - Japan is infamous for all these Proverbs and wives' tales. </joey>
<garnt> One of them was like, </garnt>
<garnt> if you sleep immediately after you eat, </garnt>
<joey> then you turn into a cow. </joey>
<garnt> - I think Thailand had something similar to that as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - I guess. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think my mum stopped telling me these </garnt>
<garnt> because whenever my mum told me them, </garnt>
<joey> I would immediately go and try them. </joey>
<garnt> (Garnt laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - I just, as a kid, </garnt>
<joey> I just never believed anything people told me. </joey>
<joey> When people would be like, </joey>
<joey> don't walk under ladders or some shit, </joey>
<connor> 'cause apparently it's superstitious, right? </connor>
<connor> I think it's a safety issue. </connor>
<joey> - Or a black cat walking past, right? </joey>
<joey> - I would just go and do all those things. </joey>
<joey> I'd be like, I don't, </joey>
<joey> I remember one time my mum was like, </joey>
<joey> "What the fuck are you doing?" </joey>
<joey> I just kept opening the umbrella in doors. </joey>
<joey> I was like, I want to see if something bad happens. </joey>
<joey> So I just kept opening it indoors. </joey>
<joey> - In Japan as well, there's that. </joey>
<connor> - And nothing happened. I was like, oh. </connor>
<connor> - Well, that's the thing. </connor>
<joey> It's like, some Japanese Proverbs are based on </joey>
<joey> actual facts that are harmful to your body. </joey>
<joey> So the sleeping after you eat thing is actually </joey>
<connor> has a little bit of logic to it. </connor>
<connor> Because if you do sleep immediately after you eat, </connor>
<connor> then all the gastric stuff goes up your esophagus and it-- </connor>
<connor> - Why'd it make me so damn sleepy? </connor>
<connor> - Burns your esophagus and damages your throat. </connor>
<connor> So I'm like, oh, okay. </connor>
<connor> So, there's actual reasoning behind that, that's cool. </connor>
<connor> But then there are some which just like, </connor>
<connor> are like, </connor>
<connor> don't whistle at night because snakes will come. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, snakes are literally deaf. </connor>
<connor> - Bro, that sounds amazing. </connor>
<connor> We got a snake army. - They have no ears. </connor>
<joey> - Snake army. </joey>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </garnt>
<garnt> - How snake charmers, </garnt>
<garnt> it isn't from the music, it's from the movement. </garnt>
<garnt> - From the vibrations. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, the movements. </garnt>
<connor> - It's literally the movement of this. </connor>
<connor> - The movement of the guy that they follow. </connor>
<garnt> - How did snake charmers start? </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<joey> - They just wake up one day and they're like, </joey>
<joey> "You know what? I wanna charm some snakes. </joey>
<connor> I got a flute. I got a basket." </connor>
<connor> - White people are stupid. </connor>
<joey> I don't know. </joey>
<joey> - Do snake charmers even exist anymore? </joey>
<connor> - You don't really charm them, do you? </connor>
<connor> You just make them dance a little bit. </connor>
<joey> - Right, but is that a thing that's like, </joey>
<connor> is there a person out there somewhere in the world </connor>
<joey> that's like, "Yes, I am a professional snake charmer." </joey>
<garnt> - Probably. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's probably a mouth breather. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - Why, why? You're obsessed with that word now. </connor>
<connor> - Now that you've told me it's an insult-- </connor>
<garnt> - All snake charmers are mouth breathers. </garnt>
<garnt> - If there's fucking psychics out there, </garnt>
<connor> there can be any job, I don't really give a fuck. </connor>
<joey> - I just feel, though, it's one of those pseudo </joey>
<joey> occupations that were kind of very timely back in the day. </joey>
<joey> It's like, you know, a soothsayer, right? </joey>
<joey> No one goes around being like, </joey>
<joey> "I'm a professional soothsayer." </joey>
<connor> - What's a soothsayer? </connor>
<connor> - They're just like budget magicians. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, what is that, actually? </connor>
<joey> - A soothsayer is a person who goes around </joey>
<joey> and tells fortunes and tells your future and stuff. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, that's a load of shit. </joey>
<garnt> - You mean, like a fortune teller? </garnt>
<joey> - Kind of, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - That's an occupation that shouldn't-- </garnt>
<joey> - But soothsayer sounds way cooler. </joey>
<connor> - That's an occupation that should have </connor>
<joey> gone out of business. </joey>
<joey> - I think it did go out of business. </joey>
<joey> - No, fortune telling. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, fortune telling. </joey>
<joey> - How that shit still exists, I dunno. </joey>
<connor> I have friends who do that and I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> you're a fucking idiot. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, really? - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - With like what, the crystal ball or the tarot cards or? </joey>
<connor> - They'll read their hands and stuff. </connor>
<joey> - Oh! </joey>
<connor> - Oh, palm reading. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I'm like, </joey>
<joey> have you seen some of the fish out there? </joey>
<joey> Do you think God really gave enough of a fuck </joey>
<joey> to worry about putting inscriptions on your hand </joey>
<connor> of what your life's going to be like? </connor>
<connor> Man couldn't even finish half the fucking </connor>
<connor> fishes in the ocean. </connor>
<connor> Are you serious, bro? Like, come on. </connor>
<connor> No, no, he did not inscribe, </connor>
<connor> he doesn't give a fuck about you. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, I like doing it every now and then </joey>
<joey> just to see what they say. </joey>
<connor> - We like to feel interesting as people. </connor>
<connor> That's an egotistical need that we have. </connor>
<connor> But I genuinely believe that we are not interesting things. </connor>
<connor> It is up to us to make our own lives interesting. </connor>
<connor> And horoscopes and all that and all that nonsense, </connor>
<connor> I just don't believe in any of it. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I'm like, nobody gives a fuck about this. </connor>
<connor> - You don't believe in star signs or anything like that? </connor>
<garnt> - No. - Honestly, I don't. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, me either. </garnt>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Anyway. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, me either. Anyway. </connor>
<garnt> - The whole blood type, the whole lines on your hands. </garnt>
<garnt> All of that shit, I just think it's fucking nonsense. </garnt>
<garnt> I think it's cool. </garnt>
<joey> And when someone tells me, I'll listen. </joey>
<joey> - I think it's cool for the sake of entertainment. </joey>
<garnt> - I view it as more of just an entertainment thing </garnt>
<connor> or like a conversation starter, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - It's not something I take seriously. </garnt>
<garnt> - But I'm like, is your life is so fucking boring, </garnt>
<garnt> where this is the stuff that gets you excited? </garnt>
<garnt> This is what you look forward to? </garnt>
<connor> You need lies to tell yourself </connor>
<connor> to feel like you're doing something in life? </connor>
<joey> Just go and fucking do something. </joey>
<connor> - Some people need that, man. </connor>
<joey> Some people need that encouragement. </joey>
<connor> - Stop. Go and do something. </connor>
<connor> Stop reading your fucking hands. </connor>
<joey> - Only mouth breathers do that. </joey>
<connor> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </connor>
<connor> - The reason why you have no chin is not because </connor>
<joey> of a line in your hand, okay? </joey>
<connor> - It's because you breathe through your mouth. </connor>
<connor> - Connor's like, "Fuck reading your hands, </connor>
<garnt> but please breathe through your mouth. That's real." </garnt>
<connor> - I think that there's behavior that you can do </connor>
<garnt> that can affect your health and your body, right? </garnt>
<garnt> That's, I feel like that's fair to say. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, I feel-- </garnt>
<garnt> - But I think that no mystical entity </garnt>
<connor> decided to carve some fucking lines in your hand, </connor>
<connor> and that would decide how your personality was going to be. </connor>
<connor> No, fuck no. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, yeah, there is a clear difference. </garnt>
<garnt> Because I feel like there is a lot of little things </garnt>
<joey> you just don't know about your body </joey>
<joey> and then you don't figure it out until you hit like 30 </joey>
<joey> or something. </joey>
<connor> And then you realize, oh-- </connor>
<connor> - We also don't know a lot of the stuff </connor>
<connor> about the human body. </connor>
<connor> We're still barely understanding how the mind works, </connor>
<garnt> you know? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, we're still fucking decades or centuries off </garnt>
<garnt> to figuring out how that works. </garnt>
<connor> - I mean, all of America doesn't even have bidets. </connor>
<garnt> So how the fuck are they gonna have </garnt>
<garnt> scientific breakthroughs? </garnt>
<joey> - I can't believe it. </joey>
<joey> - You can't have a scientific breakthrough, </joey>
<joey> not with a bidet. </joey>
<joey> - They call themselves a first world country. </joey>
<joey> Not having any bidets. </joey>
<joey> If they haven't figured that out, </joey>
<connor> how the fuck are they going to figure out </connor>
<connor> what's going on in the brain? </connor>
<connor> Sorry, go ahead, Garnt. </connor>
<garnt> - I completely forgot-- </garnt>
<connor> - You were talking about how they haven't discovered </connor>
<connor> anything about the brain. </connor>
<garnt> - No, it's just like, </garnt>
<garnt> part of growing up and growing into your thirties, I guess, </garnt>
<garnt> is just realizing that sometimes, </garnt>
<joey> you just have a problem with your body. </joey>
<joey> And like, as a kid, I thought everything's fixable. </joey>
<joey> Everything will go back to normal, eventually. </joey>
<joey> And then you don't realize that </joey>
<joey> sometimes you just have a problem </joey>
<garnt> and then you just learn to live with it. </garnt>
<connor> It's sad. </connor>
<garnt> - You just kinda hope that you don't get a problem </garnt>
<joey> that's too insufferable. </joey>
<joey> - Life-threatening, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Like kidney stones. Fuck, if I get those, fuck. </connor>
<garnt> - Everyone around my age </garnt>
<garnt> just starts talking about their knees. </garnt>
<joey> And luckily enough, </joey>
<garnt> I haven't felt anything about my knees yet. </garnt>
<joey> - It's like lower back pain, knees, neck pain, headaches. </joey>
<joey> - It's just like God decided, </joey>
<garnt> all right, everyone gets a debuff at 30. </garnt>
<garnt> Everyone gets a different one, you know. </garnt>
<joey> - It's like the moment you turn 30, </joey>
<joey> God comes to your sleep and just clocks you in the knees. </joey>
<joey> It's like, "You're 30 now!" </joey>
<joey> Yeah. I don't know. </joey>
<joey> I watched that video of, what was it? </joey>
<joey> It was probably on your guys recommended as well of like, </joey>
<connor> how do kidney stones-- </connor>
<joey> - I was just going to watch that. </joey>
<connor> I had it on the "Watch Later," I never did. </connor>
<joey> - A super interesting video, I recommend it. </joey>
<connor> But it's like-- </connor>
<garnt> - Explain it to me. </garnt>
<garnt> - Basically, it's this guy who, </garnt>
<garnt> he got big off Tiktok, I think, </garnt>
<garnt> because he's like a, </garnt>
<garnt> he works in forensics or something. </garnt>
<garnt> But basically he uses the bodies that, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> you donate to science </garnt>
<garnt> and to study things about the human body, basically. </garnt>
<garnt> And this guy got really big on Tiktok. </garnt>
<garnt> I forgot his name. </garnt>
<garnt> Basically just doing short videos of like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Did you know that this is a real stomach? </garnt>
<garnt> I'm going to open it up </garnt>
<garnt> and show you how food is digested," or whatever. </garnt>
<garnt> And he has a YouTube channel </garnt>
<garnt> and he literally gets a real human body that was donated-- </garnt>
<garnt> - Where is he getting these--? </garnt>
<connor> - People donate their bodies to science after they die. </connor>
<connor> - It's Tiktokers. </connor>
<joey> - He works in some kind of scientific research facility-- </joey>
<garnt> - He's fucking Dexter or something. </garnt>
<garnt> - "Here's what I dug up earlier!" </garnt>
<connor> - It's like the modern day Dexter. </connor>
<connor> He's not a forensics expert. He's just a Tiktoker. </connor>
<connor> - Has anyone checked this guy's credentials? </connor>
<joey> - Is he legit? </joey>
<joey> - He's just insane. </joey>
<joey> I'm sure if I turned up with a body being like, </joey>
<joey> "No, no, a guy donated it." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, some guy donated it, very kindly. </joey>
<connor> - "Officer, it was a donation." </connor>
<joey> - But basically, he gets a proper human body </joey>
<joey> and opens up the kidneys </joey>
<garnt> and explains how kidney stones form </garnt>
<garnt> and why they fucking hurt and stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's like, </garnt>
<garnt> man, I can't imagine something that big </garnt>
<joey> traveling through my dick. </joey>
<joey> - How big is it? </joey>
<connor> - Some of these are big, bro. </connor>
<joey> - Some of these can go like that. </joey>
<connor> - But you have to just hope they break down in your kidneys. </connor>
<joey> 'Cause they just can't go through the tubes. </joey>
<joey> They use ultrasound-- </joey>
<connor> Ultrasonic? Yeah, ultrasonic on your like, </connor>
<connor> kidneys to break it. </connor>
<joey> - They literally scream at it to crumble, essentially. </joey>
<joey> (Joey yells) </joey>
<joey> (Garnt yells) </joey>
<joey> And then it shatters. </joey>
<garnt> That's literally what they do, sometimes. </garnt>
<joey> - It's actually the title one audio they play. </joey>
<connor> (Joey yells) </connor>
<joey> - Get this shit out of me! </joey>
<joey> - But in worst case scenarios where not even that works, </joey>
<joey> that it's so crystallized and so hard, </joey>
<joey> they literally go through your penis with a pair of tweezers </joey>
<joey> to just pull it out. </joey>
<joey> (Grant groans) </joey>
<garnt> - I did not need to hear this. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm sorry. </garnt>
<garnt> - I did not need to hear that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, this guy. Institute of Human Anatomy. </garnt>
<joey> That's the guy. Really cool Tiktok channel. </joey>
<garnt> - Sounds legit. Let's just hope he's not a serial killer. </garnt>
<connor> - I mean, he sounds nice. </connor>
<joey> - I don't want any tweezers going in my peepee. </joey>
<joey> I can't. I literally can't handle hospitals or, </joey>
<connor> I just faint immediately doing anything. </connor>
<joey> - That's why I'm really nervous to get older </joey>
<joey> because you have to do, </joey>
<joey> you know, when you hit like a certain age, </joey>
<joey> you have to do annual colonoscopy and shit like that. </joey>
<garnt> I'm just not looking forward to the day </garnt>
<joey> where a camera has to go up my arse, like. </joey>
<connor> - Hospitals are pretty, the only fear that I have, </connor>
<joey> that I think it's irrational. </joey>
<joey> I guess, is that what it counts as? </joey>
<joey> - I mean, 'cause lots of bad stuff happen at hospitals. </joey>
<joey> - It's just like, </joey>
<joey> I know that shit's gonna happen to my body, </joey>
<joey> I'm not used to it, I don't like it. </joey>
<joey> I don't like anything. </joey>
<joey> And I just, </joey>
<joey> I always get so lightheaded 'til I faint. It's horrible. </joey>
<joey> - You scared of needles or anything like that? </joey>
<joey> - No, I don't give a shit about needles. </joey>
<joey> It's operations and stuff terrify me. </joey>
<joey> - It's just things entering my body that shouldn't be there. </joey>
<connor> - Even when I went to the dentist the other day, </connor>
<joey> just having the fucking shit in my mouth, </joey>
<joey> fucking loud as fuck. </joey>
<connor> (Joey imitates whirring) </connor>
<connor> I was getting lightheaded. I was like, fuck. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, that's why everyone hates going to the dentist. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause you hear sounds in your mouth </joey>
<garnt> that just shouldn't be made anywhere near. </garnt>
<connor> - It's weird 'cause I didn't give a fuck as a kid. </connor>
<joey> I didn't care at all when I had to go and do that stuff. </joey>
<joey> But I dunno what happened between after age 18 </joey>
<connor> where I suddenly started being terrified of it. </connor>
<joey> I'm not really sure why. </joey>
<joey> - I can barely give myself eyedrops, </joey>
<joey> let alone something going into my body. </joey>
<connor> - Well, sometimes you have that friend </connor>
<joey> who's had like 10 surgeries. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, how the fuck are you doing this? </joey>
<connor> How are you not fucking freaking out all the time? </connor>
<joey> Maybe they are, I dunno. </joey>
<connor> - It's like when my dad comes back </connor>
<connor> from his annual colonoscopy, right. </connor>
<connor> It's just like, you know, it's the same vibe </connor>
<connor> as, yeah, I just went to the pub. </connor>
<joey> - I think I legit would faint. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, right? </joey>
<joey> - How do I tell the doctor, listen, I'm a little bitch, bro. </joey>
<garnt> I don't know what's gonna happen. </garnt>
<connor> You gonna loop me up or something? I dunno. </connor>
<connor> - I'm lucky enough to have never needed to have surgery </connor>
<connor> or anything like that. </connor>
<garnt> But just the concept of it fucking terrifies me. </garnt>
<joey> That's one thing that fucking keeps me up at night. </joey>
<joey> - Even if it's not a life-threatening surgery. </joey>
<garnt> - The whole idea of being under anesthesia </garnt>
<joey> just terrifies me. </joey>
<joey> - I hate the surgeries where you're not on it. </joey>
<joey> Or you're on light one. </joey>
<joey> Like the surgeries when, </joey>
<garnt> I think my parents, </garnt>
<garnt> my mum had something with a heart </garnt>
<garnt> and she had to be awake for it. </garnt>
<garnt> And that sounded terrifying. </garnt>
<garnt> - What? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, because apparently, I don't know. </joey>
<joey> It sounded awful. </joey>
<joey> Apparently, you can feel it and stuff. </joey>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt groan) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it's terrible. </joey>
<joey> Exactly, right, it's horrible. </joey>
<joey> But if you have to have it, you have to have it, right? </joey>
<joey> But I think maybe it came from, </joey>
<joey> I had to get, </joey>
<joey> 'cause I had hemophilia where I'd like, </joey>
<joey> if I bleed, you know, don't stop bleeding. </joey>
<joey> I had to go like every three or six months to the hospital </joey>
<joey> to go and do tests just to make sure it wasn't getting worse </joey>
<joey> or getting any better. </joey>
<joey> Luckily it didn't get any worse, but yeah, it was awful. </joey>
<connor> I hated going. </connor>
<connor> And it was just a terrible experience because-- </connor>
<joey> - I think it's because of the atmosphere in a hospital. </joey>
<joey> That hospital atmosphere. </joey>
<joey> - So the ward I'd always had to go to </joey>
<joey> was just filled with old people that were dying. </joey>
<joey> And some of them couldn't even think or talk. </joey>
<joey> And I felt so bad 'cause they would talk to me </joey>
<joey> and they just didn't understand. </joey>
<connor> It scared the fuck out of me when I was like 13. </connor>
<connor> I was like, oh my God, oh Jesus. </connor>
<connor> - Because it's that glimpse into a possible future, right? </connor>
<joey> Of like, "Oh, shit, I could be like that one day." </joey>
<connor> - And the smell. </connor>
<connor> - Talking about smells, </connor>
<garnt> hospitals do definitely have a distinct smell. </garnt>
<connor> - Even thinking about the smell makes me uncomfortable. </connor>
<joey> - That's what I hate about the dentist as well. </joey>
<joey> The dentist has that type of smell that's like, </joey>
<joey> (Joey exclaims) </joey>
<joey> what is that? </joey>
<garnt> - Dentists smell sanitized. </garnt>
<joey> - It's like it's overly sanitized. </joey>
<garnt> You know where it's like, this is too clean. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, it's like you just stepped into a crime scene. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<garnt> - Everything's bleached to shit. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, everything's bleached to shit. </garnt>
<garnt> - I hate it when the doctor doesn't talk at all. </garnt>
<garnt> Doesn't crack jokes or anything. </garnt>
<connor> I like it, 'cause when the nurse, </connor>
<connor> when the nurse is funny as fuck, </connor>
<connor> I feel so good. I feel like I'm chill. </connor>
<connor> When the nurse is cracking jokes. </connor>
<garnt> She's like, "Yeah, I do this all the fucking time." </garnt>
<connor> And she's telling me about funny, old </connor>
<garnt> other patients and stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> I feel so more at ease. </garnt>
<garnt> When the doctor doesn't say anything, </garnt>
<connor> I'm like, what's going on? </connor>
<connor> Talk to me, what's going on? </connor>
<joey> - When the doctor doesn't smile or anything like that. </joey>
<connor> - I'm like, whoa, what's going on, bro? Come on, tell me. </connor>
<joey> - I know you're being serious with your job, </joey>
<connor> but you know, help me calm down a little bit, dude. </connor>
<connor> It's like, fucking hell. </connor>
<joey> It's like we're at a job interview. </joey>
<connor> - I remember there was only one time </connor>
<connor> I ever wanted to go to the hospital </connor>
<joey> and it was this one specific hospital </joey>
<joey> that I think I went to one time </joey>
<joey> had a GameCube right when it came out. </joey>
<joey> - What is this mythical hospital? </joey>
<connor> Why don't more hospitals do that? </connor>
<connor> - And I was like, all right. </connor>
<connor> I saw it as I was leaving, </connor>
<garnt> I was like, next time I come in, I'm gonna play it. </garnt>
<garnt> And then I went and someone fucking stole the controllers. </garnt>
<garnt> So they had a GameCube with no fucking controllers. </garnt>
<joey> They're like Super Mario Sunshine, Super Mario Strikers, </joey>
<garnt> Super Mario Party Brawl. </garnt>
<garnt> They had Brawl somehow. </garnt>
<garnt> You couldn't even buy that game often. </garnt>
<garnt> - Why did they have this at a hospital? </garnt>
<garnt> - I think it was like, </garnt>
<garnt> a charity had given them or donated, </garnt>
<garnt> like a room where, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause it was like, when I was like 12. </garnt>
<joey> So it was for the kids. </joey>
<joey> - Well, that makes the asshole who stole the controllers </joey>
<joey> even worse. </joey>
<joey> - Some fucking dickhead stole a fucking GameCube controller </joey>
<joey> from a children's hospital </joey>
<joey> that had been donated from a charity. </joey>
<joey> What? Who does that? Who does that? </joey>
<joey> - It's probably a mouth breather. </joey>
<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<joey> - I feel like we're gonna get in trouble. </joey>
<joey> I don't know if this is a controversial insult. </joey>
<garnt> - Is it a controversial one? </garnt>
<connor> - I don't even know. </connor>
<connor> - I don't even know. </connor>
<garnt> - If it is, we apologize. </garnt>
<joey> - I just can't take that insult seriously anymore. </joey>
<joey> - [Navi] Apparently, it was an insult </joey>
<joey> back in the 1940s America. </joey>
<garnt> - It's been around for that long? </garnt>
<garnt> - Jesus Christ. This is the first I'm hearing of it. </garnt>
<connor> - This is like, if I taught you the word bussin, </connor>
<joey> you found that it was racist or something. </joey>
<joey> It's like, "Shit, I've been saying it the whole episode." </joey>
<joey> I wanna know the motivation of someone who steals a game </joey>
<joey> controller from a-- </joey>
<garnt> It was already a rare console at the time. </garnt>
<garnt> - Honestly, it's probably another kid, right? </garnt>
<connor> - It was probably another kid, I imagine it was. </connor>
<garnt> - Another kid who just doesn't have a GameCube </garnt>
<joey> or is wanting a GameCube. </joey>
<joey> - Or they stole a GameCube from somewhere </joey>
<joey> and forgot the controllers. </joey>
<connor> - 'Cause GameCubes, at that time, </connor>
<joey> I think were quite expensive and they were, </joey>
<joey> I mean the games aren't cheap 'cause it's Nintendo. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, the games still aren't cheap. </joey>
<joey> - Imagine you're rich enough where your parents </joey>
<joey> buy you a GameCube but not enough controllers, </joey>
<joey> so you steal it from a kid's hospital. Like what? </joey>
<joey> - What an arsehole. </joey>
<joey> - I dunno. Really strange. Really bizarre. </joey>
<garnt> Fuck that kid. I was so excited to play fucking Brawl. </garnt>
<garnt> - What were you in the hospital for? </garnt>
<connor> - I dunno, I was just getting checkups, I think. </connor>
<garnt> - You're like, "Mum, can we go to the hospital, please?" </garnt>
<connor> - I know I went to the hospital a lot. </connor>
<connor> I know I had a lot of, I think, injuries, </connor>
<joey> but all of them ended up being just chill ones. </joey>
<joey> Just like, no big deal. - Just like a bruise </joey>
<joey> or whatever. </joey>
<joey> - It's like bruise, sprains, nothing. </joey>
<joey> Luckily I just never broke bones, so. </joey>
<joey> I don't know how I got so lucky, </joey>
<connor> 'cause I fucked my body up so many times. </connor>
<connor> I don't know how I got so lucky. </connor>
<joey> - It's like, "Why is my kid so enthusiastic </joey>
<joey> to go to the hospital?" </joey>
<connor> - And also, sometimes you get like, </connor>
<connor> your parents would buy you a sweet or something afterwards. </connor>
<connor> They'd be like, "Yeah, you get some nice food. </connor>
<joey> Because you went to hospital." </joey>
<joey> - I thought when you said sweet, </joey>
<connor> I thought you meant like a hotel suite. </connor>
<connor> - I just bought me a suite. </connor>
<connor> - We call 'em sweets in the UK. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, okay. </joey>
<joey> If you buy chocolate or that, it's like sweets. </joey>
<joey> - Do you know what we call them in Australia? </joey>
<connor> Lollies. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<joey> - We have, if they're lollipops. </joey>
<joey> Do you refer to all candy as--? </joey>
<joey> - All candy are lollies. </joey>
<connor> - We refer to lollies as just lollipop. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - But in Australia, they're all called lollies. </connor>
<joey> There's this infamous meme photo of me from back in the day </joey>
<joey> where I'm at an airport in Sydney. </joey>
<joey> And I just thought it was really funny. </joey>
<joey> I just posed next to this sign that just said, </joey>
<joey> "Bagged Lollies," and I just did that. </joey>
<joey> And it's made its rounds on meme forums. </joey>
<connor> - I'm glad that the lollipop is </connor>
<joey> the worst candy of all time. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause now I can say, </joey>
<joey> I hate lollies in every sense of the word. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<connor> No, I remember when I used to get it like age 10, </connor>
<connor> they give you a lollipop. </connor>
<connor> You're like, for fuck's sake. </connor>
<connor> It's the cola flavored fucking lollipop. </connor>
<joey> - I like the cola flavored ones. </joey>
<connor> - Fuck, that sucks, man. </connor>
<connor> - You mean the Chupa Chups, right? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah! </garnt>
<connor> - The cola flavored Chupa Chups are the best. </connor>
<connor> - No, fuck off. Cola flavored sweets are just not good. </connor>
<joey> - They suck. </joey>
<joey> - It's like eating hard, flat Coke. </joey>
<garnt> And that's the best way I can describe it. </garnt>
<garnt> Like flat Coke is bad enough as it is. </garnt>
<garnt> Let's make it hard. </garnt>
<connor> - I never liked it. Who liked lollipops? </connor>
<connor> They fucking sucked. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, I'm not going to go out of my way to eat a </joey>
<connor> fucking Chupa Chups now, </connor>
<connor> but I won't complain if someone gives me one. </connor>
<joey> - It was made to make kids eat sweets for a long time </joey>
<joey> that aren't actually a lot of sweets. </joey>
<joey> I was smart. I realized this is waste, </joey>
<joey> this is not optimized. </joey>
<joey> I can eat way more than this. </joey>
<joey> - I have teeth to break this down. </joey>
<connor> - I hated it. I'd never go for the lollipops. </connor>
<joey> - What's your favorite type of candy? </joey>
<joey> Like the one that you always go back to. </joey>
<joey> - I think chocolate is the best sweet thing, </joey>
<joey> but that's often not considered candy. </joey>
<garnt> It's kind of in its own thing. </garnt>
<garnt> I really liked the-- </garnt>
<garnt> - Haribo. I love Haribo. </garnt>
<garnt> - Sour Haribo were pretty fucking good. </garnt>
<joey> I like sour Haribo. I like the laces, you know? </joey>
<joey> - Oh, the sour strips, right? </joey>
<connor> - Oh, the sour strips, the rainbow sour strips? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah! </garnt>
<connor> - Those things slap. I love those. </connor>
<connor> - In Australia, did you have the penny sweets? </connor>
<connor> - Penny sweets? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, we had this in the UK. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, where you go to a, </connor>
<connor> literally a fucking candy store </connor>
<joey> and you get given a bag and you just fill it up. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yes, yes, yes. </joey>
<joey> - I mean those, I think those fucking candies slapped. </joey>
<connor> - The biggest one in Wales is in my town and </connor>
<connor> it's literally like the size of this set. </connor>
<joey> - That's huge. </joey>
<joey> - Every single wall is candy. It's good. </joey>
<joey> And they used to have these really fucking sour things. </joey>
<garnt> Like they're the most sour sweet in the world. </garnt>
<joey> They're just dunked in that fucking horrible sour stuff </joey>
<joey> you gave us that one video. </joey>
<connor> It was just fun. </connor>
<joey> - I love sour candy, man. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. Sour candy is my favorite, but it's awful though, </connor>
<connor> 'cause you can't drink anything afterwards </connor>
<joey> and water tastes bad. </joey>
<joey> - Water tastes sweet, right? </joey>
<connor> I kinda like that though. </connor>
<joey> - What? No. </joey>
<joey> - It's something about that, where it's like </joey>
<joey> every other drink tastes like absolute shit. </joey>
<joey> But when the water is sweet, I'm just like, ooh. </joey>
<garnt> That's kinda nice. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, I don't think it's that bad. </garnt>
<garnt> It's fucking water. It's just water, bro. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think I'm too British, I think I like crisps the most. </garnt>
<garnt> They're just my favorite snack. </garnt>
<garnt> - Walkers crisps? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, Walkers crisps are amazing. </garnt>
<garnt> We have so many good crisps in the UK. </garnt>
<joey> Cause it's like a national identity. </joey>
<joey> Like every single lunch must have a bag of crisps in it. </joey>
<joey> - Not chips, crisps. </joey>
<joey> - Crisps. - Crisps. </joey>
<joey> - Nah, they're called chips. </joey>
<joey> - We have so many good brands of crisps. </joey>
<joey> I fucking love Monster Munch. I love McCoy's. </joey>
<connor> - Monster Munch sounds epic. </connor>
<joey> - Dude, Monster Munch fucking slaps. </joey>
<joey> - I will say the best crisps I miss, </joey>
<garnt> Walker's Max Paprika Flavor. </garnt>
<connor> - That's just McCoy's kind of, but like lighter. </connor>
<connor> McCoy's are thick. </connor>
<garnt> - Nah, nah, nah. 'Cause Walker's Max has the right-- </garnt>
<connor> - These must sound fucking stupid to any Americans. </connor>
<garnt> They're like, "What are they saying?" </garnt>
<connor> - I'm just like, what are these? </connor>
<garnt> - The Walkers Max crisps have the right amount of </garnt>
<garnt> oiliness to them. </garnt>
<garnt> It's just like, it's a little unhealthy. </garnt>
<connor> - It's kind of weird, 'cause we give like, you know, </connor>
<connor> I don't know what the standard lunch is </connor>
<connor> in Australia or America. </connor>
<joey> But if you ever have a lunch in the UK, </joey>
<joey> it normally just comes with crisps. </joey>
<joey> It's a given that-- </joey>
<joey> - Oh, like school lunch? </joey>
<connor> - Most lunches come with a bag of crisps. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I guess like, you know, </connor>
<joey> I used to eat chips and stuff during lunch. </joey>
<connor> - But then it's really common as well to just have </connor>
<connor> tons of bags of crisps in your house in the UK. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, we have that as well. </joey>
<connor> - Every meal deal you get in the UK includes crisps. </connor>
<connor> Like it doesn't matter if it's fucking Tesco's or-- </connor>
<garnt> - You go to Subway, there's crisps. </garnt>
<garnt> You go to Greg's, there's crisps. </garnt>
<joey> It's always like, it comes with the lunch. </joey>
<joey> It's such a staple in the British lifestyle. </joey>
<joey> - What, just like salt flavored or? </joey>
<connor> - No, we have so many flavors, </connor>
<connor> and I think they're amazing. </connor>
<connor> I've yet to find many brands of crisps that </connor>
<connor> I don't like in the UK. </connor>
<connor> Like Quavers, I love Quavers. </connor>
<connor> I love, even though you have to buy-- </connor>
<connor> So, Quavers, have you seen these before? </connor>
<connor> Basically cheese flavored like thin curls of-- </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, they're cheese flavored, </garnt>
<connor> but they don't taste anything like Cheetos. </connor>
<connor> - No, no, it's much lighter, </connor>
<connor> and you can eat seven bags in one sitting, </connor>
<joey> no problem, 'cause it just tastes like air. </joey>
<joey> The whole thing is like, </joey>
<joey> it's light and has two calories </joey>
<garnt> Yeah, but it has like two bites in the bags, </garnt>
<garnt> so of course it's two calories. </garnt>
<joey> Yeah, that's what it looks like. </joey>
<garnt> They're fucking amazing, bro. </garnt>
<garnt> - Never seen that. - I think those are okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - We have these Pom Bears. </garnt>
<garnt> What are they called? They're in France as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - Pom Bears? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, like the bears crisps. They're just bears. </garnt>
<garnt> - I've never seen those before. </garnt>
<garnt> - They're really good. </garnt>
<garnt> - What the fuck are they? </garnt>
<garnt> - They're in Europe, too. </garnt>
<joey> Yeah, they're German, right. </joey>
<joey> They have those there. </joey>
<joey> But the other British ones, </joey>
<joey> dude, Monster Munch is my favorite. </joey>
<connor> Chris loves Monster Munch too, I think, and McCoy's. </connor>
<garnt> He's really British, though. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - McCoy's is okay. </connor>
<connor> I still stand by the Walkers Max. </connor>
<connor> - Let me Google British crisps. There's so fucking many. </connor>
<garnt> - This has been like a fucking tangent, hasn't it? </garnt>
<joey> - All Australians watching this can agree that </joey>
<connor> the best chips we have is Red Rock Deli chips. </connor>
<connor> That is the one brand that I've been saying, </connor>
<joey> since the beginning of my career, I will happily sell. </joey>
<connor> - We recently, </connor>
<connor> about at this time, before I left, </connor>
<garnt> we recently started having a boom of high-end crisps </garnt>
<garnt> in the UK. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, you mean the kettle chips? </garnt>
<garnt> - Kettle chips are the bomb. - I do like them. </garnt>
<joey> - Tyrrells are massive now in the UK. </joey>
<joey> - Tyrrells? </joey>
<joey> - They're called Tyrrells. </joey>
<joey> You sometimes see them in Japan, they import them. </joey>
<joey> - Really? </joey>
<joey> - As like premium British crisps. </joey>
<joey> This one's in French. They're called French Fries. </joey>
<joey> Do you have these? - I think so. </joey>
<joey> - They're just crisps that are shaped like french fries. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, we have those. </joey>
<connor> - They're really fucking good. </connor>
<connor> - I don't think they're called French Fries, though. </connor>
<joey> There's a different brand for those. </joey>
<connor> - We have Squares by Walkers as well. </connor>
<garnt> - I fucking love Squares! - Ah, Squares fucking slaps. </garnt>
<connor> - Okay, now you're talking, Connor. </connor>
<garnt> Now you're talking. </garnt>
<connor> - Dude, they're so good. - Squares? </connor>
<joey> - I'll put them on screen. </joey>
<joey> - I assume they're square. </joey>
<joey> - They're crispy, salty squares, </joey>
<connor> and the salt and vinegar ones are super fucking salty. </connor>
<connor> They have salt and vinegar, prawn cocktail, </connor>
<joey> and cheese and onion. </joey>
<joey> - Prawn cocktail? </joey>
<joey> I've realized cheese and onion is a very British flavor. </joey>
<connor> - Is it? - Fucking cheese and onion-- </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause we don't have cheese and onion flavored stuff </connor>
<garnt> in Australia. </garnt>
<garnt> - Dude, you're missing out. </garnt>
<garnt> Cheese and onion is honestly, I think, the best one. </garnt>
<garnt> - The one brand of chips that I thought was fucking awesome </garnt>
<connor> was when I was in Ireland, I had Tayto's. </connor>
<connor> - Tayto's? I think that's a specific Irish one. </connor>
<connor> - Specific to Ireland, but the cheese and flavor Tayto's. </connor>
<joey> Man, orgasmic. They're so fucking good. </joey>
<connor> - But, wait, fuck, what were we on before that? </connor>
<joey> - Squares. </joey>
<joey> - Squares? Squares are really nice. </joey>
<joey> We also have Hula Hoops. </joey>
<joey> - Hula Hoops? </joey>
<joey> - Do they have these in America? I'm pretty sure they do. </joey>
<joey> They're just the ones you put on your, </joey>
<joey> they can fit on your fingers. </joey>
<joey> They're like rings. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, I know those. - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - We have Nik Naks. I really like Nik Naks. </garnt>
<garnt> - I never had those. </garnt>
<garnt> That's a very like, </garnt>
<garnt> like marmalade coated crisps. </garnt>
<joey> - Marmalade? </joey>
<connor> - Right? I think that's what it is. </connor>
<connor> Is that what it is? I can't remember what it is. </connor>
<connor> - We have Wotsits. </connor>
<joey> - That sounds weird. </joey>
<connor> - What are they called, Wotsits in America as well? </connor>
<garnt> - I think they have Wotsits in America. </garnt>
<garnt> - They're like Cheetos. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. They kinda feel like Cheetos. </garnt>
<garnt> - Jacob's Minis. </garnt>
<garnt> Sensations. </garnt>
<garnt> - I remember Sensations, oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> - They had premium bagged crisps. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, but these are all Walkers brands, right? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, they're all owned by Walkers. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause Walkers is like, </connor>
<joey> what are they called in America, again? </joey>
<joey> Lays. </joey>
<garnt> - I wish we had this conversation last week </garnt>
<garnt> when Shu was here </garnt>
<garnt> because I don't have another Australian to relate to. </garnt>
<joey> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </joey>
<joey> Damn it. </joey>
<joey> - People have like, </joey>
<joey> apparently there's so many news organizations </joey>
<connor> in the UK have done tier lists of crisps </connor>
<connor> from bottom tier to high tier. </connor>
<joey> - That's an after dark-- </joey>
<joey> - It's a special. </joey>
<connor> - We also had a bag of crisps that was really popular. </connor>
<joey> It was called Salt and Shake. </joey>
<joey> It was like a bag of crisps that hadn't been salted, </joey>
<joey> and it would come with salt. </joey>
<joey> And the whole gimmick of this thing was that </joey>
<connor> you put the salt in and you'd shake it. </connor>
<garnt> - You'd literally salt it yourself. </garnt>
<joey> - Right, right, right. </joey>
<connor> - And it tasted like shit. </connor>
<joey> - I was about to say, that's kind of innovative. </joey>
<garnt> - Because it was just unsalted evenly. </garnt>
<joey> Like the salt would stick to the bottom. </joey>
<joey> - And then the rest of the salt's just at the bottom. </joey>
<joey> - It was terrible. </joey>
<garnt> If you come to the UK, </garnt>
<connor> I really highly recommend trying all our crisps. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't really rate the Japanese ones too much. </garnt>
<connor> - Nah, they're pretty bad. </connor>
<connor> - The pizza potato ones are pretty good. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't know why you like the pizza potato ones. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. I told Chris, I was like, </connor>
<connor> next video that I want to make with him </connor>
<joey> is trying all the Japanese crisps. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause it was just two super British people </joey>
<joey> complaining about crisps. </joey>
<connor> 'Cause there's a lot of meh ones here. </connor>
<garnt> - Most of the ones you find here are just pretty meh. </garnt>
<garnt> Especially the ones from like the company. </garnt>
<connor> - The flavors they have is so bizarre, </connor>
<connor> and they have Doritos here, </connor>
<connor> but they're taco flavored and it does not taste like taco. </connor>
<joey> - Well, they have Cheetos here as well, </joey>
<joey> but it doesn't taste like Cheetos. </joey>
<garnt> - But that's how I feel about pizza flavored stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, what is the flavor of pizza anyway, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Crust. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, no crust apparently. </connor>
<joey> Not a single fucking crust in sight, mate. </joey>
<joey> You won't see a crust. </joey>
<garnt> - You should love it, technically. There's no crust. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean it's a pizza. </joey>
<joey> - It's a pizza! </joey>
<garnt> - It's a pizza! You need the crust in the pizza, j </garnt>
<garnt> just not the crust by itself. </garnt>
<garnt> - You hearing this? </garnt>
<joey> - This man is dumb. </joey>
<joey> - I'm not going to start. </joey>
<joey> We're not gonna start talking about </joey>
<garnt> fucking pizza crust again. </garnt>
<garnt> We've moved on. We've evolved from that. </garnt>
<joey> - Let's just talk about the patrons </joey>
<garnt> before we get onto that tangent. </garnt>
<joey> - Talking about people </joey>
<joey> who are definitely not mouth breathers, </joey>
<joey> look at all these Patreons. </joey>
<connor> - I bet it's going to insult so many people, oh my God. </connor>
<connor> - I really hope not. </connor>
<joey> - I really hope there isn't a mouth breathing community </joey>
<garnt> on the Internet that's just gonna come out. </garnt>
<garnt> But, hey, if you're not a mouth breather, </garnt>
<joey> then maybe go over to our Patreon, patreon.com/trashtaste. </joey>
<garnt> - I'll laugh if this episode ages super horribly. </garnt>
<joey> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </joey>
<joey> - Probably fucking will. </joey>
<joey> - This becomes like the next racial slur. </joey>
<joey> But, yeah, consider following us on Patreon </joey>
<joey> to support the show, patreon.com/trashtaste. </joey>
<joey> Also, follow us on Twitter, </joey>
<joey> send us your memes on the subreddit, </joey>
<joey> and if you hate our faces, listen to us on Spotify. </joey>
<joey> But, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - I'm literally Googling right now, </garnt>
<garnt> "Is mouth breathers offensive?" </garnt>
<connor> - It doesn't matter because the way Garnt said it </connor>
<connor> sounded a little too cozy. A little too-- </connor>
<joey> - It was a hard M on the word mouth there, Garnt. </joey>
<joey> I don't like the way you inflicted that. </joey>
<connor> - I hope you enjoyed this episode of Trash Taste. </connor>
<joey> - We'll see you guys next week. </joey>
<garnt> - It says, "Being called mouth breather </garnt>
<garnt> is used as a derogatory term </garnt>
<garnt> used to describe someone who is, </garnt>
<garnt> well, here's the urban dictionary definition, </garnt>
<garnt> literally someone who lacks enough intelligence </garnt>
<garnt> that they never learned to breathe through their nose. </garnt>
<garnt> - All right, well, that's been this episode of Trash Taste. </garnt>
<garnt> - And on that bombshell, good night. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Bye! </garnt>
<garnt> (gentle upbeat music) </garnt>
