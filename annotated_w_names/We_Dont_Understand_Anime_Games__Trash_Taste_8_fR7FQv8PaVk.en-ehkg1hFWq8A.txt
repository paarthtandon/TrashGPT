<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> - You know how crazy (indistinct)
in some States in America, </joey>
<joey> if you get caught drink
driving, they put a thing </joey>
<joey> on your car to blow into it every time. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Some guy like he'd made a video, </joey>
<joey> he was like, how do we avoid doing that? </joey>
<joey> By inhaling gold cola instead. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - That sounds safe. </joey>
<joey> - All the cards were like, </joey>
<garnt> I feel like you're missing the point </garnt>
<garnt> of why this is in your car, </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) but anyway... </garnt>
<garnt> - You get like in Ava, right? </garnt>
<garnt> They just just made like an
alcoholic version of like LCL, </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) so you just
like.(laughing hysterically) </garnt>
<joey> Hey guys and welcome to another episode </joey>
<joey> of Trash Tastes Podcast, </joey>
<joey> where we talk about our
trash tastes, anime, </joey>
<joey> gaming whatever, I don't know. </joey>
<joey> Actually, we've never talked about gaming. </joey>
<garnt> I dunno, whatever we have our
trash tastes and everything. </garnt>
<garnt> I am your host for today, Gigguk. </garnt>
<garnt> And with me is Connor, CDawgVA , </garnt>
<garnt> and Joey, The Anime Man. </garnt>
<garnt> (indistinct) Keeping it real today. </garnt>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - Okay, you sure? </garnt>
<joey> Okay I cut you off with that. </joey>
<joey> - No facetious nicknames. </joey>
<joey> - What did you wanna say
Connor, what did you wanna say? </joey>
<joey> - I mean if you mentioned it, </joey>
<joey> should we just talk about games then? </joey>
<joey> Like what games you've been playing </joey>
<joey> or what have you played or something? </joey>
<joey> - Have you been playing anime games? </joey>
<connor> - No, I never play anime games. </connor>
<garnt> - Do you never? </garnt>
<connor> - I never play anime games.(mumbling) </connor>
<connor> - Okay, okay what
constitutes as an anime game? </connor>
<connor> - That's the thing. </connor>
<connor> - If the characters go
(screaming) every ten seconds. </connor>
<connor> (Gigguk laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - That's like every game. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - You can say Last Of Us is an anime game. </garnt>
<joey> (both chuckling) </joey>
<joey> - They have a cute (indistinct). </joey>
<connor> (screaming) </connor>
<garnt> - I don't know, like how
many games do you guys play? </garnt>
<garnt> Because I found that, </garnt>
<garnt> I just have zero time to
play a lot of games nowadays. </garnt>
<joey> - Now that the quarantine
is over here, right? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah.
- As a gamer. </connor>
<joey> (cross talk) </joey>
<garnt> - As a pro gamer. </garnt>
<garnt> - I just wanted to say as a gamer. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know, I'm kidding. </garnt>
<connor> No, I mean, I feel like
it's probably the thing, </connor>
<connor> that got cut the most
when I became an adult. </connor>
<connor> Like out of everything that I do, </connor>
<garnt> watching films doing anything else, </garnt>
<garnt> like, gaming got cut down the most to me. </garnt>
<joey> Cause in university.. </joey>
<joey> - Cause that's what you used to do, right? </joey>
<joey> - I used to do gaming
for like 12 hours a day. </joey>
<joey> No problem. </joey>
<joey> - Jesus.
- Yeah, it was easy. </joey>
<joey> I loved that shit. </joey>
<connor> (cross talk) </connor>
<connor> - Depends on the game actually, for me. </connor>
<connor> Like I played, when Person
Five first came out, </connor>
<connor> I definitely played like.... </connor>
<connor> - Still haven't played Persona Five. </connor>
<joey> - More than 12 hours a day on that. </joey>
<garnt> - I know like for me, </garnt>
<garnt> the reason I don't play many
games anymore is because, </garnt>
<garnt> when I get into a game, like get into. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm like one of those
guys who just can't go, </garnt>
<joey> like I either have eight
hour gaming sessions, </joey>
<joey> or I just don't game at all. </joey>
<joey> There's like no in between. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like especially if it's like an RPG </joey>
<joey> or a story-driven game, </joey>
<joey> like I remember when I
last played Persona Five, </joey>
<joey> it was just like, just block out my week, </joey>
<joey> nothing is happening this week, </joey>
<joey> but me was playing Persona Five. </joey>
<garnt> Which is why I haven't played
Royal, yeah.(indistinct) </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean I've played Persona Five, </garnt>
<garnt> Persona Five Royal and
Persona Five Scramble. </garnt>
<joey> And I think in total that took maybe like </joey>
<joey> five, 600 hours out of my life. </joey>
<connor> - This man finds time,
where time shouldn't exist. </connor>
<joey> (Gigguk laughing) </joey>
<joey> - I mean, that's what I like
about animal crossing, right? </joey>
<joey> Because I'm still
playing that to this day, </joey>
<garnt> and I've put in maybe like
three, 400 hours into that game. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Gigguk] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - But that's the thing, right? </garnt>
<garnt> It's like unlike most gaming
sessions where it's like, </garnt>
<garnt> zero hours or eight hours. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Gigguk] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Animal crossing is
just one of those games </garnt>
<garnt> we could play for half an
hour, and then you just draw. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Gigguk] Yeah.
- That's fair enough. </garnt>
<garnt> - Which is what I like, right? </garnt>
<joey> It's just like a little thing, </joey>
<joey> to just kind of do on the sideline. </joey>
<connor> - As someone who plays league
of legends, I feel like, </connor>
<joey> even if it is a 40-minute game session. </joey>
<garnt> - Pro gamer here. </garnt>
<garnt> - That shit felt Like eight hours. </garnt>
<garnt> The mental Battle that
it took to play a game </garnt>
<connor> of league of legends took eight hours. </connor>
<connor> But I fucking used to love
playing league of legends man, </connor>
<joey> I was so addicted. </joey>
<joey> - Are there any like actual-like games, </joey>
<joey> based off animated that you guys like? </joey>
<joey> - What'd you mean? </joey>
<joey> - Like by anime games, </joey>
<joey> I don't mean like games with
animated looking characters. </joey>
<joey> Like I'm not talking
about like a Xenoblade </joey>
<joey> or like Dragon Quest 11 kind of.. </joey>
<garnt> - Has there ever been
a good anime spin off? </garnt>
<joey> I'm sure there has, </joey>
<garnt> it's just, I can't really
think of any right now. </garnt>
<joey> (cross talk) </joey>
<joey> - I (indistinct) the Attack
on Titan game on steam, </joey>
<joey> I was like, yo, I'm so hype. </joey>
<connor> I get 10 minutes into the game like, huh! </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Probably Dragon Ball Fighters, that's.. </garnt>
<connor> - You like fighting games? </connor>
<connor> - I mean, I'm not really much
of a fighter game enthusiast, </connor>
<garnt> but I mean, I had fun playing it, </garnt>
<garnt> and I think it was a pretty good game. </garnt>
<joey> - I enjoyed, what was the
latest like Natto funny game? </joey>
<connor> Like I'm not a huge fan of Natto. </connor>
<connor> (crosstalk) (laughing) </connor>
<connor> Something like that, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But like the latest
one on that on steam, </connor>
<connor> like I think someone gifted that to me </connor>
<connor> and then I just gave it a
go, but I was like, you know, </connor>
<joey> I'm not that much of an advocate
for like fighting games, </joey>
<joey> I'm not that good at fighting games. </joey>
<joey> And I'm not much of a fan
of the narrative franchise, </joey>
<joey> but I gave it a go. </joey>
<joey> That game's genuinely fun. </joey>
<joey> - [Gigguk] Right. </joey>
<connor> - I mean, you have, what's
the Pokemon fighting game? </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Oh, Pokken? </connor>
<connor> I like Pokken, Pokken is good, I like.. </connor>
<joey> - If you like Pokken, it's
similar to that just.(indistinct) </joey>
<connor> - No one ever wants to
play Pokken, and I'm like. </connor>
<connor> - Pokken is so fun. </connor>
<connor> - It's good though,
because I do, you know, </connor>
<garnt> you bring your switch to a party, right? </garnt>
<garnt> You're like, I've got Mario party. </garnt>
<garnt> I've got Mario kart. </garnt>
<garnt> I've got all these amazing
multiplayer games, right? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - The last thing anyone
wants to play is Pokken. </joey>
<joey> But if people give it a
chance, it's actually fun. </joey>
<joey> I don't think it's a great game, </joey>
<joey> but it's a really fun party game. </joey>
<joey> - It's fun, it's really really fun, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's just like a brain
dead fighting game. </joey>
<joey> It's really easy (indistinct) down a lot. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughing) </joey>
<connor> But I think it needed to be,
cause I suck at fighting games. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh, here's a question for you guys, </garnt>
<garnt> and have you ever watched an anime, </garnt>
<garnt> and thought this would
be a really cool game? </garnt>
<joey> Cause I can think of one
off the top of my head. </joey>
<joey> - Sold on. </joey>
<joey> (Gigguk laughing)
I am joking (indistinct). </joey>
<garnt> - Would (indistinct) be a good game bro? </garnt>
<garnt> - I've played the Solo
online games, they will suck. </garnt>
<connor> (cross talk) </connor>
<connor> - Hey, wait there is one in Arcadia. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, and I'm not just saying that </connor>
<connor> because I don't like solo online, </connor>
<joey> like genuinely, they all suck. </joey>
<connor> - I just had a huge epiphany. </connor>
<joey> - Yes.
- What? </joey>
<joey> - The Jojo Battle of The Jojo Fortnite. </joey>
<joey> - The Jojo Fortnite game. </joey>
<joey> - The Jojo Fortnite game. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, in Japan they have an arcade game, </joey>
<joey> and it's a battle Royale of Jojo. </joey>
<connor> And you go on Mario,
and all you do is like, </connor>
<connor> try and fucking punch each
other to death, it's so fun. </connor>
<joey> - That game is fun. </joey>
<connor> - It's kind of bad,
it's kind of a bad game. </connor>
<joey> - It kinda sucks, but it's fun. </joey>
<joey> - It's good. </joey>
<garnt> - It's fucking great, because like, </garnt>
<connor> I completely forgot about
Japanese arcades as well, </connor>
<connor> and just.. </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God, we haven't
even spoken about that. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, we haven't spoken about that. </joey>
<joey> - My second home baby. </joey>
<joey> (Gigguk laughing) </joey>
<garnt> I'm (indistinct) arcades, </garnt>
<joey> I was at an arcade just
yesterday actually. </joey>
<joey> Cause I wanted to get a, </joey>
<joey> what's that piano game that
you and I are really into? </joey>
<garnt> - It's like Nostalgia.
- Nostalgia? </garnt>
<garnt> I think it's called. </garnt>
<joey> - I think it's something like that. </joey>
<joey> Basically, in Japanese, </joey>
<garnt> Japanese arcades are fucking next level. </garnt>
<garnt> Like arcades just didn't die here. </garnt>
<garnt> And there's so many cool
things about Japanese arcades, </garnt>
<garnt> that you just can't get
anywhere else in the world. </garnt>
<joey> - If you think American arcades are fun, </joey>
<joey> you will nut in a Japanese arcade. </joey>
<joey> - [Gigguk] Yeah, yeah, exactly. </joey>
<connor> - It's a different experience in arcade, </connor>
<connor> cause growing up my arcade
experience is always like, </connor>
<garnt> you know, House Of The Dead, those types. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Gigguk] Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - So like party games... </joey>
<connor> (crosstalk)
- Time crisis. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, Time Crisis, right. </connor>
<connor> That's like, and they do have those. </connor>
<garnt> I'd say those are the only games </garnt>
<garnt> that really translated well
from like Western arcades. </garnt>
<connor> Like maybe that sense
of evolution as well. </connor>
<garnt> - I dunno, cause like Japanese arcades, </garnt>
<connor> have so many rhythm games. </connor>
<connor> - It's like 80% rhythm games. </connor>
<connor> - They've got so many unique
ideas about rhythm games. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Cause I remember when I was like, </connor>
<connor> before I came to a Japanese
arcade, I was like, Oh yeah, </connor>
<connor> rhythm games aren't
really my thing, you know. </connor>
<joey> I didn't really enjoy DDR
or that kind of stuff. </joey>
<joey> And then I went to a Japanese arcade, </joey>
<joey> and there are just so many
different types of rhythm games. </joey>
<joey> - Oh it's crazy.
- Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And it's fucking crazy. </joey>
<joey> I mean, I thought you
know, playing guitar here </joey>
<joey> and just pretending to be a band, </joey>
<joey> or you're , what was it, rock band. </joey>
<joey> - Rock band, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But you're playing
basically, every instrument. </joey>
<joey> I was like, rhythm games aren't
gonna get better than this, </joey>
<joey> cause you're pretending to
be playing the instruments. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And then Japanese arcades be like, </joey>
<garnt> now how about we just invent instruments? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> You see this DJ board
right here, six buttons. </joey>
<connor> You're a DJ now. </connor>
<garnt> (Gigguk laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> And It feels amazing when you
like turn the knobs and stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's like ooh, ooh, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm making some music right now, goddamn. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, but no I wasn't the exact same. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, I've always liked rhythm games, </garnt>
<joey> even way before you
know, like rhythm heaven </joey>
<connor> and stuff like that on the DS, </connor>
<connor> like I played the fuck out
of those games, loved it. </connor>
<garnt> But when I moved here, I
was the exact same, right? </garnt>
<joey> I was like, I'm not a huge fan of DDR, </joey>
<joey> never really played a lot of rhythm games </joey>
<joey> like in Western arcades. </joey>
<garnt> And I didn't really even
have an arcade in Australia. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Gigguk] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - We didn't really have an
arcade that was nearby enough. </garnt>
<joey> Like we had one in the city. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, there was one that
was really far away from me. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, but like the city for me, </joey>
<connor> where I live is like a 45 minute drive. </connor>
<joey> - Oh shoot.(indistinct) </joey>
<joey> - So to a 14 year old, </joey>
<joey> it might as well be in
a different country. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So my only experience with arcades, </joey>
<joey> is the Japanese arcades. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - But even when I was little, </garnt>
<garnt> I would go to a Japanese arcade, </garnt>
<garnt> and I never really
touched the rhythm games, </garnt>
<garnt> because all these like high
school kids are around it. </garnt>
<connor> As a 10 year old, you don't
want to go into that crowd. </connor>
<joey> (crosstalk) </joey>
<joey> - It's intuitive, </joey>
<connor> those dudes on some of
these games are insane. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - You know, someone is like insane, </joey>
<joey> when there's like a 16 year old, </joey>
<connor> just rocking up in front
of a (indistinct) machine, </connor>
<connor> and he just puts his gloves on. </connor>
<connor> (Gigguk laughing)
- Get the gloves. </connor>
<connor> If they wear gloves, they're like serious. </connor>
<garnt> - It's like the anime moment, you know? </garnt>
<connor> When they put on the glove, it's like.. </connor>
<joey> - He puts on the gloves,
he just does the shine, </joey>
<joey> and he just gets ready, like
he just stretches himself. </joey>
<joey> - Is that the game
where they go like this? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it's like.. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, they for some reason, </joey>
<joey> I don't know why all
the good players do it. </joey>
<joey> There must be a trick there, </joey>
<joey> but they all throw their hands in the air, </joey>
<joey> when they are playing this piano. </joey>
<connor> - Like they just don't care? </connor>
<connor> - That's an actual movement.
(laughing hysterically) </connor>
<garnt> - What?
- Wait what? </garnt>
<garnt> - What did you say?
- What did you say? </garnt>
<connor> - Don't worry about it.(laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I'm gonna see the replay
anyway, you mother(indistinct). </connor>
<joey> - No but like I played (indistinct) once, </joey>
<connor> because I was also (crosstalk). </connor>
<connor> - That's an actual movement
you need to do you have to, </connor>
<connor> there's a sensor in the actual board, </connor>
<joey> that senses your hands moving up. </joey>
<connor> - [Gigguk] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But a lot of them do
it like when they've, </connor>
<connor> you know in the movies or they
finished their piano solo, </connor>
<connor> and they just like raise their hand? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - They go high, no fucking around. </connor>
<connor> - It looks like, you
know, a classical pianist, </connor>
<connor> just finishing their performance, right? </connor>
<garnt> - But they are doing it every two seconds. </garnt>
<joey> (crosstalk) </joey>
<joey> - I mean like, they're almost
putting in as many inputs </joey>
<joey> as like a Japanese pianist, </joey>
<joey> like a professional pianist sometimes. </joey>
<garnt> It looks so cool though,
when someone's good, </garnt>
<joey> you're like, man this is amazing. </joey>
<garnt> This is like a spectator sport right here. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, But then you think about man, </joey>
<joey> how many 100 yen coins did
they have to go through. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah.
- To get to that level? </joey>
<connor> - (indistinct) You get like
three songs most of the time. </connor>
<connor> So about 10 minutes for
about a hundred yen, </connor>
<connor> which is less than a dollar. </connor>
<joey> - So wait, so what are
the go-to rhythm games </joey>
<joey> for you guys at an arcade? </joey>
<garnt> - I like the one you showed me. </garnt>
<garnt> I can't remember what it was called, </garnt>
<joey> but it's the one where
it's like a massive circle. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, Waka. </joey>
<joey> - Waka, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> And basically it's a really unique input, </joey>
<connor> where it's like the entire circle, </connor>
<connor> and you have to like follow the lines </connor>
<connor> and everything like that. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] We have a video on screen. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah, I'm sure. </connor>
<connor> - [Gigguk] It was something that, </connor>
<garnt> it's really games like
this, that you just can't, </garnt>
<garnt> that I've just never seen before. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - That shit burned my fingers though. </garnt>
<connor> When you're trying to do that (screaming). </connor>
<garnt> - It was the first time I
(indistinct) and I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> should I buy gloves? </garnt>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - It's like a plastic thing, right? </joey>
<connor> And some of the inputs are
like do a full three 60 </connor>
<connor> with your hands. </connor>
<connor> So you're just sliding your sweaty palms </connor>
<connor> all around this thing. </connor>
<garnt> And you're like, ah, trying
to get your hand around. </garnt>
<garnt> - I was like, oh that's where
the gloves come in handy. </garnt>
<joey> I understand. </joey>
<joey> - Cause the thing is,
they're no buttons as well. </joey>
<joey> They're all just sensors. </joey>
<joey> So you're just here like, smashing this, </joey>
<garnt> smashing this hard surface like, dude. </garnt>
<garnt> And it just hurts your fingers. </garnt>
<garnt> - It hurts.
- Oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> - It really fucking hurts. </garnt>
<garnt> - Shit hurts. </garnt>
<garnt> I love the, like the
piano one but that's cause </garnt>
<garnt> it's basically, what's the
other piano one where the guys </garnt>
<connor> do the thing in the air? </connor>
<connor> What's it called? </connor>
<connor> - Uh tune(indistinct). </connor>
<connor> - I feel like that's the hard version. </connor>
<connor> And the one that I likes is the easy one, </connor>
<connor> because it's like a piano thing, </connor>
<connor> but, you don't have to
actually hit the right, </connor>
<connor> just close enough. </connor>
<connor> - Just close somewhere around there. </connor>
<connor> - So you basically look at the screen, </connor>
<joey> and you just do the, it's
really like beginner friendly. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And I really like it
because a lot of them, </joey>
<joey> like there's, I feel the problem
with a lot of the games is, </joey>
<joey> there's medium and then
there's fucking insane. </joey>
<joey> Like there's no in-between. </joey>
<joey> And I always had this
problem with guitar hero, </joey>
<joey> where like I could do medium fine. </joey>
<joey> But when we put the little pinky involved, </joey>
<joey> that's when it all fell
apart, like I couldn't do it. </joey>
<garnt> - It makes you feel like a pianist. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my God, shut the fuck up. </garnt>
<garnt> Or the classic, the Taiko drums, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yeah.
- Oh yeah, that's genius </garnt>
<joey> - [Connor] That's like,
whenever you bring someone, </joey>
<garnt> you are like, get (indistinct) </garnt>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah come on, you all enjoy this. </connor>
<connor> - It's so easy to understand, right? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - It's like monkey brain
mode activated.(laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - I hit two places. </joey>
<garnt> Okay, I understand. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- What about you? </garnt>
<connor> - I mean, the one I always
go to is Groove Coaster. </connor>
<connor> - Oh you always play Groove
Coaster, It looks cool though. </connor>
<garnt> - Groove Coaster is fun. </garnt>
<garnt> - Which one's that one? </garnt>
<connor> - Groove Coaster is the
one with the giant screen. </connor>
<garnt> - It's like(indistinct) in HD. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Gigguk] Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And there's two like knobs, </garnt>
<garnt> that you have to like move around and tap. </garnt>
<garnt> And I sucked at it at first, </garnt>
<joey> but then I went to this
con in Washington DC, </joey>
<joey> like two years ago, maybe three years ago. </joey>
<joey> - [Gigguk] Right. </joey>
<joey> And they had a Groove Coaster machine, </joey>
<joey> but no one was in front of it. </joey>
<joey> And at this point I'd never
played Groove Coaster before. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And I just saw this
Groove Coaster machine </joey>
<joey> that nobody was lining up in front of. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And it was free to play. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah.(crosstalk) </connor>
<connor> - So I was like, I got like
two hours to kill, fuck it. </connor>
<connor> And no one's lining up
in front of this thing. </connor>
<garnt> Let's do it. </garnt>
<garnt> And I got so good in those
two hours where I was like. </garnt>
<garnt> I have to come back to Japan and like, </garnt>
<joey> actually get on these machines
and then ever since then, </joey>
<joey> I've loved it. </joey>
<joey> And there's also , what's the other one, </joey>
<connor> what's the cube one? </connor>
<connor> I keep forgetting. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Oh the one that you go like, </connor>
<connor> tap the things in time? </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah tap the things in time. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] I forgot what that's called. </connor>
<garnt> - [Joey] That was really old.
- [Connor] That's everywhere. </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] That's like a classic one game </joey>
<joey> in the Japanese arcades. </joey>
<garnt> - Cause I remember my
first experience with </garnt>
<garnt> like Japanese arcade games. </garnt>
<garnt> There's always that fear,
where you're just like, </garnt>
<garnt> I have no idea what I'm doing. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing)
You know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> Like especially at conventions
when there's always that guy. </garnt>
<garnt> That guy who just like, </garnt>
<garnt> and he's always before you as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - He comes up with the Excel spreadsheet </garnt>
<garnt> on the best technique. </garnt>
<garnt> (Gigguk laughing) </garnt>
<connor> And it's like, all right, </connor>
<connor> I just wanna play the game(indistinct) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah and you're just
standing there being like, </connor>
<connor> what buttons do I press?(laughing) </connor>
<connor> Like, I don't even know
any of these songs. </connor>
<garnt> - It's time, crisis. </garnt>
<garnt> - And it's always like,
it's always the worst </garnt>
<garnt> (indistinct) as well, </garnt>
<garnt> because you know there's
people standing around you. </garnt>
<connor> - [Gigguk] Oh no!
- Judging you so hard. </connor>
<joey> It's like, look at this(indistinct). </joey>
<joey> - Especially when you're
like a guest there, </joey>
<joey> everyone's gonna look at you like, </joey>
<connor> wow, Joey kind of sucks at that. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I'm definitely gonna bring this up </joey>
<connor> at they panel later.(laughing) </connor>
<connor> you sucked at DDR, </connor>
<joey> Do you have any comments about that? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I suck at DDR. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, that's what I love
about like Japanese arcades, </garnt>
<garnt> is that you can just spend, </garnt>
<connor> you can just lose so many hours in there, </connor>
<connor> and it's really easy because it's.. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, and you get the cards. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I was going to
talk about the cards. </connor>
<connor> - Sorry, sorry.(crosstalk) </connor>
<connor> - Like basically,
actually you explain Joey, </connor>
<garnt> cause you're the one who did it for me. </garnt>
<garnt> So you probably know the
process better than me. </garnt>
<joey> - So, different machines
are owned by I guess, </joey>
<garnt> different rhythm game
companies or whatever. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And you can, if you get so good at it, </garnt>
<garnt> you can buy these cards for
like 300 yen, which is nothing, </garnt>
<garnt> It's like $3 and you print them out, </garnt>
<joey> and you can save your progress on it, </joey>
<joey> because it's a public rhythm game. </joey>
<joey> So if you just put the money
in, you're treated as a guest. </joey>
<joey> So you records all records
for whatever stage you do. </joey>
<joey> - High scores.(crosstalk) </joey>
<garnt> - High scores, that kind of stuff, </garnt>
<garnt> doesn't get saved because
you're just a guest. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - So if you get so invested
in a particular rhythm game, </garnt>
<garnt> or a number of rhythm games. </garnt>
<joey> You can buy these cards and to you know, </joey>
<garnt> save your records and stuff like that. </garnt>
<joey> And you can, a lot of
Japanese people I know </joey>
<joey> like share it online to flex
on each other essentially. </joey>
<joey> - [Gigguk] Yeah.
- Yeah, they do. </joey>
<garnt> - I recommend getting it any way, </garnt>
<garnt> because there are some rhythm
games, like the piano one, </garnt>
<garnt> that if you don't have a card, </garnt>
<garnt> they're going to make you
sit through the tutorial, </garnt>
<garnt> and there's no way to skip it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Exactly. </garnt>
<joey> - Like I remember, I really enjoyed it. </joey>
<joey> I went to the arcade on
three separate occasions, </joey>
<garnt> and for the first like three minutes </garnt>
<garnt> I was just sitting there being like... </garnt>
<connor> - I remember I finished
up my first two songs. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, you don't have the tutorial? </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - I was still doing the
tutorial every time. </garnt>
<garnt> So I was like, I've
gotta get a fucking card. </garnt>
<garnt> I need a card, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - And the good thing as
well with those cards is </joey>
<joey> that not only are they cheap,
but a lot of the cards, </joey>
<connor> the first game that you do
with the card is usually free. </connor>
<connor> So you actually make that money back. </connor>
<connor> - Is it really?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> So with Groove Coaster at least, </connor>
<joey> when you get a, its called a
NESCA card, cause I guess.. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, there's NESCA and
then there's a few other ones. </connor>
<joey> - Then there's the
Bandai one,(indistinct). </joey>
<connor> - I think yeah, I have that. </connor>
<connor> - So with the NESCA card at least, </connor>
<joey> the first game of Groove
Coaster you play is free. </joey>
<joey> Because you just put
that money into the card. </joey>
<garnt> - [Gigguk] Right. </garnt>
<joey> - which I think is a nice compromise </joey>
<joey> because it doesn't feel
like you just, you know </joey>
<joey> you're paying extra to save
your progress essentially. </joey>
<connor> - And you can, like you'll only
have a set amount of stages </connor>
<connor> as a guest.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And if you, you know, level
up, you learn more stages. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </connor>
<joey> It's just cool to like
go back to an arcade, </joey>
<connor> you know every so often just.. </connor>
<connor> - My favorite anime song. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, so I've gotta
triple S this stage, man. </connor>
<connor> I just have to, I have to invest more. </connor>
<connor> - They have Undertale on
Groove Coaster, right? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, they have intel soundtrack. </joey>
<connor> - [Gigguk] Oh sit.(laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Dude, I can do level 12 Megalovania, </connor>
<connor> like Triple S, I was
pretty proud of myself, </connor>
<connor> I'm not gonna lie. </connor>
<connor> - It's so cool, Cause on
Groove coast they have like, </connor>
<joey> Special animations just
for the Undertale song. </joey>
<joey> - Oh really? </joey>
<connor> - So it looks like an Undertale game, </connor>
<joey> playing out on the game. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, no, that's every
song that they have. </connor>
<joey> Even all the Vocaloid stuff
as well, they use like, </joey>
<joey> the music videos for it. </joey>
<joey> And that's what I love
about Groove Coaster, </joey>
<joey> because every stage actually
looks really unique as well, </joey>
<joey> because it has to match the song. </joey>
<connor> - Have you tried using
your card at(indistinct) </connor>
<connor> in America, have you ever tried that? </connor>
<garnt> - No.
- I should try that. </garnt>
<connor> - That'd be pretty cool. </connor>
<garnt> If you're at a convention
and you just(crosstalk). </garnt>
<garnt> Whip out the card, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - (indistinct) the internet? </connor>
<connor> - I gotta, flex on these
people that I Triple S </connor>
<garnt> Megalovania level 12, you know. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh you still have all stages. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, how'd you guys feel
about like the UFO machines, </garnt>
<garnt> or like what, like the prize
machines here in Japan? </garnt>
<joey> - Archie is fucking amazing at it, </joey>
<joey> and I don't know how she is. </joey>
<garnt> - Because, what really
surprised me is that, </garnt>
<garnt> in most, in everywhere else,
it's kind of like a lock. </garnt>
<garnt> Kind of like a lock base. </garnt>
<garnt> But in here I see people
who are just really good </garnt>
<garnt> at these machines and
they can actually turn it </garnt>
<garnt> into a profit because then
they just sell the figures, </garnt>
<connor> or whatever you get or buy. </connor>
<connor> - That's a huge industry as well. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, exactly.
- Its a big deal. </garnt>
<garnt> Like a lot of the stores </garnt>
<connor> (indistinct) selling crank game stuff. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.(indistinct) </joey>
<joey> - I just don't understand how
people can get good at that, </joey>
<joey> because Archie, every
time we go to an arcade, </joey>
<joey> Archie is always just like,
fuck the rhythm games, </joey>
<joey> I'm just gonna go to the crane games, </joey>
<joey> to just get random shit. </joey>
<joey> But every time I try it, </joey>
<joey> and she's standing next
to me, she's always like, </joey>
<joey> Oh no, you should move
them all to the right. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, how do you know that?(laughing) </joey>
<joey> I was just fucking going forward. </joey>
<joey> Just like a whole like
secret thing where it's like, </joey>
<joey> yeah you have to aim as
slightly to the left, </joey>
<joey> so that it drags the
plushy closer to the hole. </joey>
<connor> I'm just like, how do
you figure that shit out? </connor>
<joey> - I just wanna go beep beep and pick up </joey>
<joey> I don't wanna think about this. </joey>
<joey> (Gigguk and Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> I wanna just play it. </joey>
<joey> - I guess you have to if you wanna like, </joey>
<joey> not spend as much money. </joey>
<connor> But if I really really want
the thing in the crane, </connor>
<connor> I'll just go to the shop next door, </connor>
<connor> that probably is selling
it used for like 800 yen. </connor>
<connor> Which is way cheaper than
what it would have... </connor>
<joey> - Every time we to an arcade in Akihabra </joey>
<connor> There's always the store
next to it is selling </connor>
<joey> the exact thing you're
trying to gamble for. </joey>
<connor> - But if in Japan, if you mess up, </connor>
<connor> and you put enough money in the machine, </connor>
<joey> the staff will come over and be like, </joey>
<garnt> hey you want help? </garnt>
<garnt> - We feel kind of bad, you've spent like </garnt>
<connor> how many thousands of yens on this. </connor>
<garnt> - Which is why like when I
have friends who are doing it, </garnt>
<garnt> who are fucking up loads, </garnt>
<joey> and they've put like 20 bucks, I'm like, </joey>
<joey> Put like 10 more bucks, and
then I'll call the staff over. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And if you do that,
normally they'll place it. </joey>
<joey> They'll pick it up, </joey>
<joey> literally put it on the box, </joey>
<garnt> and just require you to like tap it. </garnt>
<garnt> Like they'll pretty
much set it up for you. </garnt>
<garnt> - Baby mode, baby mode activated. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, literally baby mode. </garnt>
<joey> Pro tip, if you come to
Japan, just fuck up a lot. </joey>
<connor> - Use your (indistinct) card and be like, </connor>
<garnt> I don't know how to do this. </garnt>
<connor> (cross talk) </connor>
<joey> - And they'll be like,
all right, I got you man. </joey>
<joey> - Man, damn. </joey>
<joey> Have you ever seen a crane game </joey>
<garnt> at the conventions in America? </garnt>
<garnt> - No, I haven't actually. </garnt>
<joey> - I've seen them, but I've
always been scared to try them. </joey>
<connor> - I guess, cause you
can set the crane game </connor>
<joey> to how difficult you want it. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<joey> And just knowing how like a lot of, </joey>
<connor> at least American crane
games that I played, </connor>
<garnt> how they might as well just be like, </garnt>
<joey> they might as well not be a claw. </joey>
<garnt> - It's basically just a slot
machine with a claw attached. </garnt>
<joey> You know what I mean?
- Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<garnt> (crosstalk) </garnt>
<joey> I'd rather put my money
into an actual slot machine, </joey>
<joey> than a crane game. </joey>
<connor> - Which I would not rather
do anyway.(laughter) </connor>
<garnt> - But no, there's like a
lot of different games, </garnt>
<garnt> that you just don't see
anywhere else in arcades. </garnt>
<garnt> Like I don't know why there's always, </garnt>
<garnt> there's always a Faygo, </garnt>
<garnt> like section that's like.. </garnt>
<joey> - It's not just one machine,
there's an entire row. </joey>
<garnt> - There's a row of Faygo
machines in every fucking arcade, </garnt>
<garnt> I swear to God. </garnt>
<joey> - And those machines, have
you played on those machines? </joey>
<joey> - I haven't yet. </joey>
<joey> - They are fucking expensive. </joey>
<garnt> - What is it? </garnt>
<joey> I've never played the game. </joey>
<joey> - The cards, right? </joey>
<joey> - So they're expensive because </joey>
<joey> you can print out physical
cards of the waifus </joey>
<garnt> that you get in Faygo. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yo for real.
- [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - [Connor] You didn't know that? </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, shit. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] I'm surprised. </garnt>
<connor> - (indistinct) cause you'll
be broke, don't, don't. </connor>
<connor> - So, Nobi, one of my best friends here, </connor>
<connor> he is like a super
heavy, like Faygo player. </connor>
<connor> I mean he used to be. </connor>
<connor> - AKA he has no money. </connor>
<connor> - AKA, he's broke, so.. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't need to give fate anymore money. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] No you don't, don't. </garnt>
<garnt> - Don't tell me this, don't tell me this. </garnt>
<garnt> - But from what I saw, cause
I went to an arcade with him </garnt>
<garnt> and he was like, Oh can I just
go into the Faygo machines? </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm like, yeah, actually cause </garnt>
<garnt> I've always wanted to know what they were. </garnt>
<garnt> I've always walked past them. </garnt>
<garnt> And yeah, it's like a double screen. </garnt>
<joey> It's like a giant DS essentially, </joey>
<joey> where the bottom screen
is like a touchscreen </joey>
<joey> and you have these packet of cards, </joey>
<garnt> and you can essentially use
cards to summon fake characters. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's so cool, oh my God! </garnt>
<joey> You are telling me this
and I'm just like.. </joey>
<joey> - Its like you use the
fake characters to like, </joey>
<joey> beat like a certain quest. </joey>
<joey> It's kind of like Dragon
Quest with fake characters. </joey>
<joey> And if you beat a certain quest, </joey>
<joey> and depending on how you beat it, </joey>
<joey> then you can unlock different waifus, </joey>
<garnt> and you can actually print out
the waifus from the machine. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh no!
- Don't tell him this. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh no! </garnt>
<garnt> - Just to play one game is
already expensive enough. </garnt>
<joey> But of course, they take money to like </joey>
<joey> actually print out the cards. </joey>
<joey> So it's just like so much money
for the franchise right now. </joey>
<garnt> And I know after today
you're gonna go to one. </garnt>
<garnt> - You're just gonna see me in a week, </garnt>
<connor> and(indistinct) guys I've
spent way too much money. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> - (indistinct) coming in with like a deck. </connor>
<garnt> - Like why did you tell me this? </garnt>
<joey> - I'm surprised you never went on it, </joey>
<garnt> considering you made
the whole Gacha video. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean like, because of quarantine. </joey>
<joey> Like it was quarantine
that started my process </joey>
<joey> for the Gacha video. </joey>
<joey> So I haven't actually been to an arcade </joey>
<joey> since quarantine started. </joey>
<garnt> So I've just been playing Faygo, and so.. </garnt>
<joey> - You know what we're
doing after this podcast. </joey>
<garnt> (Gigguk laughing) </garnt>
<joey> We're going to an arcade that
has a Faygo machine and.. </joey>
<connor> - It just(indistinct) like Skylanders, </connor>
<connor> but for questionable adults. </connor>
<joey> (laughter) </joey>
<garnt> you know what I mean, like
that's what it sounds like. </garnt>
<connor> You can (indistinct) the cards. </connor>
<connor> Oh, okay. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, to be fair, it's Pretty fun. </joey>
<joey> - I mean , that's basically
Gacha games and(indistinct). </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Okay. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, you're just, you're
just collecting P and G's, </joey>
<garnt> or cards or whatever. </garnt>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Literal P and G is
printed out this time. </connor>
<garnt> - Wait, wait, so you're telling me </garnt>
<connor> that we're not just collecting P and Gs, </connor>
<connor> but they're physical
and printed out, bruh. </connor>
<garnt> - Laminated cards. </garnt>
<garnt> - Once a P an G always a P and G. </garnt>
<garnt> (Gigguk and Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Man, do you know the coolest game </garnt>
<garnt> I ever saw on Arcadia here was? </garnt>
<garnt> You know Typing Of The Dead? </garnt>
<garnt> It's actually on arcade machines. </garnt>
<joey> - Are you serious? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it's in Akihabra. </joey>
<joey> It's on like the, one
of the Sega buildings. </joey>
<joey> - They have like four Sega buildings. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, one of them, one of them. </joey>
<joey> There's the typing of the dead mode. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - They actually have a Typing Of The Dead. </joey>
<joey> So it's house of the dead,
but you type all the... </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> So what, its like a keyboard there? </joey>
<joey> - It's a keyboard, two
keyboards(indistinct). </joey>
<joey> - Oh that's so cool. </joey>
<joey> - It's so fucking cool, I
need to get a picture of it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that's so cool. </joey>
<joey> - I remember being next to the
game where you tip the table. </joey>
<garnt> (laughter) </garnt>
<garnt> There's an arcade game in
Japan, where all you do is like, </garnt>
<connor> you have to tip this
table as hard as possible. </connor>
<joey> - You know, in like American arcades, </joey>
<joey> they have the punching machines. </joey>
<garnt> - [Gigguk] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's that, but instead
of punching something, </garnt>
<garnt> you just lift something. </garnt>
<joey> - (laughing) You lift the table. </joey>
<garnt> - You flip it as hard as you can. </garnt>
<joey> - On screen right now,
there'll be a reference. </joey>
<garnt> But yeah, it's really fun and cool. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's very fun, </garnt>
<garnt> - But it's kind of expensive,
cause you get one flip. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And then you better
make that flip count. </garnt>
<garnt> - Better make that flip count.(laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - That sounds fucking amazing. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah.
- It's good, its good. </joey>
<joey> - Only in Japan(indistinct).
- Only in Japan. </joey>
<garnt> - Where else would you wanna flip a table? </garnt>
<garnt> Like </garnt>
<connor> - Where else can you flip a table </connor>
<garnt> in real life and just get away with them? </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - You don't have to clean up the mess. </garnt>
<joey> - Not only get away with
it, but will be rewarded. </joey>
<garnt> (laughter) </garnt>
<garnt> - Well done,(indistinct) high score. </garnt>
<joey> - In your like, home countries, </joey>
<garnt> did you ever have like
these arcades at home, </garnt>
<garnt> where they would like have this
one Japanese arcade machine, </garnt>
<garnt> and like everyone would be on it. </garnt>
<connor> - In Wales, they didn't
but in London they did. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, in London there's a few. </garnt>
<garnt> I remember there was one
arcade machine collect.. </garnt>
<connor> I think it was Bishy Bashy. </connor>
<connor> - I love that game. </connor>
<joey> (crosstalk) </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, but like in London it
was like a really, really old, </connor>
<joey> like arcade. </joey>
<joey> - It was beaten up.
- It was beaten up. </joey>
<joey> And in here, like I didn't
realize there was like, </joey>
<joey> new iterated versions of it. </joey>
<garnt> Yeah, Bishy Bashy is a lot of fun. </garnt>
<garnt> It's just basically like
Mario party on crack. </garnt>
<connor> (laughter) </connor>
<garnt> - With only one mechanic. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - It's like, you have to press
your button in certain ways, </connor>
<joey> but one button. </joey>
<joey> - I mean Bishy Bashy means to hit. </joey>
<connor> - Oh yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Cause there's some, some
games you are just like... </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like I'm spamming
and I love those games. </joey>
<connor> It's a fun game, you should play it, </connor>
<connor> if you ever come here. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it's super fun. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, basically, I feel like
one of the web experiences </garnt>
<garnt> is go to Akihabara, </garnt>
<garnt> but I feel like you'd be missing half that </garnt>
<garnt> by not going to an arcade as well. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, and that's the good thing </joey>
<connor> about Japanese arcades, right? </connor>
<connor> Is that you don't have to go
to Akihabara to experience it. </connor>
<connor> - [Gigguk] No you don't. </connor>
<joey> - They are literally everywhere. </joey>
<joey> - [Gigguk] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Its definitely like a
different gaming experience </joey>
<joey> from normal gaming. </joey>
<connor> In a way that like is hard
to quantify the value of. </connor>
<connor> I guess cause as a gamer, right? </connor>
<connor> I love spending 10 hours
a day playing video games, </connor>
<connor> but I can't spend more
than like four hours </connor>
<connor> in an arcade in Japan. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah.
- It's hard. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, it depends on the game for me. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Gigguk] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, I think nowadays.. </garnt>
<connor> - It's hot as well.
- Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, it's so fucking hot. </joey>
<joey> - And If you're on the
floor where they smoke, </joey>
<joey> like, cause there's always one floor, </joey>
<joey> where you're allowed to smoke. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Oh my God, that floor reeks. </connor>
<joey> - Oh yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> I mean, I feel like nowadays </joey>
<joey> I probably have a little
bit of an easier time </joey>
<joey> because I've kind of
diversified my rhythm game. </joey>
<joey> - Bring headphones, bring headphones. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh yeah.
- Oh yeah, bring headphones. </garnt>
<joey> Bring your own headphones as well. </joey>
<joey> - You need an aux cord basically. </joey>
<joey> - But if you don't, </joey>
<joey> then you're going to try
and play a rhythm game </joey>
<connor> while you're hearing 50 other rhythms. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - At the same time. </joey>
<joey> - I think that's why it's
so hard for me to sit down </joey>
<garnt> or stand is before for like months, </garnt>
<garnt> I didn't use headphones. </garnt>
<garnt> I couldn't get into it. </garnt>
<garnt> But when I put headphones
on, I just do my thing. </garnt>
<garnt> - You're just in your zone, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - For like maybe like an hour, </connor>
<connor> but I can't sit there for too long. </connor>
<connor> - It feels so good. </connor>
<connor> Cause I remember the first
time I tried the piano machine, </connor>
<joey> and I didn't have headphones
and I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> I can't even hear the music. </joey>
<joey> So I'm just, I'm just
playing, press the color. </joey>
<joey> (laughter)
You know what I mean? </joey>
<garnt> Like, there's no rhythm to this game. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just smashing what I see on screen. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - But like with headphones I'm like, </garnt>
<joey> oh, this feels good, this is... </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> - I feel like a fucking
master at playing piano. </joey>
<joey> I'm here, I'm just like, like smashing. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, pretty colors. </joey>
<joey> - So when it comes to
like actual anime games, </joey>
<joey> like games that are based off of anime. </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> - Which ones have you done? </joey>
<joey> Cause we briefly mentioned </joey>
<joey> about the Dragon Ball fighting games, </joey>
<joey> or the Naruto fighting games, </joey>
<joey> but have you guys played any recently? </joey>
<garnt> - I don't think so, </garnt>
<garnt> cause the only games,
anime games I can think of </garnt>
<garnt> that I played recently
are all like mobile games, </garnt>
<joey> or like I Gacha games and you know, </joey>
<joey> do they really count as games? </joey>
<joey> I mean, yes. </joey>
<joey> - They are kind of in a
league of their own, right? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I feel like that's
a separate genre, right? </connor>
<connor> - I'm a pure multi-player slave. </connor>
<garnt> So I think just like no anime
games and like a multiplayer. </garnt>
<joey> - Because the recent
anime game that I played, </joey>
<joey> which apparently no one fucking played was </joey>
<joey> the Fist Of The North Star game. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, cause it was like
a skin on a Yakuza game. </connor>
<joey> - Basically it was done by
the people who did the Yakuza. </joey>
<joey> (crosstalk) </joey>
<joey> And I mean I fucking love
this in a North star. </joey>
<joey> So when I saw that and I was like, </joey>
<joey> Oh it's basically just a Yakuza game. </joey>
<connor> I was like, hell yeah! </connor>
<joey> I played it, that game is so fucking fun. </joey>
<joey> No one played it. </joey>
<connor> - If you like the Yakuza
games, you'll (indistinct). </connor>
<joey> - But here's the thing, </joey>
<joey> I've never played a Yakuza game. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, okay. </joey>
<joey> - I've only heard about Yakuza games, </joey>
<joey> because a lot of my friends like it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - But I was just more drawn to
the fact that it was a first </connor>
<garnt> in an all-star game and
it looked fucking amazing. </garnt>
<connor> - I saw a clip he's like
(mimicking screams). </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, dude, you can do the
(speaks in foreign language) </connor>
<garnt> in the game.
- Oh, my God. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I was like, yes! </garnt>
<joey> It was so fun, so good, I love it. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, but.. </joey>
<garnt> - Did that get localized over to the West? </garnt>
<joey> - I'm pretty sure it did.
- okay. </joey>
<joey> - I saw a few of my
(indistinct) friends playing it. </joey>
<connor> - Okay. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah I saw a few
reviews when it came out, </connor>
<connor> and everybody was just kind of like, </connor>
<connor> yeah, it's a Yakuza game. </connor>
<joey> - [Gigguk] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, do you guys remember
when Jump Falls was announced? </joey>
<garnt> - Oh my God. (laughter) </garnt>
<joey> - The shit storm that caused. </joey>
<garnt> - That was hilarious. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my God. </garnt>
<joey> It was the beautiful irony, </joey>
<garnt> that a game about anime characters </garnt>
<joey> had some of the worst cuts
scenes imaginable.(crosstalk) </joey>
<joey> - I just remember the scene where, </joey>
<garnt> I think it was freezer or
something, just like floating up. </garnt>
<joey> (laughter) </joey>
<joey> - T posing and he's like,
all right I have to go guys. </joey>
<joey> I have to go. </joey>
<connor> - That whole game is junk bro. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, that's the problem
with anime games recently, </joey>
<joey> because I don't know
if the game will be out </joey>
<joey> by the time this episode is out. </joey>
<garnt> But right now I'm doing a
video where I collect a bunch </garnt>
<garnt> of old retro anime games </garnt>
<garnt> that never made it out of Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - To like kind of review anime games, </garnt>
<garnt> because like the general consensus I feel </garnt>
<joey> with anime based games,
at least in the West, </joey>
<joey> is that they're very
much a modern endeavor. </joey>
<joey> It's like only recently that now </joey>
<joey> anime is becoming a lot
more of a mainstream thing </joey>
<joey> in the West that they're
finally starting to capitalize </joey>
<joey> on the Western market. </joey>
<joey> And, but you know, in retrospect, </joey>
<joey> anime games have been
around since like the NES. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - (indistinct) period. </garnt>
<garnt> They just never made it out of Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> But it's so unfortunate that now, </garnt>
<garnt> all these like people in
the West who love anime, </garnt>
<garnt> are finally starting to get
kind of a glimpse into like </garnt>
<garnt> anime based games. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Gigguk] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And yet you get shit like Jump Force, </garnt>
<joey> and One Piece World Seeker. </joey>
<connor> - You got one piece game,
I saw a footage of that. </connor>
<connor> Oh my God, the frame rate was garbage. </connor>
<joey> - Dude, I was kind of looking
forward to that game too. </joey>
<garnt> Cause I'm like maybe
finally we'll get a good </garnt>
<joey> One Piece adventure game. </joey>
<joey> No, we did not. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean the problem with anime games, </garnt>
<garnt> a lot of anime games,
is they just look like </garnt>
<garnt> a quick cash grab. </garnt>
<garnt> You know what I mean?
- Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - They want to make it look triple A, </connor>
<connor> but they're not willing to
put the money in.(crosstalk). </connor>
<garnt> - Like I remember, I
think it was last year, </garnt>
<joey> or the year before there was
like my hero academia game. </joey>
<joey> They all look the same, </joey>
<joey> they all look junky as fuck. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And yeah, I dunno like I haven't like, </joey>
<joey> and then you read some of the reviews, </joey>
<joey> and nothing really sells you on this game, </joey>
<garnt> versus this hey this actual triple A game, </garnt>
<connor> or something that has
nothing to do with anime. </connor>
<garnt> Like I don't have enough
time to play games enough </garnt>
<connor> as it is, let alone play.. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] I'm not playing a shitty game. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.(chuckling) </connor>
<connor> - If you're going to get me off like, </connor>
<joey> the games I'm cripplingly addicted to, </joey>
<joey> it better be fucking good. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Right, right. </connor>
<connor> It better be oak knights.(laughing) </connor>
<joey> - It better be oak knights, </joey>
<joey> Breath of The wild was one game </joey>
<joey> that like managed to tear me away. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, yeah of course, everybody,
everybody(indistinct). </garnt>
<garnt> - The only thing that tears me away, </garnt>
<connor> from like league of legends
is another multiplier thing </connor>
<connor> where I could just keep
grinding and(indistinct). </connor>
<garnt> - I remember when I first
played Breath Of The Wild, </garnt>
<joey> cause when I first
played Breath Of The wild </joey>
<joey> was when I first came to Japan. </joey>
<joey> And I remember it was
great because I was like, </joey>
<joey> it was my first time experiencing Japan, </joey>
<garnt> and seeing all the stuff
and all I can think of is, </garnt>
<connor> I just want to go home, so
I could just...(laughter) </connor>
<garnt> - I had the exact same thing. </garnt>
<garnt> - I need to get to that temple man. </garnt>
<connor> There is a part of the
map that is unexplored, </connor>
<garnt> I want to hit that out. </garnt>
<garnt> - I remember playing in the bathtub. </garnt>
<garnt> Like I was so addicted
that even my bathing, </garnt>
<joey> I had to be playing it. </joey>
<joey> - You had to utilize every
amount of time that you have. </joey>
<joey> - I remember, I was in
that fucking fire dungeon, </joey>
<joey> the wind dungeon thing with.. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Dude it's terrible. </connor>
<joey> - I recently during, at the
beginning of quarantine, </joey>
<joey> I decided to get back
into Breath Of The Wild. </joey>
<connor> But this time I played it on pro mode. </connor>
<connor> - Wow, you're a real gamer,
you are such a gamer. </connor>
<garnt> - I know, epic gamer gold moment, </garnt>
<garnt> but the only difference between
pro mode and regular mode, </garnt>
<garnt> is that on the main HUD, </garnt>
<garnt> like, you know how, when you're
playing Breath Of The Wild </garnt>
<garnt> there's like the mini map in the corner, </garnt>
<garnt> like the temperature, time of day. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Gigguk] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Pro mode basically,
takes all of that away, </garnt>
<garnt> and just shows you your heart. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - So you're forced to
explore and look around. </garnt>
<garnt> And when I played it, I was like, </garnt>
<connor> this is how the game is
supposed to be played, </connor>
<connor> because I discovered more
things in the photo file. </connor>
<connor> - (indistinct) This is the correct way. </connor>
<garnt> (laughter) </garnt>
<garnt> - No, legit because I discovered more shit </garnt>
<garnt> in the first 10 minutes of pro mode, </garnt>
<connor> than I did in the first couple
of hours of regular games. </connor>
<connor> - Damn, what the fuck were
you doing in the regular game? </connor>
<connor> - Because in the regular game mode, </connor>
<connor> you have the mini-map, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So you're forced to like
go to the closer shiny thing </connor>
<garnt> that you see on the mini map. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Whereas on pro mode, </garnt>
<garnt> you have to fucking look
around and I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> Oh shit I didn't know there
was a temple right here, </garnt>
<garnt> like right under my feet, </garnt>
<garnt> because I'm too fucking worried
about going to this tower, </garnt>
<garnt> that the game is telling you to.. </garnt>
<garnt> - Joey is a pro gamer.
(laughter) </garnt>
<garnt> - Dude, at that moment, I was like, </garnt>
<joey> this is epic gamer go mode right here. </joey>
<garnt> - On the topic of anime games though, </garnt>
<joey> how'd you guys feel about visual novels? </joey>
<joey> - I fucking love them. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, have you ever played one? </joey>
<garnt> - No I have not played visual novel? </garnt>
<joey> - I had a moment during high school </joey>
<joey> where all I played was visual novels. </joey>
<connor> - I remember I've booted
them up several times. </connor>
<joey> - [Gigguk] Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - And every single time I
get about five minutes in, </connor>
<connor> I'm like, hey this is
just a book, (laughter) </connor>
<connor> in disguise, trynna trick me into reading. </connor>
<garnt> - This is just a book with extra pictures. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like it's a book with extra steps. </garnt>
<connor> - It's like a novel, but
there's like visuals to it. </connor>
<garnt> What the fuck? </garnt>
<joey> - I think the best example I
ever heard was my friend saying </joey>
<connor> this is just an audio book with pictures. </connor>
<connor> (laughter) </connor>
<connor> - Some of them don't
even have voice acting. </connor>
<connor> - It's an audio book with pictures , </connor>
<connor> but the main character never
has the voice. (laughing) </connor>
<joey> Because they want you to immerse. </joey>
<connor> - I don't know, I'm sure
there's a lot of people </connor>
<connor> that are at home who are
watching this as well </connor>
<joey> who holds her in the same boat as me </joey>
<joey> where I'm like, it's too (indistinct) </joey>
<connor> - I don't blame anybody, </connor>
<joey> Who says that they can't
get into visual novels. </joey>
<connor> - Is it in the same category as gaming? </connor>
<garnt> Like, it can't be, right?
- No. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's what I was gonna say, </garnt>
<connor> cause like, I'm a gamer.(crosstalk) </connor>
<connor> - There's like different
levels, I feel because like </connor>
<garnt> okay so like.. </garnt>
<connor> - Like in a game, I hear you.(chuckling) </connor>
<connor> - No, cause like it took
me like years because, </connor>
<connor> as a kid I would play on my DS. </connor>
<connor> Like I was a Nintendo kid, right. </connor>
<garnt> So I had like a D S, would
like play on that a lot. </garnt>
<garnt> And then it took me years
to realize, wait a minute, </garnt>
<garnt> Phoenix Wright is just a visual novel. </garnt>
<connor> - I never liked Phoenix Wright. </connor>
<garnt> - Did you know? </garnt>
<garnt> - He was trynna trick me into thinking. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh I love Phoenix Wright. </garnt>
<joey> - I love Phoenix Wright. </joey>
<joey> - How dare you trick me into thinking? </joey>
<connor> Let me shoot things. </connor>
<joey> - Where is that high octane
gameplay that I signed up for? </joey>
<joey> - Where is the action? </joey>
<joey> I didn't come here to think, </joey>
<garnt> if I wanted to think I'd play.. </garnt>
<connor> - I didn't come here to read. </connor>
<connor> - I would have played Professor Layton, </connor>
<joey> if I wanted to think. </joey>
<connor> - Hey professor, Layton is
also a really good game. </connor>
<joey> (crosstalk) </joey>
<joey> - I would look at it, I love puzzle games. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But that's why when I
tried to play Phoenix Wright, </joey>
<connor> I'm like this isn't a puzzle game, </connor>
<connor> they're trying to trick me into thinking, </connor>
<connor> I'm using my brain, I'm
just reading the whole time. </connor>
<connor> - Weirdly enough, I got into visual novels </connor>
<garnt> because I really heavily
gone into Arrow Gaze. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> - (clapping) Yes, yes, yes. </garnt>
<garnt> - I started with Arrow Gaze and then.. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's my brother, that's my brother. </garnt>
<joey> - I started with Arrow Gaze obviously, </joey>
<joey> because I am a 13 year old
horny boy on(indistinct). </joey>
<connor> - What, the first visual
novel that you played? </connor>
<garnt> - Why don't you just watch
porn if you are horny? </garnt>
<connor> - I did. </connor>
<connor> - You were you in Google,
you have all the Google, </connor>
<garnt> and you think I want to read the porn. </garnt>
<garnt> (crosstalk) </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, okay, before you get
to the porn, you need to like, </garnt>
<garnt> it doesn't feel as good if you just, </garnt>
<garnt> if they just hand it to you, right. </garnt>
<garnt> (crosstalk) </garnt>
<garnt> You earned that shit. </garnt>
<joey> - You don't read the porn,
you experience the porn. </joey>
<connor> - So how old were you
guys when you've gotten </connor>
<connor> into this festival? </connor>
<joey> - Arrow Gaze? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like 14.
- 13, 14. </joey>
<connor> - When I was 14, right? </connor>
<connor> My mum could have come in the
room at any second, right? </connor>
<joey> This needed to be like
special ops precision. </joey>
<joey> I needed to get in and out, </joey>
<joey> and get the deep done, because you know, </joey>
<joey> did you have like two
floors through the house? </joey>
<joey> - No, I have one floor. </joey>
<joey> No, no, I had two floors, but
we're all on the same floor. </joey>
<joey> - Okay so my bedroom is
on the second, right? </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> - Where I had about a five second window, </joey>
<joey> where I could here the stairs creaking. </joey>
<joey> I didn't know which
room she was going into, </joey>
<connor> but just in case I had
to prepare every time. </connor>
<joey> - During those five seconds, </joey>
<connor> it's just the Mission Impossible
theme playing in your head. </connor>
<joey> It's like what do I do? </joey>
<joey> - I had like a whole
setup ready just in case, </joey>
<joey> my mum was going to
walk in the room, right? </joey>
<joey> And it was playing with.. </joey>
<connor> How did you have the time
to get into a story, right? </connor>
<connor> And without any of your parents
finding you watching porn? </connor>
<joey> - Because I was one of those kids </joey>
<connor> that had a lock on his door. </connor>
<connor> - Your parents give you a lock? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Bro, my parents would
never give me a lock. </connor>
<connor> - Actually like the only computer we had </connor>
<connor> in my household was like
the family computer. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I'd use the family laptop. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - So I was watching porn
on the family laptop. </connor>
<connor> - Because my dad was been working </connor>
<garnt> in an IT company for 30 years, </garnt>
<garnt> so he gave everybody
like our own computers. </garnt>
<garnt> - He had it on easy mode.(laughter) </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - He didn't have to like walk
around schedules or anything. </garnt>
<garnt> - But like, I knew because
my parents would always, </garnt>
<garnt> they would always be out in several like, </garnt>
<garnt> specific hours of the day for work. </garnt>
<garnt> So I'd be like, okay, it's
Arrow Gaze time.(laughter) </garnt>
<connor> - I would just like 10
minutes, get the deed done, </connor>
<connor> go back to gaming. </connor>
<joey> - I don't even remember what
the first Arrow Gaze was </joey>
<garnt> that I played, it was(indistinct). </garnt>
<garnt> - I remember what it was for me. </garnt>
<joey> It was called the Sagara
Family or something like that. </joey>
<connor> - That sounds ghetto or something. </connor>
<connor> - How I discovered it, right? </connor>
<connor> This is like going before Arrow Gaze </connor>
<garnt> but it was technically Arrow Gaze. </garnt>
<garnt> Did you guys ever go through that phase </garnt>
<garnt> where you're just playing shitty, </garnt>
<garnt> like henti visual novels on new grounds? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah.
- Frank's adventure?(laughter) </joey>
<garnt> That was the shit. </garnt>
<garnt> Are you kidding me?(laughter) </garnt>
<garnt> (indistinct) </garnt>
<garnt> (crosstalk) </garnt>
<garnt> - Henti sex kid or something like that? </garnt>
<connor> - I feel like this was two hobbies, </connor>
<connor> that you shouldn't have
combined at a young age. </connor>
<connor> Like I wanted a game. </connor>
<garnt> - That just like blew the
biggest wave of nostalgia in me. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I knew(indistinct). </garnt>
<garnt> - Of course I do. </garnt>
<garnt> Oh you go onto new grounds
and you see that like </garnt>
<garnt> red letter a, I was like,
it's my game boys let's go. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughter) </garnt>
<garnt> It was so good, it was
like it was so shitty </garnt>
<joey> because you know this was made by like, </joey>
<joey> one dude living in like
the middle of fucking like, </joey>
<garnt> you know Winnie Peg. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Gigguk] Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - In like his mom's basement being like, </garnt>
<joey> I'm gonna make a really
shitty like hentai flash game. </joey>
<garnt> - But like, as a kid at that time, </garnt>
<joey> that was like the only
exposure you can get. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - So you were just like, holy shit. </garnt>
<joey> - I was too afraid at that moment, </joey>
<joey> to like go on to Google images. </joey>
<joey> Cause I didn't know how to
search for that shit, right? </joey>
<garnt> (crosstalk) </garnt>
<connor> - So you're telling me, you
know how to find porn games, </connor>
<connor> but you didn't know how to find porn? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah because on new grounds
they have an entire section. </joey>
<garnt> I don't know if it's still to this day, </garnt>
<garnt> but back then on new grounds, </garnt>
<garnt> there was an entire adult section </garnt>
<garnt> that clearly just said "Adult". </garnt>
<garnt> - [Gigguk] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - So you knew that, </garnt>
<garnt> if you clicked on that
part of the website, </garnt>
<garnt> every game or animation that came up, </garnt>
<garnt> was going to be of that caliber. </garnt>
<garnt> - Exactly, and they were all hentai games. </garnt>
<garnt> - They were all hentai games. </garnt>
<garnt> - Why don't you watch porn? </garnt>
<joey> I don't understand. </joey>
<joey> - Because you don't
know how to look it up. </joey>
<joey> - What do you mean? </joey>
<garnt> You know what porn is.. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, Because porn hub
didn't exist, you know.. </garnt>
<connor> - Wait, when did porn hub come around? </connor>
<connor> - I don't know, Like.. </connor>
<joey> - when I was like 16, maybe. </joey>
<garnt> This is (indistinct) </garnt>
<garnt> but this was before the age of streaming. </garnt>
<joey> - Okay, like in anime
boomer, right?(laughter) </joey>
<garnt> - No, like so what do you
do if you need to find porn, </garnt>
<connor> but you can't stream it. </connor>
<connor> When did Google get popularized? </connor>
<connor> Cause I remember back then
I was probably using Yahoo, </connor>
<connor> or Ask Jeeves. </connor>
<garnt> - Yahoo, Ask Jeeves. </garnt>
<connor> - Jeeves, where is the porn? </connor>
<garnt> - Where is Brazzers Jeeves, I'm wondering. </garnt>
<connor> - Cause the reason I
discovered Sagara family, </connor>
<joey> was because you know,
in those hentai visual </joey>
<garnt> like the new ground visual novels, </garnt>
<garnt> you don't (crosstalk). </garnt>
<garnt> You know what I'm talking about Connor? </garnt>
<garnt> - I know what you're talking about. </garnt>
<garnt> - They would always like, </garnt>
<joey> the porn part would always be these gifs, </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> and then I saw one of the
comments and they were like, </joey>
<garnt> they sourced the gif. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah.
- I'm like, yeah. Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> And so that's what introduced
me to the world of Arrow Gaze. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's how I found my
first Arrow Gaze as well, </garnt>
<garnt> because I played like Frank's adventure </garnt>
<garnt> or whatever the fuck it was. </garnt>
<joey> And there was a section where it's like </joey>
<joey> you walk into a cinema, but
like the cinema is mosaic </joey>
<joey> and you have to get like a special item </joey>
<joey> from someone to like, unlock the mosaic. </joey>
<garnt> And when you finally did, </garnt>
<garnt> it was this like gif of
this like, oh, this image. </garnt>
<joey> It wasn't even a gif because
I was from an Arrow Gaze. </joey>
<joey> It was just this gif or this PNG of just </joey>
<garnt> this like really old
like nineties Arrow Gaze. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Gigguk] Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And my 13 year old
brain was like, fuck yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> What is that? </garnt>
<connor> Give me the sauce. </connor>
<connor> (crosstalk) </connor>
<connor> And I scroll to the comments, </connor>
<garnt> and of course there was that
one also a horny on main </garnt>
<garnt> 13 year old, and he was like,
hey, at this part of the game, </garnt>
<joey> where she from? </joey>
<garnt> - Where does this image come from? </garnt>
<garnt> - And of course there
was this culture boy, </garnt>
<garnt> who was like, my man's, I got you. </garnt>
<garnt> Probably from Reddit
or fortune at the time, </garnt>
<joey> he was like, I got you bro. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I came from the A board. </garnt>
<joey> That's where all the source is. </joey>
<joey> And then I would finally look it up. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And of course back then, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> the wild wild West of the internet. </garnt>
<joey> You could get games like that very easily. </joey>
<garnt> - You can get it easily. </garnt>
<garnt> You just took like two
millennia to download. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - Cause I remember like because
I could only download it </garnt>
<garnt> when my parents were out. </garnt>
<garnt> - What is two gigabyte download, son? </garnt>
<garnt> (laughter) </garnt>
<garnt> - It was like gigabytes, and I'm like, </garnt>
<joey> Oh, this is gonna take time. </joey>
<joey> So back then, like I would have
to like plan this shit out. </joey>
<garnt> This is like scheduled. </garnt>
<garnt> Okay yeah, you had a bell. </garnt>
<garnt> - (indistinct) special ops operation. </garnt>
<garnt> (crosstalk) You had about
40 different dot RAR files, </garnt>
<garnt> and you need to download
them one at a time.(laughter) </garnt>
<garnt> Cause you couldn't
download one massive pile. </garnt>
<joey> You had to download like.. </joey>
<joey> - That hit too close to home for me, men. </joey>
<joey> And I hated it when you
would go into the website, </joey>
<joey> and it's like, you can only download, </joey>
<joey> you would download part one of 76 raw file </joey>
<joey> and you finally get it, and
you realize it's like 200 Meg. </joey>
<joey> It's like, all right,
that won't take too long, </joey>
<joey> and you download it and you
go to download part two, </joey>
<joey> and it's like, you have to wait 15 minutes </joey>
<joey> for the next one.(laughter) </joey>
<garnt> I'm just like god damn it. </garnt>
<connor> - So like.. </connor>
<connor> - These are struggles
I do not identify with. </connor>
<connor> - So like when I actually
done it and sometimes like </connor>
<connor> one of the parts would be
missing, and it was just the most, </connor>
<connor> it was the most angry
moment you can think of. </connor>
<connor> Cause you've downloaded 40 files, </connor>
<connor> you just need one more file. </connor>
<joey> You, go on WinRAR you try to
extract it, there's an error. </joey>
<joey> What the fuck do you do? </joey>
<joey> - Exactly. </joey>
<joey> - I remember so many times I would.. </joey>
<joey> (crosstalk) </joey>
<joey> - I remember so many times. </joey>
<connor> - I just wanted that last piece. </connor>
<connor> - Because when you've invested
so much time downloading this </connor>
<connor> and there's just one file. </connor>
<garnt> There were so many hentai
games I've never played, </garnt>
<garnt> cause there's just one file missing. </garnt>
<garnt> And I couldn't find the problem. </garnt>
<joey> - Because that's the
problem, it's like unlike, </joey>
<joey> you know, previously we talked
about like how part three </joey>
<joey> out of eight of this
anime movie was missing. </joey>
<joey> You could still watch
the other seven parts. </joey>
<joey> But with Arrow Gaze, with WinRaR, </joey>
<joey> you missing one part you
can't play any of them. </joey>
<connor> - It just sounds like
fucking Harry Potter hunting </connor>
<garnt> down the(indistinct). </garnt>
<garnt> - Like I just realized
how close that story was </garnt>
<garnt> to the YouTube story that
we told a few weeks ago </garnt>
<connor> about watching animate in parts. </connor>
<garnt> But imagine, if you're missing one part, </garnt>
<joey> you just don't watch the
entire series.(laughter) </joey>
<joey> - You can't watch the entire movie. </joey>
<connor> It's like you're missing part three, </connor>
<joey> you can't open part one. </joey>
<connor> - Sounds like a message from
God to be a good Christian boy. </connor>
<joey> - And that's why when all those parts </joey>
<garnt> did successfully download
and did successfully extract, </garnt>
<garnt> and you booted it up the
moment a window popped up </garnt>
<garnt> and it wasn't like spyware. </garnt>
<joey> It was just like, yes. </joey>
<joey> Now I can finally put in the time, </joey>
<joey> that I'd spent so long trying to get, </joey>
<garnt> and I did put in the
time no matter how shitty </garnt>
<garnt> the Arrow Gaze was. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause I remember my first couple of, </garnt>
<garnt> I didn't know what a good
Arrow Gaze was at the time. </garnt>
<garnt> I just downloaded whatever
the fuck the I saw </garnt>
<joey> on Huguenots at the time. </joey>
<garnt> - It was a victory. </garnt>
<garnt> The fact that you got it
working and you were like, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm gonna play this and
I'm gonna fucking enjoy it. </garnt>
<garnt> And it was amazing. </garnt>
<joey> - I'm gonna 100% complete
this shit if it kills me. </joey>
<connor> - Damn, I was just playing(indistinct) </connor>
<garnt> (laughter) </garnt>
<joey> You guys go and you guys saw you </joey>
<joey> go through a fucking mission </joey>
<joey> just to get something working. </joey>
<joey> - But it was so worth it. </joey>
<connor> - Just to see like what,
one third of a tootie tit? </connor>
<garnt> - That's what it was, men. </garnt>
<garnt> - Cause that was like how hard it was, </garnt>
<garnt> to get porn back in the day. </garnt>
<connor> - Like go go rune scape,
selling GF, buying GF? </connor>
<connor> - Actually I have a funny story on that. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh shit, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no, because like, okay, </garnt>
<garnt> this is like when I was a kid, right? </garnt>
<garnt> And like when you first discover, </garnt>
<connor> like the concept of like
sex and porn and like, </connor>
<connor> I didn't like we had dial
up internet back then. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, same, same. </connor>
<connor> - But like this was going back </connor>
<connor> when I was like nine, 10, you know, </connor>
<connor> before I could really like
have time to work on a computer </connor>
<connor> and everything like that. </connor>
<connor> So I would like the only way I could get </connor>
<connor> anything close to that was </connor>
<garnt> by watching like late night
TV shows right in the UK. </garnt>
<garnt> So, what I try to do as a kid was, </garnt>
<garnt> I would record shows on my VHS. </garnt>
<garnt> - I did that as well.
- okay, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, but there's was this one show, </garnt>
<garnt> cause I looked at the TV guide, </garnt>
<garnt> there was this one show. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh I think you did what I did. </garnt>
<garnt> - There was this one show that was like, </garnt>
<garnt> Ooh this sounds spicy as a kid, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, Ooh, this sounds
exactly what I'm looking for. </garnt>
<garnt> It was a late night TV
show aired at like 12. </garnt>
<connor> - Is it, can I say the title? </connor>
<garnt> - Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - Is it called Babe Station? </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no, no. </garnt>
<connor> - That was the one in UK. </connor>
<joey> - Let's talk about that later. </joey>
<joey> - I probably would have
enjoyed Babe Station more. </joey>
<joey> The show was called, Sex In The City. </joey>
<joey> (laughter) </joey>
<joey> So me being a nine year old kid, </joey>
<garnt> thinking I'm about to get porn right now. </garnt>
<garnt> And then I set my VHS up, </garnt>
<garnt> I go to sleep the VHS records, </garnt>
<garnt> and I've never been more
disappointed as a kid.(laughter) </garnt>
<joey> Like, imagine it as a kid, </joey>
<garnt> you think you're about to get full on sex, </garnt>
<garnt> for the first time. </garnt>
<garnt> - In the city.
- In the city </garnt>
<garnt> - And the city, right? </garnt>
<garnt> And you just get a bunch of girls </garnt>
<garnt> talking about Dick and shoes. </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, what is this? </garnt>
<garnt> This is false advertising. </garnt>
<garnt> Do you know how much
effort I had to put in </garnt>
<garnt> to record this show
and this is what I get. </garnt>
<joey> - I remember as well, </joey>
<joey> I was like a 12 year old, 13 year old. </joey>
<joey> And just hearing that like my mom's friend </joey>
<garnt> whose favorite show was Sex in the City, </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, that's not
very Christian of you, </garnt>
<garnt> what the fuck?(laughter) </garnt>
<joey> Man, adults are scary. </joey>
<joey> (indistinct) hold on. </joey>
<joey> We got to hear about what
the fuck Babe Station is. </joey>
<connor> - So Babe Station is a
channel in the UK, right? </connor>
<garnt> And it would air, like what? </garnt>
<garnt> Like 11 30? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, something like. </garnt>
<garnt> - (indistinct) Just like girls
on a couch, like half naked. </garnt>
<garnt> And then they would
occasionally take off that bra. </garnt>
<garnt> But the whole time you
wouldn't hear anything. </garnt>
<garnt> You would just here like porn music, </garnt>
<connor> but they were calling someone, </connor>
<connor> you could call in and talk to them. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - And there's some good videos on YouTube, </connor>
<connor> People trolling them, right. </connor>
<connor> That's pretty funny, but
I was like a 14 year old, </connor>
<connor> and I was like, damn. </connor>
<garnt> - It's basically chatter bates before.. </garnt>
<connor> - On TV.
- On TV. </connor>
<garnt> - But you can't hear what they're saying. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Because they're talking to someone. </connor>
<garnt> Occasionally they would let
you hear the audio.(indistinct) </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah.(laughter) </garnt>
<garnt> - This is where you could be having, </garnt>
<garnt> that was 12-year old me,
I'm never gonna call them. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my God, yeah, cause I remember </garnt>
<connor> after family guy would
air, so I would like </connor>
<joey> tape a family guy episode, </joey>
<connor> just to leave it running,
you know(chuckling). </connor>
<connor> - Just nonchalantly, yeah. </connor>
<joey> I noticed actually that
light UK TV at night, </joey>
<connor> really like holds (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> (crosstalk) </connor>
<connor> - Porn on so many channels(indistinct) </connor>
<connor> - Because Archie and I
only recently discovered, </connor>
<garnt> thanks to Martia, about
the show Naked Attraction. </garnt>
<joey> (crosstalk) </joey>
<garnt> Yeah, you showed that to me. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<joey> Naked attraction is basically this.. </joey>
<garnt> - You've seen this?
- I have not. </garnt>
<connor> - The show, it's a show on UK televisual. </connor>
<joey> I don't know what time it
is, I assume it's like.. </joey>
<connor> - It's on channel four about like 9:00 PM. </connor>
<joey> - But basically it's this game
show where a guy or a girl </joey>
<joey> would come onto the show, </joey>
<joey> looking for a boyfriend or a girlfriend. </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> And in the case with
like say a boy coming on, </joey>
<joey> looking for a girlfriend,
what they would do is </joey>
<garnt> they would show five different girls, </garnt>
<garnt> but they would be butt naked. </garnt>
<garnt> - Completely naked. </garnt>
<garnt> - Completely naked.
- Seriously? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah like, no mosaic, completely naked. </garnt>
<joey> And what they would do is they
would start from the down up. </joey>
<joey> So what they would do is, </joey>
<joey> they would first show below the belt. </joey>
<joey> - [Gigguk] Right. </joey>
<connor> - And then the guy was.. </connor>
<connor> - And you could see everything. </connor>
<joey> - You could see everything. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, okay. </joey>
<joey> - And the guy will go, would be like, hmm, </joey>
<connor> okay, I like that genitalia. </connor>
<connor> I don't like that genitalia. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And then at that point,
just from looking at like </connor>
<garnt> the genitalia, they have to
be like no to this person. </garnt>
<garnt> And then they would go up to the tits </garnt>
<joey> and then they would show the face, </joey>
<joey> and then that would reveal the voice. </joey>
<joey> And at the end, when there's
the last two people remaining, </joey>
<joey> like last two contestants remaining, </joey>
<joey> the guy or girl who like
originally came onto the show, </joey>
<joey> they have to also come out naked. </joey>
<joey> - [Gigguk] Oh. </joey>
<connor> - And then, as they're naked they have to </connor>
<connor> pick one of the two and
then they go on a date. </connor>
<connor> - It's really awful. </connor>
<connor> - And I watched it, and
Archie and I were like, </connor>
<connor> this is the most amazing
show I've ever seen. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it's called
Naked Attraction I think? </connor>
<connor> - Naked attraction, yeah. </connor>
<connor> And there's clips of it on YouTube. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - How are they getting away with it? </garnt>
<garnt> - There's entire seasons of it on YouTube, </garnt>
<garnt> and I don't understand how
they're getting away with it. </garnt>
<garnt> Like we get like, </garnt>
<garnt> I guarantee this episode
is gonna get(indistinct) </garnt>
<garnt> and yet whole episodes of naked attraction </garnt>
<garnt> can be on YouTube, and YouTube is like, </garnt>
<garnt> well, I guess it's a TV show. </garnt>
<garnt> So I guess it's okay. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, but I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> I thought I was going to hate it at first, </garnt>
<joey> because just from the concept,
it sounds absolutely trashy </joey>
<connor> - But it makes you like
the worst person ever. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Cause you're like, oh wow, </joey>
<connor> their feet are slightly disformed, </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna have to(indistinct). </connor>
<joey> - It's not even their feet, it's like, </joey>
<joey> Oh, that pussy is a little mangled. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh God.
- Oh my God, oh. </garnt>
<garnt> - And you have to say that
in front of the person, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, I would never
be able to(indistinct). </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't think I have the
self-confidence(indistinct). </garnt>
<garnt> (crosstalk) </garnt>
<garnt> - But these are like just
chill people, normal people, </garnt>
<connor> and they go on and they're just like, </connor>
<connor> (indistinct)just spice it up a little bit. </connor>
<connor> There's spicing it up love, </connor>
<connor> and then there's getting naked </connor>
<connor> in front of the entire
country, there's an in between. </connor>
<connor> - I'm like, is it really worth it </connor>
<connor> for the 15 minutes of fame? </connor>
<joey> If you have to show your
naked body(indistinct) </joey>
<connor> - And they show you a little
bit of a date afterwards </connor>
<joey> and they are always fucking awful. </joey>
<garnt> - It's so awkward, it's so awkward. </garnt>
<joey> - It's like, hi, hi(indistinct) </joey>
<joey> - So, yeah. I hear you think
(indistinct) win tower defense? </joey>
<garnt> How'd you go on a day after you've just </garnt>
<garnt> Commented on their like
weirdly shaped penis. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<joey> My favorite though is when
they do finally pick a winner </joey>
<connor> and it's that awkward hug. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, they do an awkward hug. </connor>
<connor> - They do an awkward hug
to the person who lost. </connor>
<connor> - Like oh, thank you, you chose me. </connor>
<connor> - But it's so funny how
back both of their like.. </connor>
<garnt> (crosstalk) </garnt>
<garnt> That their genitalia don't
touch as they hug each other. </garnt>
<joey> And the host is just watching it. </joey>
<joey> And she's just like,
all right, fuck off now. </joey>
<connor> - (indistinct) that woman, </connor>
<connor> she does all the channel four shows. </connor>
<connor> She did a Big Brother. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh, Davina McCall? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, Davina McCall. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And she's really big name in the UK. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, she's a good host. </joey>
<connor> - It's kinda weird that
she kinda got relegated </connor>
<connor> to the see team. </connor>
<joey> - I didn't know she did big brother, </joey>
<joey> but now I know that it
totally makes sense. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, going back to
visual novels though, </garnt>
<garnt> we got very sidetracked. </garnt>
<garnt> What was it like the first visual novel </garnt>
<garnt> that you played then,
that you would consider </garnt>
<garnt> not going through your trashy
Arrow Gaze teenager phase. </garnt>
<garnt> Oh my God, this is hentai. </garnt>
<joey> - I think the first one I played
knowing exactly what it was </joey>
<garnt> and enjoying the fuck out of it was Kanon. </garnt>
<garnt> - Kanon, oh okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, because I think
it was weird, right? </garnt>
<garnt> I kind of discovered
the Kanon visual novel </garnt>
<connor> after I watched air. </connor>
<connor> - [Gigguk] Right. </connor>
<connor> - What is this stuff by the way? </connor>
<connor> Cause I have no idea(indistinct) </connor>
<garnt> - It's from the same guy. </garnt>
<garnt> - Its from the same
people who made Clan ad. </garnt>
<connor> - I know that, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So before clan ad visual
arts made a number of games, </connor>
<joey> One of them being Air, </joey>
<joey> which I watched the anime of </joey>
<joey> and I first discovered
what visual arts is. </joey>
<joey> And I was like, Oh, I want to see, </joey>
<joey> oh, this is based off a game. </joey>
<joey> I couldn't find, I remember
I couldn't find the </joey>
<joey> air visual novel anywhere. </joey>
<joey> - [Gigguk] Right. </joey>
<joey> - But I found Kanon,
which is the first game </joey>
<joey> that they ever made. </joey>
<joey> So I played Kanon, </joey>
<joey> and of course, if you
know the story of Kanon, </joey>
<garnt> I cry like a bitch, obviously. </garnt>
<garnt> But I was like, the first
time in my life, I was like, </garnt>
<joey> wow, visual novels are
really fucking long. </joey>
<joey> (laughter) Because
Kanon not only has like, </joey>
<garnt> seven different endings, but
just to get to one ending, </garnt>
<garnt> it takes about 30 hours. </garnt>
<joey> - Almost like a book. </joey>
<connor> - It is. </connor>
<connor> - [Gigguk] Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - It's like reading seven
different books at once. </joey>
<connor> - That's how they get you, man. </connor>
<connor> I mean people who play
the same visual novel </connor>
<connor> over and over again. </connor>
<garnt> And I'm like, what's wrong with you? </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, I did that.(laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Go outside, go and do
something productive. </garnt>
<joey> Go and play eight hours of
league of legends, be happy. </joey>
<joey> - I played the clan of
visual novel as well, </joey>
<joey> just to get to the true ending,
it takes like 200 hours. </joey>
<connor> - Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> - But-
- You did that? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- What's wrong with you? </connor>
<joey> - Because I was so invested in the story, </joey>
<joey> because once you get invested, </joey>
<joey> that's the thing with the secret visual. </joey>
<joey> - How old were you? </joey>
<joey> - When I played Konan? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Uh, 15. </joey>
<connor> - How the fuck do you
have the patience for that </connor>
<joey> as a 15 year old? </joey>
<joey> Because I used to read
a lot of books anyway. </joey>
<joey> - Because you find time. </joey>
<connor> - What do you do as a 15 year old? </connor>
<garnt> - As a 15 year old, like
200 hours means nothing. </garnt>
<connor> - Wow, Halo just came out,
I think for me, like it's.. </connor>
<joey> - I don't wanna to be
like those normy scum </joey>
<connor> who play Halo. </connor>
<joey> I wanted to be a different one. </joey>
<joey> I wanted to embrace my weird bro. </joey>
<joey> - There's nothing better than </joey>
<connor> pissing your friends off at school </connor>
<connor> by like destroying all their (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I mean, I would do that at school, </connor>
<joey> but then I would come home
and be like, you know what, </joey>
<garnt> I miss you Nagi so I wanna know </garnt>
<connor> what happens to you baby girl. </connor>
<joey> - Okay, I had friends
in my friend group who </joey>
<joey> we would always play X-Box together, </joey>
<joey> but there's always that one friend, </joey>
<joey> we were great friends with, </joey>
<joey> never hear from him when he goes home. </joey>
<joey> You were that kid. </joey>
<connor> - I was that kid. </connor>
<garnt> I was in my room just like
continuously, pressing space bar, </garnt>
<joey> I'm playing Clan ad. </joey>
<garnt> - Huh, Oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because it's so good. </garnt>
<garnt> - Check out this gameplay. </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Click, click ,click. </garnt>
<garnt> - And then after, and then
halfway through Clan ad </garnt>
<garnt> I realized the auto function, </garnt>
<garnt> so I don't even have to click anything. </garnt>
<garnt> I was just, I was just sitting there, </garnt>
<joey> I was like watching a movie. </joey>
<joey> I was like, Oh, hell yeah, dude, let's go. </joey>
<garnt> - It was just like watching
a movie with extra words. </garnt>
<joey> - I don't think I'd be
able to play a visual novel </joey>
<garnt> like that now though. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no. </garnt>
<joey> - Which is unfortunate. </joey>
<garnt> - Cause it's like watching
anime nowadays, right? </garnt>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<garnt> - You can't watch an
anime that's over like </garnt>
<garnt> 13 episodes without
having to fully commit. </garnt>
<joey> - Right, and it's
unfortunate because like, </joey>
<joey> especially in the last couple of years, </joey>
<joey> I know there's been some
fucking amazing visual novels </joey>
<joey> that have come out. </joey>
<joey> Which I know if I put the
time in, I would fucking love. </joey>
<connor> - [Gigguk] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But it's just unfortunate
now that a lot of these, </connor>
<connor> take like a hundred plus hours, </connor>
<connor> and I know I would have no time. </connor>
<joey> - This sounds like hell to me, </joey>
<garnt> this sounds like hell. </garnt>
<connor> - (indistinct) Question to you Connor, </connor>
<garnt> did you not play Doki
Doki when that came out? </garnt>
<garnt> - No. </garnt>
<garnt> - You missed the Doki Doki. </garnt>
<connor> - I saw it and I was like,
cool girl kills herself. </connor>
<connor> Everyone's happy about it. </connor>
<joey> - Doki doki though, </joey>
<joey> I would recommend because it's
only like five or six hours. </joey>
<garnt> - (indistinct)shorter one, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> It's like a good gateway one. </connor>
<joey> - When that blew up, I just
had on the tell flashbacks </joey>
<joey> on YouTube when that blew up(crosstalk). </joey>
<joey> Cause it was that kind of audience </joey>
<joey> that was getting attracted to it. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, people are
only attracted to this, </joey>
<joey> cause it's the first time </joey>
<joey> they're seeing anything
remotely gory, that's it. </joey>
<joey> - I guarantee it, yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> - I'm sure, there's way
better visual novels </joey>
<joey> than Doki Doki, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, oh a hundred percent. </joey>
<connor> - Right, right, exactly. </connor>
<connor> - But to them it was like the first time </connor>
<connor> that they were playing a visual novel </connor>
<joey> that was also like kind of mind tripping. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, you guys clearly
haven't played(indistinct) </joey>
<joey> because that will fuck you up. </joey>
<garnt> - I was about to say I think like a good, </garnt>
<joey> I dunno a good gateway,
a not good gateway, </joey>
<joey> visual novel is Son of Utah. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Because that's the
visual of all that just </joey>
<joey> hits the ground running. </joey>
<joey> You know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> Like it has a really interesting concept, </joey>
<joey> but it is fucked up. </joey>
<joey> - It is fucked up. </joey>
<joey> - So this is a visual novel
written by Guinera Bucci, </joey>
<joey> who is the same guy who
wrote the in Doka Magica , </joey>
<joey> Fate Zero, Psychopaths. </joey>
<joey> And the concept is about this
guy, I think he wakes up. </joey>
<connor> - I think he wakes. </connor>
<connor> - (laughing) I can't
remember the exact beginning, </connor>
<connor> cause the concept is, there's
just this guy who all he sees, </connor>
<connor> is just this hellish landscape. </connor>
<connor> Like it's like grotesque. </connor>
<connor> Like there are like intestines. </connor>
<connor> - America.(laughter) </connor>
<connor> - I'm sorry, I'm gonna get
killed for that.(laughter) </connor>
<joey> - There's just like intestines </joey>
<joey> on the walls and just
like veins popping out. </joey>
<connor> - It's very (indistinct). </connor>
<connor> - It's like this, it's like a scene </connor>
<connor> from Silent Hills or something like that. </connor>
<connor> Some of the most hellish
scenes from silent Hills </connor>
<connor> and the only thing that's normal </connor>
<connor> is this like one little Lolly. </connor>
<connor> That's just like, she's
the only normal thing, </connor>
<connor> in this hellish landscape. </connor>
<connor> Cause like every other person is just like </connor>
<connor> just also hellish blob
that he can't understand. </connor>
<connor> So the only person that
he can communicate with </connor>
<connor> is this lolly. </connor>
<connor> And then that to me just
drew me in immediately. </connor>
<connor> Right, because it was like, </connor>
<connor> cause it was like, yeah, what's going on? </connor>
<connor> Damn, why is it this way? </connor>
<connor> And like that's what I
look for in a visual novel. </connor>
<connor> Cause a lot of the problems I see </connor>
<connor> with a lot of visual
novels, Doki Doki included, </connor>
<connor> is that the beginning's like very similar, </connor>
<connor> where she's like, ha,
here's a high school. </connor>
<connor> - It's a normal setting. </connor>
<connor> - Here's all the characters. </connor>
<joey> And you know, it takes
that time to get invested </joey>
<joey> in the story.
- Right. </joey>
<joey> - Once you do, it's fucking great. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But, Son of Utah if
you can handle a bit, </joey>
<garnt> if you're not squeamish then and you know, </garnt>
<garnt> you can handle a bit more, you know </garnt>
<garnt> your stomach's a bit stronger. </garnt>
<joey> - If You can get past the gore, </joey>
<joey> Son of Utah has a fantastic visual novel. </joey>
<garnt> - It's fucking great. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like great story, great characters, </garnt>
<garnt> everything about it is awesome. </garnt>
<joey> Hey guys, this episode of
the Trash Taste podcast, </joey>
<joey> is proudly sponsored by CDJapan. </joey>
<garnt> CDJapan is the best place to order </garnt>
<garnt> Japanese CDs DVDs
Blu-rays and collectibles. </garnt>
<garnt> They offer the widest variety of major </garnt>
<garnt> and independent J rock and J-pop music </garnt>
<garnt> that you can find anywhere. </garnt>
<connor> - [Connor] Not only are
they an E-commerce site, </connor>
<connor> they also have a proxy shipping service </connor>
<connor> that is easily the most popular offer. </connor>
<garnt> - So basically to explain proxy shipping </garnt>
<garnt> if there's certain items
that you can only get, </garnt>
<garnt> if you're in Japan, like for example, </garnt>
<garnt> we recently bought a lot of Jojo merge </garnt>
<garnt> that you could only get in Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> Do you want to explain what
you've bought from Japan? </garnt>
<connor> - I mean, we have the
watch that Joey's wear. </connor>
<garnt> - Hell yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Let's say if you wanted
those sweet Jojo suits </garnt>
<garnt> that I posted on my Twitter, </garnt>
<connor> couldn't get that unless
you live in Japan. </connor>
<connor> But if there was a proxy service, </connor>
<garnt> you'd be able to get a hold of those. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, so all you need to
do is give them the link </garnt>
<garnt> to whatever products you
want and they will buy it, </garnt>
<garnt> and ship it for you straight
to wherever you live. </garnt>
<joey> - And the good thing is in case
you didn't get any of that, </joey>
<joey> then on the website as well, </joey>
<joey> they give you a step-by-step guide, </joey>
<joey> on how proxy services work. </joey>
<joey> So you fully understand how to
get the necessary equipment, </joey>
<joey> and much that you're looking for. </joey>
<garnt> - So basically if you see anything </garnt>
<joey> on our shelves that you can find online, </joey>
<joey> that might not be
available on that website, </joey>
<garnt> then you can use the
proxy shipping service. </garnt>
<connor> - We've also heard that
their customer service </connor>
<connor> is extraordinary and
it's one of the aspects </connor>
<connor> that they care most about of the service. </connor>
<joey> - And of course, with the recent events </joey>
<joey> that have been going on in the world, </joey>
<joey> they've also done a really
good job to keep everything </joey>
<joey> up to date for all of the customers, </joey>
<joey> including all their social media, </joey>
<joey> and of course the
affirmation Customer service. </joey>
<joey> So you can be sure that you're
in some pretty good hands. </joey>
<connor> - There's tons of different
delivery methods on the website, </connor>
<connor> such as DHL, FedEx. </connor>
<connor> So no matter what you
ordered, you can guarantee </connor>
<connor> that you will get it
safely and in one piece. </connor>
<garnt> - And no matter where you live as well, </garnt>
<garnt> they will make sure your item gets to you. </garnt>
<connor> - Let's see what Jojo stuff they got. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, just on the side,
Oh, they have the journo pen. </connor>
<joey> - Oh yeah, they do, look at that. </joey>
<joey> - Me and Connor have a.. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I have this one, I
also have like three knockoffs. </connor>
<connor> - Oh wait, no, I have the
(indistinct) pen, actually. </connor>
<connor> - I have the drummer one. </connor>
<connor> - It's really cool. </connor>
<joey> It works as a figurine
and it works as a pen. </joey>
<connor> - You would never wanna use it. </connor>
<joey> - You'd never use it as a pen. </joey>
<connor> - It's an awkward pen to use. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, imagine buying
this and being like, </garnt>
<connor> I'm gonna use this. </connor>
<connor> - But it is cool, it is cool. </connor>
<joey> - If you want something like that, </joey>
<joey> it's available on CD Japan. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, you can get the entirety
of the market in Japanese. </garnt>

China dress version. </joey>
<joey> Oh that looks fucking nice
though, look at that dude. </joey>
<garnt> - That's hot, that's hot. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's hot. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's a lot of damage.

important part right there. </garnt>

<joey> So again, if you want to go </joey>
<joey> and check it got some Japan only stuff </joey>
<joey> that you might not be able
to get from your country. </joey>
<joey> Then CD japan.com is the
best place to get it. </joey>
<joey> So again, thank you to CD Japan, </joey>
<joey> for sponsoring today's
episode back to the video. </joey>
<connor> - Okay. I'm hearing more about
these great visual novels, </connor>
<joey> and they sound crazy, but I don't know </joey>
<joey> if I'm just a person who's never gonna get </joey>
<joey> into visual novels cause of how I am. </joey>
<joey> Like is, is Dangan Ronpa a visual novel? </joey>
<joey> Cause I felt like it was. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, okay. </joey>
<connor> - Cause that shit dragged on. </connor>
<joey> - Dungan Runpa, is kind
of half visual novel, </joey>
<joey> half history game. </joey>
<joey> Because it's visual novel in the aspect of </joey>
<joey> when your going through
the story elements, </joey>
<joey> it's a hundred percent visual novel. </joey>
<joey> Like in the way it looks and
the way it presents the story. </joey>
<joey> But when it comes to the
actual mode of mysteries </joey>
<joey> you have to solve </joey>
<connor> there's a bit of exploration that happens. </connor>
<connor> And the whole part of when
you go to the actual trial </connor>
<connor> that's a whole game in and of itself. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, that's true. </joey>
<connor> I mean, I just got remembering
being so frustrated </connor>
<joey> playing that. </joey>
<connor> I don't know why. </connor>
<connor> - Which one did you play though? </connor>
<connor> - The first one. </connor>
<joey> - Okay, don't play the first one. </joey>
<joey> - Is it bad? </joey>
<joey> - The second one is by far the best. </joey>
<connor> - I thought everyone said like
the third one's the worst. </connor>
<joey> - The third one is the worst. </joey>
<joey> - First one ain't great either. </joey>
<joey> - I didn't, I wasn't a huge
fan, I played all three. </joey>
<joey> First one was okay. </joey>
<joey> The second one though is by far
the most optimized the best, </joey>
<joey> in terms of like game playings, </joey>
<garnt> of the story in terms of
characters, everything. </garnt>
<garnt> And then the third one,
they just dropped the ball. </garnt>
<joey> They are all so disappointing. </joey>
<joey> - (chuckling)No. </joey>
<joey> - They bombed that so fucking hard. </joey>
<joey> It was the ending to the third
one, which I was just like, </joey>
<joey> it made me sit through three
whole games of this shit, </joey>
<joey> and that's how you end it? </joey>
<joey> Fuck you. </joey>
<connor> - If you had to like pitch it to me, </connor>
<joey> to get me into visual novels, </joey>
<joey> I'm sure there are some viewers at home. </joey>
<joey> How would you do that? </joey>
<joey> Cause like, as somebody who's
never experienced visual novel </joey>
<garnt> and doesn't really think
that he'll like it. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, do you like books? </garnt>
<connor> - Hmm, it's been a while
since I have read a book. </connor>
<connor> - (laughing) Well there's
our first problem. </connor>
<connor> - (indistinct) with books is
that I never seek them out, </connor>
<connor> but every time I've read a
book, I've had a great time. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I get it. </joey>
<connor> Then that might just be
the case with visual novels </connor>
<connor> or maybe all you need is
just that one visual novel </connor>
<joey> that you can relate to. </joey>
<joey> And because you know the pool
of visual novels is so deep. </joey>
<connor> - What's like some
beginner recommendations </connor>
<connor> for visual novels that like everyone must? </connor>
<joey> - Honestly Doki Doki. </joey>
<garnt> - Really? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, Doki Doki is a great, </garnt>
<connor> like it's just a great starter
one because it's so short. </connor>
<connor> If you can get through like, </connor>
<connor> the worst part Doki Doki unfortunately, </connor>
<connor> is like the first half where it's just </connor>
<connor> setting up the scene and everything. </connor>
<garnt> But like at the halfway
point hits and it's like, </garnt>
<garnt> Oh this has got a lot
of interesting ideas. </garnt>
<joey> - In defense of Doki Doki though, </joey>
<connor> the reason why the first
half is so boring is because, </connor>
<connor> it's parodying visual novels. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So knowing that if you go into Doki Doki </connor>
<connor> with that mindset, then the first half is </connor>
<connor> a little more bearable. </connor>
<connor> But the thing is, if you're
not interested in the actual, </connor>
<joey> the problem with visual novels is, </joey>
<joey> if you're not invested in the story, </joey>
<joey> you're not gonna enjoy it. </joey>
<joey> No matter how flashy or good it is, right? </joey>
<joey> - [Gigguk] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And that's the unfortunate thing is that </joey>
<joey> so many visual novels
get passed under the rug </joey>
<joey> because too many people are just too lazy </joey>
<garnt> to get into the story. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Gigguk] Yeah, yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<joey> - This guy.
- Yeah, this guy. </joey>
<connor> - I hate story in video games. </connor>
<joey> - Okay, here's the question to you then? </joey>
<garnt> What are like some
visual novel adaptations </garnt>
<garnt> for animate that you've
just really enjoyed. </garnt>
<joey> - That's a good question. </joey>
<garnt> Have you watched a lot? </garnt>
<connor> - Oh, I think I have. </connor>
<joey> - Maybe you have watched a
lot and you just didn't know. </joey>
<connor> - I can't remember the top
of my head, which ones? </connor>
<garnt> - Some of them might be Stein's Gates. </garnt>
<garnt> - I like Stein's gate a lot, </garnt>
<garnt> but that felt like a visual
novel when I was watching that, </garnt>
<joey> you know what I mean? </joey>
<garnt> There's lots of moments where </garnt>
<garnt> they weren't afraid to
like be boring.(laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Not be boring, </connor>
<joey> but they weren't afraid to let you sit </joey>
<joey> with (indistinct) situations. </joey>
<joey> - It's a very slow character
development matter. </joey>
<joey> - Amazing animator. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like I fucking loved that. </joey>
<joey> - And it's an amazing visual novel. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, cause I remember I
had the game on three 60. </connor>
<joey> I just never played it. </joey>
<joey> - Right, right, right. </joey>
<joey> - I've don't know why I never played it. </joey>
<joey> I think I bought, I watched
the anime and thought, </joey>
<joey> wow, I wanna play this. </joey>
<joey> I bought it, never played it, </joey>
<connor> cause I was like, what a muffet.(laughter) </connor>
<garnt> - There's also like the
Fate franchise love those. </garnt>
<connor> - Fate, every Fate series I've watched, </connor>
<garnt> I didn't watch the new ones
cause they were based on.. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, that's a lot of Fate series. </garnt>
<garnt> - Heaven's Feel. </garnt>
<garnt> - Heaven Feel, I didn't
watch Heaven's Feel. </garnt>
<garnt> I watched, I love Fate
Stay Night and Fate zero, </garnt>
<connor> are some of my favorite
oh Unlimited Blade works, </connor>
<joey> some of my favorite. </joey>
<joey> - Oh that's all just the Fate game. </joey>
<joey> - Oh I know it is. </joey>
<connor> But then, you know,
you wanna get into Fate </connor>
<connor> and you see the fucking
chart of like the Fate law. </connor>
<connor> And you're like, wait,
there's how many Sabers? </connor>
<connor> I don't want this many Sabers. </connor>
<joey> - It was just Type Moon being like, </joey>
<joey> let's make this universe just
so difficult to get into. </joey>
<joey> - So you watch the anime and you think, </joey>
<connor> this is a little confusing, but
it makes sense, I like this. </connor>
<connor> And then you actually go
and look what Fate is, </connor>
<connor> and you're like, this is a dumpster fire. </connor>
<garnt> - I feel like the biggest enemy </garnt>
<garnt> against people getting
into fate is ironically, </garnt>
<garnt> the Fate fandom itself. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Oh no. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because, here's the thing, I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> I have one of like one of
the most popular Fate videos, </garnt>
<joey> which is just me parodying, how to </joey>
<joey> unlike a newcomer trying to
understand the Fate series. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And like to me, as someone
who like really likes Fate, </joey>
<joey> it's really not that hard to get into. </joey>
<joey> You've watched Unlimited Blade Works. </joey>
<joey> You've watched Fate zero. </joey>
<joey> It doesn't matter which
one, which either one. </joey>
<connor> - They are both amazing. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, they can
be enjoyed by themselves, </joey>
<joey> and then from there, you
just take it from there. </joey>
<garnt> - (indistinct) told me when I was trying </garnt>
<garnt> to get into the fate
series, I was like, okay, </garnt>
<joey> I can trust your opinion
because you've been with Fate </joey>
<garnt> from the very beginning until now. </garnt>
<garnt> How do I get into it? </garnt>
<garnt> And he was just like, watch Fate zero, </garnt>
<garnt> watch Fate unlimited blade wars. </garnt>
<joey> And you will understand 95% of the law, </joey>
<garnt> and the rest is just a bonus. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh really?
- Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - But the problem is
the like the Fate fandom </garnt>
<garnt> as a collective, just can't
seem to fucking agree on it </garnt>
<garnt> because there's like, I fucking lost it </garnt>
<joey> because there was this
Reddit thread recently, </joey>
<joey> on like our anime and someone had made, </joey>
<joey> I think the title of the thread was, </joey>
<joey> "I made an easy to follow guide
on how to get into Fates." </joey>
<joey> Right?(laughter) </joey>
<joey> - The ultimate click play. </joey>
<garnt> - And I fucking burst out
laughing when I saw like, </garnt>
<garnt> 800 odd votes, 700 comments. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm just like, Oh
boy, here we fucking go. </garnt>
<garnt> - That ratio, oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm gonna get the fucking popcorn. </garnt>
<garnt> And I remember like one of the
top comments were just like, </garnt>
<garnt> Oh yeah just watch Fate Zero, </garnt>
<garnt> it doesn't really fucking matter. </garnt>
<garnt> Fate Zero is good. </garnt>
<garnt> And like, the next comment is, </garnt>
<garnt> but you're not gonna answer
an X if you watch Fate Zero. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm not just like, Oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> Like how is how I can't imagine
how it looks for a newcomer, </garnt>
<garnt> cause it looks like a (indistinct) right? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It does, I mean, I
watched Fate Zero first </connor>
<joey> and I thought it was
like a classic, right? </joey>
<joey> I thought it's a great show. </joey>
<garnt> I mean, I can re watch Fate Zero. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know, do you
get put off by shows, </garnt>
<connor> if the fan base is
toxic or shit like that? </connor>
<connor> Cause I don't, and I'm just like fuck you, </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna watch the show
and make my own opinion. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's weird, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Because I remember the Fate Fandom, </garnt>
<joey> used to be a lot more toxic, right? </joey>
<joey> - It used to be more toxic? </joey>
<joey> - Oh no, definitely there
was this phase, right? </joey>
<joey> Where if you recommended
people to start Fate, </joey>
<garnt> with Fate zero, when that first came out, </garnt>
<garnt> then there will be
people in the Fate fandom </garnt>
<garnt> who were just like, how dare you? </garnt>
<joey> How dare you not just recommend
the original visual novels? </joey>
<joey> Like he was like, if you're
not willing to sit through </joey>
<joey> a two hundred hour visual novel, </joey>
<joey> then why are you even
enjoying this franchise? </joey>
<joey> - O my God. </joey>
<joey> - You know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> And now it's evolved
a bit, now, it's like, </joey>
<joey> okay, people just want other
people to get into Fate. </joey>
<joey> But now they just don't know how to agree </joey>
<joey> on one specific ways to get into Fate. </joey>
<joey> And it's the problem because
it's a problem of fate </joey>
<joey> being a visual novel adaptation. </joey>
<joey> Because there is no perfect
adaptation of Fate Stay Night, </joey>
<joey> cause if you think about it logically, </joey>
<joey> if you think about something
like the Montgomery series, </joey>
<joey> easy, you start with
release order, all right. </joey>
<joey> So you start with
(indistinct) cause that came </joey>
<joey> out first, you know. </joey>
<garnt> But the problem with fate
is that chronologically, </garnt>
<garnt> the first released adaptation
of the Fate franchise, </garnt>
<joey> is just shit, right? </joey>
<joey> Cause it was.. </joey>
<connor> (crosstalk) </connor>
<connor> Yeah Fate stay night adapted
by Studio Dean, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So that basically
adapted the first roots of </connor>
<connor> the Fate visual novel, the
Face Stay Night visual novel, </connor>
<joey> Right? </joey>
<joey> But it's also like a
really hard starting point </joey>
<joey> for newbies to get into
fate because it's just shit. </joey>
<joey> Its not recommended in this day and age. </joey>
<joey> So what you would have
to recommend is probably </joey>
<joey> unlimited blade works,
which is the second routes. </joey>
<garnt> But then, you know but
then people skip over the </garnt>
<garnt> like entire first root which
is the Fate Stay Night route. </garnt>
<garnt> So it's complicated because of the way </garnt>
<garnt> the visual novel is laid out. </garnt>
<connor> - I hope, I genuinely
thought Fate Stay Night </connor>
<connor> and Fate Stay Unlimited
Blade works was just a remake </connor>
<connor> of Fate Stay Night. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, you think so, right? </connor>
<connor> - Is it not? </connor>
<connor> - No, no, no. </connor>
<garnt> - It's completely different? </garnt>
<garnt> - I think from my understanding,
correct me if I'm wrong. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - Fate Stay Night Unlimited
Blade Works and Heaven's Feel </garnt>
<connor> are just different endings
to Fate Stay Night. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, okay so.. </connor>
<joey> - I feel like this is how NASA must feel, </joey>
<joey> trying to fucking program their rockets. </joey>
<connor> - And people keep saying </connor>
<joey> that the Montgomery series
is complicated, like. </joey>
<garnt> - No, no, no. </garnt>
<connor> So yeah, there were like three
routes in the original Fate. </connor>
<connor> Oh my God, I'm doing the meme now. </connor>
<connor> - This is the short version. </connor>
<connor> - What happened to numbers? </connor>
<connor> We can't number shit anymore? </connor>
<connor> - It's because of the way
visual novels was laid out </connor>
<connor> with different routes, all right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So you think of something
like Clan ad or something, </connor>
<connor> where like a different route,
you get a different girl </connor>
<connor> or like, you know, that's.. </connor>
<connor> - Like a Pokemon, women are
like Pokemon collect them. </connor>
<garnt> - So in Fate it's like every
route is completely different, </garnt>
<garnt> but it starts at the same starting point, </garnt>
<garnt> if that makes sense. </garnt>
<garnt> So technically.. </garnt>
<garnt> - Do I need a notepad, like, </garnt>
<connor> do I need to like write this shit down? </connor>
<connor> - They all start at the
same starting point, </connor>
<joey> but that's not made apparent
in the anime adaptations. </joey>
<connor> - No, no. </connor>
<connor> - I fucking hate(indistinct) </connor>
<connor> - Which is why you would think
that Unlimited Blade Wars </connor>
<connor> and Fate Stay Night </connor>
<garnt> and Fate zero and Heaven's Feel, </garnt>
<garnt> are completely different games. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Gigguk] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - But in retrospect they all are the same. </garnt>
<connor> - Dude, sometimes I feel
like I'm the only asshole, </connor>
<connor> who just doesn't give a
fuck about half the shit. </connor>
<connor> Cause like everyone seems to know </connor>
<connor> and then I'm sitting there like, </connor>
<connor> I just wanna just click play. </connor>
<joey> - Oh trust me, it took me
fucking forever to understand 1%. </joey>
<connor> - Most people like me or
like you guys, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> I feel I'm in the minority. </connor>
<connor> - I've been here since the beginning. </connor>
<connor> So you guys probably don't remember </connor>
<garnt> that there's been two unlimited
blade works adaptations. </garnt>
<garnt> - I did not know that. </garnt>
<joey> Wait, wait both by(indistinct)? </joey>
<garnt> - No one like Studio
Dean did Fate Stay Night, </garnt>
<joey> then I think they did Unlimited
Blade Works movie as well. </joey>
<joey> - Are you serious?
- Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> And then (indistinct)
came along and was like, </joey>
<joey> fuck that shit we are
starting over at Fate Zero. </joey>
<joey> And then they were like, okay fuck, okay, </joey>
<garnt> we've done Fate Zero,
fuck Fate Stay Night. </garnt>
<garnt> Let's go to Unlimited Blade Work, </garnt>
<garnt> and then adapt Heaven's feel. </garnt>
<joey> - Cause I only remember
that there was only </joey>
<garnt> two Fate Stay Nights. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Gigguk] Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - And then there was the
Studio Dean Fate Stay Night. </joey>
<joey> - This is too much. </joey>
<joey> - And then, (indistinct)
was like, hold my beer, </joey>
<joey> let's do a better adaptation. </joey>
<joey> And then it was just all from there. </joey>
<joey> But I didn't know about
the second unlimited one. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, and this is just a making fail, </garnt>
<joey> it's so fucking bad now. </joey>
<joey> - It is. </joey>
<joey> - And we are not even
mentioning all the(indistinct). </joey>
<garnt> - This is just the main
timeline, Kanon as well. </garnt>
<connor> - Just watch Fate Zero, and
then if you like it(crosstalk). </connor>
<connor> - Honestly, from what I've heard, </connor>
<connor> if you wanna get into fate, </connor>
<joey> just watch Fate Zero and
Unlimited Blade Works. </joey>
<connor> - Fate Zero is a great fucking show, </connor>
<connor> and it's, you can just
watch it on its own. </connor>
<connor> You don't need to have a college degree, </connor>
<connor> or a PhD to understand
what the fuck is going on. </connor>
<connor> Just watch it. </connor>
<connor> If you like all the characters, you know? </connor>
<connor> It's fucking great. </connor>
<joey> Hey, watch Montgomery it's
less complicated.(laughter) </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, so is Pokemon, like
what are we recommending there? </connor>
<connor> - Fate's a lot of fun. </connor>
<garnt> I mean, you get into
it for the good story, </garnt>
<garnt> and then you're like, man. </garnt>
<connor> - I got into it cause I
was doing a fandub of it. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh seriously? </garnt>
<garnt> - (indistinct) someone
else's fandub of it. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh, okay. </connor>
<connor> - I think I was playing like. </connor>
<joey> - How the hell do you do an
abridge of the Fate series? </joey>
<connor> - It wasn't abridged, it was a fandub. </connor>
<connor> - I know, but like just
the hypothetical question. </connor>
<garnt> Has anyone done it?(indistinct) </garnt>
<garnt> (crosstalk) </garnt>
<joey> how do you abridge
something that complicated? </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, you can just
abridge a certain show, </garnt>
<garnt> but like having to explain
the entire franchise, </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, that's an undertaking. </garnt>
<joey> - I want a Fate abridged
where the entire bridge is </joey>
<joey> just them explaining the Fate law. </joey>
<garnt> - And I'm actually doing
a video on that, spoilers. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh really? </garnt>
<garnt> Great minds think alike,
big brain boys think alike. </garnt>
<joey> - I've actually been working
on that for like over a month. </joey>
<joey> - Of course you have. </joey>
<garnt> - That was not a scripted bit,
I'm just letting you know. </garnt>
<connor> - Got promoting his future content. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - It's probably not going to be out, </garnt>
<garnt> by the time this like
this episode comes out. </garnt>
<garnt> But I don't know, it's there's different. </garnt>
<connor> Cause the Fate franchise
is so wide, right? </connor>
<connor> But it's like just this rabbit hole, </connor>
<connor> that you can just sink in </connor>
<connor> and there will always be.. </connor>
<connor> - I feel like we found a
trap talking about it here. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah exactly. </connor>
<connor> - But that's the thing like, </connor>
<connor> if you just wanna enjoy Fate Zero </connor>
<garnt> and Unlimited Blade Works, you can just.. </garnt>
<connor> - That's what I did. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, what did you think of them? </garnt>
<garnt> - I loved them both individually. </garnt>
<connor> I felt very satisfied and I felt that, </connor>
<garnt> I'm okay not having more. </garnt>
<connor> Like I was, I saw the,
it's like you finish it, </connor>
<garnt> and then you walk outside, </garnt>
<garnt> and you see the rest of the world on fire. </garnt>
<garnt> And you're like, no, not today. </garnt>
<garnt> - Are you gonna watch Heaven's Feel then? </garnt>
<garnt> - I thought someone told me that, that </garnt>
<garnt> was just based on the Gacha game. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, that's Fate Grand Order. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's Fate Grand Order. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh, is that an anime series as well? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, there's a Fate Grand Order anime. </joey>
<joey> (crosstalk) </joey>
<garnt> - To to make it more confusing,
the Fate Grand Order anime </garnt>
<joey> adapts the like the, like
one of the later chapters </joey>
<joey> in the Fate Grand Order Gacha games. </joey>
<connor> So it doesn't even start at the beginning. </connor>
<connor> - Why, are they doing this? </connor>
<joey> - Ask Type moon dude. </joey>
<joey> - Like I wanna watch more
cause I enjoyed what I watched, </joey>
<connor> but at the same time </connor>
<connor> it just seems like I'm gonna
be watching it, thinking... </connor>
<joey> - That's the thing it's like, </joey>
<joey> I'm scared to start watching
the Heaven's feel movies, </joey>
<garnt> as much as I want to
because I'm just like, </garnt>
<connor> oh God, do I have to like fucking revise? </connor>
<joey> - I'm gonna be paranoid. </joey>
<connor> I'm gonna be watching
thinking like, (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> I just wanted to like,
watch something, you know? </connor>
<garnt> - It's very daunting, </garnt>
<connor> but it's really not that
complicated because.. </connor>
<connor> (laughter) </connor>
<garnt> - You say that. </garnt>
<garnt> - You literally wrote
a 10-minute rant about </garnt>
<garnt> how much of a fucking mess this is. </garnt>
<connor> What do you mean, it's
not that complicated? </connor>
<garnt> - Look, you can enjoy Heaven's
Feel if you've like watched, </garnt>
<garnt> Fate Zero and UBW that's
the end(indistinct) </garnt>
<connor> - You control a lot of things(indistinct) </connor>
<joey> - You know he's a veteran, </joey>
<joey> when he calls Unlimited Blade Wars </joey>
<joey> UBW, it's like it's too long. </joey>
<joey> UBW, you know what I mean, right? </joey>
<joey> - He (indistinct) so much
in his daily vocabulary, </joey>
<garnt> but he has to shorten
Unlimited Blade Works to UBW. </garnt>
<garnt> - Fellow Fate fans, I tried, okay? </garnt>
<garnt> I tried my fucking hardest. </garnt>
<connor> - If I find that.. </connor>
<garnt> - I'm not falling for your
trap today(indistinct), </garnt>
<joey> not today. </joey>
<connor> I'm happy not having(indistinct) </connor>
<joey> - I will sing that time
into a visual novel, </joey>
<joey> before I try and get into the Fate soon. </joey>
<connor> - Okay, do people just
like not watch shows, </connor>
<connor> and then just think, okay, I'm done. </connor>
<joey> I've had enough of this show. </joey>
<joey> That's how I felt with Fate. </joey>
<joey> - Well yeah, I mean, some
people just get so invested </joey>
<joey> in the characters that they
just wanna go further beyond. </joey>
<connor> - Like Who liked Saber so much
that we had this many Sabers. </connor>
<connor> Why, wasn't one Saber okay? </connor>
<connor> Am I mistaken with being
happy with one Saber ? </connor>
<connor> - I don't know, man. </connor>
<garnt> You should ask his people. </garnt>
<connor> - Okay, okay. </connor>
<garnt> - What's wrong with with one Saber. </garnt>
<garnt> (crosstalk). </garnt>
<connor> Why is one Saber not enough? </connor>
<connor> - Okay, okay, here's the thing, right? </connor>
<garnt> I didn't get it until I started
playing Fate Grand Order, </garnt>
<connor> and then I totally get it. </connor>
<joey> Cause I like, I don't
care too much about Saber, </joey>
<joey> but Rin, Rin's my girl, so. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, I know(crosstalk) </joey>
<connor> - So whenever like there's.. </connor>
<connor> - How many Rins are there? </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, there's, there's no.(laughter) </garnt>
<garnt> - The fact that there's no clear answer </garnt>
<garnt> to this question is fucked up. </garnt>
<connor> - There's not as many
Rins as there are Sabers. </connor>
<connor> - What do you mean? </connor>
<connor> There shouldn't be more than one. </connor>
<connor> - For example, like
getting Ishta, for example, </connor>
<connor> I'm like, I need to get, </connor>
<garnt> every time there's a character </garnt>
<garnt> that kind of resembles Rin, I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> well time to(indistinct) </garnt>
<joey> - I'm not going to lie,
the first time I saw Ishta, </joey>
<joey> I was like, Oh, is that Rin? </joey>
<connor> - You know, I hear this shit, </connor>
<connor> and all I think of like
man, this sounds like, </connor>
<connor> it's nearing Kingdom
Hearts level of bullshit. </connor>
<joey> - Oh no. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, no, Kingdom Heart wishes,
it could be that awkward. </joey>
<garnt> - we're just talking about the series, </garnt>
<connor> we haven't gotten into Fate law. </connor>
<garnt> - We're not getting into that.(laughter) </garnt>
<joey> (crosstalk) </joey>
<joey> - Apocrypha and like
(indistinct) and stuff like that. </joey>
<connor> - You know, being around anime fans, </connor>
<connor> you hear these words
like Apocrypha whatever. </connor>
<joey> I hate that shit so much,
I don't know what it means. </joey>
<joey> I don't wanna know what it means. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know what it means either. </joey>
<joey> - I hate it </joey>
<connor> - But I know it's just a spinoff. </connor>
<connor> - I hear it so much, right? </connor>
<connor> - All I know is that
Apocrypha and (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> are spin offs but the spinoffs
that also add to the law. </connor>
<connor> - It's time to stop. </connor>
<connor> - I mean.(laughing) </connor>
<connor> - No, we are not getting into this. </connor>
<garnt> - Okay, So to start off my
lecture today on Fate law. </garnt>
<garnt> - (indistinct)things
that I didn't get before, </garnt>
<garnt> let's go back to that. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughter)Oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> You have two minutes gone, say your piece. </garnt>
<connor> - Okay, just watch Fate Zero. </connor>
<connor> Watch Unlimited Blade Works, </connor>
<connor> and then that's like
the main line timeline. </connor>
<connor> So you can enjoy Heaven's Feel. </connor>
<garnt> And then if you wanna enjoy
more of the Fate franchise, </garnt>
<garnt> you can because none of
it's technically Kanon </garnt>
<garnt> even though it is, but I'm
not going to get into that. </garnt>
<garnt> Just watch the main timeline
shows and that's me, that's it. </garnt>
<joey> - You say watch the main timeline shows, </joey>
<connor> but at this point we don't know </connor>
<connor> what the main time line shows are. </connor>
<connor> - I'm convinced people that like fate, </connor>
<connor> also like cock and bull torture.(laughter) </connor>
<joey> They wanna die. </joey>
<joey> - The one thing about Fate
that I wanna say is that, </joey>
<joey> I couldn't fucking believe when, </joey>
<joey> I asked the same question
to Nobi, my friend, </joey>
<joey> who's like heavily into Fate about Saber. </joey>
<joey> I was like, why there's so many Sabers? </joey>
<joey> And do you know what he said to me? </joey>
<joey> He's like Saber, the clause
or Saber the character? </joey>
<joey> (laughter) </joey>
<joey> and I mean, what do you mean? </joey>
<connor> I mean, Saber and he's
like, yeah, which one? </connor>
<connor> I'm like, what do you mean which one? </connor>
<connor> Cause there's Saber the clause, </connor>
<connor> and then there's the character, Saber. </connor>
<joey> - I know that, I know that, I know that. </joey>
<joey> Cause like she is the Saber clause </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah.(crosstalk) </joey>
<connor> - But then yeah, but then he was like, </connor>
<joey> Saber clause, Saber
character, I'm like, Saber. </joey>
<joey> The one called Saber. </joey>
<joey> Which one is it? </joey>
<joey> And at that point I was like, okay </joey>
<joey> I don't think I'll ever be able
to get into this franchise. </joey>
<joey> So bottom line, </joey>
<joey> when it comes to visual
novels, maybe skip out on Fate. </joey>
<connor> - I'm convinced, right? </connor>
<connor> If Fate didn't exist, </connor>
<connor> the world would be 100% more productive. </connor>
<connor> We would have cured every
known disease on the planet. </connor>
<connor> But these people are too busy </connor>
<connor> making fucking timeline charts. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, Type moon would actually be like </joey>
<joey> a cancer institute, right? </joey>
<connor> - Honestly, if we redirected
that, that mental resource </connor>
<connor> into doing something productive, </connor>
<connor> there would be no poverty,
poverty would be ended. </connor>
<connor> But instead we wanted a hundred Sabers. </connor>
<connor> That's what we went for. </connor>
<garnt> - It's because we just wanted
to collect the waifus, okay? </garnt>
<garnt> We just want a slightly
different variation </garnt>
<garnt> of the same character, </garnt>
<garnt> so they could like sell us
to like roll another like </garnt>
<garnt> 1,000 rolls in the Gacha. </garnt>
<garnt> And then we can be like,
yeah, I have another Saber. </garnt>
<garnt> I have everything I want. </garnt>
<garnt> Oh wait, they released another Saber? </garnt>
<garnt> Oh, okay, okay I see, I see. </garnt>
<connor> - This is just like that, you know </connor>
<connor> like that there's memes
where it's like the fucking, </connor>
<connor> the business meeting with the
executives and they're like, </connor>
<connor> what do the people want? </connor>
<connor> They really like, it seems like gentlemen, </connor>
<connor> they really enjoy Saber. </connor>
<connor> And then someone's like
Saber two, Saber two </connor>
<connor> and it's like three Sabers </connor>
<connor> - Saber two, but it's not the Saber. </connor>
<connor> - If saber is so good, why
isn't there a Saber two? </connor>
<connor> The executives are like, </connor>
<joey> we got your back. </joey>
<joey> - Super Saber, you want a super Saber? </joey>
<connor> - Saber black.(laughing) </connor>
<garnt> Saber pink. </garnt>
<connor> - There's actually like a red Saber. </connor>
<joey> - Oh no, I'm done. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, red Saber and the Saber red. </joey>
<garnt> - No, no, there's a red
Saber and Saber of red. </garnt>
<garnt> Those are two different characters. </garnt>
<joey> - At this point Time Moon
has to be fucking with us. </joey>
<garnt> Right, like I'm ready for them. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm ready for Time moon to just come out </garnt>
<joey> and just like
pulling(indistinct)just being like, </joey>
<joey> yeah all of that, has no meaning. </joey>
<joey> We just wanted to fuck with you. </joey>
<connor> - I'm going insane, listening to Gon, </connor>
<garnt> try and explain this shit
to me, I hate this so much. </garnt>
<connor> - I wanna have an
episode where I just like </connor>
<garnt> spend an hour explaining Fate
law to you guys. (indistinct) </garnt>
<garnt> (laughter) </garnt>
<joey> - But going back to visual novels, right? </joey>
<garnt> That we would recommend to
beginners, AKA, not fucking.. </garnt>
<connor> - It's like one pain to another, man. </connor>
<connor> - Other than Doki Doki literature club, </connor>
<connor> what's like another visual novel </connor>
<connor> that you would recommend to Conner? </connor>
<connor> - Undertale. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't know because.. </garnt>
<connor> - There are none, psych. </connor>
<joey> - Okay, question, would you
recommend kinda of a show Jo? </joey>
<joey> - Kind of a Show Jo also
has like, acts one, is </joey>
<joey> it takes reading through act
one to get really invested </joey>
<garnt> into kind of a show Jo, kind of a show Jo </garnt>
<garnt> is great by the way. </garnt>
<connor> - Is there like 10 million
Sabers in that as well? </connor>
<joey> - (laughing) There isn't,
70 cuddlers unfortunately. </joey>
<garnt> - Kind of a Show Jo Actually has a very, </garnt>
<connor> very interesting backstory. </connor>
<connor> (crosstalk) </connor>
<connor> Cause I mean, I feel like the backstory </connor>
<connor> is almost as interesting
as the visual novel itself. </connor>
<connor> I don't wanna say too much, </connor>
<garnt> cause I'm also working on a video on it, </garnt>
<garnt> but it's a visual novel </garnt>
<garnt> that basically originated from Four Chan. </garnt>
<joey> - Can you believe something good </joey>
<garnt> actually came out of For Chan once? </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no, no. </garnt>
<garnt> So it's like a data simulator
with crippled girls, </garnt>
<garnt> from Four Chan. </garnt>
<garnt> And you say that and you're like, wow. </garnt>
<joey> - (indistinct)Be quaking. </joey>
<joey> - But like it's, it's one of
the most like wholesome kind </joey>
<joey> of inspirational stories
about how these disabled girls </joey>
<connor> like really just, are just
normal people and just like, </connor>
<connor> like how they deal with
their disabilities. </connor>
<connor> - That sounds good, I'd read that. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, it's great.
- It's fantastic. </joey>
<joey> - It's, actually a really,
really good visual novel. </joey>
<joey> And if like how much
patience do you have though? </joey>
<garnt> Cause I've seen you gaming, right? </garnt>
<garnt> If you're not doing something
within the first five seconds, </garnt>
<garnt> if you're not like head shotting. </garnt>
<connor> (crosstalk) </connor>
<joey> - No scope in the first 10 seconds. </joey>
<connor> - I have an amount that I
can like power up in myself. </connor>
<joey> - But is it enough to go through </joey>
<joey> the first chapter of catalog show jo? </joey>
<joey> - Why is it that bad? </joey>
<garnt> - It's not bad. </garnt>
<connor> (crosstalk) </connor>
<connor> - How long is the first chapter? </connor>
<joey> - Oh, that's a good question. </joey>
<connor> - I can't remember. </connor>
<joey> - Depends how fast you read. </joey>
<garnt> - I'd say like an hour or two. </garnt>
<joey> - That's a lot of time.
- An hour or two maybe? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Holy shit. </joey>
<joey> - That's the same with Doki Doki, </joey>
<joey> cause like it takes an hour or two </joey>
<garnt> to get through the first half. </garnt>
<joey> - But, mind you unlike Doki Doki, </joey>
<joey> which is about a six to seven hour game, </joey>
<connor> cuddler show Jo has about 30 to 40 hours. </connor>
<connor> - That's fine. </connor>
<connor> - So compared to that, </connor>
<joey> an hour's not too bad, until it starts. </joey>
<garnt> - Honestly, I do think Son
of Utah would be really </garnt>
<joey> really good for someone like you. </joey>
<garnt> Cause I know you can handle that shit. </garnt>
<garnt> And that was something
that hooked me instantly. </garnt>
<connor> - Maybe I'll stream, am
I allowed to stream it? </connor>
<joey> Is it a game I can stream? </joey>
<joey> - No, it's It's been on Twitch. </joey>
<connor> - Oh geez, goddammit Twitch. </connor>
<connor> - It was the first visual novel
that was banned on Twitch, </connor>
<joey> because of course(indistinct)
be out here just being like, </joey>
<garnt> I'm not making anything
that's family friendly. </garnt>
<joey> I'm here to traumatize
everybody that plays my shit. </joey>
<garnt> - No, cause it's a story,
it's a visual novel that </garnt>
<garnt> doesn't have that, you know, entry period. </garnt>
<garnt> It has a very interesting concept, </garnt>
<garnt> and it just kind of hooks you right away. </garnt>
<garnt> And for me, I remember
just reading Son of Utah, </garnt>
<garnt> and I read it all in like one sitting, </garnt>
<garnt> cause I just wanted to know
immediately what happens next. </garnt>
<garnt> Like there was no break from
me starting it to finishing it. </garnt>
<garnt> In terms of like visual novel type games. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know, like, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> Here's the thing, </garnt>
<garnt> would you count the persona series, </garnt>
<garnt> as like a visual novel with
a lot of gameplay in it? </garnt>
<connor> - Oh, that seems like an RPG to me. </connor>
<joey> - Okay, the thing with
the persona series is that </joey>
<joey> it's really interesting
because yes, it is a JRPG </joey>
<joey> but a whole lot of the JRPG element, </joey>
<garnt> and like how you play the
JRPG element on that game, </garnt>
<garnt> is dependent on the visual
novel side of the game. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because what the persona series did, </garnt>
<garnt> which I think is fucking genius is that, </garnt>
<joey> they made you the way
that they made you sit </joey>
<joey> through the story of persona,
and it's a long story, </joey>
<joey> if you've played any persona game, right? </joey>
<garnt> the genius way that they
made you sit through, </garnt>
<garnt> is that by sitting through it, </garnt>
<garnt> and physically interacting
with certain characters </garnt>
<garnt> in certain ways it changes
how strong you become </garnt>
<garnt> in the JRPG element. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - So what you do is you
form Alison persona five. </garnt>
<garnt> What you do, is you </garnt>
<garnt> by talking to certain
characters and befriending them, </garnt>
<garnt> and like going out to do these
like normal everyday things, </garnt>
<garnt> you would level up your
different abilities. </garnt>
<garnt> And those abilities then
get directly reflected </garnt>
<garnt> in the JRPG element. </garnt>
<garnt> So the more you're involved in the story, </garnt>
<garnt> the easier time you will
have in the JPG elements. </garnt>
<garnt> And what that forced you to do </garnt>
<garnt> is that not only is it
interesting because it's like </garnt>
<garnt> you're playing two
different games at once, </garnt>
<garnt> but you are literally forced
to sit through the story. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - So everybody that plays
it enjoys the story.. </joey>
<joey> - So like, if you imagine
like a Gacha game right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So in every Gacha game there's like, </joey>
<garnt> the gameplay element and then
there's the Gacha element. </garnt>
<connor> - I played Fire Emblem, Three Houses. </connor>
<garnt> - Right. </garnt>
<joey> - And that had a lot of story-building, </joey>
<connor> which I found so boring. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, you found that boring. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I found it really boring. </joey>
<connor> I would just skip, whenever
they start talking, </connor>
<connor> I'm like B B B. </connor>
<joey> - But the thing is fire
emblem, three houses </joey>
<connor> kind of did the same thing where, </connor>
<connor> you are doing everyday
things around the campus </connor>
<joey> would affect you in battle. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, I liked Fire
Emblem Three Houses, right? </joey>
<joey> I enjoyed what I did, but
I, for whatever reason man, </joey>
<connor> the moment I see text pop
up on my screen, I'm like, </connor>
<connor> you are in the way of my game. </connor>
<joey> - You are so monkey minded. </joey>
<garnt> - You got that monkey vibe.(laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - I don't know what
happened to me in the womb, </joey>
<joey> but like, I can't pay
attention to story in games. </joey>
<joey> And I'm sure there's one
or two people out there, </joey>
<garnt> who can sympathize with me, </garnt>
<garnt> but the moment story
comes on any video game, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, where's the skip button? </garnt>
<garnt> Where's it? </garnt>
<garnt> - Really? </garnt>
<connor> - I can't, I can't pay attention. </connor>
<garnt> - So what's what's your favorite
story in a video game then? </garnt>
<garnt> (laughter) </garnt>
<garnt> - Trick question. </garnt>
<garnt> - Has there ever been one? </garnt>
<garnt> - Bro, I need to like
really go deep in my memory. </garnt>
<garnt> I remember the only game that </garnt>
<garnt> I think I watched the cut scenes. </garnt>
<garnt> And I think I was like 15. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't even know why I played this game. </garnt>
<garnt> It's called blue dragon it's a JLPG. </garnt>
<garnt> Weird games, stupid
people in the comments, </garnt>
<connor> were like, I don't know
what that is, it's a JLPG </connor>
<joey> - Comment below, if
you've played blue dragon. </joey>
<joey> - It just seemed like a
dragon quest knockoff. </joey>
<garnt> But I didn't know what
dragon quest was at the time </garnt>
<garnt> but I watched dragon quest
afterwards and I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> wait a second. </garnt>
<connor> This looks awfully like
that game I used to like. </connor>
<connor> And you know, it pains
me every time, right? </connor>
<connor> When I go to press that skip button like, </connor>
<joey> I don't know what it is. </joey>
<joey> Like, is there something wrong with me, </joey>
<joey> that I can't enjoy story and video games. </joey>
<joey> (crosstalk) </joey>
<connor> Maybe, but like for me, it's like, </connor>
<connor> I look for a gameplay loop, not a story. </connor>
<garnt> I'm like the complete opposite of you. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Well no, cause you play, </connor>
<connor> you've played league of legends,
you played at fair amount. </connor>
<garnt> You are playing Valorant right now. </garnt>
<connor> - In terms of like single player games. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Like, I need a story. </connor>
<connor> - I don't play single player games. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, you played for example Cup heads </garnt>
<connor> or something like that. </connor>
<garnt> - Cup heads yeah I should
speak on Cup heads. </garnt>
<garnt> That was fun, but that's
for the gameplay loop. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> Like I tried playing Cup head. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like why am I playing cup head? </garnt>
<connor> What is the narrative reason
for me to complete this game? </connor>
<connor> - I just love running gun games. </connor>
<connor> - I need a narrative reason, </connor>
<garnt> and if you need me to sit through
like a two hour cut scene, </garnt>
<garnt> I'll fucking do it. </garnt>
<garnt> If it's a good story, I'll fucking do it. </garnt>
<connor> - Like the reason I loved
doom 2016 so much is </connor>
<connor> you literally start that game. </connor>
<connor> You smash a skull open and
you start shooting.(laughing) </connor>
<connor> That was like, Oh my goodness. </connor>
<connor> - June 2016 is the epitome
of like(indistinct) </connor>
<connor> (crosstalk) </connor>
<connor> - They made a game for me. </connor>
<garnt> - It was like, gun,
enemy, shoot, let's go. </garnt>
<connor> - That was like exactly what I wanted. </connor>
<connor> I just wanted the game that
was like fuck the story. </connor>
<connor> Let's just make a gameplay
that is addictive, right? </connor>
<connor> And so when I play, like, </connor>
<connor> you know what pisses me
off to death about JLPGs. </connor>
<joey> I love JLPGs.
- Do you? </joey>
<joey> - But the moment, they
start making the menu </joey>
<joey> a fucking challenge is when I start, </joey>
<joey> I'm like this is too much, like, </joey>
<joey> I love Fire Emblem Three Houses, right. </joey>
<joey> But there was times in that, </joey>
<joey> the menuing was like half the game play. </joey>
<joey> - I'm the officer now. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yes. </joey>
<connor> - When there's a complex menu, I was like </connor>
<connor> Oh man, look at all the
different things I can do. </connor>
<connor> - Let me play the damn game. </connor>
<joey> - You are playing the
game on the main menu. </joey>
<joey> - [Gigguk] Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Okay, you know, like I go
from, I jump from multiplayer </connor>
<joey> games to multiplayer games
like, I've been like diamond </joey>
<joey> in league of legends
like five years in a row. </joey>
<joey> I started playing TFT
recently got to diamond one. </joey>
<joey> And that nilly master tier, if you know </joey>
<joey> if you play these games,
you know, it's good shit. </joey>
<joey> I'm a big brain essentially
playing Valorant now with gone. </joey>
<joey> Sometimes it's a good game to CSK. </joey>
<connor> I played Overwatch, got to master in that. </connor>
<garnt> - Okay, what's like your opinion on like, </garnt>
<joey> something like the
metal gear solid series. </joey>
<joey> (crosstalk) </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah I played(indistinct) </garnt>
<joey> - Well that's because that's
like very heavily stolen. </joey>
<garnt> - That's like a that's
not visual(indistinct) </garnt>
<garnt> (laughter) </garnt>
<garnt> - Like Halo, I love Halo. </garnt>
<garnt> I have no idea what any
of the stories are about. </garnt>
<garnt> I remember like... </garnt>
<garnt> - The halo story is great. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I remember there was a scene. </garnt>
<garnt> - Did you play Master Flex? </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no, no, not too much story for me. </garnt>
<garnt> I remember Halo, right? </garnt>
<connor> I remember they like hyped
it up the (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> I mean, if you don't know
the Cortana, you know </connor>
<connor> but she comes back, sort of. </connor>
<connor> Cortana dies, right. </connor>
<joey> I remember everyone was
hyping up. so sad, so sad. </joey>
<joey> And I was playing my friend
and we are doing it together. </joey>
<joey> And the moment the cut scene
happened, I fucking skipped it. </joey>
<connor> No, no, what are you doing? </connor>
<connor> We need to find out what happened. </connor>
<connor> I'm like why? </connor>
<garnt> we gotta shoot things. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, this is hurting me so much. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't know man, I
just, I'm sure there's one. </connor>
<connor> I'm I in the minority here? </connor>
<garnt> - I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> - I feel like it's 50, 50, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Maybe.
- Maybe. </garnt>
<garnt> - Or like 70 30, cause
there must be a reason why </garnt>
<connor> the most popular games are
like multiplayer games, right? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, because they're played
by 11 year olds, you know. </joey>
<garnt> - Monkey brain.
- That monkey brain. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean the reason I got into
games like league environ is </garnt>
<connor> just cause I could just get into it. </connor>
<connor> It's like, it was like a stress reliever. </connor>
<connor> - It's a 40 minute thing that
you do, and it's no more. </connor>
<connor> - It's just like a, </connor>
<connor> it's like a different
kind of stress relief </connor>
<connor> and like animal crossing, for example, </connor>
<connor> but you just get in a
quick session, you get out, </connor>
<connor> you play as long as you
want and then you get out. </connor>
<connor> - It's a closed loop, </connor>
<connor> you don't feel like there's anything else. </connor>
<connor> - For like single-player experiences. </connor>
<connor> I like to get invested in the game, </connor>
<garnt> in the same way that I like
to get invested in anatomy. </garnt>
<garnt> And like, I love just, I
love that feeling of just, </garnt>
<garnt> marathoning a show and just getting.. </garnt>
<garnt> - Putting yourself into a story, </garnt>
<garnt> and being able to like physically
interact with the story. </garnt>
<connor> It's like, it's so fucking cool. </connor>
<connor> - I think I ruined games
for myself during the X-box. </connor>
<joey> - So is there literally not a single game </joey>
<joey> that you enjoyed the story of? </joey>
<connor> - I cannot, like I enjoyed
Zelda Breath of the wild </connor>
<connor> a fuck ton, but I don't
know like what I was doing. </connor>
<connor> I just remember, cause when I.. </connor>
<connor> - Breath of the wild is
such a good story too. </connor>
<connor> - Is it? </connor>
<connor> The moment we started talking (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> I'm like, give me the bomb, </connor>
<connor> give me the items, shut the fuck up. </connor>
<joey> I need a(indistinct)
because breath of wild </joey>
<joey> was the last game I
played where I got like, </joey>
<connor> no matter what other game was out there, </connor>
<connor> that I wanna play it, like
you said, it sucked me in. </connor>
<joey> I loved that game. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - That was because I felt like
the way they built the world </joey>
<joey> didn't require a story, </joey>
<joey> cause the story is the
same shit we're used to. </joey>
<joey> (crosstalk) </joey>
<connor> - In my opinion, the most genius thing, </connor>
<connor> about breath of the wild is that yes, </connor>
<connor> you could skip all of the dialogue </connor>
<connor> and still really fucking enjoy it purely. </connor>
<connor> - That's why I loved it. </connor>
<connor> Cause it was like, do your own thing. </connor>
<connor> - It's even more enjoyable
when you actually </connor>
<joey> talk to the MPCs and
especially the ones that are </joey>
<joey> kind of just out in the open, </joey>
<joey> not the ones that are in the towns, </joey>
<joey> and just hearing what they say. </joey>
<garnt> It does such a good job at world-building </garnt>
<garnt> I'm serious, you're laughing, </garnt>
<garnt> but the MPCs, like I
listened to all the MPCs </garnt>
<joey> and I'm like, okay I have so
much of a better understanding </joey>
<garnt> of this world now. </garnt>
<garnt> - (indistinct) He's like I'm
on the visual novel place. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly.(laughter) </connor>
<garnt> - I'm hearing this and I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> wait, you spoke to the MPCs? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Wait like, okay. </garnt>
<connor> The thing I hate the most, right? </connor>
<connor> Is when games make you speak
to MPCs, I hate that so much. </connor>
<garnt> - It depends on like the game for me, </garnt>
<garnt> because if it's a world
I'm not invested in, </garnt>
<garnt> then I'm like, whatever, this is shitty. </garnt>
<joey> But if it's like, where I'm
super invested in, I speak, </joey>
<joey> I'm the kind of person
just speaks to everyone, </joey>
<joey> cause I wanna get as much content
as I can out of this game. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> - And I remember speaking
to you and you were like, </joey>
<garnt> I can't enjoy a game </garnt>
<garnt> if I'm not making someone
else's day be worse.(laughter) </garnt>
<connor> - Okay, okay. </connor>
<connor> I said that to you as a joke,
but that's kind of true. </connor>
<joey> This is something that like to me, </joey>
<joey> and I, maybe this is, again,
coming back to the episode </joey>
<joey> where we spoke about chess, right? </joey>
<joey> Like to me, gaming has
always been a thing of like, </joey>
<joey> it's like a thing where I
can, I can learn a skill. </joey>
<joey> I can get better at that skill, </joey>
<joey> and then I can beat others, right? </joey>
<garnt> And like, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes you play a game
of league of legends, </garnt>
<garnt> and it feels like you
are playing the piano. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, it feels like
you're just crushing them. </garnt>
<garnt> But then when you get, when you lose, </garnt>
<connor> it's not a good feeling.(laughter) </connor>
<garnt> I wanna play a game, </garnt>
<connor> and I wanna beat other people off the top. </connor>
<garnt> - He wants to make
someone else's day worse. </garnt>
<connor> That's how he gets enjoyment. </connor>
<garnt> - Like, its why like if
I play league of legends, </garnt>
<garnt> I can't play normal games. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, I need to play a ranked game, </garnt>
<joey> cause I know that people will give a shit. </joey>
<connor> Cause if people are giving a
shit, no one's invested, right? </connor>
<connor> If I fucking die a ton, no
one gives a shit in a normal, </connor>
<joey> I mean, they do, but I don't give a shit. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But if I die in a ranked
game, I'm like, fuck. </connor>
<connor> - I think that's why I'd
never gone into PVP games. </connor>
<connor> - Really? </connor>
<connor> - it's because I've never given a shit. </connor>
<connor> - Really.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - That's pretty wild. </connor>
<joey> - Like I can't like, I don't
give a fuck if I'm playing. </joey>
<joey> - Do you know like refining a skill, </joey>
<joey> like getting good at something and like. </joey>
<connor> - That's not what I play games for. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, that's what I do. </joey>
<connor> - I play games for fucking escapism. </connor>
<connor> - Right, but then I guess
my form of escapism is </connor>
<connor> learning the skill and
having that gameplay loop </connor>
<connor> of doing it over and over again, </connor>
<connor> and then going against other people. </connor>
<joey> - No, I don't know of that,
because I don't give it. </joey>
<joey> Cause like, in my opinion,
the reason why I love JLPGs, </joey>
<joey> is because there are no
bragging rights with JLPGs. </joey>
<joey> By finishing a JLPG, it's not
like, yeah, I beat this game. </joey>
<joey> Like, that's why I beat
persona five like five times. </joey>
<joey> Not because I wanted to brag to people </joey>
<connor> that I beat it five times, </connor>
<joey> but because I wanted to see
the route of all the waifus. </joey>
<joey> - But you just bragged
about it, I'm joking. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I just did it, but.. </joey>
<joey> - No, it's not for bragging rights. </joey>
<joey> I don't do it for that. </joey>
<joey> And I don't do it to feel
superior or anything. </joey>
<joey> I just do it cause to me,
I guess, gaming for me, </joey>
<joey> the way that it's been an escape is that, </joey>
<joey> I get to sink myself. </joey>
<joey> Cause I need to be challenged constantly. </joey>
<joey> - [Gigguk] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And when a game doesn't challenge me, </joey>
<joey> in like either mechanical
skill or like mentally, </joey>
<joey> like I'm just not invested, </joey>
<joey> cause I'm like it's not challenging me. </joey>
<joey> I need something to challenge me. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, this is why I like
playing instruments, right? </joey>
<joey> So that I could get that
side of my brain focused. </joey>
<connor> - But then I guess, we
are all different, right? </connor>
<connor> Like for me, I think maybe escapism, </connor>
<garnt> and you do have that part of
you want to challenge yourself, </garnt>
<garnt> but it's satisfied by just
learning an instrument </garnt>
<garnt> or playing an instrument. </garnt>
<joey> But for me, it's like I think
it's way too consuming for me. </joey>
<joey> Like I'm way too competitive. </joey>
<joey> Like I was that one asshole in school, </joey>
<garnt> who turned everything into
the Olympics.(laughter) </garnt>
<connor> - There was always that one guy. </connor>
<connor> - I was like, oh, we're doing a light jog? </connor>
<connor> Oh, we are doing a light jog all right. </connor>
<connor> And then I would fucking sprint, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I remember like I can, </connor>
<connor> if this doesn't explain
how like competitive I am, </connor>
<connor> I don't know what will. </connor>
<connor> In school, when we used to
do long distance running, </connor>
<connor> I was terrible at long distance running. </connor>
<connor> - [Gigguk] Okay. </connor>
<connor> - But you bet every single time we did it, </connor>
<connor> I made myself throw up, I
was so desperate.(laughter) </connor>
<connor> I was so desperate to win
the long distance running, </connor>
<connor> that I would literally,
every single time we ran </connor>
<connor> I would push myself into the point </connor>
<connor> of throwing up because I wouldn't stop, </connor>
<connor> I wouldn't stop, right. </connor>
<connor> - He don't miss.(laughter) </connor>
<connor> - And I remember, it literally
became a joke at some point, </connor>
<joey> that every like, cause every year </joey>
<joey> you would do a school thing. </joey>
<joey> - [Gigguk] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And I remember I
would do the 400 meters, </joey>
<joey> and I would not stop
sprinting the whole time, </joey>
<garnt> and I would let you get to the, </garnt>
<garnt> I would sprint the
whole 400 meters to win, </garnt>
<joey> I would stop, and I would
just go(burp sound). </joey>
<joey> (laughter) Cause I was pushing myself </joey>
<connor> way beyond what was
needed cause in my head, </connor>
<joey> it was embarrassing to lose. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, I get people like that but.. </joey>
<joey> - And before anyone
thinks, wow, man, Connor </joey>
<joey> your parents must have raised you in a way </joey>
<joey> that made you fit, </joey>
<connor> but no, my parents were like,
yo Connor, calm the fuck down. </connor>
<connor> Like my parents were like,
where did this come from? </connor>
<connor> Cause we are not like that. </connor>
<joey> - I guess that's interesting
you say that though, </joey>
<joey> because then now I'm wondering </joey>
<garnt> why you're so heavily into Arc knights. </garnt>
<joey> Because Arc Knights is a
PVE game, not a PVP game. </joey>
<garnt> - Wow. </garnt>
<garnt> - But it's still got, I think I know. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause it's still got
like challenges in there, </garnt>
<joey> and Arc Knights is the worst
fucking like combo for you, </joey>
<joey> cause it's a game that you can't win, </joey>
<joey> unless you spend more money. </joey>
<garnt> And then even if you spend more
money, you still can't win. </garnt>
<joey> - And there's a whole bit of enjoyment, </joey>
<joey> by following the story. </joey>
<joey> - I didn't follow the story. </joey>
<joey> You know, I've, you know,
I've level 95 on Arc Knights, </joey>
<joey> but now that I've beaten
all of episode six, </joey>
<joey> and done all the challenge modes, </joey>
<joey> I kind of woke up the
other day and I'm like, </joey>
<garnt> what have I got to do?(laughter) </garnt>
<garnt> I've done it, I've done everything. </garnt>
<garnt> - I've done it. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm in the end game. </garnt>
<joey> I've completed the Arc. </joey>
<joey> But like that's the thing, right? </joey>
<joey> And then I think I also
destroyed any chance I had </joey>
<garnt> of liking story games cause </garnt>
<garnt> when achievements were a
thing on X-Box three 60 </garnt>
<garnt> - [Gigguk] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - You bet I was that asshole. </garnt>
<garnt> (crosstalk) </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I got way too into some games, </garnt>
<garnt> and I remember I got so
frustrated with JLPGs, </garnt>
<garnt> cause I would just buy any game. </garnt>
<garnt> But there was due to research </garnt>
<garnt> which games were easiest
to get achievements on. </garnt>
<garnt> I didn't do that. </garnt>
<garnt> I just bought a game
and I would complete it. </garnt>
<garnt> But fuck JLPGs, man. </garnt>
<connor> They had the worst achievements. </connor>
<connor> They were like collect
every one of this item. </connor>
<joey> And then you would go to the guide, </joey>
<connor> and it'd be like, Oh,
well, seven of these items </connor>
<connor> you can only get at that time. </connor>
<connor> And if you didn't get it
at that time, sorry kid </connor>
<connor> you gotta restart the game. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, I hate you. </connor>
<joey> Who did this? </joey>
<connor> I hate you so so much. </connor>
<joey> - I think that was a saving
grace for me that I never owned </joey>
<joey> like an X-Box three 60 or a PlayStation. </joey>
<joey> Like I never played on a
console that had achievements. </joey>
<joey> I was always just the Nintendo kid. </joey>
<joey> So it was literally just
you versus the game. </joey>
<connor> - [Gigguk] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I wish I did that because I
remember I got an X-Box one, </connor>
<connor> and one day I was like, why am I, </connor>
<garnt> why am I getting these achievements? </garnt>
<garnt> Like, what am I, what am I? </garnt>
<garnt> - I thought like he had the
feeling, like(indistinct) </garnt>
<garnt> I can perfect the skill to
get all of the achievements. </garnt>
<garnt> Oh, okay, it's on, it's challenging me. </garnt>
<garnt> This is a challenge. </garnt>
<connor> - And I looked back at all the shit I did, </connor>
<connor> like I beat the Lost video game, </connor>
<joey> the fucking Lost video game. </joey>
<joey> And I remember that even.. </joey>
<joey> - I didn't even know, there
was a Lost video game. </joey>
<joey> - Even my 15-year old self could tell </joey>
<joey> this video game was not a video game. </joey>
<connor> Like this was garbage dude. </connor>
<connor> And I beat it just to
get that 1000 and she, </connor>
<garnt> I hated that game. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, actually question to you then, </garnt>
<garnt> do you kind of like gamify life sometimes? </garnt>
<connor> Like do you?
- You know what's weird? </connor>
<connor> Okay, that's a good question. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Do you wanna explain
what you're going to go </connor>
<garnt> with the rest(indistinct) </garnt>
<garnt> - No, because like basically,
you know, sometimes, </garnt>
<garnt> I do see our job YouTube, </garnt>
<garnt> as it's kind of like a game right? </garnt>
<garnt> Cause, they fucking gamified this. </garnt>
<garnt> You get achievements, you get numbers, </garnt>
<garnt> you got your rivals, you
know, you do a good video, </garnt>
<garnt> it gives you a Pat on the back. </garnt>
<garnt> It gives you like a, like a
green tick mark to be like, </garnt>
<garnt> you did well, you did well </garnt>
<connor> - It's weird, right? </connor>
<connor> Because I saw, I read about this </connor>
<connor> and it's called a maximizer
and a satisfier, right? </connor>
<connor> Some people will take the first
option that satisfies them. </connor>
<connor> - [Gigguk] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And they're okay with that. </connor>
<connor> There are other people
who maximize the shit </connor>
<connor> out of everything. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And I do know what happened, </connor>
<connor> but somewhere around the age of 18 to 20, </connor>
<connor> I swapped from being a maximizer </connor>
<connor> and literally everything in my life. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- To just being satisfied. </connor>
<connor> And like I remember when
I was buying a vacuum </connor>
<connor> for the first time. </connor>
<connor> Holy shit, dude, I like
spreadsheets on spreadsheets. </connor>
<connor> I was like, yo, put the
suction power of this one, </connor>
<connor> is 50 Watts, extra and
shit, this is bristles, </connor>
<connor> extra firm ones there. </connor>
<connor> But the reviews of this one, Oh my! </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Like I would get stressed
out about everything. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - That happened with YouTube and stuff. </connor>
<connor> But somewhere along the line </connor>
<connor> I just stopped giving a
shit about everything. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And I'm like now, you know, even when I, </connor>
<connor> I remember I used to book hotels,
I used to like, Oh my God, </connor>
<connor> I would search every hotel
in like a 10 mile radius. </connor>
<connor> I would have a spreadsheet. </connor>
<connor> And I just got to the
point where I realized, </connor>
<connor> I don't think this matters, </connor>
<connor> I don't think I need to do this. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And now I just take the first thing </connor>
<connor> that makes me remotely happy. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah I mean, it's just kind of like, </garnt>
<connor> decision fatigue right? </connor>
<connor> Like there's only so many decisions </connor>
<joey> that you can make in a day. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> And there are some points
when I'm exactly the same, </joey>
<joey> especially when I'm
like booking a holiday, </joey>
<joey> or finding like even just like choosing </joey>
<garnt> what you wanna eat today. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I'd say the only thing
I still do it in my life, </connor>
<garnt> is for video games. </garnt>
<garnt> Like I still do that for video games, </garnt>
<connor> but everything else, even
YouTube, I just do what I do, </connor>
<joey> and I'm satisfied with that. </joey>
<connor> Like I, I checked the analytics, </connor>
<connor> I, you know, like roughly,
but I don't go deep into them. </connor>
<joey> Like I just see like, okay. </joey>
<joey> - You are not like Oh my God,
I'm down 1% from yesterday? </joey>
<connor> - If I gain less subscribers
than the previous day, </connor>
<connor> I don't care, I'm like, I'm
still gaining subscribers. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<joey> - I actually found out like a
huge problem for me recently </joey>
<joey> is that ,I found it really
hard just to get into new anime </joey>
<joey> and games just because like
there's so much choice. </joey>
<connor> And I don't know, </connor>
<connor> I have this thing where I'm
so scared of wasting my time. </connor>
<connor> - See that's the thing you need to let go. </connor>
<connor> Like I had that, I had that, </connor>
<connor> and I just stopped giving it a shit. </connor>
<connor> - Cause like recently, okay, </connor>
<connor> so the most recent anime I've finished, </connor>
<joey> was one that he had last season, </joey>
<joey> it was called a Sing Yesterday For Me. </joey>
<joey> And like the first beginning
of that was fucking great. </joey>
<joey> I was like, I'm good. </joey>
<joey> This is gonna be a show. </joey>
<joey> This is like anime of the
season kind of territory. </joey>
<joey> And then I watched it and
the first half was great. </joey>
<joey> And then the second half
was just kind of like, </joey>
<garnt> nothing's really happening,
and then it ended </garnt>
<garnt> and then it just kind
of just ended very fast. </garnt>
<garnt> It was obviously like
a very rushed ending. </garnt>
<garnt> It was like the most seven out 10 overall. </garnt>
<garnt> You know what I mean? </garnt>
<joey> - I remember your tweet
where you were like guys, </joey>
<connor> watching yesterday anime of
the season, take it from me. </connor>
<joey> The anime song. </joey>
<connor> - Like yes, you have that story. </connor>
<garnt> - And, like, I like, I just </garnt>
<garnt> I remember I finished it
and I knew this was an anime </garnt>
<connor> I'm going to forget in like a month. </connor>
<garnt> - That's okay. </garnt>
<connor> - Is it though? </connor>
<connor> - I think its okay, Cause
the way I see things, right? </connor>
<connor> is like no matter what happens, </connor>
<joey> if I got something I can
talk about, that's a win. </joey>
<joey> Like you pulled it up, right? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - It's all about the experience. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, you had something you.. </connor>
<garnt> - It was the friends we made
along the way.(laughter) </garnt>
<garnt> - We are (indistinct) </garnt>
<joey> - At the end of the day,
we're all knocking my baby. </joey>
<connor> - If I have something
that I can take away, </connor>
<connor> like that, it's painfully mediocre, </connor>
<connor> that's something I can talk about. </connor>
<connor> I can't be mad at that. </connor>
<garnt> - But imagine I didn't have a podcast, </garnt>
<connor> where I could just talk about it. </connor>
<connor> - You can talk about it to your friends. </connor>
<garnt> - You can talk about it
to your friends, right? </garnt>
<connor> You could have said this. </connor>
<joey> - Okay, if it had been good, </joey>
<joey> would you have been happy? </joey>
<joey> - Yes. </joey>
<joey> - No, you wouldn't have,
you'd have been like, </joey>
<connor> satisfied with the choice you made. </connor>
<connor> You wouldn't have been happy. </connor>
<garnt> - No, I would like, because. </garnt>
<connor> - What do you mean? </connor>
<connor> He would have. </connor>
<garnt> - No, no. </garnt>
<garnt> - He just watched a good anime. </garnt>
<garnt> - Cause he wanted it
to be an amazing anime. </garnt>
<connor> And if it lived up to his
expectations, he'd be like, good. </connor>
<connor> He wouldn't be like, Oh my God, yes! </connor>
<garnt> - Well, I mean like, I mean. </garnt>
<connor> - I know this guy. </connor>
<connor> - No, no I would be happy. </connor>
<connor> - Fuck off. </connor>
<joey> - Fuck you, I would be happy. </joey>
<joey> I'm happy watching good anime. </joey>
<joey> - No, no. </joey>
<joey> - Don't show me like, okay. </joey>
<garnt> Like, okay the one thing that's even worse </garnt>
<garnt> than being a bad anime is
just being a meh anime. </garnt>
<garnt> Like I remember like When I
finished domestic girlfriend, </garnt>
<connor> like the Manga. </connor>
<garnt> Okay, so I finished it
like a few weeks ago. </garnt>
<connor> - We go back to this again. </connor>
<garnt> - We are going back to domestic girlfriend </garnt>
<joey> - He always finds a way
to bring it back up. </joey>
<connor> He always finds a fucking way. </connor>
<joey> - It's like that ex-girlfriend,
that he just can't let go. </joey>
<garnt> - I can't let her go but
it was an awful ending. </garnt>
<garnt> Like it was, it was absolutely like one of </garnt>
<garnt> one of the worst endings
to like a horror Manga. </garnt>
<connor> - This is the worst trade deal. </connor>
<joey> - You are not selling us on this one. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, just imagine it, right. </joey>
<joey> This is what it was like, okay, imagine. </joey>
<garnt> Okay, it's the world cup final, okay? </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] All right.
- [Joey] Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, in terms of like,
which girl was gonna win. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, okay.
- All right. </garnt>
<joey> - So it's the world cup final
you're in the 90th minute. </joey>
<joey> It's Instapage time. </joey>
<joey> You're like ten one up, okay. </joey>
<joey> And then for no, like the other team, </joey>
<joey> is like completely incapacitated. </joey>
<joey> And then for no reason you
decided to play golden goal </joey>
<garnt> and then score an own goal. </garnt>
<garnt> That was the ending of
domestic girlfriend. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, that's that's fun,
you can talk about that. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no, no, no. </garnt>
<garnt> But that, but that's the thing right? </garnt>
<garnt> Is that because it was so
bad, I had a great time, </garnt>
<connor> like experiencing just the dumpster fire. </connor>
<connor> Unlike the nuclear fallout(indistinct) </connor>
<connor> - It was fun, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, like I had more fun with, </connor>
<joey> I'm gonna remember domestic
girlfriend for way way longer. </joey>
<joey> Than sing yesterday for me. </joey>
<joey> Because what I'm so scared of is just, </joey>
<joey> I'm gonna watch a show
and I'm gonna be like, </joey>
<garnt> and I'm gonna forget the
show, within a month. </garnt>
<connor> - But that happens a lot. </connor>
<garnt> - It does, it does. </garnt>
<connor> - Well, if you'd like,
as somebody who watches </connor>
<garnt> so many fucking documentaries, </garnt>
<garnt> like I watch a lot of documentaries. </garnt>
<connor> It's probably the only thing
I really watch on Netflix. </connor>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> - Kind of come to accept that real life, </joey>
<joey> doesn't have good endings.(laughter) </joey>
<joey> Unfortunately like life just doesn't have. </joey>
<joey> - It just kind of ends. </joey>
<joey> - It just doesn't have
good endings, right? </joey>
<garnt> Like, you know, if you make documentaries </garnt>
<garnt> about people who are still alive, </garnt>
<joey> sometimes they keep doing shit </joey>
<joey> after the documentary comes out, </joey>
<joey> then it's like, it's not
a complete documentary, </joey>
<joey> but I don't know. </joey>
<connor> I just kind of get like
satisfied with what I get, </connor>
<connor> if it's a good journey. </connor>
<connor> And if it's a mad ending, </connor>
<connor> that's something I could talk about. </connor>
<connor> That's the way I see it. </connor>
<connor> Like if (indistinct) documentary, great, </connor>
<connor> I have something to talk about. </connor>
<joey> It's a good documentary,
cool, I can talk about it. </joey>
<joey> Like I've just come to accept </joey>
<joey> that life just doesn't have good endings. </joey>
<joey> (crosstalk) </joey>
<joey> - Put that on a T-shirt.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - You know, like, come on, tiger King, </joey>
<joey> first part was way better
than the last part. </joey>
<joey> I, mean come on man.
- Yeah, of course. </joey>
<connor> - You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> Like it's I dunno. </connor>
<connor> I just come to accept that
it was good when it was good, </connor>
<connor> and I'm not gonna get too fussed about it. </connor>
<joey> - That's the whole thing, right? </joey>
<joey> It's just, it's just this idea of like, </joey>
<connor> you know, nothing in life is pointless. </connor>
<connor> Like you'll always find a way
to utilize that in some way. </connor>
<connor> And no matter how fucking
mediocre a show is, </connor>
<joey> you're gonna use it somewhere, </joey>
<joey> even if you're not even aware
of it, right like, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I realize how fucking
weird I am right now, </joey>
<garnt> cause I just don't like
story in video games, </garnt>
<garnt> but I'm happy with mediocre
stories(indistinct) </garnt>
<garnt> (laughter) </garnt>
<connor> - Then you love a lot of visual moments. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh my God. </garnt>
<joey> I mean, I don't know, it's hard. </joey>
<joey> This is like a debate that
I'm trying to come to terms </joey>
<connor> with myself as like, is it okay
to watch something mediocre? </connor>
<garnt> - But is it okay to play
something for the story? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<connor> - No, never, everyone's like,
did you play last of us? </connor>
<garnt> No, cause it's all story. </garnt>
<joey> - But you get to shoot things in it. </joey>
<connor> - No, there's no skill involved. </connor>
<garnt> - There's nothing I can master. </garnt>
<connor> - I loved Halo, and I
loved playing the like, </connor>
<connor> legendary roots alone where like </connor>
<connor> it's fucking impossible to
shoot driving up the wall. </connor>
<joey> - It's not like every 12 year old, </joey>
<joey> I didn't talk to in school.(laughter) </joey>
<connor> - I think we wouldn't get on in school. </connor>
<connor> - If we went to the same school, </connor>
<garnt> I would be like, fuck that guy.(laughing) </garnt>
<joey> who plays Halo, Legendary,
man, what a wanker! </joey>
<connor> - Man, I love that shit, its a good game. </connor>
<joey> - Jesus Christ. </joey>
<garnt> - No, but so yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Is there, is there anything
else you guys wanna talk about </garnt>
<garnt> on this podcast? </garnt>
<joey> - Bottom line, </joey>
<joey> I don't think Connor is ever gonna get </joey>
<joey> into visual novels and
that's just how it is. </joey>
<joey> - Like, the more I talk to him, </joey>
<garnt> the more I'm like, yeah, visual novel.. </garnt>
<connor> - It's the Neto of animating
my mind, It's like you.. </connor>
<connor> - It's a refined taste. </connor>
<joey> - It's not even a refined taste. </joey>
<connor> - It's like, I feel like
you are either genetically </connor>
<joey> I suppose what's the
word like you're going to </joey>
<joey> you're more likely to like it, </joey>
<joey> what's the word? </joey>
<joey> There's a word for, I don't fucking know. </joey>
<garnt> Supposed or something, it's
something along those lines. </garnt>
<joey> It's not that word. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, we're a bit drunk, right? </joey>
<connor> - I feel like you're </connor>
<connor> either going to like visual
novels or you're not. </connor>
<connor> And you know, cause if someone explained </connor>
<connor> a visual novel to you </connor>
<connor> you're going to be like, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't know, but like
I've never met someone , </connor>
<joey> who just doesn't like story period. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, that's like, if you don't like story </joey>
<garnt> in games, period, then I'm like. </garnt>
<connor> - I like story, not in video games. </connor>
<connor> Get out of my video games, raw force </connor>
<connor> amazing game metal slug, amazing game. </connor>
<connor> No stories in those games. </connor>
<connor> That's what we need. </connor>
<joey> - You are telling me, </joey>
<joey> you never looked up the wall
of metal slug?(laughter) </joey>
<connor> - I have played too many
hours in metal slug, </connor>
<joey> loved that game to death. </joey>
<joey> I have no idea if there is a story. </joey>
<joey> Is there a story in metal slug? </joey>
<joey> - Apparently there is. </joey>
<joey> - Is there? </joey>
<joey> Fuck off, no there isn't. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, there's apparently a story. </joey>
<joey> - The new doom, I fucking loved, </joey>
<connor> but I was like, wait,
wait there's cut scenes. </connor>
<garnt> No, no, no, no. </garnt>
<garnt> - But you're not like, </garnt>
<garnt> care about something like
world building, for example. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, but you can do
that through gameplay. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, but it's not as effective. </joey>
<joey> There's so many, okay
there's so many games </joey>
<connor> that try to do world
building through game play. </connor>
<joey> - Right, you play the new dooms, </joey>
<connor> you know exactly what the
world is about, just from. </connor>
<garnt> - But aren't you like actually
interested in the world? </garnt>
<garnt> - No.(laughter) </garnt>
<garnt> - And there's your short answer, really? </garnt>
<connor> (crosstalk) </connor>
<connor> - I say that, right, but
every time I hear a piece </connor>
<connor> of like legal legends law,
I'm like, Oh, that's cool. </connor>
<connor> That's cool. </connor>
<connor> And I actually, I'd watch
a league of legends anime. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But I don't wanna
watch league of legends </connor>
<connor> cut scenes in game. </connor>
<connor> Imagine you have to watch cut scenes </connor>
<connor> in league of legends, you'd be like. </connor>
<garnt> - Connor has like two modes in his brain. </garnt>
<connor> And there's like, no in-between. </connor>
<joey> It's just like shut off
brain, like absorb anime. </joey>
<garnt> It could be shit, you're
just like absorb it. </garnt>
<garnt> Or it's like monkey brain mode engage. </garnt>
<joey> - I am the greatest primate in this group. </joey>
<connor> - It's like on or off, right. </connor>
<joey> Like I can sit there and
watch light any anime </joey>
<joey> or whatever you need me to watch. </joey>
<connor> I could sit there and watch
it all day and be like, okay </connor>
<connor> I know what I'm getting into. </connor>
<connor> But when it's games, get
that shit out of here. </connor>
<connor> Get that shit off of me.(laughter) </connor>
<garnt> - Jesus Christ. </garnt>
<garnt> - I literally like, I
love watching Tyler Wan, </garnt>
<connor> like live streams cause
I feel like he embodies. </connor>
<joey> - He's the definition of monkey brains. </joey>
<connor> - I love Tyler Wan as a streamer, </connor>
<connor> because he literally embodies like, </connor>
<connor> not only physically how I
imagined my game of size to be, </connor>
<connor> but like watching him play
The Last Of Us was so funny, </connor>
<connor> cause he was just like,
what is this story? </connor>
<connor> Get this shit away from me. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, I love it,
I love it, it's so fun. </connor>
<connor> He's just such a like
giga-chatted, brain gamer. </connor>
<joey> It's so fun to watch him. </joey>
<joey> He's my favorite streamer. </joey>
<connor> Just cause I relate to
that on so many levels. </connor>
<joey> - Oh my God, I guess
you guys can let us know </joey>
<connor> in the comments below, </connor>
<joey> if there is any visual
novel that you think </joey>
<joey> Connor's monkey brain can handle. </joey>
<garnt> - I've lost all hope that Connor
can get into visual novels. </garnt>
<connor> - We can't, we can't convince him, </connor>
<joey> so maybe you guys can help us. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, okay, you know
what, before we finish this. </connor>
<connor> People were like, yeah,
I've beat Fire Emblem. </connor>
<connor> I was like, Oh yeah, me too. </connor>
<connor> And they were like, Oh, did
you play with the roots? </connor>
<connor> I'm like, why would I play
with the roots?(laughter) </connor>
<garnt> - I remember talking to you about this. </garnt>
<garnt> - That hurts me. </garnt>
<joey> - I'm like, why would
I play with the roots? </joey>
<joey> - You play blue lions right? </joey>
<joey> - I play blue lions, which I, you know </joey>
<joey> after I heard about all the other routes, </joey>
<joey> I'm like so I played the right one. </joey>
<joey> - No, no.
- No, no. </joey>
<garnt> There's no right one. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - That's just one of three. </joey>
<connor> - And mine sounded like the most. </connor>
<garnt> - So we were going back
into Fate now.(laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - No, no, we're not doing this. </connor>
<connor> We were close to ending the episode. </connor>
<connor> All I'm saying is that,
to me the point of playing </connor>
<connor> the same gameplay again
for a different ending is, </connor>
<connor> it doesn't make any sense to me. </connor>
<connor> It's like, the thought of that is insane. </connor>
<joey> - We'll never be able to
understand this monkey brain. </joey>
<joey> - No, no. </joey>
<connor> - Science please dissect my brain. </connor>
<garnt> - I need to do like a full on
study to be like, okay story. </garnt>
<garnt> You like story. </garnt>
<garnt> Connor is like, yes, yes. </garnt>
<garnt> I like story.
- I like story. </garnt>
<joey> - Gameplay, gameplay you like gameplay. </joey>
<joey> - No, no, no. </joey>
<joey> - Yes I like game play. </joey>
<joey> Story and gameplay, no, no. </joey>
<garnt> Story and game play bad. </garnt>
<connor> I do know like. </connor>
<connor> - Basically that's pretty accurate. </connor>
<connor> - Jesus Christ. </connor>
<connor> - I think that's why I love arcades. </connor>
<connor> Cause like they don't
try and give you story. </connor>
<connor> It's great. </connor>
<connor> They don't try and bulk
me down with this shit. </connor>
<joey> - Apparently the nostalgia,
the piano game has a law. </joey>
<connor> - I can't read Japanese
so I wouldn't know anyway. </connor>
<connor> You know what game is amazing
with fantastic game play </connor>
<joey> and no story? </joey>
<joey> - What?
- Chess. </joey>
<garnt> No story in chess. </garnt>
<garnt> That's why I like chess so much I think. </garnt>
<connor> it started from a young age,
my displeased(indistinct). </connor>
<garnt> - It's actually funny,
cause the thing I like </garnt>
<garnt> about chess is the story </garnt>
<garnt> and law behind the history
of chess.(laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - There are two people in the world, </joey>
<connor> two different people
in the world right now. </connor>
<connor> - But saying that, right? </connor>
<connor> If you made a documentary
about chess players, </connor>
<joey> I'd fucking love the shit out
of that cause I don't have to, </joey>
<joey> It's not like, it's not like.. </joey>
<joey> - Because it's not
interjected with gameplay. </joey>
<joey> - Because yeah, because
It's not like 10 minutes in, </joey>
<connor> move the pawn forward two. </connor>
<connor> It's like, okay, it's not like, </connor>
<connor> cause some of these visual
novels have game play </connor>
<connor> and I've seen some of the shit, </connor>
<connor> and it's like, you click
one dialogue like thing. </connor>
<connor> And it's like, why give me the
choice to click one dialogue? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, except that one piece of gameplay, </connor>
<connor> is the most stressful
piece of gameplay ever, </connor>
<connor> because it's like, Oh my God </connor>
<connor> which one do I shoot? </connor>
<joey> - [Gigguk] Exactly, right? </joey>
<connor> - Chess the documentary, I would watch. </connor>
<connor> Chess the game, I play. </connor>
<connor> Chess, the visual novel
slash documentary game, </connor>
<joey> no, get that outta here. </joey>
<connor> I don't wanna know. </connor>
<joey> - You are like the epitome of
someone who can't multitask. </joey>
<joey> - I actually can't multitask whatsoever. </joey>
<joey> I say that.
- It shows. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, maybe I watch anime in the gym, </joey>
<joey> that's about as far as it goes. </joey>
<garnt> - Wow. </garnt>
<joey> - Keigo brain, keigo brain. </joey>
<joey> - What an evolved brain, you have. </joey>
<connor> - Me crying on the treadmill.(indistinct) </connor>
<connor> - I think that's a good place
to end this podcast before, </connor>
<garnt> like we're gonna need a whole like study, </garnt>
<garnt> on how Connor's brain works. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Why is my brain so smooth? </connor>
<connor> - You know people are gonna
meme the fuck out of this </connor>
<connor> on the (indistinct) </connor>
<connor> - That's fine. </connor>
<garnt> - Please give us your meme. </garnt>

<joey> - Tyler Wan please come on the podcast, </joey>
