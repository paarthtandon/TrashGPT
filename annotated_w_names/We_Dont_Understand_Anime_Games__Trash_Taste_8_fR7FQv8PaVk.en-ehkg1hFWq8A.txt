<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know how crazy (indistinct)
in some States in America, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you get caught drink
driving, they put a thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on your car to blow into it every time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Some guy like he'd made a video, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he was like, how do we avoid doing that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> By inhaling gold cola instead. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That sounds safe. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - All the cards were like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like you're missing the point </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of why this is in your car, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) but anyway... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You get like in Ava, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They just just made like an
alcoholic version of like LCL, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) so you just
like.(laughing hysterically) </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, you sure? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Okay I cut you off with that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No facetious nicknames. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What did you wanna say
Connor, what did you wanna say? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean if you mentioned it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> should we just talk about games then? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Like what games you've been playing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or what have you played or something? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Have you been playing anime games? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, I never play anime games. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you never? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I never play anime games.(mumbling) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, okay what
constitutes as an anime game? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's the thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - If the characters go
(screaming) every ten seconds. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Gigguk laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's like every game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You can say Last Of Us is an anime game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (both chuckling) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They have a cute (indistinct). </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> (screaming) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know, like how
many games do you guys play? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because I found that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just have zero time to
play a lot of games nowadays. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Now that the quarantine
is over here, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- As a gamer. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - As a pro gamer. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just wanted to say as a gamer. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know, I'm kidding. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> No, I mean, I feel like
it's probably the thing, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> that got cut the most
when I became an adult. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like out of everything that I do, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> watching films doing anything else, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like, gaming got cut down the most to me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause in university.. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Cause that's what you used to do, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I used to do gaming
for like 12 hours a day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> No problem. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Jesus.
- Yeah, it was easy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I loved that shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Depends on the game actually, for me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like I played, when Person
Five first came out, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I definitely played like.... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Still haven't played Persona Five. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - More than 12 hours a day on that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I know like for me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the reason I don't play many
games anymore is because, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> when I get into a game, like get into. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm like one of those
guys who just can't go, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like I either have eight
hour gaming sessions, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or I just don't game at all. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There's like no in between. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like especially if it's like an RPG </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or a story-driven game, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like I remember when I
last played Persona Five, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was just like, just block out my week, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> nothing is happening this week, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but me was playing Persona Five. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Which is why I haven't played
Royal, yeah.(indistinct) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I mean I've played Persona Five, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Persona Five Royal and
Persona Five Scramble. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And I think in total that took maybe like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> five, 600 hours out of my life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - This man finds time,
where time shouldn't exist. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> (Gigguk laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, that's what I like
about animal crossing, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because I'm still
playing that to this day, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and I've put in maybe like
three, 400 hours into that game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Gigguk] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But that's the thing, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like unlike most gaming
sessions where it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> zero hours or eight hours. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Gigguk] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Animal crossing is
just one of those games </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we could play for half an
hour, and then you just draw. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Gigguk] Yeah.
- That's fair enough. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Which is what I like, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It's just like a little thing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to just kind of do on the sideline. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - As someone who plays league
of legends, I feel like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> even if it is a 40-minute game session. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Pro gamer here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That shit felt Like eight hours. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The mental Battle that
it took to play a game </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> of league of legends took eight hours. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But I fucking used to love
playing league of legends man, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I was so addicted. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Are there any like actual-like games, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> based off animated that you guys like? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What'd you mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like by anime games, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't mean like games with
animated looking characters. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I'm not talking
about like a Xenoblade </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or like Dragon Quest 11 kind of.. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Has there ever been
a good anime spin off? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm sure there has, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just, I can't really
think of any right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I (indistinct) the Attack
on Titan game on steam, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, yo, I'm so hype. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I get 10 minutes into the game like, huh! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Probably Dragon Ball Fighters, that's.. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - You like fighting games? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, I'm not really much
of a fighter game enthusiast, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> but I mean, I had fun playing it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I think it was a pretty good game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I enjoyed, what was the
latest like Natto funny game? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Like I'm not a huge fan of Natto. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (crosstalk) (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Something like that, I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But like the latest
one on that on steam, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like I think someone gifted that to me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then I just gave it a
go, but I was like, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not that much of an advocate
for like fighting games, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not that good at fighting games. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm not much of a fan
of the narrative franchise, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I gave it a go. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That game's genuinely fun. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Gigguk] Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, you have, what's
the Pokemon fighting game? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] Oh, Pokken? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I like Pokken, Pokken is good, I like.. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - If you like Pokken, it's
similar to that just.(indistinct) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - No one ever wants to
play Pokken, and I'm like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Pokken is so fun. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's good though,
because I do, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> you bring your switch to a party, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You're like, I've got Mario party. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've got Mario kart. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've got all these amazing
multiplayer games, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The last thing anyone
wants to play is Pokken. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But if people give it a
chance, it's actually fun. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't think it's a great game, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but it's a really fun party game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's fun, it's really really fun, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's just like a brain
dead fighting game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's really easy (indistinct) down a lot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> But I think it needed to be,
cause I suck at fighting games. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, here's a question for you guys, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and have you ever watched an anime, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and thought this would
be a really cool game? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause I can think of one
off the top of my head. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sold on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Gigguk laughing)
I am joking (indistinct). </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Would (indistinct) be a good game bro? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've played the Solo
online games, they will suck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Hey, wait there is one in Arcadia. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, and I'm not just saying that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because I don't like solo online, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like genuinely, they all suck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I just had a huge epiphany. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yes.
- What? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The Jojo Battle of The Jojo Fortnite. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - The Jojo Fortnite game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The Jojo Fortnite game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, in Japan they have an arcade game, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's a battle Royale of Jojo. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> And you go on Mario,
and all you do is like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> try and fucking punch each
other to death, it's so fun. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - That game is fun. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's kind of bad,
it's kind of a bad game. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - It kinda sucks, but it's fun. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's fucking great, because like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I completely forgot about
Japanese arcades as well, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and just.. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh my God, we haven't
even spoken about that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, we haven't spoken about that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - My second home baby. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Gigguk laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm (indistinct) arcades, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I was at an arcade just
yesterday actually. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause I wanted to get a, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what's that piano game that
you and I are really into? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like Nostalgia.
- Nostalgia? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think it's called. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think it's something like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Basically, in Japanese, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Japanese arcades are fucking next level. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like arcades just didn't die here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And there's so many cool
things about Japanese arcades, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that you just can't get
anywhere else in the world. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - If you think American arcades are fun, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you will nut in a Japanese arcade. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Gigguk] Yeah, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's a different experience in arcade, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cause growing up my arcade
experience is always like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> you know, House Of The Dead, those types. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Gigguk] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - So like party games... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (crosstalk)
- Time crisis. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, Time Crisis, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's like, and they do have those. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I'd say those are the only games </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that really translated well
from like Western arcades. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Like maybe that sense
of evolution as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I dunno, cause like Japanese arcades, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> have so many rhythm games. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like 80% rhythm games. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - They've got so many unique
ideas about rhythm games. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Cause I remember when I was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> before I came to a Japanese
arcade, I was like, Oh yeah, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> rhythm games aren't
really my thing, you know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't really enjoy DDR
or that kind of stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I went to a Japanese arcade, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and there are just so many
different types of rhythm games. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh it's crazy.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it's fucking crazy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, I thought you
know, playing guitar here </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and just pretending to be a band, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or you're , what was it, rock band. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Rock band, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - But you're playing
basically, every instrument. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, rhythm games aren't
gonna get better than this, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cause you're pretending to
be playing the instruments. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then Japanese arcades be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> now how about we just invent instruments? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You see this DJ board
right here, six buttons. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> You're a DJ now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (Gigguk laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And It feels amazing when you
like turn the knobs and stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's like ooh, ooh, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm making some music right now, goddamn. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, but no I wasn't the exact same. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, I've always liked rhythm games, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> even way before you
know, like rhythm heaven </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and stuff like that on the DS, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like I played the fuck out
of those games, loved it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> But when I moved here, I
was the exact same, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, I'm not a huge fan of DDR, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> never really played a lot of rhythm games </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like in Western arcades. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And I didn't really even
have an arcade in Australia. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Gigguk] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We didn't really have an
arcade that was nearby enough. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Like we had one in the city. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, there was one that
was really far away from me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, but like the city for me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> where I live is like a 45 minute drive. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh shoot.(indistinct) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So to a 14 year old, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it might as well be in
a different country. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So my only experience with arcades, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is the Japanese arcades. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But even when I was little, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I would go to a Japanese arcade, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I never really
touched the rhythm games, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because all these like high
school kids are around it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> As a 10 year old, you don't
want to go into that crowd. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> (crosstalk) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's intuitive, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> those dudes on some of
these games are insane. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You know, someone is like insane, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when there's like a 16 year old, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> just rocking up in front
of a (indistinct) machine, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and he just puts his gloves on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Gigguk laughing)
- Get the gloves. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> If they wear gloves, they're like serious. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like the anime moment, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> When they put on the glove, it's like.. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - He puts on the gloves,
he just does the shine, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and he just gets ready, like
he just stretches himself. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is that the game
where they go like this? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it's like.. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, they for some reason, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know why all
the good players do it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There must be a trick there, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but they all throw their hands in the air, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when they are playing this piano. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like they just don't care? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's an actual movement.
(laughing hysterically) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - What?
- Wait what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - What did you say?
- What did you say? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Don't worry about it.(laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm gonna see the replay
anyway, you mother(indistinct). </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - No but like I played (indistinct) once, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> because I was also (crosstalk). </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's an actual movement
you need to do you have to, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there's a sensor in the actual board, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> that senses your hands moving up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Gigguk] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But a lot of them do
it like when they've, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> you know in the movies or they
finished their piano solo, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they just like raise their hand? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - They go high, no fucking around. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It looks like, you
know, a classical pianist, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just finishing their performance, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - But they are doing it every two seconds. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (crosstalk) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean like, they're almost
putting in as many inputs </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> as like a Japanese pianist, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a professional pianist sometimes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It looks so cool though,
when someone's good, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you're like, man this is amazing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> This is like a spectator sport right here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, But then you think about man, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how many 100 yen coins did
they have to go through. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah.
- To get to that level? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - (indistinct) You get like
three songs most of the time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So about 10 minutes for
about a hundred yen, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which is less than a dollar. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - So wait, so what are
the go-to rhythm games </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for you guys at an arcade? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I like the one you showed me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't remember what it was called, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but it's the one where
it's like a massive circle. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah, Waka. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Waka, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And basically it's a really unique input, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> where it's like the entire circle, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you have to like follow the lines </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and everything like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] We have a video on screen. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Yeah, I'm sure. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Gigguk] It was something that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> it's really games like
this, that you just can't, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I've just never seen before. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That shit burned my fingers though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> When you're trying to do that (screaming). </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was the first time I
(indistinct) and I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> should I buy gloves? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like a plastic thing, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> And some of the inputs are
like do a full three 60 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with your hands. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So you're just sliding your sweaty palms </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> all around this thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And you're like, ah, trying
to get your hand around. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was like, oh that's where
the gloves come in handy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I understand. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Cause the thing is,
they're no buttons as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They're all just sensors. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So you're just here like, smashing this, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> smashing this hard surface like, dude. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it just hurts your fingers. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It hurts.
- Oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It really fucking hurts. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Shit hurts. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I love the, like the
piano one but that's cause </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's basically, what's the
other piano one where the guys </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> do the thing in the air? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What's it called? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Uh tune(indistinct). </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I feel like that's the hard version. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And the one that I likes is the easy one, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> because it's like a piano thing, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> but, you don't have to
actually hit the right, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> just close enough. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just close somewhere around there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So you basically look at the screen, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and you just do the, it's
really like beginner friendly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I really like it
because a lot of them, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like there's, I feel the problem
with a lot of the games is, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's medium and then
there's fucking insane. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Like there's no in-between. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I always had this
problem with guitar hero, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where like I could do medium fine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But when we put the little pinky involved, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's when it all fell
apart, like I couldn't do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It makes you feel like a pianist. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God, shut the fuck up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Or the classic, the Taiko drums, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah.
- Oh yeah, that's genius </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] That's like,
whenever you bring someone, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you are like, get (indistinct) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Yeah come on, you all enjoy this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's so easy to understand, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like monkey brain
mode activated.(laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I hit two places. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay, I understand. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- What about you? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, the one I always
go to is Groove Coaster. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh you always play Groove
Coaster, It looks cool though. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Groove Coaster is fun. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which one's that one? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Groove Coaster is the
one with the giant screen. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like(indistinct) in HD. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Gigguk] Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And there's two like knobs, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you have to like move around and tap. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I sucked at it at first, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> but then I went to this
con in Washington DC, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like two years ago, maybe three years ago. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Gigguk] Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And they had a Groove Coaster machine, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but no one was in front of it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And at this point I'd never
played Groove Coaster before. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I just saw this
Groove Coaster machine </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that nobody was lining up in front of. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it was free to play. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.(crosstalk) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So I was like, I got like
two hours to kill, fuck it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And no one's lining up
in front of this thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Let's do it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I got so good in those
two hours where I was like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I have to come back to Japan and like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> actually get on these machines
and then ever since then, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've loved it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And there's also , what's the other one, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> what's the cube one? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I keep forgetting. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] Oh the one that you go like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> tap the things in time? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Yeah tap the things in time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] I forgot what that's called. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] That was really old.
- [Connor] That's everywhere. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] That's like a classic one game </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the Japanese arcades. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Cause I remember my
first experience with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like Japanese arcade games. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There's always that fear,
where you're just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I have no idea what I'm doing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing)
You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like especially at conventions
when there's always that guy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That guy who just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and he's always before you as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - He comes up with the Excel spreadsheet </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on the best technique. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Gigguk laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> And it's like, all right, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I just wanna play the game(indistinct) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah and you're just
standing there being like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what buttons do I press?(laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, I don't even know
any of these songs. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's time, crisis. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - And it's always like,
it's always the worst </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (indistinct) as well, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because you know there's
people standing around you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Gigguk] Oh no!
- Judging you so hard. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, look at this(indistinct). </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Especially when you're
like a guest there, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everyone's gonna look at you like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> wow, Joey kind of sucks at that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I'm definitely gonna bring this up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> at they panel later.(laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you sucked at DDR, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Do you have any comments about that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I suck at DDR. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, that's what I love
about like Japanese arcades, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is that you can just spend, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> you can just lose so many hours in there, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's really easy because it's.. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, and you get the cards. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I was going to
talk about the cards. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Sorry, sorry.(crosstalk) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like basically,
actually you explain Joey, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> cause you're the one who did it for me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So you probably know the
process better than me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - So, different machines
are owned by I guess, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> different rhythm game
companies or whatever. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And you can, if you get so good at it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can buy these cards for
like 300 yen, which is nothing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like $3 and you print them out, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and you can save your progress on it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it's a public rhythm game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So if you just put the money
in, you're treated as a guest. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So you records all records
for whatever stage you do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - High scores.(crosstalk) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - High scores, that kind of stuff, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> doesn't get saved because
you're just a guest. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - So if you get so invested
in a particular rhythm game, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or a number of rhythm games. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> You can buy these cards and to you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> save your records and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And you can, a lot of
Japanese people I know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like share it online to flex
on each other essentially. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Gigguk] Yeah.
- Yeah, they do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I recommend getting it any way, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because there are some rhythm
games, like the piano one, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that if you don't have a card, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they're going to make you
sit through the tutorial, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and there's no way to skip it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like I remember, I really enjoyed it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I went to the arcade on
three separate occasions, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and for the first like three minutes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was just sitting there being like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I remember I finished
up my first two songs. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, you don't have the tutorial? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was still doing the
tutorial every time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I was like, I've
gotta get a fucking card. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I need a card, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - And the good thing as
well with those cards is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that not only are they cheap,
but a lot of the cards, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> the first game that you do
with the card is usually free. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So you actually make that money back. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is it really?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So with Groove Coaster at least, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> when you get a, its called a
NESCA card, cause I guess.. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, there's NESCA and
then there's a few other ones. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Then there's the
Bandai one,(indistinct). </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think yeah, I have that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So with the NESCA card at least, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> the first game of Groove
Coaster you play is free. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because you just put
that money into the card. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Gigguk] Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - which I think is a nice compromise </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it doesn't feel
like you just, you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you're paying extra to save
your progress essentially. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - And you can, like you'll only
have a set amount of stages </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> as a guest.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And if you, you know, level
up, you learn more stages. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> It's just cool to like
go back to an arcade, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> you know every so often just.. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - My favorite anime song. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, so I've gotta
triple S this stage, man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I just have to, I have to invest more. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - They have Undertale on
Groove Coaster, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, they have intel soundtrack. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Gigguk] Oh sit.(laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Dude, I can do level 12 Megalovania, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> like Triple S, I was
pretty proud of myself, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm not gonna lie. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's so cool, Cause on
Groove coast they have like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Special animations just
for the Undertale song. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh really? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - So it looks like an Undertale game, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> playing out on the game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, no, that's every
song that they have. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Even all the Vocaloid stuff
as well, they use like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the music videos for it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And that's what I love
about Groove Coaster, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> because every stage actually
looks really unique as well, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because it has to match the song. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Have you tried using
your card at(indistinct) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in America, have you ever tried that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - No.
- I should try that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - That'd be pretty cool. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> If you're at a convention
and you just(crosstalk). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Whip out the card, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - (indistinct) the internet? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I gotta, flex on these
people that I Triple S </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Megalovania level 12, you know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh you still have all stages. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, how'd you guys feel
about like the UFO machines, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or like what, like the prize
machines here in Japan? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Archie is fucking amazing at it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I don't know how she is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because, what really
surprised me is that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in most, in everywhere else,
it's kind of like a lock. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Kind of like a lock base. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But in here I see people
who are just really good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at these machines and
they can actually turn it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> into a profit because then
they just sell the figures, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> or whatever you get or buy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's a huge industry as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, exactly.
- Its a big deal. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like a lot of the stores </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> (indistinct) selling crank game stuff. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.(indistinct) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just don't understand how
people can get good at that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because Archie, every
time we go to an arcade, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Archie is always just like,
fuck the rhythm games, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just gonna go to the crane games, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to just get random shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But every time I try it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and she's standing next
to me, she's always like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh no, you should move
them all to the right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, how do you know that?(laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was just fucking going forward. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just like a whole like
secret thing where it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah you have to aim as
slightly to the left, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> so that it drags the
plushy closer to the hole. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm just like, how do
you figure that shit out? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just wanna go beep beep and pick up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't wanna think about this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Gigguk and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I wanna just play it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I guess you have to if you wanna like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not spend as much money. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> But if I really really want
the thing in the crane, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'll just go to the shop next door, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that probably is selling
it used for like 800 yen. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Which is way cheaper than
what it would have... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Every time we to an arcade in Akihabra </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> There's always the store
next to it is selling </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> the exact thing you're
trying to gamble for. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - But if in Japan, if you mess up, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you put enough money in the machine, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> the staff will come over and be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> hey you want help? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We feel kind of bad, you've spent like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> how many thousands of yens on this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which is why like when I
have friends who are doing it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who are fucking up loads, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and they've put like 20 bucks, I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Put like 10 more bucks, and
then I'll call the staff over. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And if you do that,
normally they'll place it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They'll pick it up, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> literally put it on the box, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and just require you to like tap it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like they'll pretty
much set it up for you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Baby mode, baby mode activated. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, literally baby mode. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Pro tip, if you come to
Japan, just fuck up a lot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Use your (indistinct) card and be like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know how to do this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - And they'll be like,
all right, I got you man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Man, damn. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Have you ever seen a crane game </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> at the conventions in America? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, I haven't actually. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've seen them, but I've
always been scared to try them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I guess, cause you
can set the crane game </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> to how difficult you want it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> And just knowing how like a lot of, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> at least American crane
games that I played, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> how they might as well just be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> they might as well not be a claw. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's basically just a slot
machine with a claw attached. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> You know what I mean?
- Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (crosstalk) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'd rather put my money
into an actual slot machine, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> than a crane game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Which I would not rather
do anyway.(laughter) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - But no, there's like a
lot of different games, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that you just don't see
anywhere else in arcades. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I don't know why there's always, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's always a Faygo, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like section that's like.. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's not just one machine,
there's an entire row. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's a row of Faygo
machines in every fucking arcade, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I swear to God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - And those machines, have
you played on those machines? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I haven't yet. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They are fucking expensive. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - What is it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I've never played the game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The cards, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So they're expensive because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you can print out physical
cards of the waifus </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that you get in Faygo. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yo for real.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] You didn't know that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] I'm surprised. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - (indistinct) cause you'll
be broke, don't, don't. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So, Nobi, one of my best friends here, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> he is like a super
heavy, like Faygo player. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean he used to be. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - AKA he has no money. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - AKA, he's broke, so.. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't need to give fate anymore money. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] No you don't, don't. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Don't tell me this, don't tell me this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But from what I saw, cause
I went to an arcade with him </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and he was like, Oh can I just
go into the Faygo machines? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like, yeah, actually cause </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've always wanted to know what they were. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've always walked past them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And yeah, it's like a double screen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like a giant DS essentially, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where the bottom screen
is like a touchscreen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you have these packet of cards, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and you can essentially use
cards to summon fake characters. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's so cool, oh my God! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> You are telling me this
and I'm just like.. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Its like you use the
fake characters to like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> beat like a certain quest. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's kind of like Dragon
Quest with fake characters. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And if you beat a certain quest, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and depending on how you beat it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then you can unlock different waifus, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and you can actually print out
the waifus from the machine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh no!
- Don't tell him this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh no! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just to play one game is
already expensive enough. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> But of course, they take money to like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> actually print out the cards. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So it's just like so much money
for the franchise right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And I know after today
you're gonna go to one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You're just gonna see me in a week, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and(indistinct) guys I've
spent way too much money. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - (indistinct) coming in with like a deck. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like why did you tell me this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm surprised you never went on it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> considering you made
the whole Gacha video. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean like, because of quarantine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like it was quarantine
that started my process </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for the Gacha video. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I haven't actually been to an arcade </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> since quarantine started. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> So I've just been playing Faygo, and so.. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - You know what we're
doing after this podcast. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (Gigguk laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> We're going to an arcade that
has a Faygo machine and.. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - It just(indistinct) like Skylanders, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> but for questionable adults. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughter) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you know what I mean, like
that's what it sounds like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> You can (indistinct) the cards. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, to be fair, it's Pretty fun. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean , that's basically
Gacha games and(indistinct). </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, you're just, you're
just collecting P and G's, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> or cards or whatever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Literal P and G is
printed out this time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wait, wait, so you're telling me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that we're not just collecting P and Gs, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but they're physical
and printed out, bruh. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Laminated cards. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Once a P an G always a P and G. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Gigguk and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Man, do you know the coolest game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I ever saw on Arcadia here was? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know Typing Of The Dead? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's actually on arcade machines. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Are you serious? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it's in Akihabra. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's on like the, one
of the Sega buildings. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They have like four Sega buildings. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, one of them, one of them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's the typing of the dead mode. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They actually have a Typing Of The Dead. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> So it's house of the dead,
but you type all the... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So what, its like a keyboard there? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's a keyboard, two
keyboards(indistinct). </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh that's so cool. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's so fucking cool, I
need to get a picture of it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, that's so cool. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I remember being next to the
game where you tip the table. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughter) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There's an arcade game in
Japan, where all you do is like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> you have to tip this
table as hard as possible. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - You know, in like American arcades, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they have the punching machines. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Gigguk] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's that, but instead
of punching something, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you just lift something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - (laughing) You lift the table. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - You flip it as hard as you can. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - On screen right now,
there'll be a reference. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> But yeah, it's really fun and cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's very fun, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But it's kind of expensive,
cause you get one flip. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then you better
make that flip count. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Better make that flip count.(laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - That sounds fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- It's good, its good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Only in Japan(indistinct).
- Only in Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Where else would you wanna flip a table? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Where else can you flip a table </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> in real life and just get away with them? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You don't have to clean up the mess. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Not only get away with
it, but will be rewarded. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughter) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well done,(indistinct) high score. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - In your like, home countries, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> did you ever have like
these arcades at home, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where they would like have this
one Japanese arcade machine, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and like everyone would be on it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - In Wales, they didn't
but in London they did. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, in London there's a few. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember there was one
arcade machine collect.. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I think it was Bishy Bashy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I love that game. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> (crosstalk) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, but like in London it
was like a really, really old, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> like arcade. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was beaten up.
- It was beaten up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And in here, like I didn't
realize there was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> new iterated versions of it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, Bishy Bashy is a lot of fun. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just basically like
Mario party on crack. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughter) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - With only one mechanic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like, you have to press
your button in certain ways, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> but one button. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean Bishy Bashy means to hit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Cause there's some, some
games you are just like... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like I'm spamming
and I love those games. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> It's a fun game, you should play it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if you ever come here. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, it's super fun. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, basically, I feel like
one of the web experiences </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is go to Akihabara, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I feel like you'd be missing half that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> by not going to an arcade as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, and that's the good thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> about Japanese arcades, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Is that you don't have to go
to Akihabara to experience it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Gigguk] No you don't. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - They are literally everywhere. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Gigguk] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Its definitely like a
different gaming experience </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from normal gaming. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> In a way that like is hard
to quantify the value of. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I guess cause as a gamer, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I love spending 10 hours
a day playing video games, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but I can't spend more
than like four hours </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in an arcade in Japan. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- It's hard. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it depends on the game for me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Gigguk] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, I think nowadays.. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's hot as well.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, it's so fucking hot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And If you're on the
floor where they smoke, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like, cause there's always one floor, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where you're allowed to smoke. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh my God, that floor reeks. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, I feel like nowadays </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I probably have a little
bit of an easier time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I've kind of
diversified my rhythm game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Bring headphones, bring headphones. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah.
- Oh yeah, bring headphones. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Bring your own headphones as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You need an aux cord basically. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - But if you don't, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then you're going to try
and play a rhythm game </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> while you're hearing 50 other rhythms. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - At the same time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think that's why it's
so hard for me to sit down </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> or stand is before for like months, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I didn't use headphones. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I couldn't get into it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But when I put headphones
on, I just do my thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - You're just in your zone, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - For like maybe like an hour, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but I can't sit there for too long. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It feels so good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Cause I remember the first
time I tried the piano machine, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and I didn't have headphones
and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't even hear the music. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I'm just, I'm just
playing, press the color. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughter)
You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, there's no rhythm to this game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just smashing what I see on screen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But like with headphones I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> oh, this feels good, this is... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel like a fucking
master at playing piano. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm here, I'm just like, like smashing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, pretty colors. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - So when it comes to
like actual anime games, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like games that are based off of anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Which ones have you done? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause we briefly mentioned </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> about the Dragon Ball fighting games, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or the Naruto fighting games, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but have you guys played any recently? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't think so, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cause the only games,
anime games I can think of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that I played recently
are all like mobile games, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> or like I Gacha games and you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> do they really count as games? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, yes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They are kind of in a
league of their own, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I feel like that's
a separate genre, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm a pure multi-player slave. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> So I think just like no anime
games and like a multiplayer. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because the recent
anime game that I played, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> which apparently no one fucking played was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the Fist Of The North Star game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, cause it was like
a skin on a Yakuza game. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Basically it was done by
the people who did the Yakuza. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (crosstalk) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I mean I fucking love
this in a North star. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So when I saw that and I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh it's basically just a Yakuza game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like, hell yeah! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I played it, that game is so fucking fun. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> No one played it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - If you like the Yakuza
games, you'll (indistinct). </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - But here's the thing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've never played a Yakuza game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've only heard about Yakuza games, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because a lot of my friends like it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - But I was just more drawn to
the fact that it was a first </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> in an all-star game and
it looked fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I saw a clip he's like
(mimicking screams). </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, dude, you can do the
(speaks in foreign language) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> in the game.
- Oh, my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I was like, yes! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It was so fun, so good, I love it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, but.. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Did that get localized over to the West? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm pretty sure it did.
- okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I saw a few of my
(indistinct) friends playing it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah I saw a few
reviews when it came out, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and everybody was just kind of like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah, it's a Yakuza game. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Gigguk] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, do you guys remember
when Jump Falls was announced? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God. (laughter) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - The shit storm that caused. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - That was hilarious. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It was the beautiful irony, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that a game about anime characters </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> had some of the worst cuts
scenes imaginable.(crosstalk) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just remember the scene where, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I think it was freezer or
something, just like floating up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughter) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - T posing and he's like,
all right I have to go guys. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I have to go. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - That whole game is junk bro. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, that's the problem
with anime games recently, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I don't know
if the game will be out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> by the time this episode is out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> But right now I'm doing a
video where I collect a bunch </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of old retro anime games </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that never made it out of Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - To like kind of review anime games, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because like the general consensus I feel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> with anime based games,
at least in the West, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is that they're very
much a modern endeavor. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like only recently that now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> anime is becoming a lot
more of a mainstream thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the West that they're
finally starting to capitalize </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on the Western market. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And, but you know, in retrospect, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> anime games have been
around since like the NES. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - (indistinct) period. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They just never made it out of Japan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But it's so unfortunate that now, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> all these like people in
the West who love anime, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are finally starting to get
kind of a glimpse into like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> anime based games. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Gigguk] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And yet you get shit like Jump Force, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and One Piece World Seeker. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - You got one piece game,
I saw a footage of that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Oh my God, the frame rate was garbage. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Dude, I was kind of looking
forward to that game too. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Cause I'm like maybe
finally we'll get a good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> One Piece adventure game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> No, we did not. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean the problem with anime games, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a lot of anime games,
is they just look like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a quick cash grab. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know what I mean?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - They want to make it look triple A, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but they're not willing to
put the money in.(crosstalk). </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like I remember, I
think it was last year, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> or the year before there was
like my hero academia game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They all look the same, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they all look junky as fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And yeah, I dunno like I haven't like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then you read some of the reviews, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and nothing really sells you on this game, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> versus this hey this actual triple A game, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> or something that has
nothing to do with anime. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I don't have enough
time to play games enough </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> as it is, let alone play.. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] I'm not playing a shitty game. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.(chuckling) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - If you're going to get me off like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> the games I'm cripplingly addicted to, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it better be fucking good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Right, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It better be oak knights.(laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - It better be oak knights, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Breath of The wild was one game </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that like managed to tear me away. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, yeah of course, everybody,
everybody(indistinct). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The only thing that tears me away, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> from like league of legends
is another multiplier thing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where I could just keep
grinding and(indistinct). </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I remember when I first
played Breath Of The Wild, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> cause when I first
played Breath Of The wild </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was when I first came to Japan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I remember it was
great because I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was my first time experiencing Japan, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and seeing all the stuff
and all I can think of is, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I just want to go home, so
I could just...(laughter) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I had the exact same thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I need to get to that temple man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> There is a part of the
map that is unexplored, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I want to hit that out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I remember playing in the bathtub. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I was so addicted
that even my bathing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I had to be playing it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You had to utilize every
amount of time that you have. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I remember, I was in
that fucking fire dungeon, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the wind dungeon thing with.. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Dude it's terrible. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I recently during, at the
beginning of quarantine, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I decided to get back
into Breath Of The Wild. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> But this time I played it on pro mode. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Wow, you're a real gamer,
you are such a gamer. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I know, epic gamer gold moment, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but the only difference between
pro mode and regular mode, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is that on the main HUD, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like, you know how, when you're
playing Breath Of The Wild </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's like the mini map in the corner, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like the temperature, time of day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Gigguk] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Pro mode basically,
takes all of that away, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and just shows you your heart. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So you're forced to
explore and look around. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And when I played it, I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> this is how the game is
supposed to be played, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because I discovered more
things in the photo file. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - (indistinct) This is the correct way. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughter) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, legit because I discovered more shit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in the first 10 minutes of pro mode, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> than I did in the first couple
of hours of regular games. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Damn, what the fuck were
you doing in the regular game? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because in the regular game mode, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you have the mini-map, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So you're forced to like
go to the closer shiny thing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> that you see on the mini map. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Whereas on pro mode, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you have to fucking look
around and I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh shit I didn't know there
was a temple right here, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like right under my feet, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I'm too fucking worried
about going to this tower, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that the game is telling you to.. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Joey is a pro gamer.
(laughter) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Dude, at that moment, I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> this is epic gamer go mode right here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - On the topic of anime games though, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> how'd you guys feel about visual novels? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I fucking love them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, have you ever played one? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - No I have not played visual novel? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I had a moment during high school </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where all I played was visual novels. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I remember I've booted
them up several times. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Gigguk] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - And every single time I
get about five minutes in, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, hey this is
just a book, (laughter) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in disguise, trynna trick me into reading. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is just a book with extra pictures. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like it's a book with extra steps. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like a novel, but
there's like visuals to it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> What the fuck? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think the best example I
ever heard was my friend saying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> this is just an audio book with pictures. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughter) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Some of them don't
even have voice acting. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's an audio book with pictures , </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but the main character never
has the voice. (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Because they want you to immerse. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know, I'm sure
there's a lot of people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that are at home who are
watching this as well </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> who holds her in the same boat as me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where I'm like, it's too (indistinct) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't blame anybody, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Who says that they can't
get into visual novels. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is it in the same category as gaming? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, it can't be, right?
- No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's what I was gonna say, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> cause like, I'm a gamer.(crosstalk) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - There's like different
levels, I feel because like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> okay so like.. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like in a game, I hear you.(chuckling) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, cause like it took
me like years because, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as a kid I would play on my DS. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like I was a Nintendo kid, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> So I had like a D S, would
like play on that a lot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then it took me years
to realize, wait a minute, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Phoenix Wright is just a visual novel. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I never liked Phoenix Wright. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Did you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - He was trynna trick me into thinking. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh I love Phoenix Wright. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I love Phoenix Wright. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - How dare you trick me into thinking? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Let me shoot things. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Where is that high octane
gameplay that I signed up for? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Where is the action? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I didn't come here to think, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> if I wanted to think I'd play.. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I didn't come here to read. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I would have played Professor Layton, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> if I wanted to think. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Hey professor, Layton is
also a really good game. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> (crosstalk) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I would look at it, I love puzzle games. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But that's why when I
tried to play Phoenix Wright, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like this isn't a puzzle game, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they're trying to trick me into thinking, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm using my brain, I'm
just reading the whole time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Weirdly enough, I got into visual novels </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> because I really heavily
gone into Arrow Gaze. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - (clapping) Yes, yes, yes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I started with Arrow Gaze and then.. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's my brother, that's my brother. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I started with Arrow Gaze obviously, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I am a 13 year old
horny boy on(indistinct). </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - What, the first visual
novel that you played? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why don't you just watch
porn if you are horny? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I did. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - You were you in Google,
you have all the Google, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and you think I want to read the porn. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (crosstalk) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, okay, before you get
to the porn, you need to like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it doesn't feel as good if you just, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if they just hand it to you, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (crosstalk) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You earned that shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - You don't read the porn,
you experience the porn. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - So how old were you
guys when you've gotten </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> into this festival? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Arrow Gaze? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like 14.
- 13, 14. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - When I was 14, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> My mum could have come in the
room at any second, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> This needed to be like
special ops precision. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I needed to get in and out, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and get the deep done, because you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> did you have like two
floors through the house? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, I have one floor. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> No, no, I had two floors, but
we're all on the same floor. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay so my bedroom is
on the second, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Where I had about a five second window, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> where I could here the stairs creaking. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I didn't know which
room she was going into, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> but just in case I had
to prepare every time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - During those five seconds, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> it's just the Mission Impossible
theme playing in your head. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like what do I do? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I had like a whole
setup ready just in case, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my mum was going to
walk in the room, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it was playing with.. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> How did you have the time
to get into a story, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And without any of your parents
finding you watching porn? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because I was one of those kids </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> that had a lock on his door. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Your parents give you a lock? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Bro, my parents would
never give me a lock. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Actually like the only computer we had </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in my household was like
the family computer. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I'd use the family laptop. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - So I was watching porn
on the family laptop. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because my dad was been working </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> in an IT company for 30 years, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so he gave everybody
like our own computers. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He had it on easy mode.(laughter) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - He didn't have to like walk
around schedules or anything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But like, I knew because
my parents would always, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they would always be out in several like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> specific hours of the day for work. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I'd be like, okay, it's
Arrow Gaze time.(laughter) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I would just like 10
minutes, get the deed done, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> go back to gaming. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't even remember what
the first Arrow Gaze was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that I played, it was(indistinct). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I remember what it was for me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It was called the Sagara
Family or something like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - That sounds ghetto or something. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - How I discovered it, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> This is like going before Arrow Gaze </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> but it was technically Arrow Gaze. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Did you guys ever go through that phase </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where you're just playing shitty, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like henti visual novels on new grounds? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah.
- Frank's adventure?(laughter) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> That was the shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Are you kidding me?(laughter) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (crosstalk) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Henti sex kid or something like that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I feel like this was two hobbies, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that you shouldn't have
combined at a young age. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like I wanted a game. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - That just like blew the
biggest wave of nostalgia in me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I knew(indistinct). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Of course I do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh you go onto new grounds
and you see that like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> red letter a, I was like,
it's my game boys let's go. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughter) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was so good, it was
like it was so shitty </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> because you know this was made by like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one dude living in like
the middle of fucking like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you know Winnie Peg. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Gigguk] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - In like his mom's basement being like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm gonna make a really
shitty like hentai flash game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - But like, as a kid at that time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that was like the only
exposure you can get. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - So you were just like, holy shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was too afraid at that moment, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to like go on to Google images. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause I didn't know how to
search for that shit, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (crosstalk) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - So you're telling me, you
know how to find porn games, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but you didn't know how to find porn? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah because on new grounds
they have an entire section. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know if it's still to this day, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but back then on new grounds, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there was an entire adult section </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that clearly just said "Adult". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Gigguk] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So you knew that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> if you clicked on that
part of the website, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> every game or animation that came up, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was going to be of that caliber. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Exactly, and they were all hentai games. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - They were all hentai games. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why don't you watch porn? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't understand. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because you don't
know how to look it up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What do you mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> You know what porn is.. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, Because porn hub
didn't exist, you know.. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Wait, when did porn hub come around? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know, Like.. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - when I was like 16, maybe. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> This is (indistinct) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but this was before the age of streaming. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, like in anime
boomer, right?(laughter) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, like so what do you
do if you need to find porn, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> but you can't stream it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> When did Google get popularized? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Cause I remember back then
I was probably using Yahoo, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or Ask Jeeves. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yahoo, Ask Jeeves. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Jeeves, where is the porn? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Where is Brazzers Jeeves, I'm wondering. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Cause the reason I
discovered Sagara family, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> was because you know,
in those hentai visual </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like the new ground visual novels, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you don't (crosstalk). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know what I'm talking about Connor? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I know what you're talking about. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They would always like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the porn part would always be these gifs, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then I saw one of the
comments and they were like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> they sourced the gif. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah.
- I'm like, yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And so that's what introduced
me to the world of Arrow Gaze. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's how I found my
first Arrow Gaze as well, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I played like Frank's adventure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or whatever the fuck it was. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And there was a section where it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you walk into a cinema, but
like the cinema is mosaic </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you have to get like a special item </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from someone to like, unlock the mosaic. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And when you finally did, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was this like gif of
this like, oh, this image. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It wasn't even a gif because
I was from an Arrow Gaze. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was just this gif or this PNG of just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> this like really old
like nineties Arrow Gaze. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Gigguk] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And my 13 year old
brain was like, fuck yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> What is that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Give me the sauce. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (crosstalk) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I scroll to the comments, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and of course there was that
one also a horny on main </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 13 year old, and he was like,
hey, at this part of the game, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> where she from? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Where does this image come from? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And of course there
was this culture boy, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> who was like, my man's, I got you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Probably from Reddit
or fortune at the time, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> he was like, I got you bro. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I came from the A board. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> That's where all the source is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I would finally look it up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And of course back then, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the wild wild West of the internet. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> You could get games like that very easily. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You can get it easily. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You just took like two
millennia to download. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Cause I remember like because
I could only download it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> when my parents were out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What is two gigabyte download, son? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughter) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was like gigabytes, and I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh, this is gonna take time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So back then, like I would have
to like plan this shit out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> This is like scheduled. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay yeah, you had a bell. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - (indistinct) special ops operation. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (crosstalk) You had about
40 different dot RAR files, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and you need to download
them one at a time.(laughter) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause you couldn't
download one massive pile. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> You had to download like.. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That hit too close to home for me, men. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I hated it when you
would go into the website, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's like, you can only download, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you would download part one of 76 raw file </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you finally get it, and
you realize it's like 200 Meg. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, all right,
that won't take too long, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you download it and you
go to download part two, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's like, you have to wait 15 minutes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for the next one.(laughter) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just like god damn it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - So like.. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - These are struggles
I do not identify with. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So like when I actually
done it and sometimes like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> one of the parts would be
missing, and it was just the most, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it was the most angry
moment you can think of. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Cause you've downloaded 40 files, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you just need one more file. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> You, go on WinRAR you try to
extract it, there's an error. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What the fuck do you do? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I remember so many times I would.. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (crosstalk) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I remember so many times. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I just wanted that last piece. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because when you've invested
so much time downloading this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and there's just one file. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> There were so many hentai
games I've never played, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cause there's just one file missing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I couldn't find the problem. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because that's the
problem, it's like unlike, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, previously we talked
about like how part three </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> out of eight of this
anime movie was missing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You could still watch
the other seven parts. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But with Arrow Gaze, with WinRaR, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you missing one part you
can't play any of them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - It just sounds like
fucking Harry Potter hunting </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> down the(indistinct). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like I just realized
how close that story was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to the YouTube story that
we told a few weeks ago </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> about watching animate in parts. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> But imagine, if you're missing one part, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you just don't watch the
entire series.(laughter) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You can't watch the entire movie. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like you're missing part three, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> you can't open part one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Sounds like a message from
God to be a good Christian boy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - And that's why when all those parts </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> did successfully download
and did successfully extract, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you booted it up the
moment a window popped up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it wasn't like spyware. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It was just like, yes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Now I can finally put in the time, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I'd spent so long trying to get, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and I did put in the
time no matter how shitty </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the Arrow Gaze was. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Cause I remember my first couple of, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I didn't know what a good
Arrow Gaze was at the time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just downloaded whatever
the fuck the I saw </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> on Huguenots at the time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was a victory. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The fact that you got it
working and you were like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm gonna play this and
I'm gonna fucking enjoy it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it was amazing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm gonna 100% complete
this shit if it kills me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Damn, I was just playing(indistinct) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughter) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> You guys go and you guys saw you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> go through a fucking mission </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just to get something working. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But it was so worth it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Just to see like what,
one third of a tootie tit? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's what it was, men. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Cause that was like how hard it was, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> to get porn back in the day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like go go rune scape,
selling GF, buying GF? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Actually I have a funny story on that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh shit, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, because like, okay, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is like when I was a kid, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And like when you first discover, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> like the concept of like
sex and porn and like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I didn't like we had dial
up internet back then. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, same, same. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - But like this was going back </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when I was like nine, 10, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> before I could really like
have time to work on a computer </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and everything like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I would like the only way I could get </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> anything close to that was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> by watching like late night
TV shows right in the UK. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, what I try to do as a kid was, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I would record shows on my VHS. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I did that as well.
- okay, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, but there's was this one show, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> cause I looked at the TV guide, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there was this one show. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh I think you did what I did. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There was this one show that was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Ooh this sounds spicy as a kid, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, Ooh, this sounds
exactly what I'm looking for. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was a late night TV
show aired at like 12. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is it, can I say the title? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is it called Babe Station? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - That was the one in UK. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Let's talk about that later. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I probably would have
enjoyed Babe Station more. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The show was called, Sex In The City. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughter) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So me being a nine year old kid, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> thinking I'm about to get porn right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then I set my VHS up, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I go to sleep the VHS records, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I've never been more
disappointed as a kid.(laughter) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, imagine it as a kid, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you think you're about to get full on sex, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for the first time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - In the city.
- In the city </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And the city, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And you just get a bunch of girls </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> talking about Dick and shoes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, what is this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> This is false advertising. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Do you know how much
effort I had to put in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to record this show
and this is what I get. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I remember as well, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like a 12 year old, 13 year old. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And just hearing that like my mom's friend </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> whose favorite show was Sex in the City, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, that's not
very Christian of you, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what the fuck?(laughter) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Man, adults are scary. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (indistinct) hold on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We got to hear about what
the fuck Babe Station is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - So Babe Station is a
channel in the UK, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> And it would air, like what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like 11 30? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, something like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - (indistinct) Just like girls
on a couch, like half naked. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then they would
occasionally take off that bra. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But the whole time you
wouldn't hear anything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You would just here like porn music, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> but they were calling someone, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you could call in and talk to them. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And there's some good videos on YouTube, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> People trolling them, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's pretty funny, but
I was like a 14 year old, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I was like, damn. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's basically chatter bates before.. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - On TV.
- On TV. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - But you can't hear what they're saying. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because they're talking to someone. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Occasionally they would let
you hear the audio.(indistinct) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah.(laughter) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is where you could be having, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that was 12-year old me,
I'm never gonna call them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my God, yeah, cause I remember </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> after family guy would
air, so I would like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> tape a family guy episode, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> just to leave it running,
you know(chuckling). </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Just nonchalantly, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I noticed actually that
light UK TV at night, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> really like holds (indistinct) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (crosstalk) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Porn on so many channels(indistinct) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because Archie and I
only recently discovered, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> thanks to Martia, about
the show Naked Attraction. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (crosstalk) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, you showed that to me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Naked attraction is basically this.. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - You've seen this?
- I have not. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - The show, it's a show on UK televisual. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know what time it
is, I assume it's like.. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's on channel four about like 9:00 PM. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - But basically it's this game
show where a guy or a girl </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> would come onto the show, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> looking for a boyfriend or a girlfriend. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And in the case with
like say a boy coming on, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> looking for a girlfriend,
what they would do is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> they would show five different girls, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but they would be butt naked. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Completely naked. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Completely naked.
- Seriously? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah like, no mosaic, completely naked. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And what they would do is they
would start from the down up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So what they would do is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they would first show below the belt. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Gigguk] Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - And then the guy was.. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And you could see everything. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - You could see everything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And the guy will go, would be like, hmm, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> okay, I like that genitalia. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't like that genitalia. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then at that point,
just from looking at like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> the genitalia, they have to
be like no to this person. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then they would go up to the tits </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and then they would show the face, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then that would reveal the voice. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And at the end, when there's
the last two people remaining, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like last two contestants remaining, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the guy or girl who like
originally came onto the show, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they have to also come out naked. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Gigguk] Oh. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - And then, as they're naked they have to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> pick one of the two and
then they go on a date. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's really awful. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And I watched it, and
Archie and I were like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this is the most amazing
show I've ever seen. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, it's called
Naked Attraction I think? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Naked attraction, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And there's clips of it on YouTube. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - How are they getting away with it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's entire seasons of it on YouTube, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I don't understand how
they're getting away with it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like we get like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I guarantee this episode
is gonna get(indistinct) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and yet whole episodes of naked attraction </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> can be on YouTube, and YouTube is like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> well, I guess it's a TV show. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I guess it's okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, but I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I thought I was going to hate it at first, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> because just from the concept,
it sounds absolutely trashy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - But it makes you like
the worst person ever. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Cause you're like, oh wow, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> their feet are slightly disformed, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm gonna have to(indistinct). </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's not even their feet, it's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh, that pussy is a little mangled. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh God.
- Oh my God, oh. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And you have to say that
in front of the person, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, I would never
be able to(indistinct). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't think I have the
self-confidence(indistinct). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (crosstalk) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But these are like just
chill people, normal people, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and they go on and they're just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> (indistinct)just spice it up a little bit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> There's spicing it up love, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and then there's getting naked </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> in front of the entire
country, there's an in between. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm like, is it really worth it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for the 15 minutes of fame? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> If you have to show your
naked body(indistinct) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - And they show you a little
bit of a date afterwards </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> and they are always fucking awful. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's so awkward, it's so awkward. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like, hi, hi(indistinct) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So, yeah. I hear you think
(indistinct) win tower defense? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> How'd you go on a day after you've just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Commented on their like
weirdly shaped penis. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> My favorite though is when
they do finally pick a winner </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's that awkward hug. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, they do an awkward hug. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - They do an awkward hug
to the person who lost. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like oh, thank you, you chose me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But it's so funny how
back both of their like.. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (crosstalk) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That their genitalia don't
touch as they hug each other. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And the host is just watching it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And she's just like,
all right, fuck off now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - (indistinct) that woman, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> she does all the channel four shows. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> She did a Big Brother. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, Davina McCall? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, Davina McCall. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And she's really big name in the UK. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, she's a good host. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's kinda weird that
she kinda got relegated </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to the see team. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I didn't know she did big brother, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but now I know that it
totally makes sense. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, going back to
visual novels though, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we got very sidetracked. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What was it like the first visual novel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that you played then,
that you would consider </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not going through your trashy
Arrow Gaze teenager phase. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh my God, this is hentai. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think the first one I played
knowing exactly what it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and enjoying the fuck out of it was Kanon. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Kanon, oh okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, because I think
it was weird, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I kind of discovered
the Kanon visual novel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> after I watched air. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Gigguk] Right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What is this stuff by the way? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Cause I have no idea(indistinct) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's from the same guy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Its from the same
people who made Clan ad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I know that, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So before clan ad visual
arts made a number of games, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> One of them being Air, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which I watched the anime of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I first discovered
what visual arts is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, Oh, I want to see, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh, this is based off a game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I couldn't find, I remember
I couldn't find the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> air visual novel anywhere. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Gigguk] Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But I found Kanon,
which is the first game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that they ever made. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I played Kanon, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and of course, if you
know the story of Kanon, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I cry like a bitch, obviously. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> But I was like, the first
time in my life, I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> wow, visual novels are
really fucking long. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughter) Because
Kanon not only has like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> seven different endings, but
just to get to one ending, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it takes about 30 hours. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Almost like a book. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - It is. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Gigguk] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like reading seven
different books at once. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's how they get you, man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean people who play
the same visual novel </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> over and over again. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like, what's wrong with you? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I did that.(laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Go outside, go and do
something productive. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Go and play eight hours of
league of legends, be happy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I played the clan of
visual novel as well, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just to get to the true ending,
it takes like 200 hours. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But-
- You did that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- What's wrong with you? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because I was so invested in the story, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because once you get invested, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's the thing with the secret visual. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - How old were you? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - When I played Konan? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Uh, 15. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - How the fuck do you
have the patience for that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> as a 15 year old? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because I used to read
a lot of books anyway. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because you find time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - What do you do as a 15 year old? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - As a 15 year old, like
200 hours means nothing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Wow, Halo just came out,
I think for me, like it's.. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't wanna to be
like those normy scum </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> who play Halo. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I wanted to be a different one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I wanted to embrace my weird bro. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's nothing better than </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> pissing your friends off at school </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> by like destroying all their (indistinct) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I mean, I would do that at school, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> but then I would come home
and be like, you know what, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I miss you Nagi so I wanna know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> what happens to you baby girl. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, I had friends
in my friend group who </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we would always play X-Box together, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but there's always that one friend, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we were great friends with, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> never hear from him when he goes home. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You were that kid. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I was that kid. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I was in my room just like
continuously, pressing space bar, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm playing Clan ad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Huh, Oh my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because it's so good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Check out this gameplay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Click, click ,click. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then after, and then
halfway through Clan ad </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I realized the auto function, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so I don't even have to click anything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I was just, I was just sitting there, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like watching a movie. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, Oh, hell yeah, dude, let's go. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was just like watching
a movie with extra words. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't think I'd be
able to play a visual novel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like that now though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Which is unfortunate. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Cause it's like watching
anime nowadays, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You can't watch an
anime that's over like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 13 episodes without
having to fully commit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right, and it's
unfortunate because like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> especially in the last couple of years, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I know there's been some
fucking amazing visual novels </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that have come out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Which I know if I put the
time in, I would fucking love. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Gigguk] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But it's just unfortunate
now that a lot of these, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> take like a hundred plus hours, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I know I would have no time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - This sounds like hell to me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> this sounds like hell. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - (indistinct) Question to you Connor, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> did you not play Doki
Doki when that came out? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You missed the Doki Doki. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I saw it and I was like,
cool girl kills herself. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Everyone's happy about it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Doki doki though, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I would recommend because it's
only like five or six hours. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - (indistinct)shorter one, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like a good gateway one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - When that blew up, I just
had on the tell flashbacks </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on YouTube when that blew up(crosstalk). </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause it was that kind of audience </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that was getting attracted to it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, people are
only attracted to this, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cause it's the first time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they're seeing anything
remotely gory, that's it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I guarantee it, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm sure, there's way
better visual novels </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> than Doki Doki, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, oh a hundred percent. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right, right, exactly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But to them it was like the first time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that they were playing a visual novel </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> that was also like kind of mind tripping. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, you guys clearly
haven't played(indistinct) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because that will fuck you up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was about to say I think like a good, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I dunno a good gateway,
a not good gateway, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> visual novel is Son of Utah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because that's the
visual of all that just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hits the ground running. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like it has a really interesting concept, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but it is fucked up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It is fucked up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - So this is a visual novel
written by Guinera Bucci, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who is the same guy who
wrote the in Doka Magica , </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Fate Zero, Psychopaths. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And the concept is about this
guy, I think he wakes up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think he wakes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - (laughing) I can't
remember the exact beginning, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> cause the concept is, there's
just this guy who all he sees, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is just this hellish landscape. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like it's like grotesque. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like there are like intestines. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - America.(laughter) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm sorry, I'm gonna get
killed for that.(laughter) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's just like intestines </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on the walls and just
like veins popping out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's very (indistinct). </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like this, it's like a scene </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> from Silent Hills or something like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Some of the most hellish
scenes from silent Hills </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and the only thing that's normal </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is this like one little Lolly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's just like, she's
the only normal thing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in this hellish landscape. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Cause like every other person is just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just also hellish blob
that he can't understand. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So the only person that
he can communicate with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is this lolly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then that to me just
drew me in immediately. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Right, because it was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> cause it was like, yeah, what's going on? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Damn, why is it this way? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And like that's what I
look for in a visual novel. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Cause a lot of the problems I see </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with a lot of visual
novels, Doki Doki included, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is that the beginning's like very similar, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where she's like, ha,
here's a high school. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's a normal setting. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Here's all the characters. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And you know, it takes
that time to get invested </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the story.
- Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Once you do, it's fucking great. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But, Son of Utah if
you can handle a bit, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> if you're not squeamish then and you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you can handle a bit more, you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> your stomach's a bit stronger. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - If You can get past the gore, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Son of Utah has a fantastic visual novel. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's fucking great. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like great story, great characters, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everything about it is awesome. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Hey guys, this episode of
the Trash Taste podcast, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is proudly sponsored by CDJapan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> CDJapan is the best place to order </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Japanese CDs DVDs
Blu-rays and collectibles. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They offer the widest variety of major </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and independent J rock and J-pop music </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that you can find anywhere. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] Not only are
they an E-commerce site, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they also have a proxy shipping service </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that is easily the most popular offer. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - So basically to explain proxy shipping </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if there's certain items
that you can only get, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you're in Japan, like for example, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we recently bought a lot of Jojo merge </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that you could only get in Japan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Do you want to explain what
you've bought from Japan? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, we have the
watch that Joey's wear. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Hell yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Let's say if you wanted
those sweet Jojo suits </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I posted on my Twitter, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> couldn't get that unless
you live in Japan. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But if there was a proxy service, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> you'd be able to get a hold of those. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, so all you need to
do is give them the link </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to whatever products you
want and they will buy it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and ship it for you straight
to wherever you live. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - And the good thing is in case
you didn't get any of that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then on the website as well, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they give you a step-by-step guide, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on how proxy services work. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So you fully understand how to
get the necessary equipment, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and much that you're looking for. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - So basically if you see anything </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> on our shelves that you can find online, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that might not be
available on that website, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> then you can use the
proxy shipping service. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - We've also heard that
their customer service </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is extraordinary and
it's one of the aspects </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that they care most about of the service. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - And of course, with the recent events </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that have been going on in the world, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they've also done a really
good job to keep everything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> up to date for all of the customers, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> including all their social media, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and of course the
affirmation Customer service. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So you can be sure that you're
in some pretty good hands. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - There's tons of different
delivery methods on the website, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> such as DHL, FedEx. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So no matter what you
ordered, you can guarantee </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that you will get it
safely and in one piece. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - And no matter where you live as well, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they will make sure your item gets to you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Let's see what Jojo stuff they got. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, just on the side,
Oh, they have the journo pen. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah, they do, look at that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Me and Connor have a.. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I have this one, I
also have like three knockoffs. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh wait, no, I have the
(indistinct) pen, actually. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I have the drummer one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's really cool. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> It works as a figurine
and it works as a pen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - You would never wanna use it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - You'd never use it as a pen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's an awkward pen to use. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, imagine buying
this and being like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm gonna use this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But it is cool, it is cool. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - If you want something like that, </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_04> This is why you need to learn
Japanese so you can buy manga, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Japanese and read it for that cheap. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's fucking crazy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - You can hear the first volume </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of steel ball run for $6. </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_03> Look at that, the
important part right there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Hell yeah, what else they got? </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> So again, thank you to CD Japan, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for sponsoring today's
episode back to the video. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay. I'm hearing more about
these great visual novels, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> and they sound crazy, but I don't know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if I'm just a person who's never gonna get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> into visual novels cause of how I am. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like is, is Dangan Ronpa a visual novel? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause I felt like it was. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Cause that shit dragged on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Dungan Runpa, is kind
of half visual novel, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> half history game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Because it's visual novel in the aspect of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when your going through
the story elements, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's a hundred percent visual novel. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like in the way it looks and
the way it presents the story. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But when it comes to the
actual mode of mysteries </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you have to solve </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> there's a bit of exploration that happens. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And the whole part of when
you go to the actual trial </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's a whole game in and of itself. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, that's true. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean, I just got remembering
being so frustrated </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> playing that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know why. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Which one did you play though? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - The first one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, don't play the first one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is it bad? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The second one is by far the best. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I thought everyone said like
the third one's the worst. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - The third one is the worst. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - First one ain't great either. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I didn't, I wasn't a huge
fan, I played all three. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> First one was okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The second one though is by far
the most optimized the best, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in terms of like game playings, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> of the story in terms of
characters, everything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then the third one,
they just dropped the ball. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> They are all so disappointing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - (chuckling)No. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They bombed that so fucking hard. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was the ending to the third
one, which I was just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it made me sit through three
whole games of this shit, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and that's how you end it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Fuck you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - If you had to like pitch it to me, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> to get me into visual novels, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm sure there are some viewers at home. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> How would you do that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause like, as somebody who's
never experienced visual novel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and doesn't really think
that he'll like it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, do you like books? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Hmm, it's been a while
since I have read a book. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - (laughing) Well there's
our first problem. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - (indistinct) with books is
that I never seek them out, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but every time I've read a
book, I've had a great time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I get it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Then that might just be
the case with visual novels </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or maybe all you need is
just that one visual novel </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> that you can relate to. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And because you know the pool
of visual novels is so deep. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - What's like some
beginner recommendations </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for visual novels that like everyone must? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Honestly Doki Doki. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, Doki Doki is a great, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> like it's just a great starter
one because it's so short. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> If you can get through like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the worst part Doki Doki unfortunately, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is like the first half where it's just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> setting up the scene and everything. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> But like at the halfway
point hits and it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh this has got a lot
of interesting ideas. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - In defense of Doki Doki though, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> the reason why the first
half is so boring is because, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's parodying visual novels. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So knowing that if you go into Doki Doki </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with that mindset, then the first half is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a little more bearable. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But the thing is, if you're
not interested in the actual, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> the problem with visual novels is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you're not invested in the story, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're not gonna enjoy it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No matter how flashy or good it is, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Gigguk] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And that's the unfortunate thing is that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so many visual novels
get passed under the rug </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> because too many people are just too lazy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to get into the story. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Gigguk] Yeah, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - This guy.
- Yeah, this guy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I hate story in video games. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, here's the question to you then? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> What are like some
visual novel adaptations </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> for animate that you've
just really enjoyed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's a good question. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Have you watched a lot? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, I think I have. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Maybe you have watched a
lot and you just didn't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I can't remember the top
of my head, which ones? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Some of them might be Stein's Gates. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I like Stein's gate a lot, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but that felt like a visual
novel when I was watching that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> There's lots of moments where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they weren't afraid to
like be boring.(laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Not be boring, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> but they weren't afraid to let you sit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with (indistinct) situations. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's a very slow character
development matter. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Amazing animator. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like I fucking loved that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it's an amazing visual novel. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, cause I remember I
had the game on three 60. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I just never played it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've don't know why I never played it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think I bought, I watched
the anime and thought, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wow, I wanna play this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I bought it, never played it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> cause I was like, what a muffet.(laughter) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's also like the
Fate franchise love those. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Fate, every Fate series I've watched, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I didn't watch the new ones
cause they were based on.. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, that's a lot of Fate series. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Heaven's Feel. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Heaven Feel, I didn't
watch Heaven's Feel. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I watched, I love Fate
Stay Night and Fate zero, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> are some of my favorite
oh Unlimited Blade works, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> some of my favorite. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh that's all just the Fate game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh I know it is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> But then, you know,
you wanna get into Fate </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you see the fucking
chart of like the Fate law. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And you're like, wait,
there's how many Sabers? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't want this many Sabers. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was just Type Moon being like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> let's make this universe just
so difficult to get into. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So you watch the anime and you think, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> this is a little confusing, but
it makes sense, I like this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then you actually go
and look what Fate is, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you're like, this is a dumpster fire. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like the biggest enemy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> against people getting
into fate is ironically, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the Fate fandom itself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Oh no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because, here's the thing, I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I have one of like one of
the most popular Fate videos, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> which is just me parodying, how to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> unlike a newcomer trying to
understand the Fate series. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And like to me, as someone
who like really likes Fate, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's really not that hard to get into. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You've watched Unlimited Blade Works. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You've watched Fate zero. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It doesn't matter which
one, which either one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - They are both amazing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, they can
be enjoyed by themselves, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and then from there, you
just take it from there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - (indistinct) told me when I was trying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to get into the fate
series, I was like, okay, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I can trust your opinion
because you've been with Fate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> from the very beginning until now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> How do I get into it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And he was just like, watch Fate zero, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> watch Fate unlimited blade wars. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And you will understand 95% of the law, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and the rest is just a bonus. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh really?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - But the problem is
the like the Fate fandom </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as a collective, just can't
seem to fucking agree on it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because there's like, I fucking lost it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because there was this
Reddit thread recently, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on like our anime and someone had made, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think the title of the thread was, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "I made an easy to follow guide
on how to get into Fates." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Right?(laughter) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The ultimate click play. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I fucking burst out
laughing when I saw like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 800 odd votes, 700 comments. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm just like, Oh
boy, here we fucking go. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That ratio, oh my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm gonna get the fucking popcorn. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I remember like one of the
top comments were just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh yeah just watch Fate Zero, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it doesn't really fucking matter. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Fate Zero is good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And like, the next comment is, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but you're not gonna answer
an X if you watch Fate Zero. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm not just like, Oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like how is how I can't imagine
how it looks for a newcomer, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cause it looks like a (indistinct) right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It does, I mean, I
watched Fate Zero first </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and I thought it was
like a classic, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I thought it's a great show. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, I can re watch Fate Zero. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know, do you
get put off by shows, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> if the fan base is
toxic or shit like that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Cause I don't, and I'm just like fuck you, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm gonna watch the show
and make my own opinion. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it's weird, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because I remember the Fate Fandom, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> used to be a lot more toxic, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It used to be more toxic? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh no, definitely there
was this phase, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Where if you recommended
people to start Fate, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> with Fate zero, when that first came out, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then there will be
people in the Fate fandom </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who were just like, how dare you? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> How dare you not just recommend
the original visual novels? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like he was like, if you're
not willing to sit through </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a two hundred hour visual novel, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then why are you even
enjoying this franchise? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - O my God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And now it's evolved
a bit, now, it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> okay, people just want other
people to get into Fate. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But now they just don't know how to agree </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on one specific ways to get into Fate. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's the problem because
it's a problem of fate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> being a visual novel adaptation. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because there is no perfect
adaptation of Fate Stay Night, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cause if you think about it logically, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you think about something
like the Montgomery series, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> easy, you start with
release order, all right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So you start with
(indistinct) cause that came </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> out first, you know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> But the problem with fate
is that chronologically, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the first released adaptation
of the Fate franchise, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> is just shit, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause it was.. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (crosstalk) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah Fate stay night adapted
by Studio Dean, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So that basically
adapted the first roots of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the Fate visual novel, the
Face Stay Night visual novel, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But it's also like a
really hard starting point </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for newbies to get into
fate because it's just shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Its not recommended in this day and age. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So what you would have
to recommend is probably </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> unlimited blade works,
which is the second routes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> But then, you know but
then people skip over the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like entire first root which
is the Fate Stay Night route. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So it's complicated because of the way </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the visual novel is laid out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I hope, I genuinely
thought Fate Stay Night </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and Fate Stay Unlimited
Blade works was just a remake </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of Fate Stay Night. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, you think so, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is it not? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's completely different? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think from my understanding,
correct me if I'm wrong. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Fate Stay Night Unlimited
Blade Works and Heaven's Feel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> are just different endings
to Fate Stay Night. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, okay so.. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel like this is how NASA must feel, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> trying to fucking program their rockets. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - And people keep saying </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> that the Montgomery series
is complicated, like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> So yeah, there were like three
routes in the original Fate. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh my God, I'm doing the meme now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is the short version. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What happened to numbers? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> We can't number shit anymore? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's because of the way
visual novels was laid out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with different routes, all right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So you think of something
like Clan ad or something, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where like a different route,
you get a different girl </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or like, you know, that's.. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like a Pokemon, women are
like Pokemon collect them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - So in Fate it's like every
route is completely different, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it starts at the same starting point, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if that makes sense. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So technically.. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do I need a notepad, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> do I need to like write this shit down? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - They all start at the
same starting point, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> but that's not made apparent
in the anime adaptations. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, no. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I fucking hate(indistinct) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Which is why you would think
that Unlimited Blade Wars </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and Fate Stay Night </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and Fate zero and Heaven's Feel, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are completely different games. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Gigguk] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But in retrospect they all are the same. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Dude, sometimes I feel
like I'm the only asshole, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> who just doesn't give a
fuck about half the shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Cause like everyone seems to know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then I'm sitting there like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I just wanna just click play. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh trust me, it took me
fucking forever to understand 1%. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Most people like me or
like you guys, I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I feel I'm in the minority. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've been here since the beginning. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So you guys probably don't remember </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> that there's been two unlimited
blade works adaptations. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I did not know that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Wait, wait both by(indistinct)? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - No one like Studio
Dean did Fate Stay Night, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> then I think they did Unlimited
Blade Works movie as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Are you serious?
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then (indistinct)
came along and was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fuck that shit we are
starting over at Fate Zero. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then they were like, okay fuck, okay, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> we've done Fate Zero,
fuck Fate Stay Night. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Let's go to Unlimited Blade Work, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then adapt Heaven's feel. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Cause I only remember
that there was only </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> two Fate Stay Nights. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Gigguk] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then there was the
Studio Dean Fate Stay Night. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is too much. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then, (indistinct)
was like, hold my beer, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> let's do a better adaptation. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then it was just all from there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But I didn't know about
the second unlimited one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, and this is just a making fail, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's so fucking bad now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And we are not even
mentioning all the(indistinct). </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is just the main
timeline, Kanon as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Just watch Fate Zero, and
then if you like it(crosstalk). </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Honestly, from what I've heard, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if you wanna get into fate, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> just watch Fate Zero and
Unlimited Blade Works. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Fate Zero is a great fucking show, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's, you can just
watch it on its own. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You don't need to have a college degree, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or a PhD to understand
what the fuck is going on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Just watch it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> If you like all the characters, you know? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's fucking great. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Hey, watch Montgomery it's
less complicated.(laughter) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, so is Pokemon, like
what are we recommending there? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Fate's a lot of fun. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, you get into
it for the good story, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then you're like, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I got into it cause I
was doing a fandub of it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh seriously? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - (indistinct) someone
else's fandub of it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think I was playing like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - How the hell do you do an
abridge of the Fate series? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - It wasn't abridged, it was a fandub. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I know, but like just
the hypothetical question. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Has anyone done it?(indistinct) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (crosstalk) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> how do you abridge
something that complicated? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, you can just
abridge a certain show, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but like having to explain
the entire franchise, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, that's an undertaking. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I want a Fate abridged
where the entire bridge is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just them explaining the Fate law. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I'm actually doing
a video on that, spoilers. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Great minds think alike,
big brain boys think alike. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've actually been working
on that for like over a month. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Of course you have. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - That was not a scripted bit,
I'm just letting you know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Got promoting his future content. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's probably not going to be out, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> by the time this like
this episode comes out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I don't know, it's there's different. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Cause the Fate franchise
is so wide, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But it's like just this rabbit hole, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that you can just sink in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and there will always be.. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I feel like we found a
trap talking about it here. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah exactly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But that's the thing like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if you just wanna enjoy Fate Zero </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and Unlimited Blade Works, you can just.. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's what I did. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, what did you think of them? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I loved them both individually. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I felt very satisfied and I felt that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm okay not having more. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Like I was, I saw the,
it's like you finish it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and then you walk outside, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you see the rest of the world on fire. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And you're like, no, not today. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Are you gonna watch Heaven's Feel then? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I thought someone told me that, that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was just based on the Gacha game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, that's Fate Grand Order. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's Fate Grand Order. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, is that an anime series as well? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, there's a Fate Grand Order anime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (crosstalk) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - To to make it more confusing,
the Fate Grand Order anime </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> adapts the like the, like
one of the later chapters </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the Fate Grand Order Gacha games. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> So it doesn't even start at the beginning. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Why, are they doing this? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Ask Type moon dude. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like I wanna watch more
cause I enjoyed what I watched, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> but at the same time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it just seems like I'm gonna
be watching it, thinking... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's the thing it's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm scared to start watching
the Heaven's feel movies, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> as much as I want to
because I'm just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> oh God, do I have to like fucking revise? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm gonna be paranoid. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm gonna be watching
thinking like, (indistinct) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I just wanted to like,
watch something, you know? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's very daunting, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> but it's really not that
complicated because.. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughter) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - You say that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You literally wrote
a 10-minute rant about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how much of a fucking mess this is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> What do you mean, it's
not that complicated? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Look, you can enjoy Heaven's
Feel if you've like watched, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Fate Zero and UBW that's
the end(indistinct) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - You control a lot of things(indistinct) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - You know he's a veteran, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when he calls Unlimited Blade Wars </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> UBW, it's like it's too long. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> UBW, you know what I mean, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - He (indistinct) so much
in his daily vocabulary, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> but he has to shorten
Unlimited Blade Works to UBW. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Fellow Fate fans, I tried, okay? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I tried my fucking hardest. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - If I find that.. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm not falling for your
trap today(indistinct), </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> not today. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm happy not having(indistinct) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I will sing that time
into a visual novel, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> before I try and get into the Fate soon. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, do people just
like not watch shows, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then just think, okay, I'm done. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I've had enough of this show. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's how I felt with Fate. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well yeah, I mean, some
people just get so invested </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the characters that they
just wanna go further beyond. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like Who liked Saber so much
that we had this many Sabers. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Why, wasn't one Saber okay? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Am I mistaken with being
happy with one Saber ? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> You should ask his people. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - What's wrong with with one Saber. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (crosstalk). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Why is one Saber not enough? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, okay, here's the thing, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I didn't get it until I started
playing Fate Grand Order, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and then I totally get it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause I like, I don't
care too much about Saber, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but Rin, Rin's my girl, so. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, I know(crosstalk) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - So whenever like there's.. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - How many Rins are there? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, there's, there's no.(laughter) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The fact that there's no clear answer </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to this question is fucked up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - There's not as many
Rins as there are Sabers. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What do you mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There shouldn't be more than one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - For example, like
getting Ishta, for example, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, I need to get, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> every time there's a character </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that kind of resembles Rin, I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well time to(indistinct) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm not going to lie,
the first time I saw Ishta, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, Oh, is that Rin? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - You know, I hear this shit, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and all I think of like
man, this sounds like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's nearing Kingdom
Hearts level of bullshit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, no, Kingdom Heart wishes,
it could be that awkward. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - we're just talking about the series, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> we haven't gotten into Fate law. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - We're not getting into that.(laughter) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (crosstalk) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Apocrypha and like
(indistinct) and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - You know, being around anime fans, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you hear these words
like Apocrypha whatever. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I hate that shit so much,
I don't know what it means. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't wanna know what it means. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know what it means either. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I hate it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - But I know it's just a spinoff. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I hear it so much, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - All I know is that
Apocrypha and (indistinct) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> are spin offs but the spinoffs
that also add to the law. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's time to stop. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean.(laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, we are not getting into this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, So to start off my
lecture today on Fate law. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - (indistinct)things
that I didn't get before, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> let's go back to that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughter)Oh my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> You have two minutes gone, say your piece. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, just watch Fate Zero. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Watch Unlimited Blade Works, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then that's like
the main line timeline. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So you can enjoy Heaven's Feel. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> And then if you wanna enjoy
more of the Fate franchise, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can because none of
it's technically Kanon </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> even though it is, but I'm
not going to get into that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Just watch the main timeline
shows and that's me, that's it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - You say watch the main timeline shows, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> but at this point we don't know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what the main time line shows are. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm convinced people that like fate, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> also like cock and bull torture.(laughter) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> They wanna die. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The one thing about Fate
that I wanna say is that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I couldn't fucking believe when, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I asked the same question
to Nobi, my friend, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who's like heavily into Fate about Saber. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, why there's so many Sabers? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And do you know what he said to me? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> He's like Saber, the clause
or Saber the character? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughter) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I mean, what do you mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, Saber and he's
like, yeah, which one? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, what do you mean which one? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Cause there's Saber the clause, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then there's the character, Saber. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I know that, I know that, I know that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause like she is the Saber clause </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah.(crosstalk) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - But then yeah, but then he was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Saber clause, Saber
character, I'm like, Saber. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The one called Saber. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Which one is it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And at that point I was like, okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't think I'll ever be able
to get into this franchise. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So bottom line, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when it comes to visual
novels, maybe skip out on Fate. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm convinced, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> If Fate didn't exist, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the world would be 100% more productive. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> We would have cured every
known disease on the planet. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But these people are too busy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> making fucking timeline charts. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, Type moon would actually be like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a cancer institute, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Honestly, if we redirected
that, that mental resource </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> into doing something productive, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there would be no poverty,
poverty would be ended. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But instead we wanted a hundred Sabers. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's what we went for. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's because we just wanted
to collect the waifus, okay? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We just want a slightly
different variation </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of the same character, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so they could like sell us
to like roll another like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 1,000 rolls in the Gacha. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then we can be like,
yeah, I have another Saber. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I have everything I want. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh wait, they released another Saber? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh, okay, okay I see, I see. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is just like that, you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like that there's memes
where it's like the fucking, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the business meeting with the
executives and they're like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what do the people want? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They really like, it seems like gentlemen, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they really enjoy Saber. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then someone's like
Saber two, Saber two </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's like three Sabers </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Saber two, but it's not the Saber. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - If saber is so good, why
isn't there a Saber two? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> The executives are like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> we got your back. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Super Saber, you want a super Saber? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Saber black.(laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Saber pink. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - There's actually like a red Saber. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh no, I'm done. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, red Saber and the Saber red. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, there's a red
Saber and Saber of red. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Those are two different characters. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - At this point Time Moon
has to be fucking with us. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Right, like I'm ready for them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm ready for Time moon to just come out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and just like
pulling(indistinct)just being like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah all of that, has no meaning. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We just wanted to fuck with you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm going insane, listening to Gon, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> try and explain this shit
to me, I hate this so much. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I wanna have an
episode where I just like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> spend an hour explaining Fate
law to you guys. (indistinct) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughter) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - But going back to visual novels, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> That we would recommend to
beginners, AKA, not fucking.. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like one pain to another, man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Other than Doki Doki literature club, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what's like another visual novel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that you would recommend to Conner? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Undertale. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know because.. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - There are none, psych. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, question, would you
recommend kinda of a show Jo? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Kind of a Show Jo also
has like, acts one, is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it takes reading through act
one to get really invested </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> into kind of a show Jo, kind of a show Jo </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is great by the way. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is there like 10 million
Sabers in that as well? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - (laughing) There isn't,
70 cuddlers unfortunately. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Kind of a Show Jo Actually has a very, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> very interesting backstory. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (crosstalk) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Cause I mean, I feel like the backstory </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is almost as interesting
as the visual novel itself. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't wanna say too much, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> cause I'm also working on a video on it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it's a visual novel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that basically originated from Four Chan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Can you believe something good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> actually came out of For Chan once? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So it's like a data simulator
with crippled girls, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> from Four Chan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And you say that and you're like, wow. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - (indistinct)Be quaking. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But like it's, it's one of
the most like wholesome kind </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of inspirational stories
about how these disabled girls </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> like really just, are just
normal people and just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like how they deal with
their disabilities. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That sounds good, I'd read that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it's great.
- It's fantastic. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's, actually a really,
really good visual novel. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And if like how much
patience do you have though? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause I've seen you gaming, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If you're not doing something
within the first five seconds, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you're not like head shotting. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> (crosstalk) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - No scope in the first 10 seconds. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I have an amount that I
can like power up in myself. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - But is it enough to go through </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the first chapter of catalog show jo? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why is it that bad? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's not bad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> (crosstalk) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - How long is the first chapter? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, that's a good question. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I can't remember. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Depends how fast you read. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'd say like an hour or two. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's a lot of time.
- An hour or two maybe? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Holy shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's the same with Doki Doki, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cause like it takes an hour or two </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to get through the first half. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - But, mind you unlike Doki Doki, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which is about a six to seven hour game, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> cuddler show Jo has about 30 to 40 hours. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's fine. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So compared to that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> an hour's not too bad, until it starts. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Honestly, I do think Son
of Utah would be really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> really good for someone like you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause I know you can handle that shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And that was something
that hooked me instantly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Maybe I'll stream, am
I allowed to stream it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Is it a game I can stream? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, it's It's been on Twitch. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh geez, goddammit Twitch. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was the first visual novel
that was banned on Twitch, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> because of course(indistinct)
be out here just being like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm not making anything
that's family friendly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm here to traumatize
everybody that plays my shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, cause it's a story,
it's a visual novel that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> doesn't have that, you know, entry period. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It has a very interesting concept, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it just kind of hooks you right away. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And for me, I remember
just reading Son of Utah, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I read it all in like one sitting, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cause I just wanted to know
immediately what happens next. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Like there was no break from
me starting it to finishing it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> In terms of like visual novel type games. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know, like, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Here's the thing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> would you count the persona series, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as like a visual novel with
a lot of gameplay in it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, that seems like an RPG to me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, the thing with
the persona series is that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's really interesting
because yes, it is a JRPG </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but a whole lot of the JRPG element, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and like how you play the
JRPG element on that game, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is dependent on the visual
novel side of the game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because what the persona series did, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which I think is fucking genius is that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> they made you the way
that they made you sit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> through the story of persona,
and it's a long story, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you've played any persona game, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> the genius way that they
made you sit through, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is that by sitting through it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and physically interacting
with certain characters </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in certain ways it changes
how strong you become </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in the JRPG element. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So what you do is you
form Alison persona five. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What you do, is you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> by talking to certain
characters and befriending them, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and like going out to do these
like normal everyday things, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you would level up your
different abilities. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And those abilities then
get directly reflected </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in the JRPG element. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So the more you're involved in the story, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the easier time you will
have in the JPG elements. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And what that forced you to do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is that not only is it
interesting because it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're playing two
different games at once, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but you are literally forced
to sit through the story. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - So everybody that plays
it enjoys the story.. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So like, if you imagine
like a Gacha game right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So in every Gacha game there's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the gameplay element and then
there's the Gacha element. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I played Fire Emblem, Three Houses. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - And that had a lot of story-building, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> which I found so boring. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, you found that boring. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I found it really boring. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I would just skip, whenever
they start talking, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like B B B. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - But the thing is fire
emblem, three houses </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> kind of did the same thing where, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you are doing everyday
things around the campus </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> would affect you in battle. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, I liked Fire
Emblem Three Houses, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I enjoyed what I did, but
I, for whatever reason man, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> the moment I see text pop
up on my screen, I'm like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you are in the way of my game. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - You are so monkey minded. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You got that monkey vibe.(laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know what
happened to me in the womb, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but like, I can't pay
attention to story in games. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm sure there's one
or two people out there, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> who can sympathize with me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but the moment story
comes on any video game, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, where's the skip button? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Where's it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I can't, I can't pay attention. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - So what's what's your favorite
story in a video game then? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughter) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Trick question. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Has there ever been one? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Bro, I need to like
really go deep in my memory. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember the only game that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think I watched the cut scenes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I think I was like 15. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't even know why I played this game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's called blue dragon it's a JLPG. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Weird games, stupid
people in the comments, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> were like, I don't know
what that is, it's a JLPG </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Comment below, if
you've played blue dragon. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It just seemed like a
dragon quest knockoff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> But I didn't know what
dragon quest was at the time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I watched dragon quest
afterwards and I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wait a second. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> This looks awfully like
that game I used to like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And you know, it pains
me every time, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> When I go to press that skip button like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know what it is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, is there something wrong with me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I can't enjoy story and video games. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (crosstalk) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Maybe, but like for me, it's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I look for a gameplay loop, not a story. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like the complete opposite of you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well no, cause you play, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you've played league of legends,
you played at fair amount. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> You are playing Valorant right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - In terms of like single player games. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like, I need a story. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't play single player games. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, you played for example Cup heads </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> or something like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Cup heads yeah I should
speak on Cup heads. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That was fun, but that's
for the gameplay loop. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I tried playing Cup head. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like why am I playing cup head? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> What is the narrative reason
for me to complete this game? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I just love running gun games. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I need a narrative reason, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and if you need me to sit through
like a two hour cut scene, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll fucking do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> If it's a good story, I'll fucking do it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like the reason I loved
doom 2016 so much is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you literally start that game. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You smash a skull open and
you start shooting.(laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That was like, Oh my goodness. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - June 2016 is the epitome
of like(indistinct) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (crosstalk) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - They made a game for me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was like, gun,
enemy, shoot, let's go. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - That was like exactly what I wanted. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I just wanted the game that
was like fuck the story. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Let's just make a gameplay
that is addictive, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And so when I play, like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know what pisses me
off to death about JLPGs. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I love JLPGs.
- Do you? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But the moment, they
start making the menu </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a fucking challenge is when I start, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like this is too much, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I love Fire Emblem Three Houses, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But there was times in that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the menuing was like half the game play. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm the officer now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - When there's a complex menu, I was like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh man, look at all the
different things I can do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Let me play the damn game. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - You are playing the
game on the main menu. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Gigguk] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, you know, like I go
from, I jump from multiplayer </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> games to multiplayer games
like, I've been like diamond </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in league of legends
like five years in a row. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I started playing TFT
recently got to diamond one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And that nilly master tier, if you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you play these games,
you know, it's good shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm a big brain essentially
playing Valorant now with gone. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Sometimes it's a good game to CSK. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I played Overwatch, got to master in that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, what's like your opinion on like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> something like the
metal gear solid series. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (crosstalk) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah I played(indistinct) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well that's because that's
like very heavily stolen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's like a that's
not visual(indistinct) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughter) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like Halo, I love Halo. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I have no idea what any
of the stories are about. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - The halo story is great. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I remember there was a scene. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Did you play Master Flex? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, no, not too much story for me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember Halo, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I remember they like hyped
it up the (indistinct) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, if you don't know
the Cortana, you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but she comes back, sort of. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Cortana dies, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember everyone was
hyping up. so sad, so sad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was playing my friend
and we are doing it together. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And the moment the cut scene
happened, I fucking skipped it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> No, no, what are you doing? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We need to find out what happened. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like why? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> we gotta shoot things. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, this is hurting me so much. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know man, I
just, I'm sure there's one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm I in the minority here? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like it's 50, 50, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Maybe.
- Maybe. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Or like 70 30, cause
there must be a reason why </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> the most popular games are
like multiplayer games, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, because they're played
by 11 year olds, you know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Monkey brain.
- That monkey brain. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean the reason I got into
games like league environ is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> just cause I could just get into it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like, it was like a stress reliever. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's a 40 minute thing that
you do, and it's no more. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's just like a, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like a different
kind of stress relief </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and like animal crossing, for example, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but you just get in a
quick session, you get out, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you play as long as you
want and then you get out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's a closed loop, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you don't feel like there's anything else. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - For like single-player experiences. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I like to get invested in the game, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> in the same way that I like
to get invested in anatomy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And like, I love just, I
love that feeling of just, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> marathoning a show and just getting.. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Putting yourself into a story, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and being able to like physically
interact with the story. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like, it's so fucking cool. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think I ruined games
for myself during the X-box. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - So is there literally not a single game </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you enjoyed the story of? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I cannot, like I enjoyed
Zelda Breath of the wild </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> a fuck ton, but I don't
know like what I was doing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just remember, cause when I.. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Breath of the wild is
such a good story too. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Is it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The moment we started talking (indistinct) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, give me the bomb, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> give me the items, shut the fuck up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I need a(indistinct)
because breath of wild </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was the last game I
played where I got like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> no matter what other game was out there, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I wanna play it, like
you said, it sucked me in. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I loved that game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That was because I felt like
the way they built the world </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> didn't require a story, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cause the story is the
same shit we're used to. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (crosstalk) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - In my opinion, the most genius thing, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> about breath of the wild is that yes, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> you could skip all of the dialogue </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and still really fucking enjoy it purely. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's why I loved it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Cause it was like, do your own thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's even more enjoyable
when you actually </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> talk to the MPCs and
especially the ones that are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of just out in the open, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not the ones that are in the towns, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and just hearing what they say. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It does such a good job at world-building </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm serious, you're laughing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but the MPCs, like I
listened to all the MPCs </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm like, okay I have so
much of a better understanding </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> of this world now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - (indistinct) He's like I'm
on the visual novel place. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, exactly.(laughter) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm hearing this and I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wait, you spoke to the MPCs? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wait like, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> The thing I hate the most, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Is when games make you speak
to MPCs, I hate that so much. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It depends on like the game for me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because if it's a world
I'm not invested in, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then I'm like, whatever, this is shitty. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> But if it's like, where I'm
super invested in, I speak, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm the kind of person
just speaks to everyone, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cause I wanna get as much content
as I can out of this game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I remember speaking
to you and you were like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't enjoy a game </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if I'm not making someone
else's day be worse.(laughter) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I said that to you as a joke,
but that's kind of true. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> This is something that like to me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I, maybe this is, again,
coming back to the episode </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where we spoke about chess, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like to me, gaming has
always been a thing of like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like a thing where I
can, I can learn a skill. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I can get better at that skill, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then I can beat others, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And like, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sometimes you play a game
of league of legends, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it feels like you
are playing the piano. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, it feels like
you're just crushing them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But then when you get, when you lose, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it's not a good feeling.(laughter) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I wanna play a game, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and I wanna beat other people off the top. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - He wants to make
someone else's day worse. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> That's how he gets enjoyment. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like, its why like if
I play league of legends, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't play normal games. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, I need to play a ranked game, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> cause I know that people will give a shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Cause if people are giving a
shit, no one's invested, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> If I fucking die a ton, no
one gives a shit in a normal, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, they do, but I don't give a shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But if I die in a ranked
game, I'm like, fuck. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think that's why I'd
never gone into PVP games. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Really? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - it's because I've never given a shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Really.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's pretty wild. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like I can't like, I don't
give a fuck if I'm playing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do you know like refining a skill, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like getting good at something and like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's not what I play games for. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, that's what I do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I play games for fucking escapism. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right, but then I guess
my form of escapism is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> learning the skill and
having that gameplay loop </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of doing it over and over again, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then going against other people. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, I don't know of that,
because I don't give it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause like, in my opinion,
the reason why I love JLPGs, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> is because there are no
bragging rights with JLPGs. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> By finishing a JLPG, it's not
like, yeah, I beat this game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, that's why I beat
persona five like five times. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Not because I wanted to brag to people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> that I beat it five times, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> but because I wanted to see
the route of all the waifus. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But you just bragged
about it, I'm joking. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I just did it, but.. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, it's not for bragging rights. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't do it for that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I don't do it to feel
superior or anything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just do it cause to me,
I guess, gaming for me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the way that it's been an escape is that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I get to sink myself. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause I need to be challenged constantly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Gigguk] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And when a game doesn't challenge me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in like either mechanical
skill or like mentally, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like I'm just not invested, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cause I'm like it's not challenging me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I need something to challenge me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, this is why I like
playing instruments, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So that I could get that
side of my brain focused. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - But then I guess, we
are all different, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like for me, I think maybe escapism, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and you do have that part of
you want to challenge yourself, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it's satisfied by just
learning an instrument </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or playing an instrument. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> But for me, it's like I think
it's way too consuming for me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I'm way too competitive. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I was that one asshole in school, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> who turned everything into
the Olympics.(laughter) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - There was always that one guy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was like, oh, we're doing a light jog? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh, we are doing a light jog all right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then I would fucking sprint, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I remember like I can, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if this doesn't explain
how like competitive I am, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know what will. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> In school, when we used to
do long distance running, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was terrible at long distance running. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Gigguk] Okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But you bet every single time we did it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I made myself throw up, I
was so desperate.(laughter) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was so desperate to win
the long distance running, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that I would literally,
every single time we ran </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I would push myself into the point </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of throwing up because I wouldn't stop, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I wouldn't stop, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - He don't miss.(laughter) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And I remember, it literally
became a joke at some point, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> that every like, cause every year </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you would do a school thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Gigguk] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I remember I
would do the 400 meters, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I would not stop
sprinting the whole time, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and I would let you get to the, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I would sprint the
whole 400 meters to win, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I would stop, and I would
just go(burp sound). </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughter) Cause I was pushing myself </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> way beyond what was
needed cause in my head, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> it was embarrassing to lose. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, I get people like that but.. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And before anyone
thinks, wow, man, Connor </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> your parents must have raised you in a way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that made you fit, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> but no, my parents were like,
yo Connor, calm the fuck down. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like my parents were like,
where did this come from? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Cause we are not like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I guess that's interesting
you say that though, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because then now I'm wondering </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> why you're so heavily into Arc knights. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Because Arc Knights is a
PVE game, not a PVP game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wow. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But it's still got, I think I know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Cause it's still got
like challenges in there, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and Arc Knights is the worst
fucking like combo for you, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cause it's a game that you can't win, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> unless you spend more money. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And then even if you spend more
money, you still can't win. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - And there's a whole bit of enjoyment, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> by following the story. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I didn't follow the story. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, I've, you know,
I've level 95 on Arc Knights, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but now that I've beaten
all of episode six, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and done all the challenge modes, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I kind of woke up the
other day and I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> what have I got to do?(laughter) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've done it, I've done everything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've done it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm in the end game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I've completed the Arc. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But like that's the thing, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I think I also
destroyed any chance I had </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> of liking story games cause </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when achievements were a
thing on X-Box three 60 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Gigguk] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You bet I was that asshole. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (crosstalk) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I got way too into some games, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I remember I got so
frustrated with JLPGs, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cause I would just buy any game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But there was due to research </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which games were easiest
to get achievements on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I didn't do that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just bought a game
and I would complete it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But fuck JLPGs, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> They had the worst achievements. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They were like collect
every one of this item. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> And then you would go to the guide, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> and it'd be like, Oh,
well, seven of these items </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you can only get at that time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And if you didn't get it
at that time, sorry kid </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you gotta restart the game. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm like, I hate you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Who did this? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I hate you so so much. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think that was a saving
grace for me that I never owned </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like an X-Box three 60 or a PlayStation. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I never played on a
console that had achievements. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was always just the Nintendo kid. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> So it was literally just
you versus the game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Gigguk] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I wish I did that because I
remember I got an X-Box one, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and one day I was like, why am I, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> why am I getting these achievements? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, what am I, what am I? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I thought like he had the
feeling, like(indistinct) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can perfect the skill to
get all of the achievements. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh, okay, it's on, it's challenging me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This is a challenge. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - And I looked back at all the shit I did, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like I beat the Lost video game, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> the fucking Lost video game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I remember that even.. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I didn't even know, there
was a Lost video game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Even my 15-year old self could tell </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this video game was not a video game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Like this was garbage dude. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I beat it just to
get that 1000 and she, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I hated that game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, actually question to you then, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> do you kind of like gamify life sometimes? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Like do you?
- You know what's weird? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Okay, that's a good question. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Do you wanna explain
what you're going to go </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> with the rest(indistinct) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, because like basically,
you know, sometimes, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I do see our job YouTube, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as it's kind of like a game right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Cause, they fucking gamified this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You get achievements, you get numbers, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you got your rivals, you
know, you do a good video, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it gives you a Pat on the back. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It gives you like a, like a
green tick mark to be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you did well, you did well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's weird, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because I saw, I read about this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's called a maximizer
and a satisfier, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Some people will take the first
option that satisfies them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Gigguk] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And they're okay with that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There are other people
who maximize the shit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> out of everything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I do know what happened, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but somewhere around the age of 18 to 20, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I swapped from being a maximizer </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and literally everything in my life. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- To just being satisfied. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And like I remember when
I was buying a vacuum </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for the first time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Holy shit, dude, I like
spreadsheets on spreadsheets. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, yo, put the
suction power of this one, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is 50 Watts, extra and
shit, this is bristles, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> extra firm ones there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But the reviews of this one, Oh my! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know what I mean?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like I would get stressed
out about everything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That happened with YouTube and stuff. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But somewhere along the line </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I just stopped giving a
shit about everything. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And I'm like now, you know, even when I, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I remember I used to book hotels,
I used to like, Oh my God, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I would search every hotel
in like a 10 mile radius. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I would have a spreadsheet. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I just got to the
point where I realized, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't think this matters, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't think I need to do this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And now I just take the first thing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that makes me remotely happy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah I mean, it's just kind of like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> decision fatigue right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like there's only so many decisions </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> that you can make in a day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And there are some points
when I'm exactly the same, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> especially when I'm
like booking a holiday, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or finding like even just like choosing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> what you wanna eat today. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I'd say the only thing
I still do it in my life, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> is for video games. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I still do that for video games, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> but everything else, even
YouTube, I just do what I do, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm satisfied with that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Like I, I checked the analytics, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I, you know, like roughly,
but I don't go deep into them. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I just see like, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You are not like Oh my God,
I'm down 1% from yesterday? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - If I gain less subscribers
than the previous day, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't care, I'm like, I'm
still gaining subscribers. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I actually found out like a
huge problem for me recently </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is that ,I found it really
hard just to get into new anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and games just because like
there's so much choice. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> And I don't know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I have this thing where I'm
so scared of wasting my time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - See that's the thing you need to let go. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like I had that, I had that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I just stopped giving it a shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Cause like recently, okay, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so the most recent anime I've finished, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> was one that he had last season, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was called a Sing Yesterday For Me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And like the first beginning
of that was fucking great. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, I'm good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is gonna be a show. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is like anime of the
season kind of territory. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I watched it and
the first half was great. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then the second half
was just kind of like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> nothing's really happening,
and then it ended </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then it just kind
of just ended very fast. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was obviously like
a very rushed ending. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was like the most seven out 10 overall. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I remember your tweet
where you were like guys, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> watching yesterday anime of
the season, take it from me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> The anime song. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like yes, you have that story. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - And, like, I like, I just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember I finished it
and I knew this was an anime </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm going to forget in like a month. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Is it though? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think its okay, Cause
the way I see things, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is like no matter what happens, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> if I got something I can
talk about, that's a win. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like you pulled it up, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's all about the experience. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, you had something you.. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was the friends we made
along the way.(laughter) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We are (indistinct) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - At the end of the day,
we're all knocking my baby. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - If I have something
that I can take away, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like that, it's painfully mediocre, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's something I can talk about. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I can't be mad at that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - But imagine I didn't have a podcast, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> where I could just talk about it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You can talk about it to your friends. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - You can talk about it
to your friends, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> You could have said this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, if it had been good, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> would you have been happy? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, you wouldn't have,
you'd have been like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> satisfied with the choice you made. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You wouldn't have been happy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, I would like, because. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - What do you mean? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> He would have. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - He just watched a good anime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Cause he wanted it
to be an amazing anime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> And if it lived up to his
expectations, he'd be like, good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> He wouldn't be like, Oh my God, yes! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, I mean like, I mean. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I know this guy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, no I would be happy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Fuck off. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Fuck you, I would be happy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm happy watching good anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Don't show me like, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, okay the one thing that's even worse </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> than being a bad anime is
just being a meh anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I remember like When I
finished domestic girlfriend, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> like the Manga. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay, so I finished it
like a few weeks ago. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - We go back to this again. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - We are going back to domestic girlfriend </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - He always finds a way
to bring it back up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> He always finds a fucking way. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like that ex-girlfriend,
that he just can't let go. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can't let her go but
it was an awful ending. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like it was, it was absolutely like one of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one of the worst endings
to like a horror Manga. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is the worst trade deal. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - You are not selling us on this one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, just imagine it, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This is what it was like, okay, imagine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay, it's the world cup final, okay? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] All right.
- [Joey] Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, in terms of like,
which girl was gonna win. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, okay.
- All right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - So it's the world cup final
you're in the 90th minute. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's Instapage time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You're like ten one up, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then for no, like the other team, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is like completely incapacitated. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then for no reason you
decided to play golden goal </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and then score an own goal. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That was the ending of
domestic girlfriend. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, that's that's fun,
you can talk about that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> But that, but that's the thing right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Is that because it was so
bad, I had a great time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like experiencing just the dumpster fire. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Unlike the nuclear fallout(indistinct) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was fun, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, like I had more fun with, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm gonna remember domestic
girlfriend for way way longer. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Than sing yesterday for me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because what I'm so scared of is just, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm gonna watch a show
and I'm gonna be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm gonna forget the
show, within a month. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - But that happens a lot. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It does, it does. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, if you'd like,
as somebody who watches </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> so many fucking documentaries, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like I watch a lot of documentaries. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> It's probably the only thing
I really watch on Netflix. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Kind of come to accept that real life, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> doesn't have good endings.(laughter) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Unfortunately like life just doesn't have. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It just kind of ends. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It just doesn't have
good endings, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, you know, if you make documentaries </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about people who are still alive, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> sometimes they keep doing shit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> after the documentary comes out, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then it's like, it's not
a complete documentary, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I just kind of get like
satisfied with what I get, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if it's a good journey. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And if it's a mad ending, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's something I could talk about. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's the way I see it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like if (indistinct) documentary, great, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I have something to talk about. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> It's a good documentary,
cool, I can talk about it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I've just come to accept </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that life just doesn't have good endings. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (crosstalk) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Put that on a T-shirt.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You know, like, come on, tiger King, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> first part was way better
than the last part. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I, mean come on man.
- Yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like it's I dunno. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I just come to accept that
it was good when it was good, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I'm not gonna get too fussed about it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's the whole thing, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's just, it's just this idea of like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> you know, nothing in life is pointless. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like you'll always find a way
to utilize that in some way. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And no matter how fucking
mediocre a show is, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> you're gonna use it somewhere, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> even if you're not even aware
of it, right like, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I realize how fucking
weird I am right now, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> cause I just don't like
story in video games, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I'm happy with mediocre
stories(indistinct) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughter) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Then you love a lot of visual moments. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, I don't know, it's hard. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is like a debate that
I'm trying to come to terms </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> with myself as like, is it okay
to watch something mediocre? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - But is it okay to play
something for the story? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, never, everyone's like,
did you play last of us? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> No, cause it's all story. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - But you get to shoot things in it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, there's no skill involved. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's nothing I can master. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I loved Halo, and I
loved playing the like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> legendary roots alone where like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's fucking impossible to
shoot driving up the wall. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's not like every 12 year old, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I didn't talk to in school.(laughter) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think we wouldn't get on in school. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - If we went to the same school, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I would be like, fuck that guy.(laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> who plays Halo, Legendary,
man, what a wanker! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Man, I love that shit, its a good game. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, but so yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Is there, is there anything
else you guys wanna talk about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on this podcast? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Bottom line, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't think Connor is ever gonna get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> into visual novels and
that's just how it is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like, the more I talk to him, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the more I'm like, yeah, visual novel.. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's the Neto of animating
my mind, It's like you.. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's a refined taste. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's not even a refined taste. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like, I feel like
you are either genetically </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I suppose what's the
word like you're going to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're more likely to like it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what's the word? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There's a word for, I don't fucking know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Supposed or something, it's
something along those lines. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It's not that word. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, we're a bit drunk, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I feel like you're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> either going to like visual
novels or you're not. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> And you know, cause if someone explained </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a visual novel to you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you're going to be like, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know, but like
I've never met someone , </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> who just doesn't like story period. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, that's like, if you don't like story </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> in games, period, then I'm like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I like story, not in video games. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Get out of my video games, raw force </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> amazing game metal slug, amazing game. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> No stories in those games. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's what we need. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - You are telling me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you never looked up the wall
of metal slug?(laughter) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I have played too many
hours in metal slug, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> loved that game to death. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I have no idea if there is a story. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Is there a story in metal slug? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Apparently there is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is there? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Fuck off, no there isn't. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, there's apparently a story. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The new doom, I fucking loved, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> but I was like, wait,
wait there's cut scenes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> No, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But you're not like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> care about something like
world building, for example. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, but you can do
that through gameplay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, but it's not as effective. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> There's so many, okay
there's so many games </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> that try to do world
building through game play. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right, you play the new dooms, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> you know exactly what the
world is about, just from. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - But aren't you like actually
interested in the world? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No.(laughter) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - And there's your short answer, really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> (crosstalk) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I say that, right, but
every time I hear a piece </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> of like legal legends law,
I'm like, Oh, that's cool. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's cool. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I actually, I'd watch
a league of legends anime. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But I don't wanna
watch league of legends </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> cut scenes in game. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Imagine you have to watch cut scenes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in league of legends, you'd be like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Connor has like two modes in his brain. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> And there's like, no in-between. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just like shut off
brain, like absorb anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It could be shit, you're
just like absorb it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Or it's like monkey brain mode engage. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I am the greatest primate in this group. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like on or off, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I can sit there and
watch light any anime </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or whatever you need me to watch. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I could sit there and watch
it all day and be like, okay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I know what I'm getting into. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But when it's games, get
that shit out of here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Get that shit off of me.(laughter) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I literally like, I
love watching Tyler Wan, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> like live streams cause
I feel like he embodies. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - He's the definition of monkey brains. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I love Tyler Wan as a streamer, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because he literally embodies like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> not only physically how I
imagined my game of size to be, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> but like watching him play
The Last Of Us was so funny, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cause he was just like,
what is this story? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Get this shit away from me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was like, I love it,
I love it, it's so fun. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> He's just such a like
giga-chatted, brain gamer. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> It's so fun to watch him. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> He's my favorite streamer. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Just cause I relate to
that on so many levels. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my God, I guess
you guys can let us know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> in the comments below, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> if there is any visual
novel that you think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Connor's monkey brain can handle. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've lost all hope that Connor
can get into visual novels. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - We can't, we can't convince him, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> so maybe you guys can help us. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, okay, you know
what, before we finish this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> People were like, yeah,
I've beat Fire Emblem. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like, Oh yeah, me too. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And they were like, Oh, did
you play with the roots? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, why would I play
with the roots?(laughter) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I remember talking to you about this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That hurts me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm like, why would
I play with the roots? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You play blue lions right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I play blue lions, which I, you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> after I heard about all the other routes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like so I played the right one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no.
- No, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> There's no right one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's just one of three. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - And mine sounded like the most. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - So we were going back
into Fate now.(laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, no, we're not doing this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> We were close to ending the episode. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> All I'm saying is that,
to me the point of playing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> the same gameplay again
for a different ending is, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it doesn't make any sense to me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, the thought of that is insane. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - We'll never be able to
understand this monkey brain. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Science please dissect my brain. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I need to do like a full on
study to be like, okay story. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You like story. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Connor is like, yes, yes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I like story.
- I like story. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Gameplay, gameplay you like gameplay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yes I like game play. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Story and gameplay, no, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Story and game play bad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I do know like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Basically that's pretty accurate. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think that's why I love arcades. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Cause like they don't
try and give you story. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's great. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They don't try and bulk
me down with this shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Apparently the nostalgia,
the piano game has a law. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I can't read Japanese
so I wouldn't know anyway. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You know what game is amazing
with fantastic game play </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and no story? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What?
- Chess. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> No story in chess. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's why I like chess so much I think. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> it started from a young age,
my displeased(indistinct). </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's actually funny,
cause the thing I like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about chess is the story </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and law behind the history
of chess.(laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - There are two people in the world, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> two different people
in the world right now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But saying that, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> If you made a documentary
about chess players, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I'd fucking love the shit out
of that cause I don't have to, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's not like, it's not like.. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because it's not
interjected with gameplay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because yeah, because
It's not like 10 minutes in, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> move the pawn forward two. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, okay, it's not like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cause some of these visual
novels have game play </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I've seen some of the shit, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's like, you click
one dialogue like thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And it's like, why give me the
choice to click one dialogue? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, except that one piece of gameplay, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> is the most stressful
piece of gameplay ever, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because it's like, Oh my God </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which one do I shoot? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Gigguk] Exactly, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Chess the documentary, I would watch. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Chess the game, I play. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Chess, the visual novel
slash documentary game, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> no, get that outta here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't wanna know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - You are like the epitome of
someone who can't multitask. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I actually can't multitask whatsoever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I say that.
- It shows. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, maybe I watch anime in the gym, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's about as far as it goes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wow. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Keigo brain, keigo brain. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What an evolved brain, you have. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Me crying on the treadmill.(indistinct) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think that's a good place
to end this podcast before, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like we're gonna need a whole like study, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on how Connor's brain works. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Why is my brain so smooth? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You know people are gonna
