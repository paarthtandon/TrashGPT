<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<joey> I hope I hope Mudan left that
fucking shouting thing in </joey>
<garnt> at the beginning. </garnt>
<joey> Cause that is like, that's not an act. </joey>
<joey> We sometimes do that
just to wake ourselves up </joey>
<joey> for the show. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I'm taking a
page from corners book. </garnt>
<garnt> I was about to say taking
a book from Connor's page. </garnt>
<garnt> Wait a minute. </garnt>
<garnt> That doesn't sound right. </garnt>
<joey> - So what have you guys
been up to this week? </joey>
<connor> I know Connor you went on a trip, right? </connor>
<joey> - I did, but before that. </joey>
<connor> I got this sick new shirt. </connor>
<garnt> - Where'd you get that sick shirt? </garnt>
<garnt> - Probably the same place
you got your sick shirt. </garnt>
<joey> - And Joey got his. </joey>
<joey> - What? when was this? </joey>
<joey> Yeah, that's right. </joey>
<joey> We're finally releasing merch. </joey>

<joey> - Yeah, so this is a special
deal that we're doing right now </joey>
<joey> with our friend, Bakuretsu, </joey>
<joey> who, if you guys can see the logo, </joey>
<garnt> he's the guy who designed the logo. </garnt>
<garnt> And he decided to, this is
official collaboration merch </garnt>

<joey> - So buy them, buy them now. </joey>
<garnt> - Yes, go buy them now. </garnt>
<connor> - This is more like, kind of
like an experiment for us. </connor>
<connor> We always talking about merch. </connor>
<garnt> So we didn't know how many
of you would be interested. </garnt>
<garnt> This is just like a first release. </garnt>
<garnt> So, if you like this then
we might do more merch </garnt>
<garnt> in the future, who knows? </garnt>
<connor> - It's a very simple design, </connor>
<connor> but we just wanted to start simple. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, just start simple,
you know, easy to know. </joey>
<connor> - Materials are amazing,
I got to say boys. </connor>
<joey> - Oh yeah, this is much better quality </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> than what you'll get at
regular T-shirt sites. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But so, if you're interested in that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> go to bakuretsu.co/trashtaste </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> link's in the description as well. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> And yeah, hopefully you
guys will simp for us </joey>
<joey> with these beautiful new shirts. </joey>
<connor> - But yes, Joey, I did go on a trip. </connor>
<joey> - Where'd you go? </joey>
<joey> - I went to Niigata,
which is Northern North. </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, it's like directly
North of Japan, not Japan. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> Directly, North of Tokyo is
what I was trying to say, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I had a friend, Kenta, from university. </connor>
<connor> Who actually loved the story
parts from our university. </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause he was like correcting
some of the details to me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - in my mind. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And how like the Neo Nazi
guy made like phosphorus </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> chemical substance (Garnt
laughing) in the building. </connor>
<joey> - Were your fucking
roommates like Walter White </joey>
<connor> or something? </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> - Honestly, this guy was insane, man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But anyway. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It was nice meeting him again. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I haven't seen him in ages
and he lives in Northern Japan </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and he's a teacher there and a pastor. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And yeah, he's chill. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> Just went up to see him. </joey>
<connor> - A pastor? </connor>
<connor> - Pastor, yeah. He's a pastor. </connor>
<joey> So in japan... </joey>
<joey> - Like P-A-S-T-O-R not P-A-S-T-A. </joey>
<joey> - NOT pasta. </joey>
<joey> - He's a pasta, linguine. </joey>
<connor> - I can't say it right, a pastor. </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> It's a pasta. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> If I want to eat pasta, I would have that, </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> but he's a pastor. </connor>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<connor> - Did you eat pasta with the pastor? </connor>
<joey> - I did, yeah, I did that. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, because in Japan there's a... </joey>
<joey> This is kind of so damn and condescending. </joey>
<joey> There's a job for like foreigners. </joey>
<joey> He doesn't even look that foreign. </joey>
<joey> He still looks Japanese. </joey>
<joey> He's half, like we. </joey>
<joey> - All right. </joey>
<joey> - He's, half Wales, half Japanese. </joey>
<joey> And his job is to
basically repeat a script </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> that a real pastor might. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like it's all for show. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So they just want a foreign looking guy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to like say the words. </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> - So he's not even like a legit pastor? </joey>
<joey> - No, none of them are. </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like a fake service. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So you pay a guy and
he just says the lines </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and does all the moves
and looks (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<garnt> the real part. </garnt>
<garnt> Feel like he's seen a
pastor, like that's his job. </garnt>
<connor> He marries people </connor>
<connor> - Wait, wait, how is that a job? </connor>
<garnt> In what job sector is it needed? </garnt>
<connor> - I think there's a huge market in Japan </connor>
<connor> for wanting a foreign experience wedding. </connor>
<connor> It's like a really like. </connor>
<joey> - Could I find this on Craigslist? </joey>
<connor> like looking for fake pastor. </connor>
<connor> - No, it's interesting,
it's expensive as well. </connor>
<connor> He was telling me the price, it's premium. </connor>
<joey> It's for like rich people. </joey>
<joey> - Rich and dumb people. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, to us that's dumb as fuck, </joey>
<joey> but to them it makes sense. </joey>
<joey> So that's his job and yeah,
he was basically like, </joey>
<connor> you want to hang out in
Niigata and I was like, sure. </connor>
<joey> I want to leave Tokyo. </joey>
<joey> I'm just sick of Tokyo. </joey>
<joey> - How long were you there for? </joey>
<joey> like three or four days, right? </joey>
<connor> - Three days, yeah. </connor>
<connor> So the first day didn't really do... </connor>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh, the first day I went
out with him that night </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and he took me to a bunch of girl bars, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which are not like hostess bars. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause hostess bars they sit next to you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's just like a bar where the girls </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are on the other side. </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> Normally it's like 40
year old, 50 year old men. </joey>
<joey> Just like older men </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, from what I understand
is a girl bar's just </garnt>
<joey> where the bartender,
whoever's like your waitress, </joey>
<joey> is just obligated to talk to you. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Is that right? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, we went to a bunch though. </connor>
<connor> - It's like a really
expensive call center. </connor>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like one on one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Some of the prices weren't bad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like the first bar we went into, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the girls like only
spoke to the other girls. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Not like, I'm like
fucking pay me attention. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just, I'd never been to one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He was like, do you want to go to one? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He was like, do you want
to see you at them all? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, sure, why not? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This will be a fun story
to tell in Trash Taste </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which is worth more than money. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> So, the first one was like
900 yen for 30 minutes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's cheap. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - So you can drink as much as
you want in that 30 minutes. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And it went very slowly </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because the people were no fun there. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> But yeah, </joey>
<joey> - Clearly that, that explains the price. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> You just like banter with them. </joey>
<joey> Like one of them was saying
that they can't understand </joey>
<joey> English characters and in
Japanese I asked them like, </joey>
<joey> can you read Kanji? </joey>
<joey> And they were like, yes. </joey>
<joey> And then I was like, I rest my case. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </joey>
<joey> - Why? as if like they
can't read the alphabet. </joey>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, they've been studying
it for like five years </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and couldn't read the English alphabet. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What? how? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I'm like, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<connor> So I was like, so you can read
Kanji, right? in Japanese. </connor>
<connor> She's like, yes. </connor>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, hmm. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> (Garnt speaks foreign language) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yes, I said (Connor
speaks foreign language) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> all the old dudes in the bar laugh. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, hell yeah, dude. </SPEAKER_01>
<joey> And everyone clapped and stood up there. </joey>
<joey> - He saved the boys there. </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> - So then we left that bar </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and immediately like four
people were like, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, oh nice,
you know these guys? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And he's like, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, oh, we're following them? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> He said, yeah, why not? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like, okay, cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - All right. </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> - So we're following them and
they take us to a bunny bar. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, like everyone's in a bunny costume. </joey>
<joey> - Is that what I think it is? </joey>
<connor> Everyone's just sitting in a bunny suit. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, but due to COVID they
weren't in the bunny suits. </connor>
<connor> They were in bunny school girl outfits. </connor>
<joey> And I thought this is a cop-out </joey>
<joey> because they're wearing school outfits. </joey>
<joey> - But with the bunny ears. </joey>
<connor> - (mumbles) bunny ears. </connor>
<garnt> - That's like every cosplay
who says they cosplay </garnt>
<garnt> and they just wear headbands. </garnt>
<connor> - We walked in there and it was exactly </connor>
<garnt> like what you think. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_06> It looked like, to quote Joey,
a bunch of ugly bastards. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It was like 50 year old
men who looked like really, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> really like... </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> - Just craving for attention, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, and we sat down
and we looked at the prices </joey>
<joey> and it was like 50 bucks for 30 minutes. </joey>
<joey> - Jesus. </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> - So we were like, so
we're leaving, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like we're not staying. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then the here he
looked at me like, yep. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yep, all right, cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I'm just going to go
now, then you follow me. </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> So we just did that. </joey>
<joey> - So, leave before the
dudes saw us, right? </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, so we ditched the
guys who took us there </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and they were like, whoa,
where are you going? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> We be like, bye, bye,
bye, went to another bar. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That was a lot of fun. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> We just spent all night, and then somehow </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> some sketchy dude was like
come to another bar I know. </connor>
<garnt> No, we never met this guy. </garnt>
<garnt> - At what time of the night was this? </garnt>
<connor> - Was like 2:00 AM. </connor>
<garnt> - Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - We got to take it to another bar. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_02> And we get in there and
it's like a drag queen bar. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm like how? like proper gay bar. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it was a lot of fun and yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Sung Bohemian Rhapsody,
and I was butchering it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I knew the guy next to me was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, playing very nice. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause he was saying I was singing great. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, no, no I'm not. </SPEAKER_01>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, are you alive, this is just. </SPEAKER_01>
<joey> - Yeah, it doesn't matter
who you're with, right? </joey>
<connor> No one can sing 'queen' well. </connor>
<joey> Everyone butchers 'queen'. </joey>
<joey> - I was like, you're a very attractive guy </joey>
<SPEAKER_01> but you don't need to lie to me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I know I'm butchering it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I know, I know I'm shit at this too. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You can't make this more obvious. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Then we just went to another bar </SPEAKER_01>
<connor> and just chat shit with people. </connor>
<connor> I feel like my Japanese got
way better when I was drinking. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I dunno why, but
it's the same as my Japanese, </garnt>
<garnt> as my Thai, where when I get
like a few drinks down me </garnt>
<garnt> somehow your language
skill was just improved </garnt>
<connor> by like five folds. </connor>
<connor> I don't know why. </connor>
<garnt> - You stop doubting yourself. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - You just say shit. </connor>
<joey> - It's really weird
though because that works </joey>
<joey> for every language except English. </joey>
<garnt> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </garnt>
<garnt> - It's so funny, like I
forget how to speak English. </garnt>
<garnt> So sometimes I just like run,
like when I get super drunk. </garnt>
<joey> I noticed last time you
got drunk at the onsen, </joey>
<joey> you just like start speaking Japanese. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And I was like, I totally get that. </joey>
<garnt> Cause when I get drunk, I just
start speaking Thai as well. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, I'm just like, I don't know. </joey>
<joey> So many people have told me
like when I get blind drunk, </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> it doesn't matter if no one
around me can speak Japanese. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I only speak Japanese. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like really fucking proficient. </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> Like I'm reciting like fucking, </joey>
<joey> like MLK speech in Japanese. </joey>
<joey> And meanwhile if I go back to English </joey>
<joey> I'd just be like more drink here. </joey>
<joey> I just go cave man when I
go English, for some reason. </joey>
<joey> I don't know why. </joey>
<connor> - I brought a souvenir. </connor>
<joey> - Souvenirs? </joey>
<connor> - Little green being things. </connor>
<joey> - Kind of want to bring gifts. </joey>
<connor> - Well, just cause Joey brought. </connor>
<connor> - After I applied pressure to him. </connor>
<connor> All right, don't worry
folks, we found them. </connor>
<joey> They were just behind us the entire time. </joey>
<connor> - So, I'm guessing
because Joey started this. </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> Now we have to bring things
back when we go somewhere. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> I was told this is a famous Niigata thing. </joey>
<connor> What is this Joey? </connor>
<joey> - It is sasa dango. </joey>
<connor> - Of course, I mean,
I can read that but... </connor>
<garnt> - That's my favorite. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_02> - But what is it Joey? tell us. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I know of it. </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> I've heard of it before,
but I'd never actually... </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> - So, we dig in. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So basically, this is banana leaves. </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I'm pretty sure. </connor>
<connor> - Okay. </connor>
<connor> - And it's just like a
dango which is like a, </connor>
<connor> not a dumpling, what's the word for it? </connor>
<connor> - A red bean paste. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, kind of like a red bean paste. </connor>
<connor> It's got red bean in it. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, but basically you
just crack this open. </connor>
<connor> I've never actually had one before. </connor>
<connor> I know what these are
because I've seen them around </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> because all sorts of different... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause I think there's
different types of sasa dango </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for different areas of Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wow, that's wow. </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> - That's (Joey speaks foreign
language) right there. </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, also for Joey's birthday, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I got him a bottle of wine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, thank you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Which I don't know
which one you want Joey. </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> Then I bought one for
the Trash Taste boys. </connor>
<connor> These are both Niigata wines. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh yeah, cause you stayed
in a onsen that had a winery </garnt>
<garnt> in it or something, right? </garnt>
<connor> - I went to visit, I didn't stay in it, </connor>
<connor> cause it was like $800 a night and yeah, </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> Trash Taste ain't doing that well yet. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But yeah, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, I did try a lot of the
local wines while I was there </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> and I thought they were
actually pretty good. </connor>
<connor> And I thought, why not bring
back a wine for the boys? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I noticed with Japanese wine. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause I remember when I
went to, I can't remember, </garnt>
<garnt> I think it's Koshi Valley, </garnt>
<garnt> where it's kind of like
the Napa Valley of Japan. </garnt>
<joey> And I tried a lot of the local wines there </joey>
<joey> and I find that Japanese
wines are either really good </joey>
<joey> or not so great. </joey>
<garnt> I've never tried a Japanese
wine and I've just been like, </garnt>
<garnt> Hmm, this is like, this is okay. </garnt>
<joey> - I love that this is
considered Japanese wine. </joey>
<joey> It's like, oh yes, my
favorite Japanese wine. </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey speaks foreign language) </SPEAKER_02>
<garnt> I probably butchered that German. </garnt>
<garnt> It says Japan at the front though so... </garnt>
<garnt> - This is good, this is
like the weirdest unboxing </garnt>
<connor> I've ever done. </connor>
<garnt> But yeah, we are unboxing banana leafs. </garnt>
<joey> - So you have to you,
because this thing is thick </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> you have to kind of
take it in small chunks. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Don't don't eat the whole thing
because you will choke on it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and possibly die. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Are you serious? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, yeah, you know it's
like really common way </SPEAKER_02>
<garnt> that people die here,
a lot of old people die </garnt>
<garnt> from choking on dango and mochi. </garnt>
<garnt> - What the fuck? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Health hazard. </connor>
<garnt> - So I just bite into this thing? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> This reminds me of a Thai dish. </garnt>
<garnt> There's there's a Thai
dish of something similar. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Just take small chunks, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, It's like, in Thailand
we have like banana leaves </garnt>
<garnt> that have like sticky rice
wrapped in banana leaves. </garnt>
<connor> - It's actually pretty nice. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, can I have the banana. </connor>
<connor> I'm not gonna eat it all at once. </connor>
<connor> - That does taste like a banana leaf. </connor>
<joey> - I like this. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, it's pretty good. </connor>
<joey> - I just like the flavor though. </joey>
<joey> I mean, other than the red bean, </joey>
<joey> - I mean like, okay. </joey>
<garnt> For anyone who hasn't
tried red bean paste. </garnt>
<garnt> It's, how do you describe to someone </garnt>
<garnt> who hasn't tried red bean paste before? </garnt>
<connor> - Oh dude, it's weird. </connor>
<joey> I don't. </joey>
<joey> It's hard. </joey>
<connor> - But you guys like it, right? </connor>
<garnt> - I like it, but it's.. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's grown on me, red
bean paste is that one thing </garnt>
<garnt> where as like, I dunno,
somebody grew up in the West. </garnt>
<connor> My idea of my idea of... </connor>
<connor> - Sweets. </connor>
<connor> - My idea of my idea of
like desserts or sweets, </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> basically just boiled down
to chocolate and ice cream. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm like, if I'm feeling
like super fancy or something, </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> something like a tiramisu or
cake or something like that, </joey>
<garnt> having like red bean paste
and like mochi and stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, man, this tastes really good. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, I've always been fascinated </joey>
<joey> in the whole Japanese
sweets, like culture I guess. </joey>
<garnt> - It gets weird man, they
go crazy with sweets. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's called wagashi, for
those of you want to know. </garnt>
<garnt> But like dango, mochi,
that kind of stuff is like, </garnt>
<SPEAKER_06> it's weird because a lot of wagashi, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> a lot of Japanese sweets
can either be sweet </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or depending on what you put with it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they can also be savory. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So it's like a weird, cause
like this for example, </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> it's sweet, but it's not
like a chocolate sweet </joey>
<joey> or like a tiramisu sweet. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's almost a savory
sweet, if that makes sense. </joey>
<joey> But I mean, like my dad, for instance, </joey>
<joey> can't eat red bean paste
just because, it's weird, </joey>
<joey> he likes the flavor, but he
doesn't like the texture. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's super, super thick. </garnt>
<joey> It's just basically </joey>
<joey> - It's like grainy, right? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Almost. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like sludgy. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> - We're throwing a lot
of different adjectives </joey>
<garnt> out and then none of them are matching </garnt>
<joey> - It's because like
there's nothing I can point </joey>
<joey> to in like that people can
just ground that texture with </joey>
<joey> in like the West or something. </joey>
<joey> It's just something, it's
thicker than ice cream </joey>
<joey> but it's a bit like pasty as well. </joey>
<joey> I don't fucking know. </joey>
<joey> I'm just doing it. </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm doing an awful job. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just try it out. </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> - Like, the one dessert
I haven't enjoyed as much </joey>
<joey> as I thought I would have,
like based on the hype </joey>
<joey> that everyone talks about
it, is a shaved ice. </joey>
<joey> Japanese shaved ice. </joey>
<joey> - Is shit. </joey>
<connor> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </connor>
<connor> - It's basically just
like a Japanese version </connor>
<joey> of a snow cone. </joey>
<joey> Essentially. </joey>
<connor> - People fucking love
it here and I'm like, </connor>
<joey> just get an ice cream. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, like. </connor>
<connor> - Sometimes you don't want ice cream, </connor>
<joey> sometimes you want something
a little more refreshing </joey>
<garnt> than an ice cream. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, cause here there
are some shaved ice places </garnt>
<garnt> that people will line up
to for fucking an hour. </garnt>
<joey> - Okay, I don't get that shit. </joey>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I'll just fucking make it at home. </SPEAKER_01>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like I'm not going to
like, cause there are some </garnt>
<garnt> shaved ice places that are like, </garnt>
<SPEAKER_06> there's stores that
specialize in shave ice. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And I'm like, what's the difference </SPEAKER_06>
<garnt> between making it at home? making it here? </garnt>
<garnt> Cause like Meilyne fucking </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Of course. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_06> - Cause she's a food
critic, right? our producer. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> She's like, I found this
like amazing shaved ice place </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> but there's like a two
hour line every day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm like, why are
people lining up for it? </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> And she's like, oh, it's like fluffy. </joey>
<joey> That's not what I look for in a shave </joey>
<connor> - After like two minutes,
after you've been given, </connor>
<garnt> it all just starts melting to the point </garnt>
<garnt> where it just doesn't taste good. </garnt>
<connor> - It's just slush. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - It's having a slush puppie
with extra sugar on it. </garnt>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I don't like it, the
places when they just have </connor>
<connor> like chocolate sauce squirted on shit. </connor>
<garnt> Like how can you sit there
and tell me something is worth </garnt>
<garnt> two hours wait, when
you've just got a bottle </garnt>
<garnt> of like chocolate squeeze shit on it. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like how does squeeze
chocolate take long. </SPEAKER_01>
<connor> - You literally have to put
chocolate sauce on water </connor>
<connor> and people lining up
two hours for this shit. </connor>
<joey> Are you kidding me? </joey>
<joey> Like gelato, that shit is amazing, man. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I love that shit, so fresh. </joey>
<joey> - I like gelato. </joey>
<connor> - Gelato gang rice. </connor>
<connor> - Oh no, I absolutely love, </connor>
<connor> I had like proper authentic gelato. </connor>
<connor> - What do you mean it's all right. </connor>
<connor> What the fuck do you mean it's all right </connor>
<garnt> - I had to stop my thoughts
and I'm like, excuse me. </garnt>
<joey> - It's just thick ice cream. </joey>
<joey> Let's be honest guys. </joey>
<joey> Let's not build this up. </joey>
<joey> - That's the best part. </joey>
<joey> - You have one fucking
bite, you're like, man, </joey>
<garnt> I'll just have three
course meal and I'm good. </garnt>
<joey> - I had legit, like, I don't
wanna say, we'd say home grown. </joey>
<joey> - In Italian? </joey>
<joey> - I had a legit gelato
in Florence in Italy </joey>
<connor> and that shit was the fucking bomb. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, yeah, it's the best. </connor>
<joey> - I thought gelato here and
like in Australia was good. </joey>
<joey> But then I had it in Florence I'm like, </joey>
<joey> damn this hits different. </joey>
<connor> - Italians, man, they know
how to make fucking gelato. </connor>
<connor> - They know how to make good gelato. </connor>
<connor> - I love you, just keep it gelato. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, Florence just keep making gelato. </connor>
<connor> - Never change, never change. </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> - Never change, never change. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, but I dunno like,
are there any other, </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> like Japanese sweets that you guys like. </connor>
<connor> - Melon pan scrape. </connor>
<joey> - Melon pan? </joey>
<garnt> Is that considered a sweet? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, that just goes back
to the bread conversations </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> where like a lot of things
just happen to be sweet sweets. </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> But are they really sweets? </connor>
<connor> - It's more of a sweet
than bread, I'd say. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Well, things like melon pan
and like chocolate coronets </joey>
<connor> are considered like cush
bang which is sweet bread </connor>
<connor> or like a confectionary bread. </connor>
<connor> That's what it's called. </connor>
<joey> Yeah, chocolate coronets. </joey>
<connor> Like the eye corneas? </connor>
<joey> - No, no. </joey>
<joey> - That's what I thought as well. </joey>
<garnt> - No, no, no. </garnt>
<garnt> Chocolate coronets are like
the ones that the fucking </garnt>
<SPEAKER_02> cornets eat in 'lucky star'. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, those ones? </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> - Like the little like
swirly with the chocolate. </joey>
<joey> - The poopy ones? </joey>
<joey> - The poopy ones, yeah. </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey laughing.) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - They look like poop. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's the poopy bread, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<garnt> - You bite it and then
the black shit comes out </garnt>
<garnt> and it's just like, okay. </garnt>
<joey> - I'll show you, but
you've definitely seen it. </joey>
<joey> It's got like the big hole at the bottom </joey>
<joey> where they squeeze the chocolate into </joey>
<joey> and the entire debate, like 'Lucky Star' </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> started this entire
debate of like which side </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> do you eat the chocolate
cornet from, the fat end </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or the thick end. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The entire first episode
of lucky star is that </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> That's how an anime opens. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, but it's great. </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> There's lots of those
kinds of bread in Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then there's like
the savory bread, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But for some reason they
also make the savory bread </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> sweet in a sense. </joey>
<garnt> So, I just don't... </garnt>
<garnt> - There's just nothing
that's savory in Japan. </garnt>
<joey> - There's just nothing savory. </joey>
<joey> And when it comes to bread,
there's nothing savory. </joey>
<joey> It's Weird enough like this kind of shit </joey>
<joey> is more savory sometimes. </joey>
<garnt> - [Connor] Yeah. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_02> - Than the bread that you get. </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> - What'd you want? something savory. </joey>
<joey> Okay, so just a little bit of sugar. </joey>
<joey> It's like, no, no, no, no sugar. </joey>
<joey> So just one teaspoon of sugar. </joey>
<garnt> Is that what you're talking about? </garnt>
<joey> - It goes back to the whole
like Thai dish no spice, right? </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, what do you mean
no spice in a Thai dish? </SPEAKER_02>
<garnt> - That's not an option. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like, one chili, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - But like I noticed with Japan, </garnt>
<garnt> there's so many different types of sweets. </garnt>
<garnt> And I feel like it's because
of the gift giving culture </garnt>
<connor> here, because there
seems to be like a gift </connor>
<connor> for every occasion and every
kind of relationship you have. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - So dumb, so dumb </garnt>
<joey> - There's, my favorite example of just </joey>
<garnt> the gift giving culture
that is just way too intense </garnt>
<garnt> is a Valentine's day in Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, well, I mean there's,
there's the whole concept </garnt>
<garnt> of like Valentine's day,
which is on the usual, </garnt>
<garnt> February 14th and then there's White day, </garnt>
<joey> which is March 14th. </joey>
<joey> - See, the only reason I
know this is because of anime </joey>
<joey> because there's the one
episode in every romance </joey>
<joey> or harem anime where
like the girl or the guy </joey>
<garnt> is just rushing to get
some fucking chocolate </garnt>
<garnt> for the other guy. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_06> - The girl is always like she's
just making the chocolate, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> has to stay up all night
and the chocolate sucks </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> but the main protagonist is
like, no, it's still good. </joey>
<garnt> It doesn't matter because
she poured her heart </garnt>
<connor> and soul into this. </connor>
<connor> - It's one week before, right? </connor>
<connor> - What? </connor>
<joey> - White day? </joey>
<joey> - No white day is March 14th. </joey>
<connor> It's a month after. </connor>
<connor> So what it is is... </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's after? Oh, fuck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, so Valentine's day traditionally, </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> in every other country,
is guys give chocolates </connor>
<connor> to the girls, girls give
chocolates to the guys, right? </connor>
<connor> All that kind of shit. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - That's the traditional way. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think so. </garnt>
<garnt> But in Japan, Valentine's
day is specifically </garnt>
<joey> a day where the girls give
chocolates to the guys. </joey>
<connor> - Now this is right,
because I remember this. </connor>
<joey> I was like six, you get like
a month to analyze that gift. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like all right, how
much am I going to spend? </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> - Yeah, and then white day. </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Connor gets out his spreadsheet
and he's just like, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<garnt> - You have a month to optimize. </garnt>
<connor> - What's the worst thing
about having you're both going </connor>
<connor> to buy a gift for each other
at the exact same time. </connor>
<garnt> - This is why I hate Christmas. </garnt>
<connor> - No, exactly. </connor>
<connor> - This is why I fucking hate Christmas. </connor>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because, right, you have
to like either mind read </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> each other like, how much
is he going to spend? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Or you got to just straight
it, be like max 20 quids. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You're saying max 20 quid? </SPEAKER_01>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So that's great because... </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> - I hate having the
conversation before Christmas. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> She's like, yeah, we're
setting a budget on this. </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> - What budget? </connor>
<garnt> - This is our budget. </garnt>
<garnt> - So that's great, I remember this. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause then I got a gift
and I was like sick. </garnt>
<connor> So I can just either
not give you a gift back </connor>
<connor> if I don't see you again in the moment. </connor>
<connor> Or I can plan it out,
what I'm gonna give you. </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So yeah, usually it's
the whole idea of like, </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> the guy has to give an equal amount </connor>
<connor> or because Japan is always like this... </connor>
<connor> - One up. </connor>
<joey> - The guys have to one up the girls. </joey>
<connor> - Or just say psych and
don't date her anymore. </connor>
<joey> - True, but here's the thing right? </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> In Japanese Valentine's day. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I know it cause I made
a whole video on this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> There's three different types
of chocolates you can give. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Really? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> So there's okay. </joey>
<joey> So there's honmei choco,
which is the chocolate </joey>
<connor> that a girl gives to a guy who
the girl like really likes, </connor>
<connor> it's like the one basically. </connor>
<connor> And then there's giri
choco, which is a chocolate </connor>
<connor> that a girl gives to a guy
that she has had some kind </connor>
<joey> of like, non platonic relationship with. </joey>
<connor> - Someone literally just
saw the Apple pricing </connor>
<connor> for the phone. </connor>
<connor> Let's do that with chocolate. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, pretty much. </joey>
<joey> So basically giri choco is like, say like, </joey>
<joey> if like, Meilyne, for example, right. </joey>
<joey> She's out producer. </joey>
<joey> Like we, aren't together. </joey>
<connor> So, she would give us giri
choco, because we work together. </connor>
<connor> We're involved in her life in some way. </connor>
<connor> - Is there ever a point
where you're like, stop? </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> I can't eat this chocolate,
this is giri choco. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We need to go above this. </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> - Exactly, I can't believe you
thought about me like this. </connor>
<garnt> I thought we were closer than this. </garnt>
<joey> - Like yeah. </joey>
<joey> And then there's that right? </joey>
<joey> And traditionally that's where it ended. </joey>
<joey> But recently, there's a third
type of chocolate called </joey>
<joey> tomo choco, which is where
girls will give chocolates </joey>
<joey> to other girls who they're friends with. </joey>
<connor> - I hate this. </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God. </connor>
<joey> - So Japan is somehow just fucking. </joey>
<joey> - They've spreadsheet chocolate. </joey>
<joey> - They've spreadsheet advances. </joey>
<joey> - It's spread sheeting gifts. </joey>
<joey> Because I had a conversation last week </joey>
<joey> with someone who is like
the manager of Teddy Lloyd, </joey>
<joey> one of Meilyne's friend. </joey>
<joey> And she was telling me about how she, </joey>
<joey> like every time she has a new
clients or someone she has </joey>
<joey> to manage, she, Japanese
culture is that they have to </joey>
<joey> give a gift. </joey>
<joey> So she goes to this
department store to like, </joey>
<joey> get this gift for this
new band or something. </joey>
<joey> And then the department
clerk literally asks them, </joey>
<joey> Okay, how well do you know them? </joey>
<joey> What's your relationship with them? </joey>
<joey> And then she answers that. </joey>
<joey> And then the next question was, </joey>
<joey> so where are you giving it to them? </joey>
<joey> Are you giving it to the
dressing room (Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> or are you giving it in the office? </joey>
<joey> - Who cares. </joey>
<joey> Like she literally had to
had a fucking spreadsheet, </joey>
<joey> apparently, she pulls
out a catalog depending </joey>
<connor> on what answers she was given
to give the perfect gift. </connor>
<connor> - This is extreme floaters, Jesus. </connor>
<connor> - And I mean, it's just like,
dude, it's just some fucking, </connor>
<garnt> at the end of the day, it's
just a bunch of sweets. </garnt>
<joey> You know what I mean? </joey>
<garnt> - You know what this is the equivalent of? </garnt>
<joey> This is equivalent to like doing those </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> personality questionnaires
at the start of RPGs </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> to see like which partner you get. </joey>
<joey> But then after you fill it
out, you have all the options </joey>
<joey> open to you anyway. </joey>
<joey> That's exactly what it is. </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's the fucking Facebook quiz. </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> - [Joey] Exactly. </joey>
<joey> - Which character are you? </joey>
<joey> - Which Valentine's day gift are you? </joey>
<joey> Japan has not only done
this with Valentine's day. </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> They've done it for like Christmas, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> they've done it for like Halloween. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> They've done it for everything. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> They've just completely
somehow made everything </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> like a million times more
complicated than it should be. </joey>
<joey> - It's as if life here
isn't stressful enough. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, right? </joey>
<connor> - With all the paperwork you
gotta fill out for everything. </connor>
<connor> - And then you got shit
like oseibo and ochugen, </connor>
<connor> which is like giving gifts at
like certain times of the year </connor>
<joey> and shit to people. </joey>
<garnt> - This is why I'm glad that we don't work </garnt>
<joey> exactly in an office environment. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, fuck. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, no. </joey>
<joey> - Like we work with people
who understand foreign culture </joey>
<joey> and everything like that. </joey>
<SPEAKER_01> So I don't have to... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because if I'm working
in a Japanese company </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'd be so fucking stressed out. </SPEAKER_01>
<connor> - I'm doing my work, not
fucking up with gifts. </connor>
<joey> - Imagine going to a company party </joey>
<connor> - Oh, fuck. </connor>
<joey> - or going to like a
company drinking session. </joey>
<joey> And you just don't know how to act. </joey>
<joey> Cause that's me, right? </joey>
<garnt> - Jesus. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like only in Japan
will you go to the office </garnt>
<joey> and you're more stressed out
about your like social status </joey>
<joey> than you are the actual work
that you're involved in. </joey>
<garnt> - Like I'm stressed enough
thinking am I giving them </garnt>
<joey> my business card the right way? </joey>
<joey> - Oh, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - You know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> - There's rules to that as well. </joey>
<joey> - There's rules to that. </joey>
<joey> I just want to like swap business
cards, but no, it's like, </joey>
<garnt> is it pointed the right way? </garnt>
<garnt> we have to give it at the same time. </garnt>
<connor> - I had the situation where I had to give </connor>
<garnt> my business cards recently
and I had a mailing mix up. </garnt>
<connor> So I had like a 1,000 IQ move. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, no, no, no,
my manager will do it. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm not. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm like, I'm not giving my business card. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> My manager will give you a business card. </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> - I do that some of the time. </connor>
<connor> Every time we're in the business meeting </connor>
<joey> I'm like Meilyne take it, swap contact. </joey>
<joey> Do the thing manager. </joey>
<joey> - It's the opposite for
me because she knows </joey>
<joey> that I can speak Japanese. </joey>
<connor> So she waits for me to go first. </connor>
<garnt> - But in reality, I've just
forgotten my business cards. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> I don't carry them with me, man. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause I don't want to carry
them with me all the time. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because you have to have a
separate business card holder. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_02> And I've not gotten to the point </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where I have enough business meetings </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> where I could be networking
at any point all the time. </connor>
<joey> And it just looks tacky. </joey>
<joey> If you just put out your business card </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's in your beaten ass wallet </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with 20 other million cards in it, </SPEAKER_02>
<garnt> that just doesn't look cool. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - You know one bullshit rule </garnt>
<connor> I found out the other day in Japan. </connor>
<connor> If I want to leave my apartment building </connor>
<connor> for more than two weeks,
I need to get permission. </connor>
<joey> - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> Is it more than two weeks for you? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - For us it's a month. </joey>
<joey> - More than two weeks. </joey>
<connor> I got to get like permission
to leave my house. </connor>
<joey> - Oh yeah, that is. </joey>
<garnt> - You didn't know why that's
the case though, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Why is that the case? </garnt>
<garnt> - It's because there's
a lot of cases in Japan </garnt>
<connor> of people running away. </connor>
<connor> - Oh. </connor>
<connor> - They leave the house space, </connor>
<connor> they basically escape from their lives. </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> - Supposed to have a
guarantor or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> - Well, no, it's the guarantor
who can't chase you up. </joey>
<connor> - Then the guarantor has to pay, right? </connor>
<connor> Is that the whole point? </connor>
<joey> - No, no, you, you, you send
the money to the guarantor </joey>
<joey> and then the guarantor has to pay. </joey>
<joey> But if you're not sending
any money to the guarantor </joey>
<joey> then the guarantor can't do anything. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, I thought the whole
point was the guarantor pays </connor>
<connor> if you can't pay. </connor>
<joey> - That's if the guarantor is nice enough. </joey>
<connor> - I guess I can understand if
they're worried about that. </connor>
<connor> But then also, I don't know, </connor>
<joey> it's just weird living in the UK. </joey>
<joey> I don't know, It just
seems like I'd never want </joey>
<joey> to have to ask if I can leave. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, sure. </joey>
<garnt> - That's weird. </garnt>
<garnt> - You have to ask
permission to do everything. </garnt>
<connor> - Two weeks? </connor>
<joey> That seems like a little, a
month I can kind of understand. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I mean, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - So yeah, so like every
time Aki and I go to the US, </joey>
<connor> for example, like last year, </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> before the whole pandemic
thing, when we were in America </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> for like three months
at a time or something. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> I have to call them up. </joey>
<joey> I mean, it's super easy. </joey>
<connor> - I can imagine though. </connor>
<connor> They never say no. </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<connor> - But it's just weird though
that they might say like, </connor>
<connor> no, you can't go. </connor>
<joey> - Well, I mean, for us it's
easy, because I just say, </joey>
<connor> oh, it's for work. </connor>
<connor> And they're like, okay. </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They don't question it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But if it's like, I have to
attend an animate convention, </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> then maybe they'll be like, hmm. </joey>
<connor> - If they were like
grilling you I'd be like, </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> mind your own fucking business, I pay you. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, oh my gosh. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember I saw a few
comments that are like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> man kind of hates Japan. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Why is he even there. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> He's so ungrateful man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I was like, nah, I want to... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Privileged. </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> - I guess we do often point out the things </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> that we don't like about Japan a lot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But that's because I think a lot of people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in my mind view Japan as
this like utopian country. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And at the end of the day </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> it's like any other
country that has issues. </connor>
<joey> - And also because, I think
that we've experienced </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> living here as opposed
to just listening here. </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> You can't get a scope of a
country just from visiting it. </joey>
<garnt> - But, I mean, we have
complaints about any country. </garnt>
<connor> - We're British, I mean, </connor>
<garnt> I'm going to complain about anything. </garnt>
<connor> I'll find a complaint
about something I love. </connor>
<joey> - I love it, but fuck, I hate it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah exactly. </joey>
<garnt> When I lived in Thailand
there were like so many things </garnt>
<SPEAKER_02> that I didn't like about living there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But there's things I
fucking loved as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So it's all like a give
and take wherever you live. </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> It's funny, right? </joey>
<joey> Cause when I was a kid, I
was like I want to live in A. </joey>
<joey> I want to live in X. </joey>
<joey> It'd be cool if I lived there. </joey>
<joey> But like the more you move
around and the more I travel, </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> the less I know where
I want to settle down. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Cause like the more I travel,
the more I'm like, man, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I really love this one
thing about that one place. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> But man, I really hate that
one thing about that one place, </joey>
<connor> so really wants me to like,
I dunno, this COVID situation </connor>
<connor> has just made me feel
trapped in this country. </connor>
<connor> - For sure, for sure. </connor>
<joey> - This has probably been
like one of the longest </joey>
<joey> I've gone through in my entire life </joey>
<joey> without flying somewhere. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. I mean, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> I dunno like for me as well,
like this is the longest </garnt>
<SPEAKER_06> I've been in Japan for like
an extended period of time </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> without going anywhere. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I've definitely, I don't know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I haven't noticed anything
new about or new about </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> you know, like any of the
good parts about living here </joey>
<joey> or any of the bad parts. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But, I dunno. </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> It's made me appreciate the
things that I really like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and fucking despise
the things that I hate. </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> - True, true. </connor>
<joey> - It's like to another level. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I wake up every day
and I walk past my router </joey>
<connor> and I just smile, I'm like damn. </connor>
<connor> Damn, I have a gigabyte
download and upload. </connor>
<connor> That's just beautiful,
I love to see it, dude. </connor>
<joey> - I don't know why I heard you say Naruto. </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> - I sit by and I'm like, damn you're good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Damn, damn. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You do your job good. </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<SPEAKER_01> - You can, fucking sucks the internet. </SPEAKER_01>
<garnt> - You're talking to the Australian here. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yeah, sure </garnt>
<SPEAKER_01> - Don't don't talk to me
until you have experienced </SPEAKER_01>
<joey> a point four upload. </joey>
<SPEAKER_01> - No dude, cause in fucking
Wales, man, you would get like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, but you live in the
middle of fucking nowhere. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right, so you would,
they'd be like, oh yeah, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we only have copper wire by the way. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We're not going to put
any other wire down. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> Here's your 0.1 download that
doesn't work half the time. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And it's like, cool. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then they charge you like
fucking $80 a month for it. </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> And it's like, okay, why? </connor>
<joey> It doesn't work. </joey>
<joey> - That's what it was
like for us in Australia. </joey>
<joey> We had copper wires everywhere. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, and then did they say that like, </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> oh, someone will come on this
day and then no one turns up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That happened so many
times, or they turn up, </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> they'd be like yeah, we're
gonna send somebody to fix it. </connor>
<connor> They turn up and they're like, </connor>
<connor> yeah, I have no idea what's wrong with it. </connor>
<joey> - Like especially in Australia, the whole, </joey>
<joey> if I were to sum up the whole
like just service business </joey>
<joey> side of things in one
phrase would just be, </joey>
<joey> that was a fucking lie. </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> Because they never show. </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> Like the service men
never show up on time. </joey>
<joey> Transport never fucking shows up on time. </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, oh my God, the
Australia, the Sydney transport. </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> I don't know about
other parts of Australia </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> but Sydney transport had
to be one of the worst </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've ever experienced. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Okay, so I had to catch
a bus every day to go </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to uni, all right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And this bus turns up every 20 minutes. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> That's what it says on
the timetable at the stop. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I'm like, okay, cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This next one's coming in 10 minutes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 10 minutes passes, no
bus, like not a single bus. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, did I miss it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> while I was looking down at my phone? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Where is it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right.
- Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - All right, whatever. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Another 10 minutes doesn't show up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But then five minutes before
the next bus shows up, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the previous bus shows up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Right, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But, because the bus is full. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It doesn't stop. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So I'm like, not only
are you 15 minutes late </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> but this motherfucker
didn't even stop for me. </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> - Dude, you can have
that in Wales as well. </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> This boy is lucky, he grew up in a city. </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, I did too technically. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, shit. </joey>
<garnt> - He grew up in Sydney. </garnt>
<garnt> - I grew up in Sydney. </garnt>
<joey> - What the fuck? </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> - Which is like the biggest city. </SPEAKER_02>
<garnt> - One of the biggest city of Australia </garnt>
<connor> - So like, my bus, that was
the one that I used to get </connor>
<SPEAKER_01> if I want to go to England, like Chester. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I would have to get this bus. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it was every 30 minutes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Problem was, is that it
was always give or take </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 30 minutes late. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like 30 minutes late or early. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So you basically had like
to go there and wait. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And like, if it said like, half, three, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it would just turn up at four. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<connor> - And then you were like is
this the next bus that's early? </connor>
<connor> Or is it this bus that's late? </connor>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<connor> It's basically fucking madness. </connor>
<joey> Yeah, it was bad as well
because not only was sometimes </joey>
<joey> the bus is late but
sometimes the bus would come </joey>
<garnt> five minutes early because I don't know. </garnt>
<joey> It just happened to run
all the traffic lights. </joey>
<joey> - Like, it wasn't really a schedule. </joey>
<garnt> It was just like a rough estimate of time. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like a recommended route, </garnt>
<SPEAKER_02> like we should probably get here... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, recommended time of arrival. </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> - Yeah, just stick around though. </connor>
<connor> Fuck those kids. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, and it's the same
with like package deliveries </connor>
<SPEAKER_01> in the UK. </SPEAKER_01>
<connor> I hated it, because they would say, </connor>
<connor> between 8:00 AM and 8:00 PM. </connor>
<connor> And it's like, wow. </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> So I just got to be at the
house the whole fucking day? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 12 hours. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because you've just said Tuesday, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like that is eight to eight. </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> And they wouldn't even turn
up on that day sometimes. </connor>
<SPEAKER_01> So it's like what is he, what is... </SPEAKER_01>
<joey> - Meanwhile, here in
Japan we just got a couch </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> for the office just this morning. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And we set it for 12:00 PM to 2:00 PM. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Two hour window, perfect. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<garnt> - The couch arrives at 1201. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - And they phoned you as well. </joey>
<joey> - They phone you to
make sure that you're in </joey>
<garnt> and they can come and
everything and it's beautiful. </garnt>
<connor> - And if you miss it, you
can also just reschedule. </connor>
<connor> Say, if you miss it like 8:00 AM, </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> you can reschedule it the same day </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for it to come at like 4:00 PM. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Which is like insane, because
in the UK, if you miss it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like, right, well, next
month we have a schedule. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We have a slot three, and it's like, what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was horrible pre-ordering games. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And the games turn up like four days late </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then you might miss it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they just wouldn't post
it through the letter box. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So you got to call them up or go online </SPEAKER_01>
<connor> and then they'd be like,
oh we have a free slot </connor>
<connor> in five days. </connor>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, five days, I bought this game, </SPEAKER_01>
<joey> what do you mean five days. </joey>
<joey> - See, because back when
I was living in Australia </joey>
<joey> I know I've got a lot
of comments about this </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> but we have Amazon now in Australia. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But back when I was living in Australia, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Congratulations. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I know, we finally got it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because people are like, Joey,
what are you talking about? </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> we do have Amazon. </joey>
<joey> Back when I was living in
Australia, we didn't have Amazon. </joey>
<garnt> Back in my days, we didn't have Amazon. </garnt>
<joey> - Joey is an Australian boomerang. </joey>
<joey> - I'm an Australian boomerang. </joey>
<joey> - Back in my day. </joey>
<joey> - Back in my day, we
didn't have Amazon yet. </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> Like Amazon's only like a
recent thing that got introduced </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> to Australia, because we only had eBay. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, wow. </joey>
<joey> - Why would you use eBay for anything? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, like I still have
never experienced Amazon now </garnt>
<joey> or the comforts of like
living in a place where </joey>
<joey> you can just get your
package literally hours off. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, it's beautiful. </joey>
<garnt> - Order it. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, especially
coming from me, who'd never </joey>
<joey> experienced Amazon until moving to Japan. </joey>
<joey> The first week of me
experiencing Amazon I was like, </joey>
<joey> I feel like a God. </joey>
<joey> Like I can just get things
delivered now, without having to </joey>
<joey> wait arduous amounts of time. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I don't know
how people move to Japan </garnt>
<joey> before Amazon existed as
like a Gaijin, oh my God. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know. </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't know for like... </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> I guess my house just
wouldn't be furnished </joey>
<SPEAKER_01> for like a month, I guess
or even more and fuck knows </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how I would just get
like normal necessities </SPEAKER_01>
<garnt> that I just can't find in stores. </garnt>
<joey> - Right. It's like, oh, you
know, I need a phone charger. </joey>
<joey> I couldn't just, you know, go
on Amazon, get it delivered, </joey>
<connor> probably the same day. </connor>
<connor> Or I could trek 30 minutes
by train to the closest </connor>
<connor> big camera to buy one measly cable. </connor>
<joey> Why would I do that? </joey>
<joey> - Tokyo doesn't have this, but London did. </joey>
<joey> London had Amazon now </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> and it was basically
like two hour windows. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You could, if you ordered
it, it would come in two hours. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, wow. </SPEAKER_06>
<garnt> - Yeah, it was pretty good. </garnt>
<connor> - I was just saying... </connor>
<connor> - Like expedited shipping? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, like sometimes we
would be at a house party </connor>
<connor> and we'd run out of alcohol
and like instead of going </connor>
<connor> to the Tesco we'd literally
just order our alcohol </connor>
<garnt> off Amazon and it would just
turn up like an hour later </garnt>
<connor> when we were like low on beers. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - This is the future. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, like a whole crate. </garnt>
<garnt> And then also, like I remember
I ordered a crate of beer </garnt>
<connor> and like a Nintendo switch
game and I was like sick. </connor>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I was like... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - They're like who ordered this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, like who ordered a
fucking Mario Party Super? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> So, Super Mario Party
and I'm like, that's me. </SPEAKER_01>
<garnt> - It was at the bottom of the box. </garnt>
<garnt> - Just really wanted to play Mario Party. </garnt>
<joey> - I'm just fucking jealous of the guy </joey>
<SPEAKER_01> in the other room playing Mario. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I really wanted it, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<joey> - That's awesome though. </joey>
<joey> - I think on that incident, </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> it was quicker to get it
delivered on Amazon now, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> than it was to download it. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> - Oh, wow. </joey>
<connor> - Because the download is a piece of shit. </connor>
<joey> - Oh yeah, yeah, true, true. </joey>
<connor> - That's like first world
problems in a nutshell. </connor>
<joey> Download too slow, just
order it off Amazon. </joey>
<connor> It's slightly faster </connor>
<garnt> - Because when I used to make long videos, </garnt>
<SPEAKER_02> I had to leave my PC on all
night and a bit on the next day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I couldn't use it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> I distribute upload
files for Evan to edit, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I would have to leave it on all night. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> Hoping that when I woke
up, they were all uploaded. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Otherwise I probably would
be able to use my PC. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> So, yeah, that was a pain in the ass. </joey>
<joey> Now I just upload it in one hour. </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because that's the one with
the copper wiring, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Is that like when you're
using an upload, for example, </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> like really heavily, the
download has to compensate </connor>
<connor> for the upload. </connor>
<connor> So yeah. </connor>
<connor> So like every time I
would like upload a video </connor>
<connor> at like 1:00 AM, right? </connor>
<joey> I couldn't use the internet
because I had legitimately </joey>
<joey> like fucking dial up speed. </joey>
<garnt> - I was about to say going
back to dial up at this point. </garnt>
<joey> - It was legitimately dial up speed. </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> It took like two minutes
to load up Twitter </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm just like, I
can't, I can't do this. </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> - I can't live like this. </connor>
<connor> - I can't do this man. </connor>
<joey> Why would you do this to me? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it's crazy. </joey>
<joey> And they said like, the
companies used to throttle </joey>
<connor> my internet all the fucking time. </connor>
<garnt> - God, were you a Virgin. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Fucking virgin man </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> - Virgin media fucking sucks. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> - My God, what a version company? </joey>
<SPEAKER_01> - They would really have
closed shop because, on paper </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they give you the best internet speeds. </SPEAKER_01>
<connor> - 100 megabytes download. </connor>
<connor> Never fucking saw it once. </connor>
<connor> - You never see it. </connor>
<garnt> And at peak times, man, you
are not getting anywhere close, </garnt>
<garnt> near to what they advertise to you. </garnt>
<joey> - The moment you upload or
download anything as well </joey>
<joey> they immediately throttle
you and had to call them up </joey>
<joey> so many times like,
hey, turn that shit off. </joey>
<connor> I paid for this. </connor>
<joey> And they charge you so much. </joey>
<joey> - We're going back to the days of dial up </joey>
<connor> where you have to be like,
mom, get off the phone, </connor>
<connor> I'm downloading a game. </connor>
<SPEAKER_01> - I had to that to my little brother </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when I used to play league
at home, I'd be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<connor> and my ping would go
from like maybe 66, 150. </connor>
<garnt> I'm like get off the fucking phone. </garnt>
<garnt> - I remember back in university,
whenever you were living </garnt>
<garnt> in like a shared house, my God, </garnt>
<garnt> trying to game in a shared
house is fucking impossible. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause yeah, your ping
would either be like 10, </garnt>
<joey> when no one's awake or
when it's dinner time, </joey>
<joey> it's like fucking 800. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, who's fucking downloading </joey>
<joey> another episode of 'Game of Thrones'. </joey>
<joey> Everyone's a fucking duck. </joey>
<joey> Everyone's torrenting. </joey>
<garnt> - Everyone puts their hands up. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was fucking worse for me because </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> when I was doing YouTube,
like way back in Australia, </connor>
<connor> all of my YouTuber friends
were in America, right? </connor>
<connor> So every time I'd jumped onto
like G-mode or something, </connor>
<joey> on a good day, my ping would be like 300. </joey>
<connor> I'd be like, guys... </connor>
<connor> - Why even play a 300 pings? </connor>
<joey> - Cause I was desperate for friends. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </joey>
<connor> I didn't have any YouTuber
friends in Australia. </connor>
<connor> - There must be a Formula
for like ping correlation </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> with how desperate you are
to hang out with that person. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Because I play league of legends
a lot with Titus and Emily </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and it's like 200 ping. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I'm like, man, this
sucks, but it's really fun. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh yeah, I mean 300
pings G-mode was still fun. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> But I mean, yeah, no one could kill me </joey>
<joey> because I just keep fucking teleporting. </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> - What is the value of friendship, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Is it 300 pings. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - What is your ping limit for us? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We should break down
the value of friendship </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> by ping number. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, would I pay 160 ping for you? </SPEAKER_01>
<joey> Yeah, I'll pay you for that. </joey>
<joey> - 800 ping, ultimate friend. </joey>
<joey> 100 ping, just an acquaintance. </joey>
<connor> - I just wanna talk to you, man. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, so you used to upload daily </garnt>
<joey> on that garbage internet. </joey>
<joey> - I sure did. </joey>
<joey> - Oh my God. </joey>
<joey> - And that's why my
computer exploded, remember? </joey>
<joey> - How did you not get like
burned out, from that. </joey>
<joey> I think I would like hey,... </joey>
<connor> - I mean, I did get burned out, </connor>
<joey> after like two and a
half years of doing that. </joey>
<joey> Because I quit Let's Plays a
week before I moved to Japan. </joey>
<connor> - I remember when you quit
that and I thought like, good. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, everyone was like, good. </joey>
<joey> You should have done that. </joey>
<joey> And I think I did it at the perfect time </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> because that was just around
the time, like early 2015. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That was around the time when gaming </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> was kind of starting to dip. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like just overall, that's when YouTube </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> kind of shafted all of gaming. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> YouTube was like no
more spotlight for you. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, that's around 2015. </connor>
<garnt> - Which like speaking
about that, have you guys </garnt>
<joey> in your YouTube careers, ever
properly experienced burnout? </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah. </joey>
<joey> - When was the last time you
guys experienced burnout? </joey>
<joey> - Last time I experienced
like proper burnout was maybe, </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> this was back before I
was leaving with Aki. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> - And I was just living on my own. </joey>
<joey> And yeah, I just had like a moment, </joey>
<joey> like maybe for like half a year
where I was just constantly, </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> like all I was thinking
about was like, all right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What's the next video? </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> What's the next one? </connor>
<connor> I just keep one upping myself. </connor>
<connor> And like just coming up with
ideas because even back then, </connor>
<joey> I think it was maybe uploading like once </joey>
<joey> every three days or something. </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> So not as intense as daily
but it's still pretty intense. </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> Especially because now I wasn't
doing Let's Plays anymore. </joey>
<joey> I was doing like straight up like, </joey>
<joey> I was writing a script every fucking day. </joey>
<joey> So that shit burnt me
out like a hell of a lot. </joey>
<joey> And there was like a point
where I was legitimately like, </joey>
<joey> should I just like stop? </joey>
<joey> Like, should I just stop
YouTube for a while? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But then I was like,
nah, ain't worth it. </joey>
<connor> - I think a lot of
people view us here a lot </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> about like, the mystical
YouTube burnout, what it means, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like, can you like try to explain. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - At this point, I'm sure
for a viewer hearing burnout </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> was just like, oh let's just get that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> off the YouTuber checklist. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's kind of just become a cliche now. </SPEAKER_02>
<garnt> It's like, oh, you reached burnout. </garnt>
<garnt> Okay, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - All right, see you in a couple of days, </garnt>
<joey> you'll be over it soon. </joey>
<joey> Like people think that
YouTuber burnout is just like, </joey>
<joey> like I dunno </joey>
<joey> - Woe is me. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, kind of a woe is me, </joey>
<joey> like a very privileged
first-world problem. </joey>
<joey> But I think it's just another
form of like creative burnout. </joey>
<joey> And if you've never experienced
burnout in your life </joey>
<joey> or create a burnout, artists
block is another word for it. </joey>
<joey> It's essentially where
you want to do something </joey>
<joey> and you want to make
something, but you either </joey>
<joey> have no motivation or
no inspiration to do, </joey>
<joey> or both sometimes. </joey>
<connor> You're just like, man, I
really want to get a video out. </connor>
<garnt> I know I need to get a video out. </garnt>
<garnt> I want to be creative. </garnt>
<garnt> I just don't know what to do. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - And I have no motivation for it. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> I think there's one person
who reached burnout recently. </garnt>
<garnt> Then they made a statement about it </garnt>
<garnt> and like hit me hard because... </garnt>
<SPEAKER_06> So the author of "Tower of
God" recently went on hiatus </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> for like an indefinite period of time. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So we don't know, he hasn't said, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm going to be away for this long. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> He actually just wrote like
a really really long post </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just detailing that
he's just had no breaks </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> for this entire like time
during "Tower of gods". </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I remember there was
one line that really hit me </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> which was, I think he said, I didn't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whether I was working to
upload or uploading to work. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I didn't know whether
I was living to upload </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or upload to live. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm just like, dude,
I totally get that, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because there are times during burnout </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> where you're just like, man </joey>
<joey> - What am you doing? </joey>
<connor> - What am I doing? </connor>
<garnt> Am I even enjoying this anymore? </garnt>
<garnt> - So I mean, to explain to the viewers, </garnt>
<joey> how do you like get into burnout? </joey>
<joey> Like, how do you, like,
what does it feel like? </joey>
<connor> Like, like how does it start? </connor>
<joey> - It happens in so many different ways. </joey>
<joey> I feel really depends
on the person, but like, </joey>
<joey> a common thing that would
happen is, for example, </joey>
<joey> like if you uploaded
like four or five videos </joey>
<joey> that are like absolute bangers, right. </joey>
<joey> It's just like, boom, views,
boom views, boom, views. </joey>
<joey> And then after that really good streak </joey>
<joey> you have another streak, but
in the opposite direction </joey>
<joey> of like, oh, that one bombed, oh, </joey>
<joey> that one bombed even harder. </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> Oh, that one bombed even harder. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And you start to lose self
motivation and like you start to, </SPEAKER_06>
<garnt> I dunno, it's really hard
to explain, isn't it? </garnt>
<garnt> You don't realize creative burnout started </garnt>
<joey> until you're deep in creative burnout. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's really hard
to see the early signs </garnt>
<garnt> of creative burnout. </garnt>
<garnt> Sometimes it's just, you just
wake up and you just do a job. </garnt>
<connor> And then eventually like
five months down the line </connor>
<connor> you're like, man, I've
just been feeling the same. </connor>
<connor> Exactly the same this entire five months. </connor>
<connor> And I'm just not getting
anything new out of this. </connor>
<connor> - I'm sure, like most people
who just work normal jobs </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> get it as well with their own job </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where they just kind of feel light, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like, hmm, do I like this or? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like, I know a lot of people
don't like what they do </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and they just do it to survive </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because they don't have a choice. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I mean, we're very lucky
that we do something that is, </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> most people would say
it's pretty fun, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And it's very... </joey>
<joey> - And no doubt it is. </joey>
<joey> - It's definitely like,
it's a very hard job </joey>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm not in like any
manual intensive kind of way, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but like, yeah, we're
working so fucking hard. </SPEAKER_01>
<joey> It's a hard job, like mentally,
but still definitely by far </joey>
<joey> like the best job I've ever had. </joey>
<joey> I couldn't think of a job </joey>
<garnt> that would give me this much freedom. </garnt>
<connor> - No, I wouldn't replace
this for anything. </connor>
<connor> - Which is why we haven't quit. </connor>
<connor> But in terms of pure work hours. </connor>
<joey> I know for a fact, I
put more hours working, </joey>
<joey> like actual working in this
job unlike any previous job. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, easily. </joey>
<joey> - And it's because you
can never switch off. </joey>
<joey> And I think this is the
same war for anyone. </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> Who's like self-employed, where,
especially in our position </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where our jobs stemmed from our hobby. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So do you ever get that point
when you're kind of watching </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> an anime and you can or reading a manga </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and there's just that
little voice in the back </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of your head that says, you
can make a video out of this. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> You can make a video out of this, </joey>
<joey> instead of just like
reading it for platitude. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that's why I've completely, </joey>
<joey> over the last two years or so. </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> I've had a complete anime
burnout, just for that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like, I've stopped. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like I'm sure my viewers
can easily see that, </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> I have not been talking about
recent animate whatsoever. </joey>
<joey> When people ask, hey,
have you watched this? </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> Hey, have you watched this recent stuff? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I always say, nope, nope. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll get to it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> I'll get to it, because I
have that thing of like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I could just watch this
for my own entertainment. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> But at the same time, I feel
like I'm wasting my time </joey>
<garnt> if I don't make a video on it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - I don't know. </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> That's my biggest fear,
is just wasting time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I dunno, like, whenever I
feel like I'm wasting time, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just can't lose myself in
like any show or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> And for anime, that's times
10, because I can never </connor>
<connor> just watch an anime
just for purely watching </connor>
<connor> an anime anymore. </connor>
<connor> That's made watching
anime and reading manga </connor>
<connor> 10 times harder. </connor>
<connor> Cause if I feel like I don't
get anything out of this, </connor>
<connor> either like for entertainment
wise or if I see something </connor>
<connor> I can't talk about or something like that, </connor>
<connor> then I just cant get
myself to focus in there. </connor>
<connor> Like recently I just
watched the good place, </connor>
<joey> which is like a live
action show on Netflix. </joey>
<joey> - You watch live action? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - What? </joey>
<joey> - I did something I hadn't
done in a long time. </joey>
<connor> And I watched all four
seasons, in like a few days. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, wow. </connor>
<connor> - I'm like, what the fuck did I just do? </connor>
<connor> How did I? </connor>
<connor> I didn't know I had this in me. </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> Remember when I watched one
piece in like two weeks. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can watch. </SPEAKER_02>
<garnt> - I can still binge stuff. </garnt>
<connor> My God </connor>
<connor> - It's weird, cause I think
the hardest part is like, </connor>
<joey> when I used to work at
McDonald's and I used to go home </joey>
<joey> and I got to watch anime
or play video games. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It was just like totally different. </joey>
<joey> I didn't have to worry about McDonald's. </joey>
<connor> - You didn't have to second guess, right? </connor>
<connor> Like you could just be
like, immediately like, </connor>
<joey> I'm watching anime. </joey>
<connor> - And I think the hard
part about burnout is that, </connor>
<joey> instead of like the job
being difficult itself </joey>
<joey> is that it creeps into
every aspect of your life. </joey>
<joey> Because YouTube is more often than not </joey>
<joey> themselves is the product. </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> Like, we're like the brand, if you will. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You know, like even just,
if I go out for a meal, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm like, hmm, am I wasting potential </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> by not posting about
this and what I'm doing? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, everything in
your life is like infected </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> with this thought of like,
should I try and monetize this? </connor>
<garnt> - It's the point where
everything in your life </garnt>
<SPEAKER_02> becomes a commodity, even experiences. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like even experiences
can become a commodity </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> or like in our cases it could
become like a nice fun story </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> on Trash Taste and that kind of thing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Where everything, you start
thinking about everything </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in your life in terms of your
job and how it can affect </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> your YouTube, or how you
can use that to benefit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And it gets to a point sometimes </SPEAKER_06>
<garnt> where it just becomes subconscious. </garnt>
<joey> - Which is why I never
understood the mentality </joey>
<garnt> of people who do like
daily vlogs of their lives. </garnt>
<garnt> - My God. </garnt>
<connor> - How do you do that? </connor>
<connor> - I think you have to be a psychopath. </connor>
<connor> - I think you do, you
have to be psychopathic </connor>
<joey> or sociopathic or a combination. </joey>
<garnt> - You definitely lose something. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_06> Like my relationship with anime and manga </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> has forever been changed. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like I still love anime and
manga, but my relationship </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> with it has been forever changed </joey>
<joey> because that to me is
content, that to me is my job. </joey>
<joey> - It's work material. </joey>
<garnt> - Imagine if your entire life was content. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, </garnt>
<garnt> - My God. </garnt>
<connor> - This is why like, all the like, cut, </connor>
<garnt> like vlogging couples always
going to breaking up, right? </garnt>
<SPEAKER_06> Because of course you have to break up </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because your whole relationship
is the YouTube channel. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Your whole relationship is
determined by the algorithm. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, and it's basically,
how long you stay together </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> is how long is the money worth it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> After you get so rich it's like, </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> at what point do you
need this extra money? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Let's be honest. </joey>
<connor> Like if you already have like two houses. </connor>
<joey> - Yes, that's fucking
crazy, like, I've seen, </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> say like there are some
family vloggers, for example, </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> that have been going on
for like, five, 10 years. </joey>
<joey> And I'm just like, how are
you guys like, okay, mentally? </joey>
<joey> Cause that would drive me fucking insane. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Because like, I get insane
just from going to a bookstore </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> and being like, all right,
I've got to find my next video. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> Let alone, you do that
every moment of your life, </joey>
<joey> you'd be like, all right, </joey>
<joey> what's something I can like
pick up and show on camera. </joey>
<joey> To like show them that
we're living a normal life. </joey>
<connor> - Also as well, whenever I've
hung out with like YouTubers </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> it's normally always like the
newer ones or the smaller ones </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> who always want to like take
a picture and post everything. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Because I think that they
haven't like experienced it yet. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> cause if you were hanging
out with big YouTubers </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they're ever like, oh, let's
post this on social media. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Let's take a picture of the post. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's always like, oh,
we're not, I don't know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's just like this kind
of vibe that you get around </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> some people where you're
like, all right, cool. </connor>
<connor> This is just going to be a private thing. </connor>
<joey> Nothing's going to be like,... </joey>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<joey> Weirdly, it's like, you usually have to, </joey>
<joey> if you're interacting
with a bigger YouTuber </joey>
<joey> you usually have to be
the one to be like, hey, </joey>
<connor> is it okay if I upload this? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Exactly. </connor>
<connor> I would ask, I mean, if I'm
within a bigger YouTuber, </connor>
<joey> and for some reason wanted
to post what I was doing </joey>
<joey> at that moment in time, I
would ask them, but I never do. </joey>
<joey> I always like it, like
a side when I'm like </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> someone pulls out a camera
are they're gonna post it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, all right. </SPEAKER_02>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - All right. </garnt>
<garnt> - We're gonna do that thing, here we go. </garnt>
<garnt> - I just wanted to eat dinner, but fine. </garnt>
<garnt> Let's turn them into something. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, cause to me it's like, </garnt>
<SPEAKER_06> the only hundred percent escape I get. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's just like a nice fucking meal. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know why. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> I fucking love food. </joey>
<SPEAKER_01> - You just like food man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I fucking love food. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, who doesn't? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - To me, like food is, talking about, </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> very tasty, very delicious. </joey>
<joey> And I can eat a lot. </joey>
<joey> - I'd like to think so, yes. </joey>
<joey> - Right, but for me, my
favorite part about food </joey>
<joey> is like the social aspect of food </joey>
<joey> and like eating with someone </joey>
<SPEAKER_01> and like having it like be a conversation </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and the food is like a compliment to that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because it's a shared
experience, that you can discuss. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And if you don't know,
someone's like, oh, okay, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> well maybe you can talk about the food </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then it opens you up a little bit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<garnt> I just really like that aspect of it. </garnt>
<garnt> And I don't like that being
like ruined like people </garnt>
<garnt> trying to like monetize it </garnt>
<garnt> - Right in front of your salad. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right, I'm just trying to
enjoy my immaculate meal, </garnt>
<joey> my A5 beef. </joey>
<joey> - My my immaculate salad. </joey>
<joey> - And sometimes I'll post a picture. </joey>
<joey> Oh no, sorry, I'll take a picture. </joey>
<joey> 99% of the time I don't post. </joey>
<joey> It's just for me. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, I want to remember this. </joey>
<joey> - That's something I've noticed recently. </joey>
<joey> I'd say, especially in the
last like two or three years </joey>
<joey> or so, where I've, for some reason </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> the more I do social media
and the more I used to post, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> now I post way less. </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> I experience more, if that makes sense. </joey>
<garnt> - This is like a lot of people ask, </garnt>
<garnt> Garnt, why don't you post on Instagram? </garnt>
<garnt> Garnt, post more on Instagram </garnt>
<connor> - I fucking don't post
anything on Instagram too. </connor>
<garnt> - I remember I've tried so many times </garnt>
<garnt> to get more my Instagram. </garnt>
<connor> And that's just because I fucking
hate having an experience. </connor>
<connor> This is the thing I hate the most </connor>
<connor> having some kind of experience </connor>
<connor> whether it's a nice meal or
you're going somewhere new. </connor>
<joey> I feel pressured to document it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like I got to take a nice
photo of this for Instagram. </joey>
<joey> - Like for one, I fucking
suck at taking photos. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So half the time I'm
like trying to figure out, </joey>
<joey> how do I make what I see look good? </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> Like, how do I do that? </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> This is why I don't work
with like live action stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But I also, I just hate that experience </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of just having to feel like
I need to document this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I need to make sure the
world knows what I'm doing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I feel like ever since
I just completely given up </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> on my Instagram. </joey>
<joey> Yes, I've just given up at this point. </joey>
<joey> - Everybody unfollow now. </joey>
<joey> - You can unfollow me,
I probably won't notice. </joey>
<joey> But like, as soon as I just gave up on it, </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> then it just felt like a
weight was off my shoulder. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And I feel like Twitter for
me is just way more casual. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> - I love Twitter. </joey>
<joey> - I love Twitter, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Twitter, I don't have to try. </joey>
<garnt> It's just, I say any stupid
story that comes to my mind. </garnt>
<garnt> - Dude, I tweeted penis
and it got 25,000 likes. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm like, you guys will
like fucking anything. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> But like with Instagram, yeah. </joey>
<joey> I'm kind of the same. </joey>
<connor> Like, I'm pretty I'm not gonna
say I'm active on Instagram, </connor>
<connor> - You're like the most active of us. </connor>
<connor> - I'm probably the most
active but the thing is, </connor>
<connor> is that like, I'd say
the past 10 to 15 photos </connor>
<connor> I put up on Instagram, I didn't take. </connor>
<connor> It was either Aki took
it, or somebody else, </connor>
<connor> like Luke took a lot of recent ones. </connor>
<joey> Cause he's a camera guy. </joey>
<joey> - I just never think when
I'm at a place I'm like, </joey>
<SPEAKER_01> I should take a picture,
like I do occasionally, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> there's pictures of my
Instagram at places. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But most of the time I never
think I should take a picture. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm like, I'm just gonna enjoy it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like, I don't know. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> Yeah, and that shouldn't
be like a thing of like, </joey>
<connor> wow, look how amazing I am. </connor>
<connor> I just... </connor>
<joey> - You have nothing to prove, right? </joey>
<connor> It's like, I don't have to
take a nice photo of this trip </connor>
<joey> I went to. </joey>
<joey> To prove to you that, oh,
I went on this nice trip. </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> Like that should just be
something that you should cherish, </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> not to say, don't post your
experiences on Instagram. </connor>
<joey> Like if, if you're okay
with that, go for it, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But it's not a necessity, </joey>
<joey> especially if you're a
content creator or YouTuber. </joey>
<garnt> - I think what we're saying, more like, </garnt>
<garnt> Dolby is about other content
creators or other YouTubers. </garnt>
<garnt> Because as a content creator
you do commodify your life </garnt>
<garnt> and you need to find as I
learned that I needed to find </garnt>
<garnt> some parts of my life that just
weren't touched by YouTube. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, really have to
like actively make sure </connor>
<connor> you're thinking about it. </connor>
<connor> - I also think that
when you're starting out </connor>
<joey> it's a lot easier to fall into
the traps of self-employed. </joey>
<joey> Cause a lot of the time
YouTubers are young. </joey>
<joey> And, you know, I started when I was 19. </joey>
<joey> And I have no chill. </joey>
<joey> - You were 19 when you started? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, 19 when I started. </connor>
<joey> - How old were you when you started Garnt? </joey>
<joey> - 17. </joey>
<joey> - 17, I was 18 when I started. </joey>
<connor> - I find when you get
that first initial growth </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> your thought is to pour
everything into it. </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I definitely did do that </joey>
<joey> and I definitely got
burned out very quickly. </joey>
<joey> Cause I was doing university
as well at the time. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, same. </joey>
<joey> - So it was like, I was putting in </joey>
<joey> a full 40 hour work week on my YouTube. </joey>
<SPEAKER_01> And then I was putting probably
not a full 40 hour work week </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> into my university studies. </SPEAKER_01>
<joey> - Oh no, it was definitely
like YouTube, university. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And then my social life was just, </connor>
<joey> - In sham </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> - you know, tumbleweed. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Yeah, and the sad thing is
that for every one of us </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that you hear the success story. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there's a lot of survivor
bias with that kind of stuff. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> Because for every three,
YouTubers like, that did it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> during a job or university,
we made it through, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it was probably like a hundred people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who sweat their ass off
full throughout university </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to get into work and failed miserably, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> didn't have anything to show for it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I took a gamble and it worked off </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> but it was a dumb gamble in reality. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - But I was passionate about it. </joey>
<joey> - But I mean the more dumb
gamble for you would have been </joey>
<joey> if you saw that little bit
of success and you're like, </joey>
<connor> I'm going to quit university. </connor>
<connor> - Which is something
that you should never do. </connor>
<connor> - So yeah, please do that. </connor>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause I was going to do a
master's, but I ended up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> getting a bachelor's because
I just hated engineering </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> by the end of it, I got
a two, one at the end. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I was like, I'll take
it, its good enough. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<joey> - Do you have that in US? </joey>
<joey> - What? </joey>
<joey> - Like the rating system. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, I'm not from the U S. </joey>
<garnt> - Is there like different
levels of degree? </garnt>
<joey> - Like, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Like bachelor's, master's. </garnt>
<connor> - Not the bachelor's like the
pass rate like the floors. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh. </garnt>
<garnt> - First, two, one, two, two. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know, I only.. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like first, second or third degree. </garnt>
<garnt> - I probably got the lowest one. </garnt>
<garnt> I legitimately just slid past. </garnt>
<joey> I was like, give me the
paper, I'm fucking out. </joey>
<garnt> - Gotta go to fucking first baby. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh my God, dude. </connor>
<connor> - You shouldn't, you would, </connor>
<connor> I wish Garnt was in my
dissertation presentation. </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> You wouldn't have
fucking cackled this way. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So I'll go on a tangent real quick. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So my dissertation was fucking awful. </SPEAKER_06>
<garnt> A dissertation, by the
way, is your final paper. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like 30 pages long. </garnt>
<garnt> And in my one in
engineering, we have to like </garnt>
<garnt> actually either prove something
like that's been proved </garnt>
<SPEAKER_02> before or like make a device or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I decided I'm gonna make,
so we were given a topic </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and my topic, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You told me this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - my topic was a wave energy device. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I loved renewable energies
and I loved doing that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> And luckily we had like one
of the best guys in the UK, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> it was the guy who was my tutor. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So I was like, yeah dude, I
can make a wave energy device. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Wave energy devices have never been proven </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to like work very well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> In concept they work but they
don't work in large scales. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Normally it's below the waves. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like the flow of the bumblebees. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I was like, but I can do it. </SPEAKER_01>
<connor> I can make a device that will work. </connor>
<connor> I had like no experience in work-shopping </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> or like making things. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I didn't know why I
thought this would go well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I did this whole paper. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> I wrote this, everything
about it, about this concept </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> then I had to build the concept. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And it was the biggest piece of shit </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I ever built in my life. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> So I dead ass, made this like
pathetic little wooden thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with some copper coils strapped to it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then like a bobbing thing,
I got like a toilet float. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I turned up to this thing, like a kid, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a six year old kid. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - At the science fair, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - At the science fair,
it was literally science </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> fair quality, but even worse than that, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I turn up and I'm like,
so I go through 10 minutes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of all this very detailed,
scientific, like calculations, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the proofing and then I
pull out this piece of shit, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> cardboard thing, like wooden plywood. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I'm like, so you just
pull this up and down </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> with the waves and it'll make electricity. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then I had an LED
attached, one singular LED </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and he's like, that's not powering it. </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> And I'm like, you have to go really fast. </connor>
<SPEAKER_01> So I start doing like
this like fucking this, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like jacking it off basically. </SPEAKER_01>
<connor> And he's like, so do you know
any waves that go that fast? </connor>
<connor> And I was like, no, there are
no waves that go that fast. </connor>
<garnt> - I love that's like the
most university professor </garnt>
<SPEAKER_06> kind of question. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like they will ask you questions </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> where they know the answer. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They just want to see you like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bullshit your way through this. </SPEAKER_01>
<connor> - Yeah, there's two people, my tutor. </connor>
<connor> And he was giggling the whole
time when I pulled it out. </connor>
<connor> And the auditor kind of person
who does the scene before </connor>
<connor> and I had to dead ass and look
her in the eye and be like, </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> this is very scientific, very accurate. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It will work, I promise. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> This is so embarrassing,
and everyone before me </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> was in a full suit and I
just turned up in a T-shirt. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I did know that we had to dress nice. </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> And so it was just fucking painful. </connor>
<connor> And then he kept asking me questions like, </connor>
<connor> can you hook it up to a battery? </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, I don't have
any dry cells lying around. </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> Maybe you do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't really know. </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - You got any lithium material cell? </garnt>
<garnt> - What did you do? you just made a device </garnt>
<connor> to light an LED that didn't even do that. </connor>
<connor> - And so I basically made a very basic </connor>
<garnt> electromagnetic thing. </garnt>
<connor> - That's what it sounded like. </connor>
<garnt> - Just like you put the magnet in a coil </garnt>
<garnt> and then it makes electricity. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, so the idea was that
it bobs up with the wave. </connor>
<garnt> - Flemmings left hand rule. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like some shit people
were doing in like the 1600s </garnt>
<joey> for science experiments. </joey>
<connor> - The problem is is that </connor>
<joey> there's too many variables in waves. </joey>
<joey> Like yeah, you would need like hundreds </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> of the little wave devices. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But how the fuck are
you going to have that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> on top of the waves? </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> The shit's going to break all the time. </joey>
<joey> Basically, it doesn't work. </joey>
<connor> I fucked up and I embarrassed myself. </connor>
<joey> - I just remembered a similar thing for... </joey>
<joey> It wasn't for like, cause
we didn't really have </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> like a dissertation for us. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> We had like three big
projects that we had to do. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then those three
projects would go on display </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> at like the graduation
party for our curriculum. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And one of them for the
course that I was doing was... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I did like a computer robotics course. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And have you ever seen like those robots? </SPEAKER_02>
<garnt> They have them a lot in
America, but they're those </garnt>
<garnt> like robot arms that are
basically like robot bartenders. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think it's an Australian
invention, but basically </garnt>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just this giant white
arm that's programmable </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it pulls drinks basically. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just an automated cartoon robot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So we had one of those
because I think our university </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> was the first to develop it or something </joey>
<joey> and we had one laying around. </joey>
<joey> So we had to make a program
that used the bartender robot </joey>
<joey> and then they would show that
off at the graduation party </joey>
<joey> to actually serve drinks
at the graduation party. </joey>
<joey> So I'm like, okay, that sounds dope. </joey>
<joey> The problem was is that
it was a group project. </joey>
<joey> Never goes well. </joey>
<joey> And second of all, </joey>
<joey> I was the only one who
knew how to program. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> And third of all, I sucked at programming. </joey>
<joey> So we made this like whole thing. </joey>
<joey> We planned out this giant
thing being like, all right, </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> let's do it where when you press
this button, you can choose </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like the amount of shots
that can go into the glass. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You can choose the glass
size, all this shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> And we're like, all right,
who's going to program it. </joey>
<joey> The other two looked
at me and they're like, </joey>
<joey> we don't know how to program. </joey>
<joey> I was like, all right, I
guess I'm programming it. </joey>
<garnt> - It's always that point where you're like </garnt>
<garnt> does anyone not know how to do this? </garnt>
<garnt> Fuck, I'm going to take responsibility. </garnt>
<garnt> - He's like, all right, I guess
I have to learn JavaScript </garnt>
<garnt> from scratch man, sick and C++. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay, yeah, I can do this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is that working? </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> - And so in the end we have to present it. </joey>
<joey> Kind of like at this
stage we have to present </joey>
<joey> in front of the class, but the problem was </joey>
<joey> the only thing that worked. </joey>
<joey> There was one thing that worked. </joey>
<joey> We had like 10 different options
that you could choose from. </joey>
<joey> None of them work, except for one. </joey>
<joey> And that was the one
where you press a button </joey>
<joey> and it'll pour a beer. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<garnt> A single beer. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's the most Australian
thing I've heard all day. </garnt>
<garnt> - Australia has been saved. </garnt>
<garnt> - Not even like, and this is a button </garnt>
<garnt> you could only press once. </garnt>
<garnt> Once the robot poured
one beer, that was it. </garnt>
<joey> The app was dead. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh my God. </garnt>
<joey> - We passed, somehow. </joey>
<joey> I don't fucking know. </joey>
<joey> But then the professor was like,
so do you want to have this </joey>
<joey> on the graduation thing? </joey>
<joey> We're just like, no, no, please. </joey>
<joey> I'm not even going to
show up to the graduation. </joey>
<joey> I'm too embarrassed </joey>
<joey> because I'm going to see all
these other amazing projects </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> and just feel like absolute shit for it. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> But if you want one beer, it's all yours. </joey>
<connor> - It'd better be the
best beer of your life. </connor>
<joey> - It was like some VB shit. </joey>
<joey> - Oh God, fuck. </joey>
<garnt> - You guys have reminded
me of like so many </garnt>
<SPEAKER_02> of my university projects
and dissertations. </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> Like I remember my
dissertation was like a lot. </joey>
<joey> Did your dissertation feel
like a lifetime to complete? </joey>
<joey> Because mine did. </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> And I remember like weather
station, had several stages. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I remember like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Depression, </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> - like one of the first
stages I had to build </joey>
<joey> like a wireless antenna. </joey>
<joey> So we had to like, had to build a system </joey>
<joey> where I could transfer data wirelessly. </joey>
<joey> And my friend actually helped me build it. </joey>
<joey> And I remember we basically just recreated </joey>
<joey> probably the invention of porn. </joey>
<joey> Right? (Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> Okay, because what happens? </joey>
<joey> We were working on this
for like an entire day </joey>
<joey> and we couldn't get it working. </joey>
<joey> We were like, why is
this not transmitting? </joey>
<joey> Is this the receiver, maybe
receiving the signals wrong. </joey>
<joey> We don't know, and then suddenly, </joey>
<joey> after so much work, we'd
like, get it working. </joey>
<joey> We send like this
message like, hello world </joey>
<joey> or some basic ass message. </joey>
<joey> And it was just like the
fucking Eureka moment. </joey>
<joey> It was like such a bro moment. </joey>
<joey> That was like, yes, we
got this message to send. </joey>
<garnt> We got data from one antenna
to another wirelessly. </garnt>
<garnt> And then we just looked at each other. </garnt>
<garnt> We're like, what do we do now? </garnt>
<garnt> And he could just go, let's
try sending ASCII porn. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_06> - So mute on the real
porn, just ASCII porn. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> - No, we couldn't send that
much data at that time. </joey>
<joey> So we were just like, what can we send? </joey>
<joey> Let's send ASCII boobies. </joey>
<joey> So we Googled like a naked girl with like, </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> through an ASCII filter. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then we try sending
that and we're like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah, it fucking works. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And thus porn was invented? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And we're in the room like, wait, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is exactly how porn was started. </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> Just imagine some scientists
having this Eureka moment, </connor>
<garnt> getting like, imagine like
the telegram being invented. </garnt>
<garnt> And then the next thing they want to send </garnt>
<garnt> is fucking ASCII porn
or something like that. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't remember that in history. </connor>
<joey> - I was like, we could go to the store </joey>
<joey> to buy the Playboy magazine </joey>
<joey> or you could just send
it to me while I'm home. </joey>
<joey> - He was like, Ooh. </joey>
<connor> - Jacking off to ASCII boobies, okay. </connor>
<connor> - Exactly, but like I remember, </connor>
<garnt> I remember going all the way forward </garnt>
<garnt> to when I had to present it. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm like, I'm still
fucking pissed to this day. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause I had my project, which
I worked so fucking hard on. </garnt>
<connor> I actually knew, it was actually working. </connor>
<connor> It was like </connor>
<connor> - Why do you gotta do me like that? </connor>
<connor> - Wow, the call out. </connor>
<connor> - Wow. </connor>
<connor> - It was many sleepless
nights, many red bulls </connor>
<connor> to get this fucking
tracking system working </connor>
<connor> that I had been working on all year. </connor>
<connor> And so for some reason, you know, </connor>
<connor> like that dickhead professor
just seems to wake up </connor>
<connor> and he just wants to be an asshole. </connor>
<connor> He just, for some reason
that was the day he woke up </connor>
<connor> and he wants to be an asshole. </connor>
<connor> So he just starts grilling
me on this presentation </connor>
<SPEAKER_01> on my presentation and asking me questions </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you shouldn't expect
from my level basically. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, I was doing a masters </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but he was asking me
like PhD level questions. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know why. </SPEAKER_01>
<connor> And I was there for a
good, like 20 minutes. </connor>
<connor> - Why do you hate me? </connor>
<connor> - Because I swear the questioning </connor>
<connor> was meant to be like 10 minutes, max. </connor>
<joey> He's going to ask you 10
minutes worth of questions. </joey>
<joey> He goes on for 20 minutes. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like sweating. </joey>
<joey> It was like the worst job
interview I've ever been in. </joey>
<joey> Like, you know, when you're
just spitting bullshit </joey>
<garnt> and you don't even know
if it's correct anymore. </garnt>
<garnt> That was like the point I was getting at. </garnt>
<garnt> So, he finishes with me and
I'm just like,(Garnt gasps) </garnt>
<garnt> what the? why did he do that to me? </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like sweating. </garnt>
<connor> I didn't even get a good
mark off my presentation </connor>
<connor> but what really kills me is
that the person next to me </connor>
<connor> was the one girl in my class. </connor>
<connor> The one girl in an engineering class. </connor>
<connor> - He didn't grill her? </connor>
<garnt> - And okay, so I saw his face. </garnt>
<garnt> So like when he was like, grilling me, </garnt>
<garnt> he was like eyebrows frowned,
like, yeah, whatever. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't give a shit about what you said. </garnt>
<garnt> Goes up to the next person. </garnt>
<garnt> Hi, what project do you have here? </garnt>
<joey> - My boy's horny on me. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> - And I know, I know for a
fact that she didn't know </joey>
<joey> that that thing didn't fucking work. </joey>
<garnt> She didn't put any fucking work into it. </garnt>
<garnt> But she got a higher mark
on the presentation than me </garnt>
<garnt> and my thing actually worked. </garnt>
<garnt> Fuck you. </garnt>
<garnt> - And it's like, well, now we know </garnt>
<joey> who is sucking the
professor off after class. </joey>
<garnt> - I don't know how we got this present. </garnt>
<connor> I don't know how we got this fucking time. </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, back to the YouTube burnout. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was telling the story and like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I think the most burnout
I ever got on YouTube, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like cause we can get
into like now later on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> But I remember, when I
first moved to London </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> for some reason, cause
I was going to London </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> quite a lot to do voice work. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I was like, fuck it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll just move there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> because why not? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There's nothing better to do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I moved there and I was
making about 1200 a month total </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> before tax, which, not great. </SPEAKER_01>
<joey> - So you're making about $500. </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, yeah, and my rent
was like 600 pounds a month. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Council tax was like a
hundred pounds a month. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then there was bills included. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So well, after all bills and tax was gone, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was left with like
a hundred to 200 bucks </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> for like food and stuff. </joey>
<joey> And I was like, oh, oh, that's not good. </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> That's not good, and then... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Do the math. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I was doing the
math on my spreadsheet </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it was like, you're fucked,
you're absolutely fucked. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And so... </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> - That's put in a spreadsheet formula, </joey>
<joey> it comes out, you're fucked. </joey>
<garnt> - Conclusion, you're fucked. </garnt>
<garnt> - So that first month I
moved there, I was like, </garnt>
<joey> I really wanted to change
my content up as well </joey>
<joey> because I was doing strictly
like Black Butler based stuff </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> at the time. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I was desperate to get out of that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because I really didn't want
to keep doing that because I.. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> - You were burned out at Black Butler. </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'd fucking started hating it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And the viewers were really
obnoxious at times as well. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And so I really wanted to
make this content work. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And as you guys know, when you... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Normally when you try
new stuff on YouTube, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the first few times you do
it, it isn't perceived well. </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> Normally people are a
bit hesitant about it. </connor>
<connor> At least, it was quite drastic
at the time, for me at least. </connor>
<connor> So I started doing new content
and I was working my ass off </connor>
<connor> and none of it was getting views. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, oh, I'm gonna go broke. </connor>
<connor> I'm not going to be able to... </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm in danger. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm like Chuckles, </SPEAKER_01>
<connor> I'm like, yo, these next
four videos, bangers, </connor>
<joey> hundred percent bangers. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - This is my new content, new me. </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> This is where I'm going
to turn it all around. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> Then they all bombed so hard. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like how hard are we talking? </SPEAKER_01>
<joey> - I was averaging about,
in 24 hours I was averaging </joey>
<joey> about 25 K views at that time up to 30 </joey>
<joey> which is not... </joey>
<joey> - How many subs did you have at the time? </joey>
<garnt> When I moved to London, it
must've been about 200 K. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think I was averaging
anywhere between 25 K </garnt>
<SPEAKER_06> to 50 K views, a video
a week, which is fine. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And I remember these videos all came out </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and they got like eight K. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I checked the address
and it was like $15. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like, I'm getting $15 a month </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> from these videos, I'm going
to go fucking broke man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then fucking Amino
come down and being like, </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> hey, you want $200 for a sponsored video. </connor>
<SPEAKER_01> I have like, no fucking
choice, but to take it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause I'm actually gonna like be homeless </SPEAKER_01>
<connor> If I don't take it or I'm
gonna have to ask my mom </connor>
<connor> for like, hey mom, can you spot me? </connor>
<connor> I don't want to do that. </connor>
<garnt> I don't ask my parents for money. </garnt>
<garnt> - I love how Amino's
every man's first sponsor. </garnt>
<connor> - Because they fucking rip you off. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I remember they
were my first sponsor. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_02> - They know how to slide in well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Cause their whole tactic
is going after channels </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that have like, are up and coming, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that don't know any better. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Because I know they gave people </SPEAKER_01>
<garnt> who gave them a million
view videos 15 bucks. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yep. </garnt>
<garnt> - What? </garnt>
<garnt> - 15 bucks, because they
don't know any better. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_02> It's crazy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And genius. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's just genius but slimy as fuck. </SPEAKER_02>
<garnt> - Completely slimy, 100 genius. </garnt>
<garnt> - And yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> And then luckily, you
know, those videos later on </garnt>
<SPEAKER_06> started turning over
all around maybe three </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or four months later and it started </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to really pick up the new stuff. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I started getting an audience, but man, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> those three months where
it wasn't picking up </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> were the scariest for
three months of my life. </joey>
<joey> Cause I thought I was going
to like, I mean, okay, </joey>
<joey> I've never tried super
fucking hard at something </joey>
<garnt> in my life and failed. </garnt>
<garnt> I thought like, fuck. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm a winner. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_01> - Cause I'm, I'm psychotic </SPEAKER_01>
<joey> when I want to get something done. </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> Like I was working like,... </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> - I think stoic is the
word you're looking for. </joey>
<joey> - Psychotic. </joey>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You are past stoic </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was like a relationship vlogger bro. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was on full psychopath mode bro. </SPEAKER_01>
<joey> I was working easily,
like 12, 14 hours a day. </joey>
<joey> To get this shit working. </joey>
<joey> I didn't have any time for video games. </joey>
<joey> Cause I was like, I
need to make this work. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And it wasn't working. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, what am I doing wrong? </joey>
<joey> And then it was probably cause
I was probably too invested </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> in it probably didn't help. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because I felt that every
single video I was going </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to make could make me
homeless if I fucked it up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> So it was like, fuck, not
am I overly invested in this </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> because I really want it to succeed. </joey>
<joey> I'm also going to go fucking homeless. </joey>
<SPEAKER_01> If I don't get this fucking working. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> And it's like, you see it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I see it with streamers as well. </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> When they're like, I'm
gonna stream 12 hours a day. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, that is... </connor>
<garnt> - Bro, I don't know how
streamers do it man. </garnt>
<garnt> Streamers is a skillset that
I could never understand </garnt>
<garnt> that I could never do no
matter how much I try. </garnt>
<connor> - I think it's your personality though, </connor>
<garnt> because I think if it was my job, </garnt>
<garnt> I think I'd have no problem
streaming it eight hours a day. </garnt>
<garnt> - I would have massive problems. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't think I'd have, I
just want to do other shit. </garnt>
<connor> Like I could do it, but I'd
prefer to do other shit. </connor>
<joey> - I very quickly noticed like,
we talked about last week </joey>
<joey> about how I've been getting
into VTuber streams and whatnot. </joey>
<joey> And I have a lot of like IRL
stream of friends as well. </joey>
<joey> Like, some of them can go
like eight to 12 hours a day. </joey>
<garnt> No problems at all. </garnt>
<garnt> I've noticed that like,
with streaming, it really is </garnt>
<connor> like YouTube, where anybody can start it </connor>
<connor> but not anybody can do it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - You really have to be built. </joey>
<connor> - It takes years of fucking up. </connor>
<garnt> - It does. </garnt>
<connor> - And also the right personality. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, because people come into YouTube </connor>
<connor> thinking they can succeed right away. </connor>
<garnt> And what they don't, like
YouTube is not about making </garnt>
<connor> one bang of videos. </connor>
<garnt> The way I see YouTube is that
if you make enough videos, </garnt>
<SPEAKER_06> eventually, eventually,
you're going to get one </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that's on the algorithm. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I've seen so many channels
that are just have like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> have like a thousand views on every video. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then one view, one
video gets like 200, 300 </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> sometimes a million views. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And you just can't recreate that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And it's about being able to
consistently grow your views. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's not about getting
that one bang of video. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's about slowly, like some
people rise up very quickly, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but you shouldn't ever think
that you're gonna be one </SPEAKER_06>
<garnt> of those people, those
are like the lucky ones. </garnt>
<garnt> But I believe that if
you play your cards right </garnt>
<garnt> and if you know what you're
doing in terms of marketing </garnt>
<garnt> on YouTube, there is a
path that you can take </garnt>
<garnt> that is sustainable growth. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, YouTube to me, isn't
about getting 15 minutes </joey>
<joey> of fame and then you've made it. </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> It's about getting 15 minutes of fame </SPEAKER_06>
<garnt> every day, consistently. </garnt>
<joey> - It's about making 10
videos that are good </joey>
<joey> and are growing consistently,
and never stopping. </joey>
<joey> And that's why burnout exists, </joey>
<joey> it's because once you've
finished one video </joey>
<garnt> you have like a day of
rest and you realize </garnt>
<garnt> you got to do it all over again. </garnt>
<connor> - No matter how good the last
one was, it doesn't matter </connor>
<joey> because that's not going to be like, </joey>
<connor> you're not a movie actor. </connor>
<joey> - That's not going to pay your
bills for the next ten years. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, unfortunately. </joey>
<garnt> - Okay, do you guys
remember an exact point </garnt>
<joey> when you just kind of
realized, like, you know </joey>
<joey> when you started YouTube, you're like, </joey>
<joey> I can do this forever. </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> Making videos, talking
about anime, fucking easy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> This is like the dream
job, I can do this forever. </SPEAKER_06>
<garnt> Do you ever have a point
when you're just like, man, </garnt>
<garnt> what's the end game of this? </garnt>
<garnt> Like, what am I doing? </garnt>
<SPEAKER_01> - You know, when I worked at McDonald's, </SPEAKER_01>
<garnt> I didn't think like, what's
the end game to this. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, how many McFlurries
do I got to make? </garnt>
<garnt> - But like, did you ever
think, man, how much longer </garnt>
<garnt> can I keep just making McFlurries? </garnt>
<joey> (Connor laughs) </joey>
<garnt> - What is there off the shop manager? </garnt>
<joey> What's above that? </joey>
<connor> - Dude, the moment I started
working at McDonald's. </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> I was like, I want to
leave here so fucking bad </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but I really want that new X-Box </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> but I really wanna fucking leave. </connor>
<connor> - Well, that's the end game, right? </connor>
<connor> That's the goal that is an end game </connor>
<SPEAKER_01> - X-Box is the end game. </SPEAKER_01>
<connor> - I guess. </connor>
<connor> It's hard because I think what I want </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> out of YouTube changes constantly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think right now I'm
in a place where I think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm the best way I've
ever been on YouTube. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I think I've got my mental
health at the best place </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where it's ever been on YouTube. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I really do separate. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I really do take care
of myself, which is weird. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> Cause I got a comment on a
few recent videos that like, </joey>
<joey> is Connor doing okay? </joey>
<joey> - There's always those comments. </joey>
<joey> - Is Connor depressed? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, and it's weird. </joey>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause like if I am more real
in the videos, if anything, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've stopped caring about
if I look kind of annoyed </SPEAKER_01>
<joey> or depressed at any points. </joey>
<joey> Like maybe when I'm directing someone </joey>
<connor> or doing something like that. </connor>
<joey> - You don't have to bother
with like the business smile. </joey>
<connor> - No, I just turn on the camera </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> and just literally just do me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I feel like it's being
received better than ever. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's hard to do that, but also I think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I've gotten such a good
control over the separation </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> of job and like, what I'm doing? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, when I went away
this weekend, Niigata, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I didn't think about
YouTube for one moment </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for like four days. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I upload a video at one point,
but that's just one point </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> in the evening where I
schedule it, and that's it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, I just don't think about YouTube </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when I'm not working now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And how I managed to do
that, because I remember </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there was a time when,
like I said in London, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I could not turn it off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I could not stop
thinking about YouTube. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Everything was YouTube. </SPEAKER_01>
<connor> Like, what am I gonna do next? </connor>
<joey> What's the new idea? </joey>
<joey> What's this new deal? </joey>
<joey> - Cause I remember you messaged
me a couple of days ago </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> when you were still up in Niigata. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And we had like a really
brief discussion about it </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> about how Connor was like, </connor>
<garnt> is it bad that I'm starting
to care less about YouTube? </garnt>
<garnt> Not in the sense of like,
I don't care about videos </garnt>
<joey> but it doesn't take over my life as much. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I will get back
to your question later, </connor>
<connor> but I guess, cause it's weird. </connor>
<connor> Because my whole YouTube
career, if you will, </connor>
<connor> I've always thought about it. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Always like I don't
stop thinking about it. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm like, is it bad
that I have large periods </garnt>
<garnt> of time like, two, three days </garnt>
<garnt> where I can just not think about it? </garnt>
<garnt> Is that bad? </garnt>
<connor> Like, I don't know. </connor>
<garnt> Am I bad? </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no. </garnt>
<connor> That's like yours, that's healthy. </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> That's what I'm trying to do. </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> I haven't been able to achieve that. </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> - I think throughout my YouTube career. </joey>
<SPEAKER_01> - Really? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think that's my problem. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think like... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I wish I could tell you how I did it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Connor laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - This year, especially, I
think I've been like close </SPEAKER_01>
<joey> to burnout around like fucking 10 times. </joey>
<joey> - You've been really bad this year. </joey>
<joey> - And I think it's just because this year. </joey>
<SPEAKER_01> - Fuck you Connor. </SPEAKER_01>
<connor> - You suck this year. </connor>
<SPEAKER_01> - Fuck you guys. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think I can definitely
tell when around you </SPEAKER_01>
<connor> that you're like... </connor>
<connor> I can feel that you're stressed about it. </connor>
<garnt> - And I think just because normally </garnt>
<joey> I'm used to a change of environment
or change of breath room </joey>
<joey> just because of like the global situation. </joey>
<connor> We've not been able to travel. </connor>
<connor> - Lockdown has definitely made it worse. </connor>
<connor> - Lockdown has just made
it like 10 times worse. </connor>
<connor> And I know, like I've gotten
a few comments recently, like, </connor>
<connor> Oh, Garnt's uploading videos
less, what's going on there? </connor>
<connor> And I was like, there's nothing going on. </connor>
<connor> I'm just staring at a blank. </connor>
<joey> That's the problem. </joey>
<joey> The thing that really
stresses me out is this notion </joey>
<joey> that if you don't upload
like in the viewers mind, </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> if you don't upload </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> - You're dead. </joey>
<joey> - Everyone's thinking
either he's dead or man, </joey>
<joey> he must be working on a banger video. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughing) </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> He must be pooling all his time </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> to this fucking banger video. </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> And it's just, sometimes that
just makes it more pressure. </connor>
<joey> Like, especially if there's
a long break that, man, </joey>
<garnt> coming back with just
another of the same upload </garnt>
<garnt> I've been doing before just
makes it really difficult. </garnt>
<joey> - That's one thing that I
guess is like the good thing </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> about having a schedule or like good thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about having a timeframe of like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay, it's been however many
days, I have to upload a video. </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> Because that expectation </joey>
<joey> gets completely thrown out the window. </joey>
<joey> And then when you do release
that banger of a video, </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> it's a pleasant surprise, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> You're like, oh, shit, my
man was able to do this </SPEAKER_06>
<garnt> in the same timeframe as a regular video. </garnt>
<joey> All right, I see you. </joey>
<garnt> - I know it's an unhealthy mindset </garnt>
<joey> but sometimes even when I'm on holiday </joey>
<connor> or even when I'm like away, </connor>
<connor> I'm secretly thinking to myself like, </connor>
<connor> hmm, this could have
been time that I've used, </connor>
<connor> was doing something on my channel. </connor>
<garnt> - That's like a big no in my mind. </garnt>
<garnt> - When I go on vacation. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know how to switch
off though, I really don't. </garnt>
<garnt> - I guess. </garnt>
<connor> Having like a little bit of
backlog of videos is like, </connor>
<garnt> you see what you don't have. </garnt>
<connor> - That's it, that's it. </connor>
<garnt> Because I have never in
my YouTube career felt </garnt>
<garnt> like I've been on top of my
work, because unlike you guys, </garnt>
<joey> I finish a video, I upload it. </joey>
<joey> And that grace period, that
20 to 48 hour grace period </joey>
<joey> after I upload a video, that's my holiday. </joey>
<joey> Because that's the only
time I can mentally be like, </joey>
<garnt> okay, I deserve this break. </garnt>
<connor> - I feel uncomfortable
if I'm not at least four </connor>
<connor> or five videos recorded ahead. </connor>
<connor> Like, they may not be edited and done. </connor>
<connor> But like, I don't feel comfortable </connor>
<connor> unless I have that buffer. </connor>
<joey> Because like, for example, when
I moved back to my parents, </joey>
<joey> before moving to Japan, I
just wasn't in the mood. </joey>
<joey> Because I hated the environment. </joey>
<joey> I love my parents, but I
just didn't like being home. </joey>
<SPEAKER_01> And I just didn't want to make videos. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I just didn't. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And then also when I moved to Japan, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I wanted to enjoy Japan
for the first month. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I didn't do videos for a month. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I didn't feel bad about that,
because I had the backlog </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and I completely used all of
my backlog for that month. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And also I just don't have to worry </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> about taking a weekend off or taking off. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I haven't made a video
or done any video stuff </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in about a week and a half now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know why, I just can't
think of ideas right now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I've also been really fucking busy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I mean, we did the, oh, the video </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that we can't talk about yet. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That's coming out soon. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> - We did a special thing. </joey>
<joey> - We did a special video. </joey>
<joey> And then also we have the
podcast in between there </joey>
<joey> and then I've been really
busy and I was way behind </joey>
<joey> on a bunch of other stuff. </joey>
<joey> So it's just like having
that backlog, even if, </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> okay, this is my advice to your Garnt. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Even if you have to do a
month between each upload, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> try and get like one or two videos backlog </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that you can like drip out
so that you can at least </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> then take those one or
two days off and be like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm not going to think about
it, because I don't need to. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm going to take these days off. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I know I'm taking these days off. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So why would I ruin them
by thinking about like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Oh, shit, what are the
Fiverr sellers up to? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> What are they doing? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> What pawn are they drawing? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I dunno. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I really, it's difficult. </SPEAKER_01>
<connor> I guess I fucked it up so many
times that I've learned now. </connor>
<joey> - I feel like I'm on
like the extreme of that </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> because, say for example, like, you know, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> every AX which is in July, </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> - Fuck. </connor>
<connor> I usually go to America for like. </connor>
<connor> - Makes me sad remembering that. </connor>
<connor> I usually go to America
from anywhere between one </connor>
<connor> to three months because I'm going around, </connor>
<connor> I'm visiting places, whatnot. </connor>
<connor> And so I have to make a backlog. </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> I mean, I could technically
just make videos </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> while I'm at Aki's parents' place, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but that would be fucking weird. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I don't want to use my time on holiday </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> because it takes
technically the whole night </connor>
<connor> to fucking worry about work. </connor>
<connor> So, two months before that I just grind. </connor>
<joey> I grind like fucking crazy. </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> And I make like legit two to three months </SPEAKER_02>
<garnt> worth of videos ahead. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know how I do it. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's like something
I have never heard of. </garnt>
<joey> - Dude, last year I made 12 videos ahead. </joey>
<garnt> - I wish, I wish I could
be that ahead, man. </garnt>
<garnt> I wish, I like wake up and
I dream of that moment. </garnt>
<joey> - And it was great because
for those one to three months </joey>
<joey> that I was away, because
we also went to like Europe </joey>
<joey> and stuff and like, I went to go see you. </joey>
<joey> And I went to go see everyone,
all my friends in Europe </joey>
<joey> and all my friends in America. </joey>
<connor> The thought of YouTube
was just completely gone. </connor>
<connor> I turned back into just
regular Joey for two months. </connor>
<connor> And it was so liberating, but
it's a double-edged sword. </connor>
<connor> Because when you're not
thinking about your job </connor>
<joey> or doing YouTube for that
long, and you come back to it, </joey>
<connor> it's like taking a gap year at uni. </connor>
<connor> - It is a little difficult
to get back into it. </connor>
<connor> But you also might come into
it more refreshed than ever. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, no, yeah. that's what I mean. </joey>
<joey> That's why it's a double-edged sword </joey>
<joey> because it can easily be
either one of the two. </joey>
<joey> You can either come back and be like, </joey>
<joey> I have like 20 new ideas. </joey>
<joey> Or you can come back and be
like fuck I don't wanna do this. </joey>
<connor> - I think the point that was
the biggest turning point </connor>
<joey> for me was getting an editor. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yes. </joey>
<joey> - And I know that you always think that </joey>
<joey> like YouTube was always like, man </joey>
<joey> but I've just got this touch to it. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, no, you're fucking wrong. </joey>
<joey> You are actually just wrong. </joey>
<joey> There was someone who could do it better </joey>
<connor> than you because that's
their job, to just do that. </connor>
<joey> - They can do it better and faster </joey>
<connor> - Better, faster and guess what? </connor>
<joey> - You've free time now,
you know what that's like, </joey>
<connor> you never had that before. </connor>
<SPEAKER_01> And I sucked at editing. </SPEAKER_01>
<joey> I fucking sucked, Garnt edits. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean Garnt told me to... </garnt>
<garnt> - I convinced Joey to get an editor. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, because up until
less than two years ago, </joey>
<joey> I was editing all my videos. </joey>
<connor> - I remember back in the
early days of YouTube </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> people used to be iffy
about, like viewers used </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to get like pissed if you had an editor. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> - But not anymore, I'm
glad that it's changed. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that's like sponsorships, right? </joey>
<joey> It's just grown to be like accepting. </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> - The way I see it is that
I've gotten better editing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And now I have more time
to make better videos </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I can make more ambitious videos </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I'm not the one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause the worst thing was, is that like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I want to make this video ambitious </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but don't add more work
in post for myself. </SPEAKER_01>
<garnt> So it was always like, you
would always limit yourself </garnt>
<connor> because you're like, I don't
want to have to add work. </connor>
<connor> - This is my problem. </connor>
<connor> Because apparently I'm
a fucking workaholic. </connor>
<joey> - You are a workaholic. </joey>
<joey> - It's just, I dunno, like
I just want to feel ahead </joey>
<SPEAKER_01> of my work for once in my life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's really hard because I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You're too hands-on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I am too hands-on but even like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> even if I have an editor. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I need to learn how to just
see what the viewer sees. </SPEAKER_01>
<joey> Because every time I get an edit, </joey>
<joey> so every time I come up
with a finished video </joey>
<joey> I can always be like,
I can make this better. </joey>
<joey> I can improve this by an extra little bit. </joey>
<garnt> And I always end up doing it. </garnt>
<joey> - Guess that's the bad thing
about being a perfectionist. </joey>
<joey> It's that like, you'll never satisfied. </joey>
<connor> - I mean, you could argue that. </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> Yeah, Maybe that extra touch
you do put in is the reason </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> why you've done so well. </SPEAKER_06>
<garnt> You know, why everyone comes
to watch your videos on anime </garnt>
<SPEAKER_06> Maybe it is, maybe it
wouldn't matter at all. </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> - Yeah, I dunno. </connor>
<connor> This is just like my... </connor>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why don't you test though? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Why don't you do a test? </SPEAKER_01>
<joey> - Test it out, just let Allan
just take all of the editing. </joey>
<SPEAKER_01> - Cause they will fucking kill me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But this is the thing,
you've got to let go, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you've got to let go. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Here is the thing bro, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> because it's not just about one video. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> As we know, you can't get enough metrics </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or enough analytics of one video. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's true. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like you can make what
you feel is like the worst </SPEAKER_06>
<garnt> fucking video of your channel </garnt>
<garnt> and for some reason it does well. </garnt>
<connor> - What if you put it out there
and it's, nothing happened. </connor>
<connor> Oh, shit, I can just let him do it. </connor>
<joey> - Because the exact
opposite happened with me. </joey>
<joey> When you talked me into
hiring Mudan to be my editor, </joey>
<joey> I was like, okay. </joey>
<joey> Mudan watches my videos, </joey>
<connor> so he should have a good grasp of it. </connor>
<connor> All right, I'll let him edit </connor>
<connor> like the first couple of videos. </connor>
<connor> Dude, the first couple of videos, </connor>
<connor> I feel so bad towards Mudan, </connor>
<joey> cause I made him redo that
first video like five times. </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause I was like, all right,
add this little zoom in here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No, I would have added this here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I would have added this here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I feel so bad now Mudan. </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> But nowadays I can just
be like, all right, Mudan. </connor>
<connor> Here's the script, here's
the raw files, go ham fam. </connor>
<joey> And he always just nails it. </joey>
<connor> - I think one of the biggest things </connor>
<connor> that an editor does as well. </connor>
<connor> At least for our kind of
content is that, dude, </connor>
<joey> I do so much embarrassing shit, </joey>
<joey> that I would delete for sure. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah. </joey>
<joey> - That would never make it into the cut, </joey>
<joey> that they would put in. </joey>
<joey> And the first time I saw it, I'm like, </joey>
<joey> I don't really like that. </joey>
<joey> I look kind of fucking stupid there. </joey>
<joey> And then after a while I'm like, </joey>
<joey> I guess that's kind of funny
and adds a bit of charms. </joey>
<joey> So now if I ever work with
anyone who edits my videos, </joey>
<joey> I'm like, please make me
look as stupid as fuck. </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> Make me look so fucking dumb. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Please poke fun at me the whole time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The whole monkey brain. </SPEAKER_02>
<garnt> - Yeah, poke fun of me. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause like, I mean that's, what's funny. </garnt>
<garnt> And now I find that funny. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's very British self-doubt. </garnt>
<joey> - Very much, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But I also like now, </joey>
<joey> cause I work with multiple editors now. </joey>
<joey> So like I always just tell them
now to just throw in as much </joey>
<joey> of your personality into your
editing, as best as possible. </joey>
<joey> Because I feel that like the
landscape of YouTube editors </joey>
<joey> has kind of changed in the
sense that now YouTube editors </joey>
<joey> have almost become their
own identity in the video </joey>
<joey> where like, perfect example
is Game Grumps, for example. </joey>
<joey> Like Barry, the first
editor was just as much </joey>
<joey> of an important aspect of
Game Grumps as the hosts were. </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> And I feel that like with a
lot of YouTubers the editor </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> is kind of just become another part </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of that person's like personality. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I feel it just clearly makes
for a different type of video </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> but also it makes it really
unique at the same time. </joey>
<garnt> - I guess that's why I'm having
such a hard time letting go </garnt>
<garnt> because I feel like what I
do is I put my personality </garnt>
<connor> into like I let Allen do the
hard, like most of the work </connor>
<connor> and like the other 5% is just me. </connor>
<connor> Like, I'm self inserting
myself into my videos, </connor>
<connor> but I feel like it's because of that </connor>
<connor> that people would know me </connor>
<connor> or like why sit down in the first place? </connor>
<connor> It's because my videos are very personal </connor>
<garnt> and it's like my personality reflected. </garnt>
<garnt> Not only in like my script,
but my editing as well. </garnt>
<garnt> And the way, like I edit jokes. </garnt>
<garnt> - You and Alan have known
each other for so long. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I feel like Alan would have a good grasp </garnt>
<garnt> of your type of personality. </garnt>
<joey> - He definitely does. </joey>
<garnt> There are some videos that take </garnt>
<joey> no effort at all for him to edit. </joey>
<joey> And there's some videos
where he's just like </joey>
<joey> I don't know what the fuck. </joey>
<connor> I dunno, it's a difficult balance. </connor>
<connor> I'm still working on it. </connor>
<connor> It's funny that I'm like 13 years </connor>
<connor> into my YouTube career or whatever. </connor>
<connor> - Still haven't figured this shit out. </connor>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I still haven't
figured this shit out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's only because me and Connor </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> were talking about like
our perfect vacation. </SPEAKER_01>
<joey> And like our perfect
vacation, which we were like, </joey>
<joey> we were hoping to do sometime
after COVID allowed us. </joey>
<joey> Was just like fly to
Korea, spend an entire day </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> in like a gaming cafe. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Multiple days. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Or multiple days and just
playing league of legends. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> And if you would play league
of legends, Joey, we'd be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<garnt> let's get Joey on board. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh my God, but the only
problem with that is I have </joey>
<joey> to play league of legends. </joey>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<connor> - It's good fun, it's good fun. </connor>
<SPEAKER_01> It's to me, like the perfect
vacation is just shutting off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And like I miss being able to
waste all day playing games </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and what better way to do it
than in Korea in a gaming cafe </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with like, where you can
get food, all that kind </SPEAKER_02>
<garnt> of shit delivered to your table. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, it sounds amazing. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I really want to,
I love league and I... </connor>
<joey> - I'll join you guys,
but I'll play Mario 64. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, you can come and
just chill next to us </joey>
<joey> on one of the PC, play PUBG, I don't know. </joey>
<connor> What do you play on PC Joey? </connor>
<joey> - I dunno, I was just going
to fuck you or something. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<SPEAKER_01> - You be like, do you
guys wanna go outside? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm just imagining that,
but we can also go out </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> and get fucking Korean
barbecue, some amazing food. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm just like, this is
just the perfect holiday. </SPEAKER_02>
<garnt> Fuck traveling, fuck seeing things. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm the kind of guy
when I go on vacation. </connor>
<connor> I just, because I work so fucking much. </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> The last thing I want to
do is work on my vacation </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in terms of like doing too much shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I just want to eat
food, drink and relax </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and like take it easy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, I like beaches, but
I mean, I normally just, </SPEAKER_01>
<connor> I like good hotels as well. </connor>
<joey> - I mean that's why like,
whenever I go on a vacation </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> with Aki or I go on a
vacation with like my friends, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I usually let them decide. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I just kind of tag along and be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm down for anything now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If we want to go sightseeing, cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> If we want to just drink, cool. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm very hands-off with my vacation. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If there's a schedule I'm like, no, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> This is already a turnoff right now. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, should love food. </connor>
<joey> - Where are some places though
that we've been thinking </joey>
<joey> to go once COVID is over? </joey>
<garnt> I mean, we mentioned Korea, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I would like to go to Korea </garnt>
<joey> to just spend some few days. </joey>
<joey> - Is that like at the top of
your bucket list right now? </joey>
<joey> - I mean right now cause
it's just easiest to get to. </joey>
<joey> - It's like less than
an hour by plane, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, and I remember going
to Korea like two years ago. </joey>
<joey> - I've never been. </joey>
<joey> - I've never been either. </joey>
<joey> - Actually like Seoul's
just very much like Tokyo, </joey>
<joey> just less busy. </joey>
<connor> And I very much enjoyed the vibe </connor>
<connor> and also the e-sports
scene was massive there. </connor>
<connor> I went there for the league
of legends, grand finals. </connor>
<connor> - We both love watching
the legends worlds. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, that's starting soon,
but yeah, I flew all the way </connor>
<connor> to Korea just to see Fanatic get decimated </connor>
<connor> but the experience was
fucking fantastic man. </connor>
<connor> Like the team, I was actually
cheering for got destroyed, </connor>
<garnt> but just going there and
seeing this massive stadium </garnt>
<garnt> like the noise that they
made, like I've been </garnt>
<garnt> to a football match before,
but I still think the energy </garnt>
<garnt> of this like stadium
watching a fucking video game </garnt>
<garnt> was like 10 times more intense. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yeah. </garnt>
<joey> I mean like I've seen clips
of sports commentators </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> versus e-sports commentators. </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> - Pentakill. </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> - Pentakill. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Pentakill, Pentakill. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - I love that clip. </SPEAKER_01>
<joey> - I love that clip because
I'm just like, wow, </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> this guy is excited about Pentakill. </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> - There's so many good clips like that. </joey>
<joey> The commentators get so hyped </joey>
<connor> It's great, I love it. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, I totally get it though, right? </joey>
<connor> - Dude, we get so fucking
hyped when we watch it, dude. </connor>
<SPEAKER_01> We would like, stand
up like, what the fuck? </SPEAKER_01>
<joey> - I mean, we get worked up, </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> whenever we watched like insane speed runs </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We're just like, what's happening. </SPEAKER_02>
<garnt> - That's the true spectator's full. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> - Did Super Monkey Ball speed runs, </joey>
<connor> the best thing to watch dude. </connor>
<connor> - It's like the cocaine of speed run </connor>
<connor> - Dude, if you get super drunk </connor>
<joey> and watch super monkey ball speed runs. </joey>
<joey> It's so fun. </joey>
<joey> - Which is what we did last Christmas. </joey>
<garnt> - We just got massively drunk </garnt>
<garnt> and watched Super Monkey Ball speed run. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was so fun because you're like, </garnt>
<SPEAKER_01> what is happening? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - How do you practice this? </SPEAKER_01>
<connor> - You're like, what the fuck? </connor>
<SPEAKER_01> Then the next course starts
and, what's he going to do? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Then he fucking flips the whole world </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and gets it in across the map. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And you're like, what the fuck </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> It's so good. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> - What is it about motion
controls that makes it </joey>
<connor> so much more impressive. </connor>
<connor> - It's just crazy. </connor>
<connor> Man, going back to YouTube burnout. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Well, where were we on that point? </connor>
<connor> - I mean, is there anything
else we want to talk about? </connor>
<connor> - I wonder, like where
are you right now with it, </connor>
<connor> like, do you feel, would
you say you're burnout? </connor>
<joey> - I was in like kind of a mini burnout. </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> - I feel like I just have
artist's block right now, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I cannot think of anything. </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> I don't dislike it, I
love it more than ever, </connor>
<connor> I just can't think of anything now. </connor>
<garnt> - I think speaking, honestly, </garnt>
<joey> I'm like pretty close to burnout. </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> Yeah, it's been difficult
because I was already </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> having trouble keeping up and
a semblance of like a schedule </joey>
<joey> this year and then Trash Taste started. </joey>
<joey> And like, you think, cause
we take one day off a week </joey>
<joey> to film this, right? </joey>
<joey> Which doesn't sound like a lot. </joey>
<joey> But for me as someone who
already values every day </joey>
<connor> that I do work, it kind of like builds up. </connor>
<connor> So, that one day, a week
turns into like quite a lot </connor>
<connor> when we're adding like extra
secret projects on top of that. </connor>
<connor> - We have a lot coming in. </connor>
<connor> They gonna take weekends away. </connor>
<connor> - So I guess for me, especially
after Trash Taste started, </connor>
<connor> I'm trying to figure out a
good, a new work-life balance </connor>
<garnt> that kind of works with
me doing everything. </garnt>
<garnt> And not working myself to death </garnt>
<garnt> or maybe I just might take
a break sometime soon. </garnt>
<joey> I don't know yet, I
haven't figured it out. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that's the thing. </joey>
<joey> It's not about seeing
if you can take a break </joey>
<joey> or seeing like what the balance is, </joey>
<joey> because everyone's balances
I feel work really different. </joey>
<joey> Because like for me at
least, my rule of thumb is </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> at least three days of the week </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I try and not do any YouTube stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So like four days and also weekends, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - weekends </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Weekends for me as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> So it's like two days on the weekend. </joey>
<joey> And then one to two days during the week </joey>
<joey> is just a day where I don't do anything. </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> It's just no work, no
YouTube work, nothing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then the rest of the four
days, I go balls to the walls. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And like that's all I do. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Of course it depends on my schedule. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> But I feel that like,
because before, when I was </joey>
<joey> in like that really, really
like deep, deep burnout. </joey>
<joey> I wasn't going out at all. </joey>
<joey> Like I wasn't going to see anybody. </joey>
<joey> - Definitely having like a
social life is like really </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> important to not feeling
like you're trapped. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I think definitely for
me, like AX and conventions </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> in general was such a huge,
like mini-vacation for me. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, it's so refreshing
when you go to a convention. </joey>
<connor> - And we just didn't get that this year. </connor>
<connor> - I know. </connor>
<garnt> - Which is why I think
everything's just been exasperated. </garnt>
<connor> - It was awful, cause I remember
the last day AX happened. </connor>
<connor> So 2019, I distinctly
remember the week before </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> I was working so much that I thought like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I was just ready to like
fucking start crying </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and like, come on, so I'm
just like, I can't do this. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> And if that AX hadn't
happened, like at that time, </joey>
<joey> I didn't know what I would've done. </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause I think I would
have been way too burnout. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause yeah, I burned myself
out so much in the anticipation </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I could enjoy this
thing and have the vacation </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and luckily it was great. </SPEAKER_02>
<garnt> I had a fucking great time. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And yeah, it's been weird now, </garnt>
<garnt> because we don't have any of that. </garnt>
<connor> And I remember speaking to
Emily and Emily was like, </connor>
<connor> what's the last time you took a vacation. </connor>
<connor> Before the Niigata one,
and I was like, hmm, </connor>
<connor> like an actual vacation,
I think it was like two </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> or three years. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> Never took a vacation. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It was just like maybe a weekend trip. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That was like a little getaway
for like one or two days. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But not like an actual vacation. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> It actually been like two, three years. </joey>
<joey> Plus I'd actually done it
now because I'd never would. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, cause you don't about it, right? </joey>
<joey> - No, cause conventions were my, </joey>
<garnt> I mean, conventions are work. </garnt>
<garnt> - Technically. </garnt>
<connor> - They're a hundred percent work. </connor>
<garnt> - Like you still enjoyed it
and it was just a nice break </garnt>
<connor> from your routine. </connor>
<garnt> That's why I do my conventions. </garnt>
<connor> - But I can't really call a vacation. </connor>
<SPEAKER_01> And it was crazy that I would
go like two, three years. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> She didn't even question
if I needed a break, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like even Christmas, like,
and all the family holidays </SPEAKER_01>
<connor> and stuff that I would do. </connor>
<connor> I would still be doing work. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It was crazy. </joey>
<joey> - Well I think that's why I
like, I've kind of been blessed </joey>
<joey> in that aspect because I am
really good at scheduling </joey>
<joey> and getting it on top of my
schedule because I've been able </joey>
<joey> to take short vacations. </joey>
<joey> Like whether it be with
family or with friends </joey>
<joey> or just whatever, just very
frequently, like, you know, </joey>
<joey> minus all of the conventions
because to me conventions </joey>
<connor> aren't a vacation, it's just work, </connor>
<joey> but a different type of work. </joey>
<connor> - Just having like a
weekend away helps so much </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> to like recharge you, I think. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And as well as my videos
have been getting a lot more </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> ambitious as well, recently, </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> so I've adding on more work schedule. </joey>
<joey> - That's the power, isn't? </joey>
<joey> - Same upload schedule
but like three times </joey>
<joey> the amount of work. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly, exactly. </joey>
<joey> - I did, by the time we were recording, </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> like a rented boyfriend
video, first video was easy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It was two hours of work on
my end of recording work. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Cause there's loads of other
work that went in before that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But two hours of just
reacting to applications. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That's easy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Second part was hard because
I had to schedule 13 people </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> with different time zones,
calls, one hour calls </joey>
<joey> with these people and then
plan out what I was going to do </joey>
<joey> on each call. </joey>
<joey> Because I did something
different for everyone. </joey>
<joey> One of them I had to like
get a whole Bob Ross set up </joey>
<SPEAKER_01> and one of them I had to get
all sculpting stuff and others. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> Just different things at each
one and there's one hour each. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So just pure call times, it was 13 hours. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> And then on top of that
I had to then fucking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> micromanage my schedule </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Which if you try and schedule times zones, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh my fucking God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's not difficult, but
you feel like your brain </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> is going to implode trying to
juggle all these times zones </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and plot them all out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And this is just for one video. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then, you know, back in
March I did the audio book video </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> which is like a month of straight work. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that was the most
stressed I've ever seen you. </joey>
<joey> - I thought you were
going to burnout there. </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't know how I did it
because I was also uploading </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> weekly videos in between
this behemoth of a video. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's crazy, cause I had
to make the audio book </joey>
<joey> and make the video. </joey>
<connor> I just, I don't know how
I did not get burnout. </connor>
<joey> - That's the double edged sword, isn't it? </joey>
<joey> Is that like, the more you do YouTube </joey>
<joey> and like the moment you're like, </joey>
<joey> - I want to do better. </joey>
<joey> - The moment you decide to
venture out into that one </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> ambitious idea and you make
it happen and it's successful </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then you start thinking,
all right, I did it once. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can do it again, but better. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> And then it just keeps getting </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and then it just keeps escalating </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and escalating and escalating
until you realize, oh shit, </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> I don't have time to make this video. </connor>
<connor> It's either going to suck </connor>
<joey> or I have to sacrifice other ideas. </joey>
<garnt> - It kind of sucks when
you reached the point where </garnt>
<garnt> you make a banger video
and then you think, man, </garnt>
<garnt> how am I going to top this? </garnt>
<garnt> If I'm not going to top this,
what's the point of trying. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly, exactly. </connor>
<connor> - The way I see it is that like, </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> the videos that I put out most often </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or the like the standard
videos that I hope people enjoy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and that they like buy a bit of time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then every now and
then I like to just hopefully </SPEAKER_01>
<garnt> think that these are the banger videos. </garnt>
<garnt> The ones that like
really blow people away. </garnt>
<garnt> But I hope that in between
them, the videos I do put out </garnt>
<joey> like keep people engaged and enjoying. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> I think it's kind of bitter
sweet when you do bring out </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> that banger video and it doesn't amazing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then you're like, all right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I have to upload a couple
of throwaway videos </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> but then throwaway videos do just as well. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> I can literally do anything
and it'll be all right. </joey>
<joey> - By throwaway videos we mean videos </joey>
<joey> that take very little time in comparison. </joey>
<garnt> - Way less time. </garnt>
<joey> - The thing that you have to get around </joey>
<joey> with being a YouTuber is that
the effort you put in a video </joey>
<joey> does like hardly ever
equates the views it gets. </joey>
<joey> - Never. </joey>
<joey> - There's no correlation to that. </joey>
<joey> And you know, the people may
notice how much effort you put </joey>
<garnt> in X videos, but what YouTube
cares about the metrics, </garnt>
<garnt> the money you make does
hardly gets affected. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's all idea based, right? </garnt>
<connor> It's all about, do you have a better idea? </connor>
<connor> It doesn't matter how you execute it. </connor>
<joey> Do you have a better idea, if
you do, we'll pay you more. </joey>
<connor> - It's unfortunate, but I
think I've just come to accept </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm totally fine with
knowing that maybe my video </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I put two months of
work into won't do well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm just happy that I did it. </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> Cause I'm like, I can at least
be like, I'm capable of this. </joey>
<joey> - It looks good on the resume. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> Like, I'm working on a
video right now where I was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I was a Fiverr seller for like two months </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and it's all done now, but
that's two months of work. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And if that video bombs,
I was gonna be pretty sad, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'ma cry. </SPEAKER_01>
<connor> - It's gonna be pretty
fucking sad, isn't it? </connor>
<SPEAKER_01> Because two months, two months
of fucking work into that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then afterwards you do
a video that takes an hour </SPEAKER_01>
<joey> to make and you'll be like,
it'll get just as many views. </joey>
<connor> - Ten times even better sometimes. </connor>
<garnt> - I think that's YouTube, right? </garnt>
<garnt> And I think I've just come to accept now </garnt>
<SPEAKER_01> that I'm not doing it for the views. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm doing it because I
want to make these videos </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I think are cool. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's pretty much where
I've gotten to now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I think Trash Taste's been
great because it allows me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to just even more further
lean that mindset of, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't really care
cause we have Trash Taste </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and Trash Taste gets more
views than most of my videos. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's just me chatting shit for hours. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I gotta not give a
shit about the views. </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I've definitely started to
care less on my main channel. </joey>
<connor> - Trash Taste is... </connor>
<joey> - Care less about the views actually. </joey>
<garnt> - No, no. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't give a fuck about my channel. </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> - Trash Taste has really
been like bittersweet </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just to see like how much
effort we put into our videos </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on our own channels. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Then we come in and
chat shit for two hours </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and we're like a million views </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for like two hours just chatting. </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> And I'm just like, what am I doing right? </joey>
<joey> And what am I doing wrong? </joey>
<joey> - It's like, hold on a million views. </joey>
<joey> And there's only three cuts in
the video, what's happening. </joey>
<connor> - It's nice though because
it feels that like obviously </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> there's, we're doing something right here. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You guys must enjoy it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> I think our dynamic must
be working, I guess. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know. </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> I mean, I'm very glad
that it's doing well. </connor>
<joey> - But that's the thing, right? </joey>
<joey> Is that because of Trash
Taste, because this is quite </joey>
<joey> different to what I do and what we all do </joey>
<joey> in our own channels. </joey>
<SPEAKER_01> It's kind of incentivized
me more to explore different </SPEAKER_01>
<connor> things on my main channel. </connor>
<garnt> Like, I recently brought out
a video where I kind of go </garnt>
<garnt> personal into like my whole
thing about being half-Japanese. </garnt>
<garnt> - That was a really good video. </garnt>
<garnt> And I was really scared to upload that. </garnt>
<garnt> Because it's got nothing to do with anime </garnt>
<joey> and it's just my life story basically. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, I really
don't want this to look </joey>
<joey> like another sob story. </joey>
<joey> Like a woe is me type of story, </joey>
<joey> but people really enjoyed it. </joey>
<joey> I asked Mudan as well to like
do a little bit different </joey>
<joey> on the editing side of things </joey>
<joey> and everything turned out amazing. </joey>
<joey> So when I saw that video
do well, I was like, okay, </joey>
<joey> maybe I can, even though
I'm called the Anime Man, </joey>
<joey> maybe not every video
has to be about anime. </joey>
<joey> Maybe I can go back to my Let's Play days </joey>
<joey> and just do whatever the fuck I want. </joey>
<connor> - A lot might not know about
voice acting so, it's fine. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I know. </joey>
<connor> But at least you also just VA, right? </connor>
<garnt> Like you don't have CDawg voice actor. </garnt>
<joey> - That's true. </joey>
<joey> - Not all my videos are
about the United Kingdom. </joey>
<garnt> (Connor and Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> So, it's all good, man. </garnt>
<joey> It's all good. </joey>
<joey> - Why did you stop talking about Arizona? </joey>
<joey> Where did the Arizona go? </joey>
<joey> - Why not then review
Virginia for the moment </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> and see what's up with that. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> - Yeah, I dunno. </joey>
<joey> It's just, I dunno, cause with me, right. </joey>
<joey> At least with you guys, </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> because your names are a
lot more general, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> You're not bound to a certain topic. </SPEAKER_01>
<connor> Not like I am. </connor>
<SPEAKER_01> - Have you ever thought
about changing your name? </SPEAKER_01>
<joey> - I have, in a sense, yes. </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> Actually a number of
times I thought about it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like, when I was still doing Let's Plays. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I thought about changing it,
just because first of all, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> half of the games I
play aren't even anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Second of all, I'm uploading
like five Lets Plays in a week </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> and tWo anime videos in a week. </joey>
<joey> So I thought, is there really a point </joey>
<joey> to call myself the Anime Man? </joey>
<joey> But at that point, now the
Anime Man is just a brand. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, true. </joey>
<joey> - People know me, not as
Joey, but as the Anime Man. </joey>
<joey> So it's really hard to just
suddenly change the name. </joey>
<joey> Because I've seen instances of YouTubers </joey>
<joey> who are already established in a name, </joey>
<joey> who decide on a whim to
change their user name </joey>
<connor> to something, because it
doesn't fit their current image </connor>
<joey> and it's never worked out. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I know, I know. </connor>
<connor> One channel, I think it's worked out </connor>
<connor> there was a channel called, I
guess he goes by Lemmino now, </connor>
<garnt> have you seen his videos? </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> He used to be a top 10 channel. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_02> - Top 10, he's still a top 10. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - My God, Lemmino. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> Like, now he basically just
does Netflix documentaries. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> That's kind of like the
level of YouTube content </joey>
<connor> that he puts out. </connor>
<garnt> - Really, really good stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> He used to be called Top Tens. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_06> And obviously he's not doing top 10's now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I think he might do
them, every now and then. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't think he does though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, he changed his name. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And I remember being weirded out at first. </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> I was like what? why? </joey>
<joey> But now you don't give a shit </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, but that's the thing, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel that is just a
really small handful. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - True.
- True. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Most of the time
you're just like, oh God, </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> why did the name change? </connor>
<connor> - You'll basically be
resetting all the SEO's </connor>
<connor> - Why are they making
completely different content? </connor>
<joey> I didn't sign up for this shit. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, like, respect to
anyone who has the balls </garnt>
<joey> to do that because I
wouldn't be able to get away </joey>
<joey> from like, my brand that I've built up </joey>
<garnt> over this entire time. </garnt>
<joey> - Like, that's like
if, for example, right. </joey>
<connor> - Like you took away VA in your name. </connor>
<connor> And you just turn it to CDawg. </connor>
<connor> - I don't think it would change anything. </connor>
<joey> - I dunno, man. </joey>
<garnt> - I think it's more like if
you just change your name </garnt>
<SPEAKER_02> to like Connor. </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah, true, true, true. </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's the reason why,
like, for me, for example, </SPEAKER_02>
<garnt> I want to like say on Trash Taste, right? </garnt>
<garnt> I just want to be established as Joey. </garnt>
<connor> Not as the Anime Man, </connor>
<joey> because I feel that's a
completely different side of me. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> You've gotten the clips on you now? right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause we had a discussion when
we were making the channel. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We were like, so in the clip. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So we calling us the Anime Man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And did X, X thing or like Joey. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think I was at the
mindset of like, okay, well. </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> It's a podcast and it's very
personal and we're probably </joey>
<joey> gonna be talking about personal things. </joey>
<joey> I think it should be Connor,
Joey, Garnt et cetera. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, and not to say
that we don't mind you guys </joey>
<joey> calling us by our usernames. </joey>
<joey> But I think the end game for Trash Taste </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> at least in my mind is that
I don't want to be known </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as The Anime Man, Gigguk and CDawg. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I wanted us to be known </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as Joey, Garnt and Connor of Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> - The boys. </joey>
<connor> - The boys, right? </connor>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I remember. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just, I wanted to be able to like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cause I have all these cool stories </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that are fucking useless to me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What am I going to do? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> When am I ever going to get
mileage out of the story? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - When am I going to monetize my stories? </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> - Let's just commoditize it. </connor>
<garnt> - Let's just commoditize
my entire fucking life. </garnt>
<connor> - Dude, I love telling the chest story. </connor>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause that's such a fucking cool story. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I never get any use out of that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And also people will just like, I dunno. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like adding layers to me,
I love it when I get to learn </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> more about a creator and
like that personal side </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> I actually like, I like,
I think that, I dunno. </SPEAKER_01>
<connor> I just also, I'm just gonna
say I love fucking talking. </connor>
<connor> I love talking. </connor>
<joey> I just won't shut the fuck up. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, I would argue
we wouldn't have a podcast </joey>
<connor> if we didn't like talking. </connor>
<joey> - That's true. </joey>
<connor> - That's why I can stream just
chatting for like four hours. </connor>
<garnt> Cause I'm a fucking psychopath I guess, </garnt>
<garnt> I just won't shut up. </garnt>
<garnt> - I have too many stories to hold. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just want to keep
fucking chatting shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know, I love talking
and it's great being able to. </SPEAKER_01>
<garnt> I love talking about YouTube as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because you never get
the opportunity to do it. </garnt>
<joey> - You never, because all of
our friends, all of our family, </joey>
<garnt> they don't know what the fuck we do. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, and then I could
talk about it with you guys </connor>
<connor> but I pretty dominate every
single conversation we have </connor>
<SPEAKER_01> off the podcast. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So it's nice to just talk about it here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then we can just chat shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<connor> Like poopy poopoo, stinky,
in private, you know. </connor>
<garnt> - We're sorry for anyone
who goes into this podcast </garnt>
<garnt> thinking it was going to be
like an anime exclusive podcast. </garnt>
<joey> - Because I know on. </joey>
<connor> - I think you two are worried about that. </connor>
<connor> - And I was like, no, dude, </connor>
<joey> I want us to be like chatting shit. </joey>
<garnt> - No, no, no, I want it
to be like, eventually, </garnt>
<garnt> we start off as an Anime podcast. </garnt>
<garnt> - And we eventually grow out. </garnt>
<garnt> - And then we can eventually
maybe start tensioning out. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_02> But not right from the get-go
first episode, we were like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm glad, I'm glad. </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> - Japan. </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, let's talk about Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, but we're really glad
that you guys have like, </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> kind of stuck around and just
enjoyed us chatting shit. </joey>
<joey> Like arguably more so than
us chatting about anime. </joey>
<joey> - I wonder, I mean, going
back to the previous topic, </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> is it like, cause you hear a lot of advice </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that YouTubers give to people. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I feel a lot of it's pretty shit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Let's be honest. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> A lot of it's pretty funny fucking </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> - Like how so? </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> I mean, don't give examples necessarily, </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> but like, how are they shit? </joey>
<connor> - There's generic phrases
that YouTubers say, </connor>
<garnt> and we, let's be honest. </garnt>
<connor> We say it cause it's fucking easy. </connor>
<connor> Like... </connor>
<garnt> - You mean what I'm going to
call like the convention panel. </garnt>
<connor> - Garnt, give me the most stereotypical. </connor>
<connor> And I'll say if these are the shit ones, </connor>
<connor> give me stereotypical answers on advice </connor>
<connor> when someone asks you
how to be a YouTuber. </connor>
<connor> - Just be yourself. </connor>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<joey> - That is fucking terrible advice. </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> - Shake my head. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Do you know how many people
I know who are insufferable. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<connor> I have so many mates where I'm like, </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> listen you're a fantastic mate. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But if you act like this on camera, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no one's going to want to watch. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> You have a lot of mates. </connor>
<joey> You're like, you just kind
of come off as a dick. </joey>
<joey> - Let's say, because for
me now I used to say, </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> just be yourself and
just have fun with it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Have fun with it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You know? </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> But nowadays I just make it a meme because </joey>
<joey> I get also many times. </joey>
<garnt> Someone's like, how do you
start becoming a YouTuber? </garnt>
<garnt> I just say, hit the upload button. </garnt>
<connor> - Are we actually going
to break this down? </connor>
<connor> - Should we give advice? </connor>
<connor> I think why not? cause people want to know </connor>
<connor> fucking YouTube advice
and we may as well like, </connor>
<garnt> actually give good advice. </garnt>
<connor> - Okay, how to become
a successful YouTuber </connor>
<connor> from Trash Taste. </connor>
<connor> I feel like we say generic
advice because there's like, </connor>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel like the generic
advice that we give </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is like the core of like... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It is fucking useless to most people. </SPEAKER_01>
<garnt> - It is useless because
there's only so much </garnt>
<garnt> you can say like a half hour panel </garnt>
<connor> - It's one of those
things where it's like, </connor>
<joey> you know, in the show when
the old man gives advice </joey>
<joey> and you're like, that's fucking dumb. </joey>
<joey> And then 10 years later
when he actually does it </joey>
<SPEAKER_01> you're like, fuck, he was right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's pretty much the advice. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, cause you're like
it's completely useless </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to anyone starting out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause that doesn't mean anything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> when you've been doing it for this long. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, it is the core, like you said. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But the be yourself thing is like, </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> I think that's the biggest like, </joey>
<connor> - Cop out. </connor>
<joey> It is a bit of a cop out. </joey>
<connor> - Because you don't, you're not, </connor>
<connor> yourself as a normal person,
you're not a presenter. </connor>
<connor> No one normally is a presenter </connor>
<connor> or a personality who's
made for like cameras. </connor>
<connor> You have to, you have to
get that, and you do it </connor>
<connor> by forcing yourself to act
maybe a little bit more </connor>
<connor> exaggerated than you normally do. </connor>
<connor> And then over time, maybe
you get way more comfortable </connor>
<connor> and it does become your
kind of like default. </connor>
<garnt> Right? </garnt>
<garnt> - I dunno, because like,
be yourself to me is like </garnt>
<connor> I guess less accurate than just, </connor>
<connor> don't try to be someone you're not. </connor>
<connor> - That's true. </connor>
<connor> Don't change your personality. </connor>
<connor> - If you are going to play a character, </connor>
<connor> play a character that is
based on your own self. </connor>
<connor> - True. </connor>
<connor> - Which is I feel like, well, </connor>
<connor> like a lot of us do online anyway. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> It's just like an exaggerated </connor>
<garnt> perfected version of ourselves. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - That's what I say. </connor>
<connor> I say like, imagine you on your best day </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> and that is you on every single
one of these YouTube videos. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> That's what should it be? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know, whether or not
that should be right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, should you be sad on
camera and stuff like that? </SPEAKER_01>
<joey> It's like, not really about that. </joey>
<joey> It's, think of every single
best personality trait you have </joey>
<SPEAKER_01> and show that, make that come through. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And so that does require
a little bit of, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a bit of fuckery, going
home with your personality. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You do have to change it a little bit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But I found as well that
it made me a better person </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> in general that like I, the
things that people liked </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about me became more prominent
in my general personality. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So it wasn't more so that
I was faking it more so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that the real me kind of changed </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> into a more confident version of myself. </joey>
<joey> And I, you know, you should pass a way </joey>
<connor> of really making you see your flaws. </connor>
<joey> - Oh yeah.
- Oh yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's a fine balance as
well, because I feel that </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> it's not about like, faking
a personality, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because if you... </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> - It's exaggerated. </connor>
<garnt> - But if you exaggerate it too much </garnt>
<joey> that's when people are like,
then you become access to doubt </joey>
<garnt> - Then you become that
psychopathic vlogger. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, then you become
that psychopathic vlogger </joey>
<joey> who is like the most angel image online. </joey>
<joey> But then when you meet them in person </joey>
<joey> they're an absolute cunt. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's like, sometimes in conventions, </connor>
<connor> people come up to me like, wow, </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> you're a lot more calm
than in your videos. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's like, well,
yeah, because, oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Did you get that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, I am like, if I'm
fucking crazy in my videos, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> or doing something stupid. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, I genuinely am like that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but you can't do that all the time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<connor> - Otherwise you're a psychopath. </connor>
<joey> - You're either a psychopath or Guy Fieri. </joey>
<joey> - You know, in real life
it's fucking annoying. </joey>
<SPEAKER_01> You're in a friend group
and someone wants to be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the center of attention all the time. </SPEAKER_01>
<garnt> Like, it's not natural to want the center </garnt>
<garnt> of attention all the time. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, it's totally okay to be
in a friend group and be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just not going to say
anything for five minutes </SPEAKER_01>
<connor> and I'll wait for my time to join in. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<joey> - And if you don't join
in at all, that's fine. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah man, that's what I thought. </joey>
<joey> - You can just be there. </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, there's plenty
of YouTubers I've met </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where, you know, you'll like,
oh, you're totally different. </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> - Oh yeah. </joey>
<connor> - You're not even close. </connor>
<connor> - Not gonna say any
names, obviously, but... </connor>
<garnt> - I don't wanna get in trouble. </garnt>
<joey> - we've had our fair share. </joey>
<garnt> - This is the gospel we have </garnt>
<garnt> behind the scenes, unfortunately. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, if the cameras weren't on </joey>
<garnt> we'd totally be saying names. </garnt>
<joey> Yeah, that person sucks. </joey>
<joey> - It's because you wouldn't... </joey>
<SPEAKER_06> Okay, you see drama on YouTube
behind the scenes sometimes. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And you're like, wow, everyone is drama. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> No one knows about it. </joey>
<joey> That's kind of crazy. </joey>
<connor> So yeah, every, YouTuber you
watch probably has some drama. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, it's just about whether they... </joey>
<garnt> - Everyone has dirt on someone else. </garnt>
<joey> - That's just about whether
they choose to monetize it. </joey>
<garnt> (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - That's so true, that's so true </garnt>
<joey> - But everyone has shit with other people. </joey>
<connor> It's very natural. </connor>
<connor> - I've had issues before, but
I've always done it in private </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> and I've always swamped in private. </SPEAKER_02>
<garnt> You know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> - Same. </garnt>
<connor> - If someone's crossed
the line I've told them. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I guess going back
to like general advice </garnt>
<garnt> on how to be a successful YouTuber. </garnt>
<connor> I think one thing that's
not really mentioned a lot </connor>
<connor> is just know who your audience is. </connor>
<connor> Like, don't try to appeal to everyone. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> - You can't please everyone. </connor>
<SPEAKER_01> - You're gonna be disliked
by a lot of people. </SPEAKER_01>
<connor> - Yeah, you're gonna be
disliked by a lot of people, </connor>
<SPEAKER_01> just accept that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel like one thing that
not many people think about, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> especially like even us, when we started, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we didn't really think about it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We didn't really think, oh, I
want to be this kind of person </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> or aim for this kind of audience </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but it's something you kind of grow into. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And now all three of us
have very different brands </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in terms of like what
our content is about. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And it's something we grow into. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But you like anyone,
anyone who's trying to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> be a YouTuber has a harder
time getting into that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because you have way more competition. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because I know that if I
were just starting YouTube </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> out today, I would be totally different. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like my content would be totally different </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> than what I'm doing now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And that's because I exist, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So if I exist, then you
can't do the same thing, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you can't exist in the
same space that I do. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And so one thing that you've got to find </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is like a unique way to
make yourself memorable. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And sometimes that might just be </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> how you approach your content. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Sometimes that may be your personality. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But a lot of the successful
YouTubers that are rising up </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> quickly have found a way
to make their own niche. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> Even if it's like this
very saturated market. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I think the person
who like sticks out to me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the most recent that I can
think of was like Nikki Jakey </SPEAKER_01>
<joey> and how fast he rose. </joey>
<joey> And that's because his content
and the way he delivered it </joey>
<joey> was just so unique compared
to every other gaming content </joey>
<garnt> out there, even though gaming
was such a saturated market. </garnt>
<joey> - Gaming outside of YouTube is everywhere. </joey>
<garnt> - And I would say like,
that's one extreme. </garnt>
<garnt> You don't have to go
like, as unique as him, </garnt>
<garnt> but even like a lot of other
people who are rising up </garnt>
<garnt> have found a way to make
their own voice unique </garnt>
<garnt> or make their presentation
unique or something </garnt>
<garnt> that is memorable about them. </garnt>
<joey> If that makes sense. </joey>
<joey> - And it's funny as well,
because a lot of those types </joey>
<joey> of YouTubers tend to be the most humble. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Because like I remember in a
Nike Jakey video he once said </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> like, yeah, because I'm just
John Tron on an exercise ball. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So he said, that's what he called himself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He's like, I'm John Tron
on an exercise ball. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like, you shouldn't
sell yourself that short </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because he's completely different. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He's made up his own thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I feel, as you said,
that's, that's the thing, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> It's like, there's nothing
wrong with getting inspired </joey>
<joey> by an already existing
YouTuber, being like, </joey>
<joey> I like that aspect of this YouTuber. </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> So I'm going to take
that into my own thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> But there's a difference
between getting inspired </joey>
<joey> by PewDiePie and then
trying to be PewDiePie 2.0. </joey>
<connor> - I think when I started
YouTube, I think like, </connor>
<garnt> I definitely loved dance videos,
but I just knew that like, </garnt>
<garnt> that's just doesn't work with me. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - As much as I'd love
to make a Gigguk video. </SPEAKER_01>
<connor> I just can't, that's
not, I can't pull it off. </connor>
<garnt> - It's a Gigguk video
because it's a Gigguk video. </garnt>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think you learn, a good
YouTuber will learn very quickly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what tools they're working with. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And you can figure out what you
can kind of get out of that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's difficult though,
because I think again, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like you've said, like a lot
of people with like specialties </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are coming up now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So if you want to join
something, like gaming </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you need a fucking good skill to separate. </SPEAKER_02>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - So think like, if you're making a video, </garnt>
<garnt> like is it just another
carbon copy of someone else's </garnt>
<garnt> or I always told myself, like, let's say </garnt>
<SPEAKER_06> even though we're in
different genres, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Let's say Markiplier
uploads a video, right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> At the same time I upload a video. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> What reason does someone have
to watch my video over his? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Because you know, that's, I
mean, this is the problem. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> It's only X amount of time in the day </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you need the eyeballs on you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So you need to make your videos
as good as the best people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on YouTube, otherwise
people aren't gonna watch. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like some people will and,
and they'll be very grateful </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because you're doing a very niche thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But in general, you need
to make your content </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> like as good as other people around you. </joey>
<joey> It doesn't matter how
big or small you are. </joey>
<joey> This is the fundamental. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, because everybody
starts off small. </joey>
<joey> - Everyone starts off small. </joey>
<connor> The problem is, is that
the YouTube algorithm </connor>
<connor> doesn't give a fuck at your side. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, I'd say that. </garnt>
<garnt> I obviously agree. </garnt>
<garnt> You should make your
content as good as possible. </garnt>
<connor> I just don't think. </connor>
<connor> Especially as a small growing
YouTuber, making your content </connor>
<connor> as good as like some
of the bigger YouTubers </connor>
<connor> - You're not going to, but
you should have that mindset. </connor>
<connor> - You should eventually. </connor>
<SPEAKER_01> But what I'm saying is like,
if you're starting our YouTube </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> some of the charm, is just
discovering this YouTuber </SPEAKER_01>
<connor> who just like, is like
a diamond in the rough. </connor>
<connor> You shouldn't, like the
quality of your videos. </connor>
<connor> You shouldn't need to
think that you need to make </connor>
<joey> like a John Tron fucking quality
video of right off the bat. </joey>
<joey> Because like, I feel like you
should, getting into YouTube, </joey>
<garnt> you should understand what
YouTube is at it's core. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, cause I think I
watched, like I still do. </connor>
<connor> I watch like 40 hours
plus of YouTube a week </connor>
<connor> and been doing that for like years </connor>
<garnt> - And YouTube at its core
isn't a video hosting platform. </garnt>
<garnt> YouTube at a core is a
friendship simulator. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh. </connor>
<garnt> - And I mean, that's, that's, it is. </garnt>
<connor> - I really want to be friends
with report of the week man. </connor>
<connor> I love that man seriously. </connor>
<garnt> - Because, the thing is, a
lot of the most successful </garnt>
<garnt> YouTubers, you know what
their personality is like </garnt>
<connor> and a lot of the reason
why I started watching </connor>
<connor> like YouTubers big or small is
because I like a certain part </connor>
<connor> of their personality. </connor>
<connor> And there was some like, even
if there was someone I hated </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> there was part of their personality
or part of their content </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I couldn't stop watching
it, what drew me to it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I feel like a lot of
the successful YouTubers </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> have been able to kind of
like convey their personality </connor>
<connor> into their content in
some way, that goes back </connor>
<connor> to like being like memorable
and stuff like that. </connor>
<connor> But you know, it plays into
like parasocial relationships </connor>
<connor> and all that, which is a
totally fucking different topic. </connor>
<connor> But if you're talking about
success, like it's basically you </connor>
<connor> the more you can become
successful successful quickly </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> by just having people who
relate to you as a person. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's true. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And that goes into,
you can't please everyone </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because your personality is not
going to appeal to everyone. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But having your own,
putting yourself out there. </SPEAKER_06>
<garnt> And if people like you, or if people </garnt>
<garnt> find part of you interesting
and you can convey that, </garnt>
<garnt> then you will grow as a YouTuber. </garnt>
<connor> - It's true </connor>
<connor> I think, unfortunately
everyone can't be like, </connor>
<joey> ultra mega charming right off the bat. </joey>
<joey> Like, I mean like report of the week. </joey>
<joey> I love that guy's, I love him. </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> And that kind of personality
doesn't come along often. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just pure, charming
and like innocence. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But you know, what if you
have like just a normal, </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> medium, boring personality. </connor>
<connor> Like, I feel like I probably
had like a boring aspect. </connor>
<joey> - All of our first
videos were just like... </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, and just developing that </joey>
<joey> along your, finding your
niche like you said. </joey>
<garnt> Like going into it. </garnt>
<garnt> Like knowing your audience, </garnt>
<connor> like these are all Important things. </connor>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like, I was someone who was
like this, awkward social kid. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Same, same. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And especially like, as a YouTuber </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I still don't feel like
I've changed a lot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just know that, hey, like
if I'm going to be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<joey> when I realized, hey, if I'm going </joey>
<joey> to be a fucking degenerate,
let's just like notch. </joey>
<joey> Let's just go all out. </joey>
<joey> I don't fucking give a shit anymore. </joey>
<joey> And it's just taking part of yourselves </joey>
<connor> and just like going full throttle with it. </connor>
<connor> I dunno, I dunno because I knew it. </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> - I agree. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I knew like that's just
gonna make you stand out. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> Like now I'm not ashamed
of being a degenerate </connor>
<connor> and I'm fucking glad that I
took that change in my content, </connor>
<connor> because like, it just
made me less embarrassed </connor>
<connor> about being who I was originally. </connor>
<connor> And like, instead of being a quiet kid, </connor>
<connor> I could just talk about all the shit </connor>
<connor> I was like, thinking about. </connor>
<joey> - Anime titties. </joey>
<garnt> - Anime titties, let's go baby. </garnt>
<joey> - So bottom line, how to
be a successful YouTuber, </joey>
<connor> be yourself (Garnt
laughs) just be yourself. </connor>
<connor> - I guess that's, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - That's kind of like
what I'm talking about. </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's what it all goes back to. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Because it's the core, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> It's the fucking core
that I'm talking about. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Well, I can't normally,
I can't say this kind </SPEAKER_01>
<connor> of answer in a fucking panel. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah, no. </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> You're just fucking
bore everyone to death. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But you know, there's and
I also think it's important </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> to just upload, like, just do it. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> - Consistency. </joey>
<joey> - I have so many friends who are like, </joey>
<joey> I'm working on something
big, like it's big, bro. </joey>
<joey> I'm sure you all have this friend. </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> Who's like, Oh, I've
got shit in the works. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, and then it's like two years later. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh, it's, it's coming. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it's coming. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's coming. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Then they upload it. </SPEAKER_02>
<connor> And then they're like, that's
it, I'm famous, I'm done. </connor>
<connor> And then they realize
they have to do it again. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, the amount of
channels I've seen that have </joey>
<joey> more update videos than actual content </joey>
<connor> on their channel is staggering. </connor>
<joey> - And it's that thing right. </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> Where I think everyone who
watches YouTube, idolizes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that YouTuber who uploads
once every three months. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's a legendary, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> But in reality, there's
only a very small room </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> for channels like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There's only a select few who can do that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And in reality, most of us </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have to just keep fucking uploading. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's just how it is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Because a lot of us aren't
capable of putting in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that amount of work into a video. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I love , what's his name? </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> Frederik Knudsen. </joey>
<joey> What is his name? </joey>
<joey> - Down the rabbit hole. </joey>
<joey> - Down the rabbit hole, love his videos. </joey>
<joey> I don't mind how long it takes him. </joey>
<joey> Cause that that man must put in. </joey>
<joey> I don't want even want to
know how much work he puts in. </joey>
<joey> I love that wings of redemption. </joey>
<joey> - It's like a two and
half hour long video. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I've watched it like
four times and I love it. </connor>
<joey> - In the same sense, like the
right opinion, for example. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I've watched this for... </connor>
<joey> - Fucking four hours. </joey>
<joey> - When I was sick I watched
this four hour video </joey>
<joey> in one sitting of his
Nick Carter avocado video. </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> And I thought I was losing
my damn mind watching this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But you know, again, it's a very, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone wants to be that channel, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The really well-respected
channel that does that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But unfortunately I think as a YouTuber </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you'll know very quickly on
if you can do that or not, </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> if that's your kind of thing,
some people can do that. </joey>
<joey> A lot of people just </joey>
<joey> just got to accept that you're going to be </joey>
<joey> that dude who makes one
video every two days. </joey>
<joey> Like, and there's nothing wrong with that. </joey>
<joey> Like just embrace it. </joey>
<joey> - There's a space for that on YouTube. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, there's a space for everything. </connor>
<connor> If you've got to make slime videos, don't. </connor>
<connor> - I for one love the slime videos, </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, fuck. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - to be honest with you. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> When I discovered that like a week ago </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> I was like, okay, kind of
like, I'm not gonna lie. </joey>
<connor> - Do you know what the biggest pitfall, </connor>
<connor> I think a lot of YouTubers fall down? </connor>
<joey> Is that when they get one
successful video series </joey>
<joey> they're like make 10 of that. </joey>
<joey> Make 10 of that, </joey>
<joey> - Do it again. </joey>
<joey> - And I think... </joey>
<joey> - You mean every top 10 channel? </joey>
<joey> - Oh my God, you meet people. </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> And they make, they just make repeats </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and repeats of the same video. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And you've got to realize like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if that's the only thing
that's pulling people in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you haven't made any other foundation </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to keep people engaged. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, you've got to be patient. </SPEAKER_02>
<garnt> - When that stops, eventually
we're gonna get bored </garnt>
<garnt> of doing it. </garnt>
<garnt> You kind of got not really anything else. </garnt>
<garnt> That's why like... </garnt>
<connor> - You're going to burn out, eventually, </connor>
<connor> like we talked about. </connor>
<connor> Putting a foundation is actually
really, really important </connor>
<connor> and something that most
people don't think about </connor>
<connor> because most people would just want to get </connor>
<connor> as successful as they can. </connor>
<garnt> - More views, more views, more views </garnt>
<garnt> And it's like, I've been
doing the cosplay series </garnt>
<garnt> and yeah, I've, I've
done a fuck ton of those </garnt>
<garnt> but I do one of them about
every two, three months. </garnt>
<connor> So they're really well spaced
out and it's really important </connor>
<connor> to just make sure you're diversifying it </connor>
<connor> so that it's not like a business meeting. </connor>
<SPEAKER_01> Make sure the synergy of your
uploads are diverse enough </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to get to cooperation. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, that's the exact problem I had </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> with the Antony standby, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I haven't done one
in, like seven months </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> eight months or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And people to this day
ask me, when's the next? </SPEAKER_01>
<connor> - When you bring it out. </connor>
<connor> People are gonna be like, hell, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - When I do it, eventually,
maybe, it's going to be great. </joey>
<joey> But the reason why I stopped making those </joey>
<joey> for the longest time is because </joey>
<joey> that's exactly what happened. </joey>
<joey> It was really successful the first time. </joey>
<joey> And I was like, I'll do it every week </joey>
<joey> just do it over and over and over again </joey>
<joey> I made like 60 anime samples, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And now at this point, I'm like, </joey>
<joey> I want to do something else with it. </joey>
<joey> I just don't want to like
upload another Q and A again, </joey>
<connor> because that's essentially what it is. </connor>
<joey> It's just a fucking Q and A. </joey>
<connor> - I also just want to
make sure people know </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> that at the end of the
day, we're fucking dudes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> who talk shit in front of the
camera, it's not a big deal. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like why do people get like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> people with 10,000 subs stacking egos? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I'm like, bro, my job is
to literally me being a clown </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> I like, do not think you're hot shit ever. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know why people
do that either though. </joey>
<joey> - You talk about Japanese car
torrents, dude, that's sad. </joey>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like dude, come on, </garnt>
<garnt> fucking know your place, Jesus Christ. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like, it blows my mind or you see </garnt>
<connor> like some of these
channels, like you see like, </connor>
<connor> do you see like reaction channels? </connor>
<connor> And they're like, I'm
kind of a big deal now. </connor>
<garnt> Bro. </garnt>
<connor> - Bro, like chill, like chill. </connor>
<joey> I see the shit you're posting on Twitter. </joey>
<joey> I'm just like, bro, just stop man. </joey>
<joey> - The audacity of this man is just insane. </joey>
<joey> - There are like a few
channels who could be complete </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> assholes and I'd be like,
I'm still gonna watch dude. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You're fucking God to your content. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You deserve a good dig sucking. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But most of us are shitty YouTubers, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who don't make anything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> So don't get an ego. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We don't do anything impressive. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, I think having
that Attitude towards it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like give it, I H one
of my videos of my baby </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and I cashed so much about it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I never ever think
I'm like anything special. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<garnt> - I think that goes a
long way in making you </garnt>
<connor> a down to earth person in personality. </connor>
<connor> - Being humble goes a very, very long way. </connor>
<connor> And, that's what it is, as
Garnt said before, right? </connor>
<joey> Like YouTube is just a
friendship simulator. </joey>
<joey> And if you want to get those friendships, </joey>
<joey> being humble is probably
the best personality trait </joey>
<joey> you can have on YouTube. </joey>
<connor> - Oh dude, dude. </connor>
<connor> I've made some of the best
friends in my life from YouTube, </connor>
<garnt> you guys, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<connor> Here we are now, the boys. </connor>
<garnt> - The boys wouldn't have come together </garnt>
<connor> if one of us was a dick </connor>
<connor> - Everyone I've met,
obviously, including you guys </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> it's just like you meet
and you just have this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like you can totally
tell that they just don't </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> see themselves as anything special. </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, I feel like very lucky </connor>
<connor> to be in the place that I am now. </connor>
<garnt> I wake up and I'm like, man,
I'm fucking lucky to be here. </garnt>
<connor> - Dude, I'm a smash of Colombini sandwich </connor>
<connor> and get back to work. </connor>
<connor> This is amazing. </connor>
<connor> Like I'm in fucking Japan. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. I know. </joey>
<joey> Meanwhile like people
with like a hundred K subs </joey>
<joey> and just like the massive ego is like, </joey>
<connor> where's my caviar in the morning. </connor>
<joey> - I've seen some abhorrent behavior </joey>
<connor> from people who just think
that they're hot shit. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> And then this isn't
just limited to YouTube, </garnt>
<joey> but like Instagrammers. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, Instagram is the worst. </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> - My God, like just chill. </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> Don't don't be an asshole. </joey>
<joey> That's the second thing. </joey>
<joey> - You want to be successful
YouTuber, don't be a dick. </joey>
<joey> - But also I think thinking
about the future as well </joey>
<joey> and just planning ahead
I think is also important </joey>
<joey> because for like, when
you hear about YouTube </joey>
<SPEAKER_01> success stories, everyone
always just sees, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh man, they're growing
so fucking quickly, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I want that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I want to grow. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I want to grow quickly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But what they don't see
a lot of the times is how </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> fucking long a lot of these
YouTubers worked before that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Cause you always see that one
YouTuber who rises up quickly </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like Mr. Beast, for example. </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> Mr. Beast was like, I
think it was last year </connor>
<connor> or two years ago. </connor>
<connor> He was like the hottest shit
on YouTube in terms of... </connor>
<connor> - He still kinda is. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, he's still here. </connor>
<joey> He's approaching like 50 mil or something. </joey>
<joey> He's like one of the biggest
creators on this platform. </joey>
<joey> But what a lot of people don't talk about </joey>
<joey> is just how many times he had failed </joey>
<joey> and how many different kinds
of content that he did. </joey>
<joey> And he's like, if you
want to be a YouTuber </joey>
<joey> you're going to put in the grind </joey>
<joey> and it is going to be a grind
and not a lot of YouTubers </joey>
<joey> talk about the grinds they put into </joey>
<joey> before they were like successful. </joey>
<joey> Cause everyone always sees </joey>
<joey> that massive fucking year that they had. </joey>
<joey> But like, I remember
being a small YouTuber </joey>
<garnt> and working like, I've been
on YouTube for 13 years. </garnt>
<garnt> Most of that 13 years was
being a, fucking nobody. </garnt>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<garnt> - I have a question. </garnt>
<connor> How many years did you work
on your YouTube channel </connor>
<connor> before you saw a penny? </connor>
<garnt> - Seven, eight years. </garnt>
<connor> - Jesus Christ. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, do you ever get those
comments where people like, </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> dude YouTubers make too much money? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then I always just tell them, dude, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> work for seven years for nothing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then see if you, like, if you want. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> Tell me you want to work for
seven years at the chance </joey>
<joey> of being successful
and getting some money. </joey>
<joey> And it's also a system that
allows some amazing things. </joey>
<joey> The reason why some people
make, you know, like, </joey>
<joey> I'm never going to make nearly
as much money as someone </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> like Logan or Jake Paul makes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But that system is also in place </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so that one animator who
makes one video a month </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> can just make enough to get by. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because if Logan Paul and Jake
Paul didn't make that much </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> then the animator down there
couldn't make that much. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And it's, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> Some of these YouTubers have
way too much fucking money. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But it's a system that
you only see the success </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> and you never, like you said,
you never see the hard work. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like you never see the 40 hours a week </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> I was putting in while
trying to get a degree. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, when we say rise and grind </joey>
<joey> we mean that half as a joke,
like we genuinely mean that. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, we talked
about how we try to have </garnt>
<connor> a less hands on approach now. </connor>
<connor> Like, some of us to varying degrees. </connor>
<connor> - Like any business, you grow
and you delegate the job. </connor>
<garnt> - Like, I don't think there
is literally a YouTuber </garnt>
<garnt> I know that hasn't gone through a period </garnt>
<SPEAKER_01> where all they did was do
YouTube, from morning to night </SPEAKER_01>
<connor> from like waking up to night. </connor>
<connor> Like there was a year I'm
sure for all three of us </connor>
<connor> where this was all we did. </connor>
<connor> And we put in that fucking grind </connor>
<connor> and the hard part was learning
once we were successful </connor>
<connor> how to get out of this grind </connor>
<connor> because it's like unsustainable. </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> But you gotta be prepared
to put the work in there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because it is going to be
really, really hard fucking work </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because you got to compete with everyone. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And every YouTuber I know
has gone through a period </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where they've just wanted
to fucking kill themselves </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> for how much work they've done. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> But that's, that's just the landscape. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause that's how much
people want to succeed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And if you're not prepared
to do that for like a year, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at least, because some
people did in a month. </SPEAKER_02>
<garnt> Like minimum, you got
to do this for a year. </garnt>
<garnt> It doesn't matter what kind
of life situation you're in. </garnt>
<garnt> Whether you're in like fucking uni, </garnt>
<garnt> like who you're working, you've got a job </garnt>
<garnt> YouTube doesn't care, YouTube
doesn't wait for that shit. </garnt>
<connor> - It's unfortunate because,
you know, obviously, </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> likely the more older you get, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the more responsibilities you have, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which means less time for YouTube. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it just, it sucks because
life isn't fucking fair. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And you know, we're really
lucky that we all started </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> at like a perfect time,
which is in university </joey>
<joey> where we could afford
to throw everything else </joey>
<joey> out the window. </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> And I feel bad, cause
sometimes you get emails </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from people who are like,
working fathers and you're like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hey, I really need to do X and X. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> And I'm like, fuck dude. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like, I mean, it's kinda
hard cause you really have </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to put in way more time
than you could ever put in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in your situation. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It sucks because it's not fair. </SPEAKER_06>
<garnt> - Because like for me, when people ask me, </garnt>
<SPEAKER_06> what do I have to do to
like make YouTube my job? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> The first thing I asked
them no matter how many </SPEAKER_06>
<connor> like sub counts they have,
if they were thinking </connor>
<connor> about making this a job,
I'm like are you prepared </connor>
<connor> to take a year out of your life? </connor>
<connor> - To make it work. </connor>
<connor> - To make it work, at least
a year out of your life. </connor>
<connor> If you're prepared to take
a year out of your life </connor>
<connor> to make this work then it's
something I think is feasible </connor>
<connor> with the right work ethic. </connor>
<connor> Because it's not just about work. </connor>
<connor> It's not just about, cause with YouTube </connor>
<joey> you'd not only have to work hard, </joey>
<garnt> you have to work smart as
well too, to stand out. </garnt>
<garnt> - And that's not even a guarantee, right? </garnt>
<garnt> That that one year is
like you have a chance </garnt>
<joey> of becoming successful. </joey>
<garnt> - If we're throwing
pure numbers into this, </garnt>
<garnt> into the algorithm, I
feel like if you have </garnt>
<garnt> over 100,000 subscribers,
you can make this into a job. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, you probably could. </connor>
<connor> Maybe not right at that
point, but you can easily get. </connor>
<connor> - With a good amount of views. </connor>
<joey> With a healthy amount of views. </joey>
<joey> - With a healthy amount of views, </joey>
<joey> like if you've just like, obviously, </joey>
<connor> just reached a hundred
thousand and you have like, </connor>
<connor> - Don't quit your job. </connor>
<connor> - I'm not saying you can quit your job </connor>
<SPEAKER_02> but you do have a chance
to make this a job </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you play your cards right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But like I said, are you
prepared to take a year </SPEAKER_02>
<joey> off your life, maybe? </joey>
<joey> You know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - That's kinda like the crossroads. </garnt>
<garnt> I've seen a lot of people at </garnt>
<connor> - And there's also,
you might see a channel </connor>
<connor> and they might've gotten
like a big burst of numbers </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> but there's maybe something
going on in the channel </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that's quite unhealthy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like, you'd see, like if that
channel is like low views, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> low views, low views, low
views, and one big view. </SPEAKER_06>
<garnt> And that's consistently
what they're getting, </garnt>
<garnt> it's normally a bad sign. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - We can just see a
channel and we can know </garnt>
<garnt> if it's going to be like successful. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because most of the time, if
you reach a hundred thousand </garnt>
<connor> you have some kind of foundation. </connor>
<connor> - You've been doing something right. </connor>
<connor> - You've got a foundation
and it's, this is like, </connor>
<connor> unless you've just had one bang of video </connor>
<joey> and then you've just
reached under a thousand. </joey>
<joey> But like most, like I'm throwing this out. </joey>
<joey> But like most of the cases I know. </joey>
<joey> where someone reaches a
hundred thousand, I knew </joey>
<connor> that they could turn into a job. </connor>
<connor> It was something that
you won't be living well, </connor>
<connor> when you when you start off, like, </connor>
<garnt> - None of us did. </garnt>
<garnt> - none of us were. </garnt>
<connor> - I was worrying about being
kicked out of my house. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So that was fun. </connor>
<garnt> - But if you understand
enough about how to monetize </garnt>
<SPEAKER_06> your work and the internet,
like fucking artists, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> please please learn how
to monetize your work. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> There's so many talented people out there </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where they're not making a single penny </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> because they don't know how
to market their skillsets. </joey>
<SPEAKER_02> Like if you just do a bit of research </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about how to market yourself </SPEAKER_02>
<garnt> and how to monetize your
platform, you can make this a job. </garnt>
<connor> - I truly do think
anyone can be a YouTuber. </connor>
<connor> Like it's not, </connor>
<connor> - I do as well. </connor>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think it just takes
different amounts of time </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> for different people. </SPEAKER_06>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But I think anyone can do it. </joey>
<joey> - Some people it just clicks,
for some people you're really </joey>
<joey> have to grind it out. </joey>
<joey> - At the end of the day, you know? </joey>
<joey> And even if you're working
father with 10 kids </joey>
<joey> I'm sure there is a chance of some path </joey>
<joey> that you could make it work. </joey>
<joey> - You just got to figure it out. </joey>
<garnt> - It's hard, man. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean there's no foolproof
way to make it happen. </garnt>
<garnt> - We're not saying it's easy. </garnt>
<garnt> There's no foolproof way,
but there is, I guess ways </garnt>
<joey> that you can increase your chances. </joey>
<joey> There's a lot of ways. </joey>
<connor> - We can definitely go way more in-depth </connor>
<joey> into this in future podcasts. </joey>
<connor> - I could chat for like four
hours of this shit, but... </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - So we'll probably leave
us for another episode, </connor>
<connor> but in the meantime, guys. </connor>
