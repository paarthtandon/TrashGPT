<connor> (lips smacking) </connor>
<connor> - I hate when you do that. </connor>
<joey> - Why? </joey>
<joey> - It sounds disgusting. </joey>
<joey> (lips smacking) </joey>
<joey> - It's the sound of my thighs when I run. </joey>
<joey> (lips smacking) </joey>
<garnt> - Is this how girls feel when
they hear the word moist? </garnt>
<joey> - No. </joey>
<joey> (lips smacking) </joey>
<connor> - Oh God. </connor>
<garnt> Oh God. It makes me feel dirty. Stop it. </garnt>
<garnt> (relaxed music) </garnt>
<connor> - Welcome to this episode
of the Trash Tastes podcast, </connor>
<connor> where we talk about not anime, </connor>
<connor> but we might talk about
anime today actually so. </connor>
<garnt> - Who knows, who knows, if,
are we feeling spicy today? </garnt>
<connor> - We'll never tell. </connor>
<joey> (hosts laughing) </joey>
<joey> - I might bring up anime </joey>
<connor> and then immediately
tangent from who knows? </connor>
<garnt> - Who knows? Not even
we do, most of the time. </garnt>
<connor> What are we going to talk about? </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<garnt> - This is like a themed episode. </garnt>
<connor> - I did, I did think what I
was going to talk about today </connor>
<connor> because I was the host I was like, </connor>
<garnt> "Connor. You have to think about </garnt>
<garnt> "what we're going to talk about." </garnt>
<garnt> - Go on then.
- Go on then. </garnt>
<garnt> What, what do you want to talk about? </garnt>
<connor> - You know, I will talk about. </connor>
<garnt> - Do you want to introduce us,
by the way? We're the boys. </garnt>
<connor> - No, I'm not introducing you.
They know who you are by now. </connor>
<garnt> We're on episode 49. </garnt>
<joey> They should know who you are, nearly 50. </joey>
<connor> But yeah no, so a few weeks ago </connor>
<connor> I watched the JoJo event. </connor>
<connor> - Of course you did. </connor>
<connor> - Of course I did, where
part six was announced, </connor>
<connor> which was great.
- Yes. </connor>
<connor> - Which is why everyone watched
it because they were like, </connor>
<connor> "Will part six get announced? Who knows?" </connor>
<garnt> - But imagine if they
didn't announce part six </garnt>
<garnt> after all that. </garnt>
<connor> - I think it would have been very sad. </connor>
<connor> I should fully explain
if you're not a JoJo fan, </connor>
<connor> don't worry, do need to explain. </connor>
<connor> Basically there's a
whole event around JoJo. </connor>
<connor> They didn't say </connor>
<connor> they were going to announce
a new anime adaptation, </connor>
<connor> but everyone was like, </connor>
<connor> "They said, it's the biggest
event in JoJo history." </connor>
<connor> So I think they're going to announce it. </connor>
<connor> Otherwise, I don't think
this is the biggest event. </connor>
<garnt> - Do they normally do JoJo events, </garnt>
<connor> just randomly out of the blue? </connor>
<garnt> - I've, I never heard of one. </garnt>
<connor> - This has been planned
for a very long time. </connor>
<joey> apparently actually. </joey>
<joey> A year ago. I think actually. </joey>
<joey> - Have they done one before this? </joey>
<joey> - I feel like they have, but then, then, </joey>
<joey> but then if you go to
YouTube and you type in </joey>
<joey> JoJo live on TV, </joey>
<joey> they just probably constantly
get the voice actors to do </joey>
<joey> kind of what they did in this event. </joey>
<joey> So I guess I'll walk you
guys through the event, </joey>
<joey> basically what happened. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, 'cause I didn't get to watch it. </joey>
<garnt> - I didn't get to watch it
either. I just saw the reaction. </garnt>
<connor> - So, yeah. The reactions
we'll get into that. </connor>
<connor> - Okay.
- It was fun. </connor>
<connor> First of all, the event, we
weren't really told anything. </connor>
<connor> So you didn't know anything
that was happening. </connor>
<joey> All we knew is that
there was a $40 price tag </joey>
<joey> (Connor exhales) </joey>
<joey> to watch the live stream. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, it was pay-per-view. </joey>
<joey> - Pay-per-view. Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, 40 bucks. </connor>
<connor> - Jesus. </connor>
<connor> - Wow. </connor>
<connor> - Which is a, little steep. </connor>
<connor> - Eat your heart out Jake Paul. </connor>
<connor> - And we were, yeah right? </connor>
<connor> YouTube boxing match JoJo event please. </connor>
<connor> But it was yeah, </connor>
<joey> so it was a pay-per-view and
we weren't told anything before </joey>
<joey> we were just told it's going to be </joey>
<joey> the biggest event in
JoJo history add an echo, </joey>
<joey> add a reverb to that. </joey>
<joey> - As if they don't say
that for every event. </joey>
<joey> - You know how they are in Japan. </joey>
<connor> I feel like they hype things
out way beyond belief. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah of course.
- Yeah. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Again, we weren't told anything. </connor>
<connor> So essentially what happened
was is that they did like </connor>
<connor> kind of like a game show kind of thing </connor>
<connor> in the start with some
of the voice actors. </connor>
<joey> So every main character Joseph. </joey>
<joey> If you don't know JoJo,
don't really worry about it. </joey>
<joey> It's not important. </joey>
<joey> Basically the voice
actors, they were like, </joey>
<joey> they quizzed them about the show. </joey>
<connor> It's kind of like meh game show. </connor>
<joey> - It's basic Japanese
TV variety kinda thing. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah yeah. It was
basically like Family Feud </connor>
<joey> but with the JoJo characters </joey>
<garnt> which actually sounds
really good actually. </garnt>
<garnt> I can make that. I want to watch that. </garnt>
<garnt> - How well did you do in the quiz? </garnt>
<connor> - Well I did, I did. We'll
get into this actually </connor>
<connor> - Okay. Okay. Okay. </connor>
<connor> - And then, you know, it was like cool. </connor>
<connor> And the voice actors performed
some of their scenes, </connor>
<connor> which was like the best part, right? </connor>
<connor> You know, they would do, </connor>
<connor> they would all do the most dramatic scene </connor>
<connor> from their respective part of the show, </connor>
<connor> which is really good. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. And then in the
end they announced it </connor>
<connor> and it went over the time. </connor>
<connor> It was supposed to be a two hour event </connor>
<connor> and my God did they talk a lot. </connor>
<connor> They very much, there wasn't
like a, like fast, it was like, </connor>
<connor> let's just talk about the
show. Talk about the scenes. </connor>
<connor> How did the scenes make
you feel? Tell us about it. </connor>
<connor> And yeah it was fine. It was fine. </connor>
<connor> But there's a few things that were </connor>
<connor> noteworthy about the event. </connor>
<connor> First of all, </connor>
<connor> is that the subtitles were
unusable, unreadable. Awful. </connor>
<joey> - Why is that? </joey>
<joey> - So in this, I said
this was a live event. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - But a live event that was pre-broadcast. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Like pre-recorded. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. It was all, yeah
not broadcast. Sorry. </connor>
<connor> Pre-recorded totally, it was. </connor>
<connor> I'm not sure if it was
intentionally going to be </connor>
<joey> - So it's a live playback in a word. </joey>
<connor> - It's a live re, replaying. </connor>
<connor> - They basically just made
a YouTube premiere. Right? </connor>
<connor> I mean that's basically it right? </connor>
<garnt> - It was edited like a
live Japanese TV show. </garnt>
<garnt> Like it was very minimal, </garnt>
<garnt> I guess, minimal in terms of </garnt>
<connor> Japanese editing and stuff on screen. </connor>
<garnt> - Bro, next time we do a
Trash Taste special with that. </garnt>
<connor> We've got to make that
pay-per-view now man. </connor>
<connor> - We do. We should do
pay. What do we do man? </connor>
<connor> We're fucking dumb.
Just giving it for free, </connor>
<joey> what?
- What? </joey>
<joey> - And it's self-funded? </joey>
<connor> - Oh my God. We're
fucking, we're schmucks. </connor>
<joey> - Losing out on our money. </joey>
<connor> - So yeah it was, it was, it was $40. </connor>
<garnt> Which, you know for a live event </garnt>
<connor> it's a bit
- A bit hefty. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean you can buy
a whole season of JoJo </garnt>
<garnt> on DVD for that or something, right? </garnt>
<joey> - You could buy four episodes
of a JoJo on Blu-ray for that. </joey>
<connor> And don't get me wrong.
The event was very good. </connor>
<connor> It was very well-made
but it was just tragic </connor>
<connor> because you know, </connor>
<connor> how many events charge
$40 for you to watch them? </connor>
<joey> - Not a lot. Well I mean, </joey>
<joey> maybe like a concert of
like a mid ranged artists </joey>
<connor> is like $40, right? But. </connor>
<connor> - Online though? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, not online. Like. </joey>
<connor> - Like a, I feel like boxing
events are the only thing. </connor>
<garnt> - I feel like boxing ones
are the only ones that </garnt>
<connor> maybe wrestling? Although, </connor>
<connor> - Right, true. </connor>
<connor> - I'm not like a, I don't watch wrestling, </connor>
<connor> but those are the ones I
think of when it's like, </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah usually it's like, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> if you're paying 40 bucks, </garnt>
<joey> you have to it's, it's an
in-person experience. Right? </joey>
<connor> Most of the time I would like to think. </connor>
<connor> - But with boxing as well,
they do it online as well. </connor>
<connor> And it's always like a fucking 80 bucks. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, I feel like with boxing, </garnt>
<garnt> it's different to a lot of
sporting, other sporting events </garnt>
<connor> because people like you're
building up months and months, </connor>
<connor> to this one moment. </connor>
<connor> Whereas other things like
football or basketball </connor>
<connor> there's like constant matches
throughout a season. Right? </connor>
<connor> But with boxing you have one event </connor>
<joey> that people build up
months to. And that's it. </joey>
<joey> So I can, I can understand
the pay-per-view price </joey>
<joey> or that model kind of
in that kind of sense. </joey>
<joey> - Boxing fans are hardcore as well. </joey>
<connor> - This is where I think like, </connor>
<connor> do I not understand the
Japanese market enough? </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I'm like, is this like
the same level as of like a </connor>
<connor> international boxing event in
Japan, like this JoJo event? </connor>
<connor> Is it like the same level of like, </connor>
<garnt> everyone, everyone's
stopping what they're doing. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well you know JoJo fans are. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. But I wonder, I wonder. </garnt>
<garnt> if this is like, is this </garnt>
<garnt> the price is this high because </garnt>
<joey> they're banking on JoJo fans
being as dedicated as they are, </joey>
<connor> which they are. </connor>
<connor> Or is it that they think </connor>
<connor> it's that big of an event
in general in Japan? </connor>
<garnt> I don't know.
- I mean, I feel like </garnt>
<joey> I'm not used to Japanese
business model period </joey>
<joey> because I feel like it's the only country </joey>
<joey> that can sell Blu-rays for
like hundreds of dollars </joey>
<joey> for like four episodes sometimes. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it's true. </joey>
<garnt> - For a special edition and
people here will still buy it. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. And watching
this live event was fun. </connor>
<joey> 'Cause the live tweets were
quite, quite interesting. </joey>
<joey> People were not very happy. </joey>
<connor> - On the English side. </connor>
<connor> - It was really, yeah. </connor>
<connor> It was really, yeah, on the English side. </connor>
<connor> - It was really interesting seeing how </connor>
<connor> all the negativity got wiped away </connor>
<connor> the moment that like
part six was announced </connor>
<connor> and everyone was like, </connor>
<joey> "Guys, guys. It's worth it. </joey>
<connor> "It was, the event was worth it." </connor>
<joey> - Two hours of shit songs. I sleep. </joey>
<connor> - So yeah essentially
right. The, again, it was, </connor>
<joey> it was pre-recorded so this
could have been subtitled </joey>
<joey> like properly. It's not, you know, </joey>
<joey> you can get budget subtitles
and translations done </joey>
<joey> for this kind of length. </joey>
<joey> Like, you know, we get
subtitles done for the podcast </joey>
<joey> I think, to get the podcast captioned </joey>
<connor> it's like $150 an episode. </connor>
<connor> But if you wanted to translate it, </connor>
<connor> I think it would be into Japanese </connor>
<joey> for like an episode like this, </joey>
<joey> which I think is around
the same length is like </joey>
<joey> maybe like 800 bucks. </joey>
<joey> So it's not, in terms of a big business, </joey>
<joey> 800 bucks for that kind of thing </joey>
<joey> for like low-end translating.
Probably not that much. </joey>
<joey> But instead they decided
for some reason to do </joey>
<joey> auto-generated subtitles. </joey>
<joey> - It's never a good sign. </joey>
<joey> - There was like, there was like, </joey>
<joey> people were just posting
screenshots of the subtitles. </joey>
<connor> It was like, "I'm going to
kill a kid or something." </connor>
<connor> was one of them </connor>
<joey> or something like really
funny out of context. </joey>
<connor> Like it was just really, really bad </connor>
<connor> to the point where it was like, </connor>
<joey> this is unwatchable if you
don't know any Japanese, </joey>
<joey> it's like the subtitles are
so bad. And it was just like, </joey>
<joey> I just wondered why, like,
this is such a good event. </joey>
<connor> Like you have, if you're a JoJo fan, </connor>
<connor> this event was amazing. </connor>
<connor> Like this is the kind of stuff
that if it was on YouTube, </connor>
<connor> it has like 5 million views guaranteed. </connor>
<garnt> - I'm wondering like,
do you think they even </garnt>
<joey> thought about the international
audience or were they </joey>
<joey> just really
- No of course not. </joey>
<joey> - marketing towards the Japanese audience? </joey>
<joey> - I don't think they were. </joey>
<joey> - Cause you like, even me living in Japan. </joey>
<connor> I only heard about it like the day before. </connor>
<connor> And that's because you
fucking posted about it. </connor>
<joey> Like I did not know, like this
wasn't talked about at all </joey>
<garnt> on my timeline, at least. </garnt>
<garnt> So I didn't know about it
until just as it was happening. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - If this was an event right? Where they, </connor>
<connor> it was only really able,
you're only able to pay in yen. </connor>
<joey> You were only able to buy
from a Japanese website. </joey>
<joey> I would. I would be like,
that's a fair argument. </joey>
<joey> You know, you went on
the Japanese website, </joey>
<joey> you went out of your way
to pay in the currency and. </joey>
<joey> - You're expected to listen
to it in Japanese. Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - You knew what you were getting into. </connor>
<connor> For some super fans, if they
don't understand a word, </connor>
<connor> that's fine. </connor>
<connor> But for me it was like, all right. </connor>
<connor> So the premiering, the
sharing like, Singapore, </connor>
<joey> US specifically, they
have a website in English, </joey>
<joey> they're charging you in dollars </joey>
<joey> and they're telling you
that going to be subtitled. </joey>
<joey> Think it's kind of fucked up. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Like again, </connor>
<connor> the event was great. </connor>
<connor> And it's just so sad that they kind of, </connor>
<joey> I feel like they mislead the people a bit. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, well absolutely. </joey>
<joey> I mean, when have automated
subtitles ever worked? </joey>
<joey> - They barely work for captioning. </joey>
<garnt> The language that they're doing. </garnt>
<connor> - They barely work for our own language </connor>
<connor> when we upload it on YouTube, right? </connor>
<connor> There's auto-subtitles. </connor>
<connor> - Like what were they thinking? </connor>
<connor> It's been known to be one
of the hardest languages </connor>
<joey> to translate into English. </joey>
<joey> - Completely different grammatically. </joey>
<joey> - I think in terms of </joey>
<joey> a cost per like, like
per minute of translating </joey>
<connor> Japanese to English is
one of the most expensive. </connor>
<joey> - I'm not surprised by that. </joey>
<connor> - Because it's the hardest.
And then there's not, </connor>
<joey> there's not many people that can do it. </joey>
<joey> - It's grammatically
completely different as well. </joey>
<joey> - Right so then who decided
that this should be like, </joey>
<connor> this is a great idea and we're
going to charge $40 for this. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, I, I would
think for a $40 price, </garnt>
<garnt> you would get like more
professional subtitles. </garnt>
<garnt> - 100% percent. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like, I, cause I guess </garnt>
<garnt> this is the first I'm hearing about this. </garnt>
<joey> But like when I hear live
events, I think, you know, you, </joey>
<joey> you understand there's some
leeway in an actual live event </joey>
<joey> where it's happening right as it's airing. </joey>
<joey> But if it was pre-recorded
then yeah I mean you could've </joey>
<garnt> dumped the subtitles.
- Yeah. there was </garnt>
<connor> nothing about this show
that needed to be live. </connor>
<connor> There is no aspect of it that
required a live audience. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. If it's prerecorded
then like it's not like, </joey>
<connor> it's not like the host can
interact with the chat or </connor>
<joey> anything like that, right? </joey>
<garnt> - So you're telling me you paid $40 </garnt>
<garnt> just to see a part six announcement. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> (hosts laughing) </joey>
<garnt> And I'd do it again connor. </garnt>
<joey> - JoJo fans. </joey>
<connor> - JoJo </connor>
<garnt> - JoJo fans in a nutshell. </garnt>
<garnt> - Pay for something I would have gotten </garnt>
<connor> like five minutes later
anyway but, you know? </connor>
<connor> I don't know. I, you know,
I sat down and I was like, </connor>
<connor> "This isn't worth the $40". </connor>
<connor> Just the subtitles, the subtitles </connor>
<connor> it's just, it's like, you
know, at what point is it like, </connor>
<connor> do I need a refund? You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> Like how bad do the subtitles
have to be where it's like, </connor>
<connor> I can't understand
anything that's being said. </connor>
<joey> - Well, I mean, I think that's
worthy of a refund, right? </joey>
<connor> Like you, you paid for
something that you didn't even </connor>
<connor> really understand. </connor>
<connor> And they didn't even
like give you the chance </connor>
<joey> to try and understand. </joey>
<connor> - It's really unfortunate as well </connor>
<connor> because people were like
dogging on them on Twitter. </connor>
<garnt> And then the JoJo anime account
tweeted out, being like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Hey guys", </garnt>
<connor> because there was a lot of
people streaming it on Twitch </connor>
<connor> and they were like, </connor>
<connor> "Guys, please don't pirate it there". </connor>
<connor> And then there was one, this is like, </connor>
<joey> I feel like as a company, you
should never ever say this. </joey>
<joey> You should never ever say the words, </joey>
<joey> "There is no excuse to
pirate" because I guarantee </joey>
<joey> within 10 seconds, </joey>
<joey> there's going to be 10 people
with 10 semi-decent reasons </joey>
<joey> why they pirated it. So for example, </joey>
<connor> and this is terrible. </connor>
<connor> So the show was only
available in the US, Singapore </connor>
<connor> and I think a few other Asian countries. </connor>
<connor> No Europe, no Europe at all. </connor>
<connor> Right? No, none of the other
American countries, nothing. </connor>
<connor> - Not even, not even Canada. </connor>
<joey> - Not even Canada. </joey>
<joey> So they were like, in
this tweet, they said, </joey>
<joey> "There is no excuse to pirate this thing". </joey>
<connor> And then in brackets they said, </connor>
<connor> "Sorry for the territory limitations". </connor>
<connor> And I'm thinking like, </connor>
<connor> "What is? What?" </connor>
<connor> - Oh no. </connor>
<joey> - So what is it? What is a
European fan supposed to do? </joey>
<joey> - Every European just unanimously is like, </joey>
<connor> - As a European, what am I supposed to do? </connor>
<connor> Tell me what I'm supposed to do. </connor>
<connor> - Just be born better. </connor>
<joey> - Just be born in a
better country. Obviously. </joey>
<garnt> - Obviously, come on. </garnt>
<connor> - Obviously I'm not, I'm
not promoting piracy, </connor>
<connor> but there is a way as a company </connor>
<connor> where that you can word
things or go about it. </connor>
<joey> - Just fly to Asia. </joey>
<joey> So you can watch it from
Asia during a pandemic. </joey>
<garnt> - Just live in Japan. It's easy. </garnt>
<connor> - You like anime. Just live in Japan. </connor>
<connor> - It's just, it's so
frustrating. Cause it feels like, </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, it feels like this. </garnt>
<garnt> - You get shafted. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. I mean, I feel like companies </garnt>
<garnt> should already have a understanding </garnt>
<joey> that like territory limitations.
I like, I, in my opinion, </joey>
<joey> the biggest reason why people pirate. </joey>
<joey> - Absolutely. </joey>
<joey> - It's, it's been like this since </joey>
<garnt> fucking the internet
was invented basically. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. Like lost media. </garnt>
<connor> I firmly believe, you know,
you should be able to, </connor>
<connor> if it's abandonware, or, </connor>
<garnt> or completely lost and there's
no, you know, honestly, </garnt>
<garnt> I think that's okay to pirate. </garnt>
<garnt> I, I don't why would that not be okay? </garnt>
<garnt> No one has a stake in this anymore. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. Like. </connor>
<connor> - It's literally history. </connor>
<connor> - Like isn't like PlayStation or Sony </connor>
<connor> shutting down the PS3, PSP
and PS Vita stores now? </connor>
<connor> So like, you know, even
though, even though like I, </connor>
<connor> you know, I, cause I own, I own a PS Vita. </connor>
<connor> And when I heard that I was like, </connor>
<connor> "Shit. What if there's a game
that I want on the PS Vita, </connor>
<connor> "I don't know what it is now", </connor>
<connor> but like, I'm not going
to be able to obtain it. </connor>
<connor> It's just lost media now. </connor>
<connor> And if you're not going to
make it readily available, </connor>
<connor> then someone's going to
archive this, you know? </connor>
<connor> And I, it's, it's, </connor>
<garnt> it's a, it's a gray area, </garnt>
<garnt> but I feel like there is, you know, there, </garnt>
<garnt> there is a reason why
people do want to pirate </garnt>
<garnt> and do want to like archive this stuff. </garnt>
<joey> You know I mean. </joey>
<joey> - There's definitely a, like,
it's not a matter of like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, there's no excuse to pirate" </joey>
<joey> when it's like, </joey>
<joey> "No, there really is an excuse to pirate" </joey>
<joey> because it's literally the only way </joey>
<joey> I'll ever be able to
get a hand on it. Right? </joey>
<connor> - I mean, it's like, if you, </connor>
<joey> you would get someone who gets
into your product who never </joey>
<joey> would have been able to, </joey>
<joey> and never would have
had a chance to. Right? </joey>
<connor> And again with this
live stream, it's like, </connor>
<connor> why is this live stream
only in some countries? </connor>
<connor> Like, is it because </connor>
<connor> they're perhaps showing
scenes from the anime? </connor>
<connor> Is it probably a license?
Ah, probably is actually. </connor>
<joey> - It's probably a licensing
thing, but still it's like. </joey>
<joey> - It's a live stream, you know? </joey>
<garnt> I mean, it's not like you
can't get it in every country. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, I mean, </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like that kind of
mentality just hasn't adapted to </garnt>
<connor> just how the internet works </connor>
<connor> and just how the community
works now in 2021 </connor>
<connor> or even fucking 2010. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] 'Cause all the laws
are just completely outdated </connor>
<connor> and copyright law is just fucked. </connor>
<connor> - All laws are completely outdated because </connor>
<joey> they are all laws that are made for like </joey>
<joey> television broadcasts and
stuff like that, right? </joey>
<joey> - Especially in Japan. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. Especially in Japan.
It just wasn't designed. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, we don't even
have fair use laws here, </joey>
<connor> which is ridiculous. </connor>
<joey> - Well, I mean, it's. </joey>
<connor> I feel like at least in the
US there is a mentality of, </connor>
<garnt> okay, well </garnt>
<garnt> technically, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> live streaming a game and not
paying the, the, you know, </garnt>
<connor> for a license to do that. </connor>
<connor> It's technically, you
know, legally speaking, </connor>
<connor> you're not allowed to do that. </connor>
<connor> But all the US companies
just kind of agreed, </connor>
<joey> it's beneficial, let them do it. </joey>
<joey> But I feel like that kinda
thing doesn't really happen. </joey>
<connor> There's not a, </connor>
<connor> there's not really a
thing of it's beneficial, </connor>
<connor> so let them do it. </connor>
<connor> You know, it's just another, you know, </connor>
<connor> it's like when you get events like this, </connor>
<connor> you're just reminded that, you know, </connor>
<connor> you're another one of those anime fans </connor>
<garnt> being a westerner that yeah. </garnt>
<connor> They don't care about you. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, I mean, I feel
like the mentality is slowly. </garnt>
<connor> I mean, it took this long for it to change </connor>
<joey> with like Western companies </joey>
<joey> so God knows how long it's going to change </joey>
<garnt> with Japanese companies. </garnt>
<joey> - It is changing at a fucking
snail's pace, that's for sure. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, I like, I would say </joey>
<garnt> at least Japanese companies
know that we exist now. </garnt>
<garnt> That's, that's, that's the
biggest difference, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Because imagine like five
years ago where they had </garnt>
<garnt> a American or they had like
an English site to promote </garnt>
<garnt> a Japanese live stream. </garnt>
<garnt> You know we, we are
taking very small steps. </garnt>
<joey> - We've gone from snail
mail to dial up email. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's been it's, </connor>
<connor> it's interesting because
it's almost similar to how </connor>
<connor> Japanese games are brought
over here. Right, like. </connor>
<connor> Here? I'm in Japan. </connor>
<joey> - To the west. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah Japanese games
were brought to the west, </joey>
<connor> but I feel like the, </connor>
<connor> the whole way the gaming
industry has gone. It's like, </connor>
<connor> it's like decades ahead
of where the anime is at. </connor>
<connor> And I wonder if that's because </connor>
<connor> they kind of grew at the same time, </connor>
<connor> like the culture of gaming
in America was its own thing. </connor>
<connor> And the culture of gaming
in Japan was its own thing. </connor>
<connor> And they kind of grew together
benefiting each other, </connor>
<joey> like they send games to each other. </joey>
<joey> And I wonder if that's, </joey>
<joey> if that's the reason why that
industry went so fast and why </joey>
<connor> sometimes people can't even
tell if a game is from Japan. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. I think it's
also because like, yeah, </joey>
<joey> like American games now, </joey>
<joey> like now they're making games
in America and in Europe. </joey>
<connor> Whereas like, </connor>
<connor> I feel the anime industry
won't do that until we get </connor>
<connor> dedicated people who are
making it in America, </connor>
<connor> making it in Europe. </connor>
<joey> - 'Cause. I, I guess when maybe </joey>
<joey> when the Japanese businessman in like the </joey>
<joey> eighties or nineties
were making video games, </joey>
<joey> they were like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh yeah, there's tons of
gaming in the US. Let's go </joey>
<joey> "Send our products over there". </joey>
<garnt> Whereas it's like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh, there's no anime there. Let's not, </garnt>
<garnt> "Let's not bother doing anything". </garnt>
<garnt> - I would also say that
from my perspective, </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like the anime
industry has always been like, </garnt>
<connor> in my opinion like, </connor>
<connor> kind of like 10 years or so
behind the gaming industry. </connor>
<connor> - I feel like 20 sometimes now. </connor>
<connor> - 10 to 20 years in terms
of the popularity and how, </connor>
<connor> you know, how, how big the industry is. </connor>
<connor> - Right, right. </connor>
<connor> - Because I like, gaming
right now is probably the most </connor>
<connor> mainstream medium, entertainment medium </connor>
<connor> there is now, right? </connor>
<connor> - Gamers? Sorry. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, I mean. </connor>
<connor> - Rise up. </connor>
<connor> - Gaming makes more
than movies now, right? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - So gaming right now. </garnt>
<connor> - Well 'cause you can't
put microtransactions </connor>
<connor> in a fucking movie. </connor>
<connor> (connor laughs) </connor>
<connor> - That's true. That's true. </connor>
<joey> - You can't roll for your gacha
in the middle of "Parasite", </joey>
<joey> you know what I mean? </joey>
<connor> - Would you like to watch
the rest of this movie? </connor>
<garnt> $5 please. </garnt>
<garnt> - But like, I would say
like within our lifetime, </garnt>
<joey> we've seen gaming. We've
seen gamers rise up </joey>
<joey> (hosts laughing) </joey>
<joey> to become, the most biggest </joey>
<connor> entertainment medium in
the world now, right? </connor>
<joey> - When are weebs gonna rise up man? </joey>
<joey> - It used to be used to be movies. </joey>
<joey> Now do I think anime is going
to become as big as gaming? </joey>
<joey> No, but I would say that anime right now </joey>
<joey> is also rising up. Weebs rise up. </joey>
<joey> - It's on its way. It's on its way. </joey>
<garnt> - It's on its way. It's
getting more popular. </garnt>
<connor> - But then isn't it weird though, </connor>
<connor> that I feel like all the money </connor>
<garnt> the weebs have is being
siphoned off in anime games. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. That is true. </connor>
<connor> - I bet </connor>
<connor> - Anime games and Vtubers. </connor>
<connor> - I bet, I bet weebs spend
way more on anime games </connor>
<garnt> than they do on anime merch and anime. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, 100%. </garnt>
<garnt> - 100%
- 100% </garnt>
<connor> - So all the weeb stuff.
All the weeb money, </connor>
<connor> there're just going in the fucking games. </connor>
<joey> - It's going to the gaming industry. </joey>
<connor> - It's going to the gaming industry. </connor>
<garnt> (hosts laughing) </garnt>
<connor> It all comes back to the
games. I mean, I feel like, </connor>
<connor> probably if, if, if you, </connor>
<connor> if you interviewed like the
average anime fan, like not, </connor>
<connor> not, not the average anime fan, </connor>
<connor> the average weeb I would say, </connor>
<garnt> the average person in the weeb culture. </garnt>
<garnt> They probably spend
more money on like games </garnt>
<garnt> or like VTubers than they
do on an actual like anime. </garnt>
<joey> - Like a figurine or a manga
or something like that. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. No, absolutely. 100%. </joey>
<garnt> - It's, it's weird how that, </garnt>
<garnt> that's just the way
weebs work, but that's, </garnt>
<garnt> that's what I felt. </garnt>
<garnt> That's what I feel weebs put
most of their money into. </garnt>
<garnt> Maybe like, maybe in 2020, </garnt>
<garnt> maybe it's because there haven't
been like anime conventions </garnt>
<connor> or things, other things they can buy. </connor>
<connor> But I would say that
the more I watch anime, </connor>
<connor> the less I buy like figurines
and stuff like that, you know? </connor>
<connor> Did you, do you feel like, I mean, </connor>
<connor> you're a hardcore JoJo fan, right? </connor>
<joey> So you, you, you put a lot of
your money into JoJo merch. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah invest in JoJo stock. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, but now, but now, </connor>
<connor> you look for like the most
exclusive stuff, right? </connor>
<garnt> You don't just buy like
the cheap casual thing. </garnt>
<connor> - No I don't, if the figure
is under like 50 bucks, </connor>
<garnt> I'm like, "I'm not interested". </garnt>
<joey> I'm like that's peasant
stuff, get that out of here. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause those figures are also cheap. </joey>
<joey> And also when you realize </joey>
<joey> that you start collecting
a lot of figures, </joey>
<joey> the one thing that becomes
more valuable than the figures </joey>
<joey> is the room they take up. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - So then you're like, </connor>
<connor> "All right now I have to decide </connor>
<connor> "which figures are worthy of the display". </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. So I'm like slowly
starting to do that too with like </joey>
<joey> exclusively paintings or
like limited merch items </joey>
<joey> and stuff like that. </joey>
<joey> - I'm sure that sounds so fucking uh. </joey>
<joey> - It sounds so fucking. </joey>
<joey> - I'm so wealthy. </joey>
<joey> - Yes, I'm an art collector. </joey>
<connor> - But it's like, you know, </connor>
<connor> when you do you, when you
do start collecting figures </connor>
<connor> and you start getting a lot you're like, </connor>
<connor> "You know this $5 Goku figure, you know, </connor>
<connor> I kinda can't argue, </connor>
<connor> it deserves the same spot as
his $200 hand sculpted Rem </connor>
<connor> fucking like DNA
engraved, you know, thing. </connor>
<garnt> - Like not, not even figurines
though, but like every, </garnt>
<garnt> anytime I go to an anime
convention or stuff like that, </garnt>
<garnt> I'd much rather buy shit
from the Artist Alley </garnt>
<connor> and things that independent
artists are doing. Because, </connor>
<connor> most of the time they make cooler stuff </connor>
<connor> than the official
figures most of the time. </connor>
<connor> Or the official
merchandise, it's just like, </connor>
<connor> I don't understand people
who go to anime conventions </connor>
<joey> and they buy buttons. </joey>
<joey> To me, buttons, buttons are
the stickers for me, right? </joey>
<joey> - Like the metallic
ones right? Right yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I hate buttons man. </joey>
<joey> - Japan is fucking obsessed with those. </joey>
<joey> - I know. I know. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Why? </joey>
<joey> - Whenever I go to like
a pop-up shop for like, </joey>
<joey> you, you hear, you hear
an announcement where, </joey>
<joey> oh, there's a pop-up shop
for like X anime series </joey>
<joey> or Y anime series. </joey>
<joey> And I remember the first
few times I thought, </joey>
<garnt> "Wow, cool. They got
exclusive merch there". </garnt>
<garnt> And it's like, 90% of
them are just buttons. </garnt>
<garnt> And to me, like buttons
are the merch you buy </garnt>
<garnt> when you don't, when you can't commit </garnt>
<garnt> to buying an actual merchandise. </garnt>
<joey> (hosts laughing) </joey>
<joey> That's what buttons are to me. </joey>
<joey> - It's when you have that
chump change in your pocket </joey>
<joey> and go, "I can pay for this yeah". </joey>
<joey> - Yeah it's like the
equivalent of, you know, </joey>
<connor> when you go abroad and you're like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, I guess I gotta
buy a souvenir, right?" </connor>
<connor> You go to Paris and
you go and you go like, </connor>
<connor> "Ah, I guess I gotta buy like a </connor>
<garnt> "fucking Eiffel Tower key ring." </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. It's literally the
equivalent of like, I was here. </joey>
<joey> It's like I was at that pop-up store, </joey>
<joey> here is physical proof that
I was at that pop-up store, </joey>
<joey> a 500 yen shitty like
can, like tin can thing. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But then they gatchafy it </joey>
<joey> so you can't even buy the one you want. </joey>
<joey> You have to buy like 500 fucking buttons </joey>
<connor> until you get the one you want. </connor>
<joey> - There are people though
that I see that have, </joey>
<connor> you know like. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, the whole bags. </connor>
<connor> - Their entire bag or their entire like, </connor>
<connor> denim jacket or whatever. </connor>
<joey> It's just like covered
in them. And they just, </joey>
<joey> they sound like a fucking festival. </joey>
<connor> - Why would you put a bunch
of barnacles on your clothes </connor>
<joey> as far as I'm concerned, right? </joey>
<connor> That's what, that's what it looks like. </connor>
<connor> It looks like it looks ugly. </connor>
<connor> (hosts laughing) </connor>
<garnt> It's ugly, and I won't stand for it. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. No, people like it
man, I don't know what to say. </joey>
<joey> - One thing, one thing
about the JoJo event though, </joey>
<joey> that I wish that </joey>
<joey> I wish that anime did have
more of these kinds of events. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I will say like one thing that </joey>
<garnt> always makes me jealous as an anime fan </garnt>
<garnt> from watching, you know,
the gaming community, </garnt>
<garnt> is that having this live event where </garnt>
<garnt> they have like a load of things
announced at once, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Like I've always been. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh you want an E3 of anime? </connor>
<connor> - I kind of do. </connor>
<connor> (Connor laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - I would love the presentations. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like honestly. </garnt>
<garnt> - Check this out. </garnt>
<garnt> - Honestly, half the fun of
E3 is just feeling like it's, </garnt>
<connor> it's just like what feeling
like you're part of a community </connor>
<connor> and just watching it and
just reacting to it, right? </connor>
<connor> 'Cause like, 'cause like to me, </connor>
<connor> like the closest thing anime has </connor>
<connor> is like the Anime Awards, right? </connor>
<connor> But we don't really have any like, what? </connor>
<connor> (Connor laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - Just the mental image right? </garnt>
<connor> - Just the thought of just
of some guy coming up like, </connor>
<connor> "Guys I'm proud to announce,
"Incest the Anime". </connor>
<connor> "Me, me and the team at Incest Anime </connor>
<connor> "have worked really hard", like </connor>
<joey> - This time, this time in 8K. </joey>
<joey> - Most anime I do not want to know </joey>
<connor> the thought process as
to why this came to be. </connor>
<connor> And I do not want to, </connor>
<connor> - Do you want, do you want? </connor>
<connor> - I do not want some 50
year old man telling me </connor>
<connor> why he thinks this 12 year old girl </connor>
<connor> should fuck this 20 year old man, </connor>
<connor> I don't want that. </connor>
<connor> I don't want to see a
presentation of that. </connor>
<connor> That is the last thing I want. And I also. </connor>
<connor> (hosts laughing) </connor>
<connor> - We hear you. Guys, we hear you. </connor>
<connor> You guys want more sister-fucking right? </connor>
<connor> - Last time we heard that the plot </connor>
<connor> got in the way of the incest. </connor>
<connor> So we decided to just go to Bang Bros. </connor>
<connor> - We upgraded that. </connor>
<garnt> - Guys, we hear you. </garnt>
<garnt> You want another isekai. </garnt>
<connor> - I just imagined it like, check this out. </connor>
<connor> The fucking PornHub,
the fucking thing plays. </connor>
<connor> (Connor mimics PornHub's beat) </connor>
<garnt> (hosts laughing) </garnt>
<joey> Oh my gosh. </joey>
<joey> - But do you like care </joey>
<joey> about most of the games
that get announced, </joey>
<joey> - No. </joey>
<joey> - Like you know, </joey>
<garnt> you wait for that one JoJo
part six announcement, </garnt>
<garnt> you wait for. I don't
know what, what else? </garnt>
<connor> - I think that we should
get more live events </connor>
<connor> to announce anime just
for the hype factor. </connor>
<garnt> Like it makes sense. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no, no. That's what I miss. I want, </garnt>
<garnt> I like the hype factor </garnt>
<garnt> in that the gaming
community have, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> it's, I, I feel like it's, </garnt>
<garnt> it adds to this community
aspect and it adds to the fun. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, Japan kind of has that already. </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] Do they? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah on Niconico, they have
this event called SUZUKIMI, </connor>
<connor> which I did the English
version of at AX last time. </connor>
<connor> But yeah, it's, </connor>
<joey> it's literally like a live
event where they get a bunch of </joey>
<joey> like voice actors and hosts </joey>
<joey> to announce the next season of anime. </joey>
<connor> - Maybe they should subtitle this. </connor>
<joey> (hosts laughing) </joey>
<connor> Maybe you could subtitle it. </connor>
<garnt> - Like imagine how hype it
would be when you like you hear </garnt>
<connor> like a "Chainsaw Man" adaptation is </connor>
<connor> instead of seeing it on Twitter, right? </connor>
<joey> You have this event where you're like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, it's fucking", you
know, it's the next. </joey>
<joey> - The teaser trailer. Right. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah yeah the teaser
trailer where you're like, </joey>
<joey> Oh, is this "Chainsaw Man"? </joey>
<connor> Is this like, "Jujutsu Kaisen" </connor>
<garnt> before they just got
animated. You know like. </garnt>
<connor> - Like they just play like
scenes of the anime like, </connor>
<joey> "YEAAH!" </joey>
<joey> - "YOOO!" </joey>
<garnt> - There are some manga series
I know people are waiting for </garnt>
<joey> like imagine like one day </joey>
<joey> "Vagabond" gets announced
or some shit like that. </joey>
<joey> I would, I'd lose my shit, you know, </joey>
<joey> I think it would be cool if
anime had this kind of event </joey>
<garnt> where we just announced a
bunch of new anime getting, </garnt>
<garnt> getting adapted. </garnt>
<garnt> - Why, we should do that. </garnt>
<joey> (hosts laughing) </joey>
<joey> Honestly, like we're saying this idea. </joey>
<joey> I'm just like, no one's going to do it. </joey>
<connor> - Anime companies reach out to us. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah please we'll do it. </joey>
<joey> - It's just feels hard
being an anime fan you know? </joey>
<connor> Fuck we just, we spend, we
spend a fuckton of money. </connor>
<connor> We get, we get beat down on, you know. </connor>
<connor> Fuck man, it's hard when
you're not Japanese. </connor>

<connor> So I needed to go through
a pizza supplier directly </connor>
<connor> and I saved 10 bucks on a $45 meal. </connor>

<connor> Back to the episode. </connor>
<garnt> - It's like people watching
award shows, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Because, okay, here's the thing. </garnt>
<garnt> Nobody actually watches
an award show to like, </garnt>
<joey> see who wins or to like
congratulate the winners. </joey>
<joey> We watch it to get salty </joey>
<joey> and to feel like we're
part of a conversation. </joey>
<joey> - Like a sporting event? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. Yeah it is kinda
like a sporting event for </joey>
<joey> like entertainment, right? </joey>
<joey> I mean, that's, that's why
people watch, you know, </joey>
<joey> the Anime Awards, </joey>
<garnt> the Gaming Awards and also
like the Oscars as well, </garnt>
<garnt> which apparently just aired yesterday. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> Nobody watched. </garnt>
<garnt> - At the time of recording. </garnt>
<garnt> - At the time of recording. </garnt>
<connor> - I didn't know it aired
until the day after </connor>
<connor> I was like, "Dude the Oscars aired?" </connor>
<joey> No one said anything. </joey>
<connor> - I only knew about it because </connor>
<joey> I saw a tweet of some guy who like </joey>
<joey> put down a list of the past 10
years worth of like viewers. </joey>
<joey> And apparently it was like
the lowest in, I think ever. </joey>
<connor> - I think it had halved in one year, </connor>
<joey> but that's also because
we didn't really have any </joey>
<garnt> big theatrical releases this year. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean we really didn't
really have any movies in 2020. </garnt>
<joey> - Most movies went to HBO
Max or Netflix or whatever. </joey>
<joey> And also I feel that I didn't
realize now until this year. </joey>
<connor> Oh my God, all those ads
that these movies pay for </connor>
<connor> and all the, like the
promotional tools and whatnot </connor>
<connor> really do work. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I don't know anything about movies </connor>
<garnt> unless they're doing these
like promotional tours. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. Yeah, same here. </garnt>
<connor> - Like I haven't heard, </connor>
<garnt> I haven't heard of like
a single really big movie </garnt>
<garnt> that came out in 2020, obviously because. </garnt>
<connor> - I only know about the Snyder cut </connor>
<connor> because that was like a meme
because it was four hours long. </connor>
<garnt> - The Snyder cut was probably the biggest </garnt>
<connor> kind of movie. </connor>
<connor> - That was a re-release. </connor>
<joey> - I think the only movie
I watched last year, </joey>
<connor> not even in cinemas, </connor>
<garnt> but like afterwards was "Tenet". </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yeah I watched "Tenet" in theaters. </garnt>
<connor> That's really good. </connor>
<garnt> - I didn't even watch that. </garnt>
<connor> - So fucking good. </connor>
<connor> - I know. I heard so many people saying, </connor>
<joey> "Yeah, it was great". </joey>
<garnt> - It's the most Nolan
movie you can ever imagine. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Yeah, yeah. It's very much. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm okay with that. </garnt>
<joey> - It's almost as if "South
Park" wrote a parody </joey>
<garnt> of a Christopher Nolan
film and then they made it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like, do you know what the
main character is called? </garnt>
<garnt> - Ah, tell me. </garnt>
<joey> - He's called the Protagonist. </joey>
<joey> - No. Yeah. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I shit you not, the main character </joey>
<joey> is just called the Protagonist. </joey>
<garnt> He doesn't have a name.
He's called the Protagonist, </garnt>
<garnt> like a fucking Nishio Ishin hole. </garnt>
<connor> - Dude, the fucking, </connor>
<connor> even if the story is kind of dumb, </connor>
<connor> like the visuals in that
movie are so fucking cool. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Oh yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's so good. And also Robert
Patterson, I fucking love, </connor>
<garnt> I think he's an amazing actor. </garnt>
<connor> I will watch anything's he's in. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah, he's fucking great. </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause I feel like watching
"Tenet" and I was just like, </garnt>
<garnt> Nolan's obviously just
given up on the script. </garnt>
<garnt> He just has a lot of
cool ideas for visuals </garnt>
<garnt> and the visuals were fucking cool, </garnt>
<garnt> but I pay attention to the plot </garnt>
<garnt> and the character for a
second. And I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "What the fuck is going
on right now?", you know? </garnt>
<connor> - Watching it in the movies
was like so exhausting. </connor>
<connor> It was literally that
I was posing like this. </connor>
<connor> So it's backwards in time. Okay. </connor>
<joey> It's pretty good. It's pretty good. </joey>
<garnt> It's fun. It was one of those movies </garnt>
<connor> that I couldn't imagine watching at home. </connor>
<garnt> I feel like the big screen helped. </garnt>
<connor> - I watched it at home. </connor>
<connor> - Bro. </connor>
<connor> - It took me like, it took me, </connor>
<garnt> it took me two times to
watch because the first time </garnt>
<garnt> I just got really, really
bored in the first half. </garnt>
<joey> - What? </joey>
<joey> - In the first half. Right? </joey>
<joey> Because the first half is all plot. Right? </joey>
<joey> - They had us in the first half. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause like, I was like, </joey>
<joey> I'm not following what's going on. </joey>
<connor> I really don't care about. </connor>
<connor> - I'm like, I sleep until
Robert Patterson comes on </connor>
<garnt> and like, I'm paying attention.
All right, what's up? </garnt>
<joey> He's so good. I love him in everything. </joey>
<joey> - He's a fantastic guy. </joey>
<joey> - He's so fucking good. Have
you watched "The Lighthouse"? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. I've seen that. </joey>
<joey> - I love "The Lighthouse". </joey>
<joey> - What's "The Lighthouse"? </joey>
<joey> - It's a movie with him and </joey>
<connor> who's the guy played Jesus Christ? </connor>
<joey> Um fuck, what is his name? I, </joey>
<joey> - William DaFoe. </joey>
<joey> - Ryuk. Who can forget
his famous reel of Ryuk </joey>
<joey> in "Death Note" live-action. </joey>
<joey> - The famous four lines
he said in that movie. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah William DaFoe is
a fucking amazing actor </joey>
<joey> and they're both in it and
they're both going crazy. </joey>
<joey> It's fucking amazing. I won't
spoil it. Go and watch it. </joey>
<garnt> It's kind of an artsy
film, but it's really good. </garnt>
<garnt> It's really, really good.
You should watch it. </garnt>
<connor> How many films do you watch? </connor>
<joey> Not many. Maybe, </joey>
<joey> - You probably go to the cinemas though </joey>
<joey> the most out of all of us though, right? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. But I don't care
what I watched at the movies. </connor>
<connor> I'm just like. </connor>
<connor> - How do you not care
about what you watch? </connor>
<joey> - It is a stimulus in my eyes. </joey>
<connor> - Well, we'll come back to the Oscars. </connor>
<joey> We'll talk about that. But yeah. Okay. </joey>
<connor> Because I enjoy just the
experience of the theater. </connor>
<garnt> I like the, I like the popcorn. </garnt>
<connor> I like the fact that I can,
so I can ignore my phone. </connor>
<garnt> - So how often did you
watch films at home? </garnt>
<joey> - Ohh. Never. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, because you're mostly just like </joey>
<joey> a Netflix
- Netflix, </joey>
<garnt> - Kinda guy. Because I'm like,
I'm the complete opposite. </garnt>
<connor> I only go to the cinemas if I know </connor>
<connor> there's a banger film I need to watch. </connor>
<connor> If not I'm just like, I
just watch it at home. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Pre, pre-Rona. </garnt>
<garnt> I was going like maybe once a week, </garnt>
<garnt> maybe once every two weeks, </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Damn. </garnt>
<garnt> - because it was just like, </garnt>
<connor> there's always something on and
they would always do reruns. </connor>
<connor> So I, I watched in Japan, </connor>
<connor> I watched "The Shawshank Redemption". </connor>
<connor> - In cinemas? </connor>
<connor> - In cinemas. </connor>
<connor> Isn't that weird? </connor>
<connor> - Why don't we just
not watch that at home? </connor>
<connor> - I just, why not? </connor>
<connor> I never got to watch it at the big screen. </connor>
<connor> Let's go and have a look.
The best film of all time </connor>
<connor> according to IMDB. </connor>
<connor> Why would I not want to
experience it on the big screen? </connor>
<connor> - I mean it's a great
film. Don't get me wrong. </connor>
<connor> - It's a fantastic film. </connor>
<connor> - But you can also watch it. </connor>
<connor> - I also don't feel bad if
I want to go and get more, </connor>
<connor> you know, drinks and popcorn. </connor>
<connor> I've already seen it like
10 times. Yeah, you know. </connor>
<connor> - So what you're saying is
you just want the popcorn. </connor>
<joey> - I really, okay. </joey>
<connor> - You wanna eat popcorn in a big room. </connor>
<garnt> - Can you not, can you
not eat popcorn at home? </garnt>
<connor> - No, not really. </connor>
<garnt> I legitimately don't go to the movies, </garnt>
<garnt> the theater now because </garnt>
<garnt> they don't sell popcorn in
the 'Rona. I don't want to go. </garnt>
<connor> - Not because there's a
pandemic. Just no popcorn. </connor>
<connor> - Well they're not selling
that because of the pandemic. </connor>
<connor> But if they let's say the
pandemic was still on, </connor>
<connor> I would very much socially distance. </connor>
<joey> - You can sneak some fucking popcorn in. </joey>
<connor> - I don't want to bring my popcorn. </connor>
<connor> I want their popcorn. </connor>
<connor> - You want the overpriced
popcorn, fucking popcorn. </connor>
<connor> - Actually, it's reasonably
priced in Japan at least. </connor>
<connor> I do not want to go. </connor>
<connor> I'm sure there's someone
out there who agrees. </connor>
<connor> I do not want to go to the fucking cinema </connor>
<connor> if I'm not getting popcorn, </connor>
<connor> it's not it's I just don't want it. </connor>
<joey> - I don't think I've ever
bought popcorn in the cinemas. </joey>
<joey> - I'll literally, legitimately
go to a restaurant before, </joey>
<joey> I'll be full as fuck. I'll be
like gagging at how full I am. </joey>
<joey> And I'll be like, "One
large popcorn please." </joey>
<connor> - I don't know what's going on. Ooooh. </connor>
<garnt> - I'll literally be dying. I do not care. </garnt>
<connor> I have to get popcorn. </connor>
<garnt> - What I don't understand, is some people </garnt>
<garnt> like some of, some of my
friends who, you know, we, </garnt>
<garnt> we go to the movies or
we'll go to the cinema </garnt>
<joey> and it's at this awkward time </joey>
<joey> of like 1:00 or 1:30. You know? </joey>
<joey> - I'm getting popcorn. </joey>
<joey> - And it's just like,
do you eat lunch before? </joey>
<joey> Or do you not eat lunch before? </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Before, before. </joey>
<garnt> - And some people were just
like, the popcorn is my lunch. </garnt>
<joey> I'm just like, how the
fuck is popcorn lunch? </joey>
<connor> - Popcorn is not anything. </connor>
<connor> I'm pretty sure you can't
even live off popcorn now. </connor>
<joey> - It's not, it's not a meal. </joey>
<joey> - No. Pretty sure it's negative calories. </joey>
<joey> Am I right? Right. </joey>
<connor> It feels like it. </connor>
<garnt> - When you kind of just eating, air right? </garnt>
<connor> - One time in Japan, </connor>
<connor> I spilled my popcorn over the floor and </connor>
<connor> I think that ruined
the whole movie for me. </connor>
<connor> I think that legitimately made my whole </connor>
<connor> - So did you spill it during the movie or? </connor>
<connor> - What was the movie
that you were watching? </connor>
<garnt> - Before it started. I don't even know. </garnt>
<garnt> I can't remember I was just so, </garnt>
<garnt> I was literally distraught </garnt>
<joey> for the first 40 minutes of the film. </joey>
<joey> I was actually just so sad. </joey>
<joey> - Well don't buy popcorn. </joey>
<joey> - I was genuinely when
it, when it fell over, </joey>
<joey> you know when you're so sad
about something bad happening. </joey>
<connor> - [connor] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You just sit there for like 10 seconds </connor>
<connor> and just let it soak about
how sad you are, you're like. </connor>
<connor> - All around me are. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, Like you know when you break, </connor>
<connor> like you drop your phone and
it smashes you'll go like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh my God". You're like, </connor>
<connor> (Connor exhaling) </connor>
<joey> - You kinda just stare at it, right? </joey>
<connor> You don't even go to
pick it up immediately. </connor>
<joey> - You're just so overwhelmed
with emotions and sadness </joey>
<joey> that you just stand there. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah no, I get that. </joey>
<connor> - And like I had that moment. </connor>
<joey> - I get that feeling, but
not when I drop popcorn. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, I get it. </garnt>
<joey> It's, it's whenever I drop any kind of </joey>
<garnt> food item or drink item I've just bought. </garnt>
<connor> - There's something, I've
broken my phone before, </connor>
<connor> I've broken expensive items. </connor>
<connor> And there's something
that just hurts so much </connor>
<connor> about dropping food or drink on the floor. </connor>
<connor> It can't be matched.
- There's nothing, </connor>
<connor> there's nothing that hurts me more </connor>
<joey> than buying a fresh pint and then like. </joey>
<joey> And then just like immediately dropping it </joey>
<garnt> or like upon it just falling off the tray </garnt>
<garnt> as you're taking it to the table, </garnt>
<connor> - I think I'd rather
drop my first born child </connor>
<connor> than my popcorn. If I'm
completely honest with you. </connor>
<connor> - Mainly 'cause I have Meilyne laughing. </connor>
<connor> - At least you can pick it back up. </connor>
<connor> - You know, the baby can
take a hit, you know. </connor>
<connor> I'm pretty sure I took a many hits. </connor>
<connor> My popcorn doesn't take a
hit. I can't eat that shit. </connor>
<connor> Right now especially if you pick that up, </connor>
<connor> everyone will look at you. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<joey> - As much as I would want to pick up, </joey>
<joey> you know a part of me is like, </joey>
<connor> is the top layer of the popcorn </connor>
<connor> on the floor okay at least? </connor>
<connor> Can I at least scoop some of it back in? </connor>
<connor> - At least it's not directly touching it. </connor>
<connor> - It's like how much of
this popcorn has fallen out. </connor>
<connor> - I'm not gonna lie, </connor>
<connor> I want to say that I'm
hygienic. But if I see if, if. </connor>
<connor> - [Meilyne] You're not! </connor>
<connor> - Shut the fuck up. If like, let's say. </connor>
<connor> a bunch of nachos fell on the floor, </connor>
<connor> I would be tempted to just be like. </connor>
<connor> - No, not nachos. </connor>
<garnt> Nachos is where I draw the line man. </garnt>
<garnt> I would be tempted to be like, </garnt>
<garnt> I would be tempted to be
like, the bottom layer </garnt>
<connor> is cushioned.
- Scrape off the top. </connor>
<connor> - Is cushioned. Is cushioned.
I will grab the top left. </connor>
<connor> And I would eat that. </connor>
<connor> - No, ugh. </connor>
<connor> And I would eat that. </connor>
<garnt> - Like popcorn comes in pieces, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Because popcorn, you can
scrape off the top layer. </garnt>
<connor> So you could scrape off the layer. </connor>
<connor> - So you can get the bucket
that you have with it. </connor>
<connor> I would put, maybe I would like kind of </connor>
<connor> shuffle some of the top ones back in. </connor>
<connor> If they were, if they were in. </connor>
<joey> - Thought you floated up slightly so. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, tilt it 40 degree angle </joey>
<joey> and see what I can like scoop
back in from the top layer. </joey>
<joey> Nachos for me, it's a little too wet. </joey>
<joey> - Nachos is way too wet. </joey>
<connor> - It's like chili, I
spilled chili on the floor. </connor>
<connor> Start grabbing. </connor>
<connor> - Scrape the top layer. </connor>
<connor> (hosts laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Like french fries right? </connor>
<connor> Let's say all the french
fries fell on the floor. </connor>
<garnt> A part of me would be tempted to be like, </garnt>
<connor> you know, the top 40% of these
french fries. Perfectly fine. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. No, no. Of course. </garnt>
<connor> - Imma start grabbing them. </connor>
<connor> - Okay 'cause one, okay
so there are two factors. </connor>
<connor> - I'm gonna sound so vile to some people. </connor>
<connor> - No, I'm the same. I'm the same. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, there are two
factors you need to consider. </connor>
<joey> One, what is the ground?
Is it like a clean? </joey>
<connor> - What is the ground? </connor>
<connor> - No no, because if it's like </connor>
<connor> - Carpet.
- Clean carpet </connor>
<joey> - Carpet is the worst. </joey>
<joey> - Carpet is the worst because
you've got like all shit </joey>
<joey> and like, you got all the dust and shit. </joey>
<joey> If you drop it on the street
floor, that's just like, </joey>
<joey> - Game over. </joey>
<connor> - Rest in peace. </connor>
<joey> - That is game over. You have
to say goodbye right there. </joey>
<joey> - Wood laminate flooring? Okay. </joey>
<connor> - Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Maybe. </connor>
<connor> - Maybe we can salvage most of this. </connor>
<connor> - Secondly you need to consider, </connor>
<connor> what is the food item that
you've just dropped? Right? </connor>
<joey> Is, is it liquid? </joey>
<joey> You know how, how, how
viscous is this food item? </joey>
<joey> - You need to get a straw. </joey>
<joey> - Like, like popcorn. It
comes in little pieces. </joey>
<joey> You can just, you can just like </joey>
<joey> scoop off the bottom layer </joey>
<connor> and just leave that on the
floor and just like it's, </connor>
<connor> it's like the safety layer </connor>
<connor> you have like the bottom layer </connor>
<connor> and then the safety layer, </connor>
<connor> just in case any of
anything on the second layer </connor>
<joey> touch the floor. </joey>
<connor> - In case the germs have
like made its way up. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Once you drop a
chocolate bar on the floor, </garnt>
<connor> do you just like pick
it up and scrape it off </connor>
<connor> all the dirt? </connor>
<garnt> - Chocolate bar. </garnt>
<joey> - I'd do that. </joey>
<garnt> - Chocolate bar. Honestly
it depends like it's, </garnt>
<joey> - Get a rinse. </joey>
<joey> - it's a solid piece of food. Right? </joey>
<garnt> So it depends on the
floor that its touched. </garnt>
<joey> - I treat it like an NES
cartridge. I just kinda blow on it. </joey>
<joey> Just blow off the dust. It's like, yeah, </joey>
<joey> it's good enough. </joey>
<joey> (hosts laughing) </joey>
<joey> I've got an immune system for a reason. </joey>
<joey> - One week later. </joey>
<joey> We have the 'Rona and what went wrong? </joey>
<connor> - I wouldn't do it now </connor>
<connor> but like during high
school, like if I, you know, </connor>
<connor> like dropped a sandwich,
for example, right? </connor>
<garnt> Like depending on how it landed, </garnt>
<garnt> like if the sandwich
perfectly lands on the ground, </garnt>
<garnt> that bottom piece of bread, RIP. </garnt>
<joey> You'll take everything else. </joey>
<garnt> - You're tearing that piece
off. Let's be honest right? </garnt>
<joey> - I'm taking everything else on top of it. </joey>
<joey> I'm not wasting food, fuck that. </joey>
<joey> - No I kinda like how
you suddenly went from, </joey>
<joey> "Yeah, eww. Disgusting." to </joey>
<joey> "Wait, maybe. Wait maybe
there's a situation". </joey>
<joey> - I don't want to waste food, man. </joey>
<joey> - The point is I would
rather drop my child. </joey>
<joey> TLDR. </joey>
<connor> - TLDR.
- TLDR. </connor>
<connor> - I'm pretty sure my parents dropped me. </connor>
<connor> I'm pretty sure I'm, I'm fine. Right? </connor>
<joey> - I don't think there's a single parent </joey>
<joey> who didn't drop their child. </joey>
<garnt> Come on now. </garnt>
<garnt> - This is what, this is why </garnt>
<connor> I am terrified of holding a child. </connor>
<connor> I don't think I've actually, </connor>
<connor> I don't think I've, in my
30 years of being alive. </connor>
<garnt> I don't think I've properly
held a baby in my life. </garnt>
<connor> - I've seen people in Japan
where they're on their bikes. </connor>
<connor> They have the kid in
the carriage behind them </connor>
<connor> and they have the kid
in the backpack on them. </connor>
<joey> And I'm like, this is just, this is </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] That's hard mode. </joey>
<joey> - This is an accident waiting to happen. </joey>
<joey> Like it feels sketch as fuck. </joey>
<joey> - Which ever way you
fall, you are cushioning. </joey>
<connor> - God Joey. </connor>
<garnt> - Just kidding. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know, that's
why I never understand. </garnt>
<garnt> whenever you know, </garnt>
<garnt> one of my family members
has a baby or something </garnt>
<garnt> and they deadass look
me in the eye and go, </garnt>
<garnt> "Do you want to hold this baby?" </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm just like, </garnt>
<joey> "Why would you trust? </joey>
<joey> "So why would you trust a
literal life in my hands?" </joey>
<joey> Like I don't trust myself to hold that. </joey>
<joey> Does this thing come with a
fucking instruction manual? </joey>
<joey> Like how do I operate this thing? </joey>
<joey> I don't fucking know. </joey>
<joey> - I always wonder like,
like I'm like, how do you, </joey>
<joey> do you like, </joey>
<joey> - You kinda like cup it, isn't it? </joey>
<connor> - Do you kinda like
take it from the bottom? </connor>
<joey> - As somebody who has many
pictures of me holding babies, </joey>
<connor> I can tell you, </connor>
<connor> It's like, do you take it from the bottom? </connor>
<connor> Or like under the arm? </connor>
<connor> - So you do it like this, </connor>
<connor> you like kind of like rest them like this. </connor>
<joey> - I know how do it now. But
like when I was like 14, </joey>
<garnt> - Who told you how to do it? </garnt>
<joey> I had no one's ever told me
how to properly hold a baby. </joey>
<connor> - Just maternal instincts isn't it now? </connor>
<joey> - Trial by fire. </joey>
<joey> - Trial by fire. </joey>
<connor> - Many babies are sacrificed. </connor>
<connor> - I used to grab them by
the temple, like this. </connor>
<connor> Realized they didn't
like that when I started. </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause I think, I think because like. </garnt>
<garnt> I, I'm terrified of it
because every single time </garnt>
<garnt> bar none that I've tried to hold a pet, </garnt>
<garnt> it's tried to wriggle out. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm just thinking, </garnt>
<garnt> "Shit, if this fucking
animal was trying to </garnt>
<garnt> "wriggle out of my grasp, </garnt>
<garnt> "I do not want to hold a human
life in my hands and risk </garnt>
<garnt> "dropping a human life on the floor." </garnt>
<joey> - Babies don't wriggle.
They just complain. </joey>
<joey> They're like British people. </joey>
<joey> - I don't think I've ever, </joey>
<connor> I don't think I've ever seen a
baby like get held by someone </connor>
<connor> and be like, "Fuck off me". </connor>
<joey> - "What are you doing?" </joey>
<connor> - It's like, "No". </connor>
<garnt> - Anyway, back to movies. What
were we saying about movies? </garnt>
<garnt> - The viewership sucked for the Oscars. </garnt>
<connor> That was the overall part. </connor>
<connor> But then again like I feel like, </connor>
<connor> I feel like the Oscars
just can't win right now. </connor>
<connor> No matter what they do
that they're going to lose. </connor>
<connor> Like if they, if they, </connor>
<joey> if they patent it more
to or change the demo </joey>
<joey> and focus more on mainstream movies, </joey>
<joey> the movies people are actually watching, </joey>
<joey> I feel like the whole
integrity of, you know, the, </joey>
<joey> 'cause you can't, </joey>
<joey> - The artistic integrity. </joey>
<connor> - You can't fucking give 10
Oscars to Fast and Furious like </connor>
<connor> as much as you know, </connor>
<connor> for the fact that, </connor>
<connor> the fact that the Harry Potter movies </connor>
<joey> never got an Oscar for anything. </joey>
<joey> for the whole movie run, </joey>
<joey> I do feel it's a bit of a shame </joey>
<joey> because I do feel during that time, </joey>
<joey> they were just kind of shunned. </joey>
<joey> The fact that they've seen
as just mainstream garbage. </joey>
<joey> And I genuinely think that Harry Potter </joey>
<connor> could have won in certain areas,
especially like, you know, </connor>
<connor> like set design. </connor>
<connor> Well there was so many times </connor>
<connor> that Harry Potter could have won an Oscar </connor>
<connor> and never did. And I feel
like a lot of disdain </connor>
<connor> was built up during that period where, </connor>
<garnt> - Well, I mean, I feel like the Oscars </garnt>
<connor> just has not aged well as time has gone on </connor>
<connor> because like. </connor>
<connor> - And then they got
caught up in the whole, </connor>
<garnt> the whole woke culture. </garnt>
<garnt> Which I felt like when
you get into that debate, </garnt>
<connor> you've just lost because
you're going to upset someone. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. Because once you get in, </garnt>
<garnt> once you get into the woke culture debate, </garnt>
<connor> then you lose whatever side you go on. </connor>
<connor> You lose whatever </connor>
<connor> - You're gonna make
enemies no matter what. </connor>
<connor> - side you pander on or
even don't pander on. </connor>
<connor> Or even if you say nothing, </connor>
<connor> you are still losing, you know? </connor>
<garnt> And I feel like that was the start of </garnt>
<garnt> really the decline of the Oscars </garnt>
<joey> along with just the fact that,
it's all kind of the same. </joey>
<garnt> Along with the fact that, </garnt>
<garnt> the more years I've watched the Oscars </garnt>
<garnt> or the more years I, 'cause I, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't even like watch
the Oscars that often, </garnt>
<connor> but like more years I've watched it </connor>
<connor> the more years I realized, </connor>
<connor> "Man, I just don't know
any of these movies". </connor>
<connor> - No you don't. Well, cause
I think they had a few years, </connor>
<connor> you know, </connor>
<joey> where there was a lot of
artsy films that were winning </joey>
<joey> which, you know, I'm
sure they deserve them. </joey>
<joey> But I think as a mainstream viewer, </joey>
<joey> most people fucking
don't know what that is. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] No. </joey>
<joey> - Like what was the, what
was that one movie that I, </joey>
<connor> I there's a few, </connor>
<connor> there's been a bunch of movies
that just won Best Picture </connor>
<connor> and I'm like, what? </connor>
<connor> - [connor] Oh yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Like Parasite was the first movie </connor>
<joey> that won Best Picture that I was like, </joey>
<joey> I know that movie. </joey>
<joey> I've seen that movie. </joey>
<joey> Good movie. </joey>
<connor> But like a bunch of other
years I've been like, what? </connor>
<joey> What? What? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. I mean, </connor>
<garnt> I think the problem with
the Oscars for me is that </garnt>
<garnt> even if something wins Best Picture, </garnt>
<connor> I mean Parasite was one of
the only Best Movie winners </connor>
<connor> where I was actually, </connor>
<connor> - I feel like everyone
was happy that it won. </connor>
<connor> - Everyone was happy with
that. That was the first thing. </connor>
<connor> When I, when I saw people actually happy, </connor>
<connor> like mostly unanimously be like, </connor>
<connor> "Yeah. Parasite deserves it.
It's a fucking great film". </connor>
<connor> Because most of the times </connor>
<connor> when I see a Best Picture
winner on the Oscars, I watch it </connor>
<connor> And I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> "Yeah, this is a, this is a
very much an Oscar movie". </connor>
<connor> And I can see why it's so highly rated, </connor>
<garnt> but I just didn't find it
that interesting personally. </garnt>
<connor> - This is what happened to, you know, </connor>
<connor> there's an institution that
goes on for too long. Right? </connor>
<connor> It's got all these built up, you know, </connor>
<connor> things that they've been doing
for years. Like the whole, </connor>
<connor> like if you want to be in the Oscars, </connor>
<connor> you have to do a bunch of dumb shit and, </connor>
<connor> and hold events for the people doing it </connor>
<connor> and basically just pay them. </connor>
<joey> - Pay them out yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Pay them to get considered for it. </joey>
<connor> And that whole shit is dumb. </connor>
<connor> That's not how it should be
done at all. I don't think any, </connor>
<connor> I don't think anybody wants a system </connor>
<connor> where to be included in an award show, </connor>
<joey> you have to, there's a, there's
a pay to win essentially. </joey>
<joey> I mean, obviously you don't pay to win, </joey>
<joey> but you pay to enter. Which I mean, </joey>
<connor> why not just make it so that </connor>
<connor> the best picture gets
nominated for Best Picture? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, you literally have to like </connor>
<joey> win the hearts of the
judge by catering to them, </joey>
<connor> not by making something good, </connor>
<joey> which is like kind of ass backwards. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. And it says something
when I think that like </connor>
<connor> somehow, you know, something like </connor>
<joey> the Crunchyroll Anime
Awards is a better system </joey>
<joey> than the Oscars. </joey>
<joey> where they have a mix of like fan vote. </joey>
<joey> And obviously if you do fan
vote, you can kind of guess </joey>
<garnt> what's gonna happen.
- People are still salty. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right. But I think having
that kind of fan vote in the, </garnt>
<joey> in the equation to say, </joey>
<joey> "Hey, this is what the fans are thinking". </joey>
<joey> Just letting you know.
Just letting you know. </joey>
<joey> - But it's also by making
a fan voting system, </joey>
<joey> it gets those fans to
actually watch the show. </joey>
<garnt> - [Connor] Right it gets them involved. </garnt>
<joey> - No, it doesn't. </joey>
<joey> - You don't think so? </joey>
<joey> - No, fans vote for what they watch. </joey>
<garnt> They don't vote for every
show that's on the list. </garnt>
<joey> - No, no but what I'm saying is like </joey>
<joey> they're more inclined to
actually watch the awards show, </joey>
<connor> to see who won. </connor>
<connor> If they vote for it, </connor>
<joey> - Definitely, I'd say </joey>
<joey> - More so than like </joey>
<connor> - Yeah more so. </connor>
<connor> - leaving it to an unknown
committee of people right? </connor>
<connor> To be like, </connor>
<joey> "This is the best film. No
one can argue about it". </joey>
<connor> - I don't know how many judges there are. </connor>
<joey> There's quite a lot. It's
like 500 or something. </joey>
<joey> I completely estimated,
maybe Ashley can you check </joey>
<connor> how many Oscar judges there are? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah I don't think, </connor>
<garnt> is the exact number known? </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm not sure, </garnt>
<garnt> but I think having some
form of waiting, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> like 5% by the fan or just
something like where the fans </garnt>
<garnt> can kind of have some form of sway. </garnt>
<connor> - Right like the Game Awards, right? </connor>
<connor> I mean, the game, the
Game Awards I feel like </connor>
<connor> I don't know the exact number </connor>
<connor> but I feel like it's like 10% </connor>
<connor> is like the fan voted part of the awards. </connor>
<connor> - That seems good to me. That's, why not? </connor>
<connor> - At least we know what
everyone else is thinking </connor>
<connor> you know? Even if, </connor>
<connor> 'cause I feel like the Oscars </connor>
<connor> is everything I hate about
pretentious Hollywood </connor>
<connor> because it's, it's </connor>
<connor> it's putting these people, </connor>
<connor> it's putting this work on
like a fucking pedestal </connor>
<connor> where an award show should
be just about you know, </connor>
<connor> celebrating what everyone loved
that came out in the year. </connor>
<connor> I mean, it's, it's become like </connor>
<garnt> this whole other political
message and fucking, </garnt>
<connor> - Well yeah and I think
that's what happens when </connor>
<joey> the weight of an Oscar
becomes what it is. Right? </joey>
<joey> Like you can make your career
off winning an Oscar, right? </joey>
<joey> If you win one early on, I imagine your, </joey>
<joey> the amount you just start
charging people for your work </joey>
<joey> goes up significantly. </joey>
<connor> So it's understandable why it
all comes in, but it's just, </connor>
<garnt> it's just, </garnt>
<garnt> - And that's why I've always enjoyed </garnt>
<garnt> other kind of award shows </garnt>
<garnt> like whenever Ricky Gervais
hosts the The Golden Globes, </garnt>
<garnt> that's just like, </garnt>
<connor> - That's like rich people get roasted 4K. </connor>
<garnt> (hosts laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Like I'd rather, I'd take that any day </garnt>
<connor> over the Oscars. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, absolutely. </connor>
<garnt> - That's very good. I do enjoy that. Yeah, </garnt>
<garnt> because the Oscars is always
the same shit it's like, </garnt>
<connor> "And now for somebody who worked hard, </connor>
<connor> "there have been struggles and sacrifices, </connor>
<connor> but they worked hard and won the award". </connor>
<connor> and it's like, great. This is like. </connor>
<joey> - As if everybody is not working hard. </joey>
<connor> - You know, </connor>
<connor> you could put all the Oscar speeches into </connor>
<connor> a learning algorithm and
I bet it will predict </connor>
<connor> what the next speech will be. </connor>
<joey> - Auto-generated Oscar acceptance speech. </joey>
<connor> - Generally, like it
feels like it sometimes </connor>
<connor> like you know, you got fucking Brad </connor>
<connor> because Brad Pitt did the
speech for Best Picture. </connor>
<connor> Oh no, it's a Best Actor, I think. </connor>
<connor> Or one of them, I don't
remember which one. </connor>
<joey> And. You know, it's
like, you have Brad Pitt </joey>
<joey> and then you give him this, </joey>
<joey> napkin-esque McDonald's, you know, </joey>
<joey> McDonald's like commercial
speech and it's like. </joey>
<joey> Why not get them to do something fun? </joey>
<joey> Why don't get them to do something </joey>
<joey> that'll get people interested, </joey>
<joey> like actually talk like properly.
I don't know. Just, yeah. </joey>
<connor> It's just like, I don't
want to fucking watch </connor>
<garnt> a McDonald's ad read. </garnt>
<connor> - Go on Ashley, how many people
were in the Oscar committee? </connor>
<connor> - [Ashley] The academy is made up of </connor>
<joey> more than 9,000 voting members. </joey>
<joey> - Jesus. </joey>
<connor> - All are film-industry professionals. </connor>
<connor> - Wow. </connor>
<connor> - Most are US-based. And almost
half are active filmmakers. </connor>
<joey> - So roughly 10,000 people. </joey>
<joey> - That is a lot of people. </joey>
<connor> - I do also think if
there is 9,000 people here </connor>
<connor> and judging who are
from the film industry, </connor>
<joey> that's also, also kind
of a problem in itself. </joey>
<joey> So the people who are
working in the industry </joey>
<connor> are the ones who had decided the votes. </connor>
<joey> - Because I guarantee
none of them are like </joey>
<connor> film critics or anything like that. Right? </connor>
<connor> - I mean, yeah, exactly. </connor>
<joey> - I mean there might be film critics. </joey>
<joey> - Maybe. </joey>
<joey> - But I mean, </joey>
<joey> if there's people who
are working on the films </joey>
<joey> that are voting, I think that's a problem. </joey>
<joey> - That's a bit of a bias happening right? </joey>
<joey> - A little bit you know? </joey>
<connor> Obviously you might not, I
don't know what the rules are, </connor>
<garnt> - I mean to me, there is no perfect system </garnt>
<connor> for like an award show right but. </connor>
<connor> - Either way, the way it is
now isn't working, clearly. </connor>
<connor> - Either way, the way it is
now is just not capturing </connor>
<garnt> the public's like, interests. </garnt>
<garnt> - Interests. </garnt>
<garnt> - Interests. </garnt>
<connor> - Also, why isn't it being
live streamed? Come on, Oscars. </connor>
<garnt> We're in the fucking 21st
century, live stream this shit. </garnt>
<garnt> - How do people watch the Oscars? </garnt>
<joey> Is it pay-per-view? </joey>
<joey> - It's on like US TV. </joey>
<joey> - It's on TV. </joey>
<joey> - Why is it not on fucking
YouTube or Twitch? Come on. </joey>
<joey> I want to PogChamp with the
fucking, could you imagine. </joey>
<joey> Best, Best Supporting Actor, And it's just </joey>
<connor> MonkaS right before it gets
announced. You know? Like, </connor>
<connor> - Pog! </connor>
<connor> - I want that, you know, </connor>
<connor> like Best Actor Shrek wins the Oscar, </connor>
<connor> just fucking like Shrek pogs in the chat. </connor>
<connor> Like, this would be fun as
fuck. Like what are you doing? </connor>
<connor> This is great. This is how
you get people into it. </connor>
<connor> Like if you could, </connor>
<connor> if you could do channel
points like gambling, </connor>
<connor> 'cause you can do gamble, right? </connor>
<connor> Like I can do, I can do, </connor>
<connor> "Mods mods, do this thing
on my stream". Right. </connor>
<connor> "But do this prediction". </connor>
<joey> Like imagine if you can do that. </joey>
<joey> - I bet so-and-so is going to win. Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Right when they're
announcing the nomination, </connor>
<joey> boom, the prediction comes in, </joey>
<connor> press your channel points. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? This is like, why? </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, I feel like this
is why the Game Awards </garnt>
<garnt> is just so much more fun to me to watch </garnt>
<garnt> as like a viewer than any kind of film, </garnt>
<garnt> film award show or other
kind of award show. </garnt>
<garnt> - Absolutely. </garnt>
<connor> - You can still stick all
the sponsors in. You can, </connor>
<joey> you can fluff the viewership numbers. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause they'll definitely
be higher. You can, </joey>
<joey> you can do so much more like
it just to me it's like, yeah. </joey>
<connor> I mean, it's just the whole system of </connor>
<connor> just old systems in place that, you know, </connor>
<connor> have to answer to it
and all this nonsense. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. Just not bothering
to change the system. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. I mean, to me, </garnt>
<garnt> the Oscars has always been that thing </garnt>
<connor> where it's just been on in the background </connor>
<connor> and people have talked about it, </connor>
<connor> but I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> "Yeah, I mean". </connor>
<joey> - When was the last time you
cared about who won an Oscar? </joey>
<connor> - I don't even remember. I
don't even fucking remember. </connor>
<garnt> - "Shrek". "Shrek" winning Best Animated. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't even remember
the last time I sat down </connor>
<connor> to watch the Oscars or the
Grammys or anything like that. </connor>
<connor> - Well you can't. Where
the fuck do you watch it? </connor>
<connor> You're you're not American. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, you can watch
it like back in Australia, </connor>
<joey> but not here anymore. </joey>
<connor> - I didn't even know where
to watch it in the UK. </connor>
<garnt> - When was the last time
you cared about a winner </garnt>
<garnt> because I feel like before "Parasite", </garnt>
<garnt> I can't even, I can't. </garnt>
<connor> - Shrek. Shrek winning
Best Animated Picture. </connor>
<garnt> - I think the last time I cared, </garnt>
<connor> - Did it actually? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah it did. "Shrek" won. </connor>
<connor> - Well no okay. Best Animated Picture. </connor>
<connor> I feel like that's a, </connor>
<connor> it's either going to be "Shrek" or, </connor>
<connor> - There's always Disney or, </connor>
<connor> - It's going to be either
Disney or "Shrek". Like wake, </connor>
<connor> wake me when an anime actually
wins Best Animated Picture. </connor>
<joey> - Well, "Spirited Away" won right? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah that's the only time an anime. </connor>
<joey> - That's the only time </joey>
<garnt> that's probably the last
time I cared about it. </garnt>
<connor> And that was like 2006
or something like that. </connor>
<joey> - I think that was 2002 or something. </joey>
<connor> - Was it? </connor>
<connor> - Surprised, "Your Name"
didn't win anything. </connor>
<joey> - It got nominated though. </joey>
<garnt> - Did it get nominated? </garnt>
<joey> - It did get nominated, but
it obviously didn't win. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - This is so sad. Imagine this, PepeHands. </connor>
<connor> (hosts laughing) </connor>
<joey> They would have lost you know? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah I mean like the anime, </connor>
<connor> anime has always just been
fluffed by the Oscars. </connor>
<connor> No matter what. I mean, </connor>
<connor> wasn't it the one year that </connor>
<joey> "Boss Baby" got nominated </joey>
<joey> over "A Silent Voice"
- Yeah it did. </joey>
<garnt> - or something like that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Let's go. </garnt>
<joey> - I think as well, I heard that like </joey>
<joey> the only reason why "Spirited Away" won is </joey>
<joey> because like one of the
head people at Pixar, </joey>
<joey> like really, personally vouched for it. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. I mean, I mean. </connor>
<connor> - They also, it got dubbed by Disney. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Ghibli is the only thing
that's been noticed by, </garnt>
<garnt> no yeah, Ghibli's been the only thing </garnt>
<garnt> that's been noticed by Disney. And, </garnt>
<connor> - Well because they certainly went, </connor>
<connor> "Holy shit. This is better animated than </connor>
<connor> "all of out stuff. What
the fuck? What's going on?" </connor>
<garnt> - Holy shit. These guys are
still doing 2D animation? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, what the fuck? </garnt>
<garnt> - That's fucking dedication right there. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah exactly. </garnt>
<connor> - TLDR, nobody cares
about the Oscars anymore. </connor>
<connor> Till they live stream it </connor>
<connor> and I can do MonkaS. </connor>
<joey> - Live stream it, then
put me on in a week. </joey>
<connor> - Honestly, honestly I'd watch </connor>
<joey> because then people will be like, </joey>
<connor> if they let people like
live stream it as well </connor>
<connor> and watch it live, </connor>
<connor> man, their viewer
numbers would be massive. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> And maybe that'll get me to
watch more films as well. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> - I do, I do want to watch
more films. It's been weird </joey>
<garnt> seeing films released online </garnt>
<garnt> on like HBO max
- I do not like it </garnt>
<garnt> - and stuff like that. Right? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. I think it's, </connor>
<connor> it's just reaffirmed for me </connor>
<joey> that I just love the movie theater </joey>
<joey> and I love the experience </joey>
<connor> and that I hope that it never goes away. </connor>
<joey> - No it's great. Like I love
going to it, but it's like, </joey>
<connor> I'm not like you where I
can just watch anything. </connor>
<joey> Like it needs to be a
movie that I want to watch. </joey>
<joey> - I just enjoy the atmosphere much </joey>
<connor> that I will go and watch anything. </connor>
<garnt> - I feel like there are some movies that </garnt>
<garnt> I would prefer to watch in
movie theaters than others. </garnt>
<garnt> - "Tenet" </garnt>
<garnt> - Like, sorry? </garnt>
<garnt> - "Tenet" </garnt>
<connor> - "Tenet" maybe actually, </connor>
<connor> I feel like that would have been cool </connor>
<connor> in the movie theaters, but
I'd like any action flick. </connor>
<connor> I feel like it would be
better in movie theaters. </connor>
<connor> - 100%. Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Like I feel like I
missed out on something, </garnt>
<garnt> not watching John Wick. </garnt>
<connor> - Well those fucking car scenes in "Tenet" </connor>
<connor> where they're like going back in time </connor>
<joey> and zooming forward. It
was so good in the theater. </joey>
<garnt> It was amazing. So good. </garnt>
<garnt> - I need to watch it this week. </garnt>
<connor> - It's so good dude, you do. </connor>
<garnt> - It's it's good. Just, </garnt>
<connor> just for the visuals and
just because it's by far </connor>
<connor> one of the most visually interesting, </connor>
<garnt> interesting like films I've ever seen. </garnt>
<connor> - Super interesting. But yeah. I mean, </connor>
<connor> I want to watch more movies. I, I just, </connor>
<connor> I just really can't watch
movies at home because I, </connor>
<joey> I put it on, I see that </joey>
<joey> fucking two hour thing counting down. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "That's a long time". </joey>
<joey> "That's a long time to focus, damn". </joey>
<garnt> - To me, to me, </garnt>
<connor> - Spend an hour and a half
watching YouTube videos, </connor>
<connor> like no questions asked. </connor>
<connor> - To me it's, I don't know
some, something about a movie </connor>
<connor> and it's, it's the commitment. </connor>
<connor> Like once I've put some movie on I'll, </connor>
<garnt> I'll fucking watch it, </garnt>
<garnt> but it's, it's bringing myself to, </garnt>
<garnt> it's willing myself to even </garnt>
<garnt> put that movie on in the first place </garnt>
<garnt> that I find trouble with. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. I'm like, I think to
myself, I'm like, all right, </joey>
<joey> I can watch this movie. It's
like an hour and a half. </joey>
<joey> But at the same time, </joey>
<joey> I could also watch like three
30 minutes YouTube videos </joey>
<joey> that I wanted to watch as well, you know? </joey>
<joey> I could do that. I think
I might prefer that. </joey>
<connor> - I could just watch random YouTube videos </connor>
<connor> for an hour and a half </connor>
<joey> that I don't really care about. </joey>
<joey> - I could watch like 300 </joey>
<joey> 20 second meme clips on YouTube. </joey>
<connor> - True, true. </connor>
<connor> I've been doing a lot of
that recently. Oh my God. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, that's, that's all, </joey>
<joey> that's been coming up on my recommended. </joey>
<connor> - I don't know what's going
on with YouTube recently, </connor>
<connor> but they just stopped
recommending YouTube videos </connor>
<joey> and started recommending
like YouTube shitposts. </joey>
<garnt> It's like Twitter videos. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah legit. It's so weird. </connor>
<connor> - If I get a recommendation nowadays </connor>
<garnt> and it's like above a minute, I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh, this must be a
fucking special video". </garnt>
<garnt> Oh, okay. </garnt>
<joey> - What was the one we watched
before we start recording? </joey>
<garnt> - The Chonk Chart. </garnt>
<joey> - The Chonk Chart. </joey>
<joey> - That's my, that's my favorite video. </joey>
<joey> It's been recommended recently. </joey>
<garnt> - That is brilliant. </garnt>
<joey> - But now it's gotten to
the point now, where like, </joey>
<joey> even all the comment sections
can all agree on what, </joey>
<joey> like everyone is, </joey>
<joey> everyone's got recommended
the same playlist </joey>
<joey> 'cause everyone's quoting the same videos, </joey>
<joey> even though they're like, </joey>
<joey> they're quoting a different
video on a different meme video. </joey>
<garnt> And everyone gets a reference, </garnt>
<garnt> even though it's not
on any kind of playlist </garnt>
<joey> or anything like that. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Well it's like people watch
two hours of Trash Taste </connor>
<connor> and not, and they'll be like, </connor>
<connor> "No movie for me. Two hour
Trash Taste podcast. Let's go". </connor>
<garnt> It's like, </garnt>
<connor> Oh wow. Okay. Thank you. I'm honored. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. Thanks. </connor>
<garnt> - Did you guys used to watch
more movies back in the day? </garnt>
<connor> - A hundred percent. Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. When I was like 15, I loved it. </joey>
<joey> But that was when you discover </joey>
<joey> like that you can watch things online. </joey>
<joey> So you can tell me, </joey>
<connor> I can watch any movie I
want by just typing the name </connor>
<connor> into Google. What the
fuck? Are you for real? </connor>
<connor> That was like a massive
revelation in my life. I was like, </connor>
<connor> Oh my God. </connor>
<garnt> - Did you guys through go through that </garnt>
<joey> IMDB top 100 movie phase? </joey>
<connor> - Oh yeah. 100%. </connor>
<joey> - Oh no, top 250 movie phase. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - You know what the first movie ever </connor>
<connor> I've watched illegally was? </connor>
<connor> - What? </connor>
<connor> - It was the Hannah Montana movie. </connor>
<connor> - How'd you remember this? </connor>
<connor> - I just remember that
was when I discovered </connor>
<connor> that you could watch it. </connor>
<joey> - Is that the one where it's like </joey>
<joey> the best of both worlds. </joey>
<connor> - I think so. I don't know
what it was, but I remember, </connor>
<joey> - It's like the one she
was on tour or some shit. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, there was like
a dance to it as well. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah yeah. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause I remember, </connor>
<connor> I remember that someone kept walking up </connor>
<connor> and getting up in front of the camera </connor>
<connor> for the movie. </connor>
<connor> (hosts laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Oh it's one of those, right right. </connor>
<connor> - So here's the thing, right? </connor>
<connor> This is like the more you get older, </connor>
<joey> the more you have money </joey>
<joey> that your, your tolerance for the quality. </joey>
<joey> So when you first, when you're like 12, </joey>
<joey> you will watch anything for some reason. </joey>
<joey> You're like, people standing
up in front of the camera, </joey>
<joey> shaky cam quality. </joey>
<joey> No problem. I'll watch it. </joey>
<joey> The moment you get it like a HD DVD rip. </joey>
<joey> You're like, I can't go back. </joey>
<joey> - It's like, 480p. Unacceptable. </joey>
<joey> - Why isn't this shaking? </joey>
<joey> Why is there no artifacts? </joey>
<joey> Why is no one standing up
in front of the camera? </joey>
<joey> What's going on? You know? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, to me, </joey>
<connor> - Sorry I just remembered. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah to me it was always
like the ripped DVDs </garnt>
<connor> that I, that sellers and
Thailand would just sell. </connor>
<connor> So we'd have like little
shops where you'd have like </connor>
<connor> just DVD cases. </connor>
<connor> - They still do that there though right? </connor>
<connor> - They still do that now right. </connor>
<garnt> This episode of Trash Taste
is sponsored by LiquidIV. </garnt>
<connor> - [Connor] When you push your body hard </connor>
<connor> or just feel run down, </connor>
<connor> it's extremely important to stay hydrated. </connor>
<connor> Making hydration a priority
helps us feel healthier </connor>
<connor> on a day-to-day basis. </connor>
<connor> And luckily with just
one stick of LiquidIV </connor>
<connor> and 16 ounces of water,
you get two to three times </connor>
<connor> the amount of hydration
as plain water got. </connor>
<connor> - [connor] I love hydration.
- What? </connor>
<garnt> - You know sometimes, I
get a little hung over. </garnt>
<garnt> And when I say sometimes, </garnt>
<garnt> I mean a lot. </garnt>
<garnt> (hosts laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> And what helps me get through
the hangover is LiquidIV. </garnt>
<garnt> Unironically, I literally
drank it this weekend </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I was hung over. </garnt>
<connor> - My personal favorite flavor </connor>
<connor> is actually the lemon lime flavor. </connor>
<joey> - Really? Mine's actually
the passion fruit flavor. </joey>
<joey> - Damn, good choice Joey. </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] Did you also know that LiquidIV </connor>

<connor> and less sugar than an apple. </connor>

<connor> Back to the video. </connor>
<connor> - I mean that's pretty from </connor>
<connor> the internet speeds
there in Thailand, right? </connor>
<connor> Are they fast in Thailand? </connor>
<connor> Does everyone have access
to internet in Thailand? </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, internet speed
in Thailand are like </garnt>
<connor> faster than some of them,
some of what I get in the UK, </connor>
<connor> at least for uploads. </connor>
<connor> - Really? </connor>
<connor> I mean, I mean, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> I mean like upload speeds in the UK sucks </garnt>
<connor> and most people won't. </connor>
<connor> - For some reason we,
we've been really cucked </connor>
<connor> on the internet speeds. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean download, completely fine, </garnt>
<garnt> But like upload you get
like 20 max, isn't it like, </garnt>
<joey> - Don't talk to me until
you went to Australia. </joey>
<connor> 20 was like fucking luxury in Australia. </connor>
<connor> - It's just, it's just
weird seeing that like, </connor>
<connor> I was paying you know, </connor>
<joey> $70 a month in London, </joey>
<joey> but promised a hundred megabytes
down and six megabytes up. </joey>
<connor> I never got more than three up. </connor>
<connor> I never got more than 60 down. </connor>
<joey> - Dude, I paid 60 bucks
a month for 0.3 up. </joey>
<connor> But you live in a prison. So that's like, </connor>
<joey> - We still have copper
wire. It's ridiculous. </joey>
<joey> In like 2020, we have copper wire. </joey>
<garnt> - Like I, I, no joke because when, when, </garnt>
<garnt> whenever I like lived in the
UK, I would be, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> I remember being a YouTuber, </garnt>
<garnt> being a YouTuber you'd
have to pay for like </garnt>
<garnt> the most expensive internet
available. So I'm like, okay, </garnt>
<garnt> who's, who's the most
fastest internet provider? </garnt>
<garnt> And at a time it was Virgin Media. </garnt>
<joey> - Fucking awful. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. And the best that they
could provide is like 20 up. </garnt>
<joey> And when they say 20 up, </joey>
<connor> it's really like 10 up in
like the quieter times in the, </connor>
<connor> quieter times in the day.
And then I, I would like, </connor>
<connor> - And it's like fucking $200. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Right. </connor>
<connor> And then I remember
living in the UK before, </connor>
<connor> like before, like I had
more American friends, </connor>
<connor> I'd see like screenshots of
people on Twitter being like </connor>
<connor> a hundred up, a hundred
down. And I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> this is obviously Photoshopped. </connor>
<connor> There's no way. There's no way. </connor>
<connor> - That is a fucking lie
and I won't stand for it. </connor>
<garnt> - There's no way people
get this upload speed </garnt>
<garnt> on any kind of internet. </garnt>
<connor> - It's just tragic. In
like places like Europe, </connor>
<connor> you can have, your
neighbor could have like </connor>
<connor> one gigabyte upload and down. </connor>
<connor> And just because the wire
stops at his house, you, </connor>
<connor> you and you're his
neighbor, you won't have it. </connor>
<connor> You have copper. I just,
I just couldn't imagine </connor>
<connor> not living in Japan with
this God-tier internet </connor>
<connor> that never breaks.
Nothing ever bad happens. </connor>
<garnt> - You say God-tier internet. </garnt>
<garnt> I have shit internet compared to you. </garnt>
<garnt> - Bro my internet is just like, </garnt>
<connor> Jesus came down and
fucking blessed my router. </connor>
<connor> - Wait, what do you have? </connor>
<connor> - au. </connor>
<connor> - au? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - What speeds are you getting? </connor>
<connor> - One gig down like 400 megabytes up. </connor>
<garnt> - I'm getting 70 down,
70 up at most on wire. </garnt>
<garnt> - Really? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, for some reason, </garnt>
<garnt> my apartment's like
semi-new but even then they, </garnt>
<garnt> they apparently can only
do like copper, I think. </garnt>
<garnt> Or like some really outdated system. </garnt>
<joey> - Because I'm on WiFi </joey>
<joey> and I get 500 up, 500 down. </joey>
<garnt> - What the fuck am I on? </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know what they gave you connor. </garnt>
<joey> 'Cause I upload like nearly
like half a terabyte of files </joey>
<joey> every week. </joey>
<joey> And that would actually just be impossible </joey>
<joey> on my old internet. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, absolutely. </joey>
<joey> - So like right now it's like, oh, </joey>
<joey> that that video I just
filmed was 150 gigabytes. </joey>
<joey> Oh no worries. </joey>
<joey> It'll take four hours to upload you know, </joey>
<joey> it's like whatever it's crazy. </joey>
<joey> Like this podcast I upload every, </joey>
<joey> every day after we film it </joey>
<joey> and it's like 300
gigabytes of video files. </joey>
<joey> And uploads overnight while
I'm sleeping and I wake up, </joey>
<connor> my PC is on. It's all done. It's good. </connor>
<joey> - Meanwhile back in Australia
it's like, 800 meg file. </joey>
<connor> Give it eight hours. </connor>
<joey> Yeah. It'll be done by the morning. </joey>
<joey> - Exactly it's ridiculous. </joey>
<joey> - It's fucking tragic. </joey>
<joey> - But yeah. I mean, I
really appreciate it. </joey>
<joey> Back to the whole, watching
shitty quality stuff. </joey>
<connor> I recently watched "Chernobyl"
and I wanted to watch it, </connor>
<connor> you know, in high quality because I just, </connor>
<connor> - You can actually. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. You can buy it on YouTube. </connor>
<connor> That's how I watched it. </connor>
<connor> - That's how you watched it? </connor>
<connor> I watched it on Amazon Prime </connor>
<connor> and I had to pay every
episode individually. </connor>
<connor> - Oh no. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. I had to do that as well actually. </garnt>
<connor> - But this is, this is how done I am </connor>
<connor> with not watching stuff
in like high quality </connor>
<connor> that I would rather pay </connor>
<connor> I think it was like $3 an
episode and it offered me, </connor>
<connor> did you want to pay a $1.50
for standard definition </connor>
<connor> or for $4 for HD? </connor>
<connor> I think you should be shot as a company, </connor>
<connor> whoever is in charge of the
decision deserves to be shot. </connor>
<connor> Right. Okay. I'm joking. </connor>
<joey> That's terrible. That is a joke by the way </joey>
<joey> - For legal reasons, it is a joke. </joey>
<joey> - This is a joke, obviously.
I'm just exaggerating. </joey>
<joey> Who, who on Earth is willing to spend like </joey>
<joey> $1.50 for standard definition,
but not the extra dollar. </joey>
<garnt> It is so scummy of these companies to do. </garnt>
<connor> Why would you downgrade the,
like, this is what I hate. </connor>
<garnt> If you have a product and then
you downgrade it and sell it </garnt>
<connor> on purpose. Like, no. No. </connor>
<connor> - Well, what I, what I wonder is like, </connor>
<connor> they obviously know no one's going to buy </connor>
<connor> the standard definition
because if you're buying, </connor>
<connor> if you're willing to
buy standard definition, </connor>
<garnt> then you're going to be the
type of person who's probably </garnt>
<connor> going to find other ways to watch it </connor>
<connor> rather than watch it
in standard definition. </connor>
<garnt> - It just makes me
irrationally angry. Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Like I was, I was very much happy to pay </garnt>
<connor> the 15 bucks to watch this whole
series. It was really good. </connor>
<connor> But I just hate the fact that one, </connor>
<connor> it made me pay for every
episode individually. </connor>
<connor> And I guess in some weird
way, give me a package deal. </connor>
<connor> Give me something. </connor>
<connor> - I think it's for the
people who are like, oh, </connor>
<joey> I watched two episodes. </joey>
<joey> Don't want to watch them. </joey>
<joey> - There should be some kind
of package deal for it. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, of course. </connor>
<garnt> - Seasonal TV show right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. I'm like, </garnt>
<joey> I think, I remember I rented,
no idea why I did this </joey>
<garnt> because again, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know why I just can't be bothered </garnt>
<joey> of doing the whole dance of
some, watch something online, </joey>
<garnt> spend two hours trying
to find a link that, </garnt>
<joey> that doesn't give you viruses. </joey>
<joey> I don't want to deal with that
shit anymore. Like it's just, </joey>
<joey> it's too stressful. </joey>
<joey> And the, watching movies is
already hard enough as it is. </joey>
<joey> I'm not, I'm not doing this. </joey>
<joey> I'm not doing this
dance anymore. I refuse. </joey>
<joey> I think I watched "Borat" on YouTube. </joey>
<joey> - Wait, really? </joey>
<joey> - You watched "Borat" on YouTube? </joey>
<joey> - I rented "Borat" on YouTube </joey>
<joey> because for some reason I
wanted to watch it again </joey>
<joey> because I wanted to, I didn't know. </joey>
<joey> - I don't think I've ever
rented a movie on YouTube. </joey>
<joey> - Don't, it was awful. </joey>
<joey> - Really? </joey>
<connor> - Because for some
reason when I rented it, </connor>
<connor> I was like, great. </connor>
<connor> It was only in like 480p, on YouTube. </connor>
<joey> - Really? </joey>
<joey> - Is, is that because it's an older movie? </joey>
<connor> - No I'm pretty sure that
"Borat" is at least in like </connor>
<joey> fucking 720 or 1080. </joey>
<joey> - I'd like to think so. </joey>
<connor> - Like, I'm pretty sure it
wasn't in 480. I was like, </connor>
<connor> "What is this? What is this?" </connor>
<joey> I don't remember looking at this shit. </joey>
<connor> - Did you, did you rent
the standard version? </connor>
<connor> - No, there was only one
choice. It was like three bucks. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah there's only one
choice, standard definition. </joey>
<connor> - And then also, I just
found it really interesting, </connor>
<connor> that YouTube actually tells you </connor>
<connor> how many views the movie has. </connor>
<connor> - Oh really? </connor>
<connor> - And it had like 20. On YouTube. </connor>
<connor> - It might not have
been legit in that case. </connor>
<connor> - No it was definitely like legit. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Really? </connor>
<connor> - Like it was legit and it was just weird </connor>
<connor> because I was like, "This is so strange". </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. I've, I've been well, </garnt>
<garnt> I've been watching a lot of
films on YouTube here in Japan, </garnt>
<garnt> because I find like, </garnt>
<garnt> if there's a film that's
not on Netflix or something </garnt>
<garnt> or Amazon here, it's
normally on Japanese YouTube. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know why. It's like, I started, </garnt>
<garnt> I started watching "The
Wire" on YouTube because, </garnt>
<connor> - Are you paying for it
all? You paying for it all, </connor>
<connor> like one by one? </connor>
<garnt> - No I'm paying like season by season. </garnt>
<connor> But like it, </connor>
<connor> because I tried to watch
"The Wire" in the UK </connor>
<connor> and it just was not available
on like any platform </connor>
<connor> that I was subscribed to basically, </connor>
<connor> if it's not on Netflix and
it's not an Amazon Prime, </connor>
<connor> I'm probably not going to watch it, right? </connor>
<connor> But I feel like here in Japan, </connor>
<connor> YouTube is like the golden child. </connor>
<connor> There was so many films here on YouTube, </connor>
<joey> so many TV series that are blocked off </joey>
<joey> when you're in like, western countries. </joey>
<joey> So yeah if you're in Japan, use YouTube, </joey>
<garnt> there's a lot on YouTube. </garnt>
<connor> - I feel like I'm repaying
my debts as a teen. </connor>
<joey> You know what I mean? Just
paying for all these movies. </joey>
<joey> - Punished with the standard definition. </joey>
<connor> - I sit there as I ordered my
300 yen "Borat", SD quality, </connor>
<joey> 480p thinking, old Connor would have, </joey>
<garnt> would have gone online and
found an HD version today. </garnt>
<garnt> No, here you go movie, billion
dollar movie companies. </garnt>
<joey> Here's three bucks. </joey>
<garnt> - But alas, I don't have two
hours to kill, to find it. </garnt>
<joey> I'm going to have to deal with this. </joey>
<connor> - I just, I just don't care anymore. </connor>
<connor> I've just like, I, I, yeah, I dunno. </connor>
<joey> I, I value my time too much now. </joey>
<joey> I'm so busy now that the
thought of spending 10 minutes </joey>
<joey> to try to find a link. If I
get to the five minute mark, </joey>
<joey> I'm about to give up. I'm like,
"No, I'm not watching it". </joey>
<connor> You've lost. You've lost. </connor>
<joey> - But like 10 years ago it'd
be like, day seven. Still, </joey>
<joey> - I'd be like, "Maybe it's my location". </joey>
<joey> Changes VPN to other countries to try </joey>
<joey> and get a different Google
search. You know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> Like I would do whatever it took. </joey>
<connor> Like I remember I tried to watch the, </connor>
<connor> the documentary about Pepe
and I just, it was fucking, </connor>
<connor> I couldn't even find a place to buy it. </connor>
<connor> Like it was
- Really? </connor>
<connor> fucking impossible to try to
find this movie to watch it. </connor>
<garnt> - Were you in the generation where you, </garnt>
<joey> where people are watching
things on Megaupload? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah yeah.
- Yeah yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Do you remember, </joey>
<joey> do you remember the dance
you had to do with the </joey>
<connor> 72 minutes time limits? </connor>
<connor> So for anyone to anyone too young to know, </connor>
<connor> so for anyone to anyone too young to know, </connor>
<connor> they used to be the site
called Megaupload, right. </connor>
<connor> Where people would upload, you know, </connor>
<connor> full TV series and full movies on it. </connor>
<connor> Now, most movies they're on time. </connor>
<garnt> It's normally like at least
an hour and a half, right. </garnt>
<connor> - A hundred minutes. </connor>
<garnt> - Like a hundred, like a hundred minutes. </garnt>
<garnt> So Megaupload for a free
account had a time limit </garnt>
<garnt> of 72 minutes. And for
every 72 minutes you watch, </garnt>
<garnt> you had to wait 72 minutes to watch the, </garnt>
<garnt> to watch it again. Right. </garnt>
<joey> - Such a dick move yet,
amazing marketing choice. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh my God. </garnt>
<joey> - It was such a dick move. </joey>
<joey> - Like I don't know, </joey>
<garnt> was it because it was the only site that </garnt>
<garnt> was available for people? </garnt>
<connor> - It was one of the only
file sites that was like, </connor>
<joey> "Welcome everything. </joey>
<joey> "Come on. Put anything you want on here." </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. And I remember, I
remember back in the day when it, </connor>
<connor> 'cause this was when I
was still in university. </connor>
<connor> So I think back, back when
Megaupload was popular, </connor>
<connor> I don't think VPNs were as popular. Right? </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<connor> - Because VPN would be like </connor>
<connor> the easy answer to this nowadays. </connor>
<connor> Right. And I remember
feeling like I was like, </connor>
<connor> so fucking five head where, where, </connor>
<connor> what I would do is our university
had like a private network </connor>
<connor> that we would connect to, to upload </connor>
<connor> like our files or upload our projects </connor>
<connor> and stuff like that. </connor>
<connor> And so what I would do is I
would watch the 72 minutes, </connor>
<connor> then I would connect to the, to the, </connor>
<connor> to the university internet
and start uploading on there, </connor>
<connor> - Was it like the edgy
room? Was it the edgy room? </connor>
<connor> - Something like that. Right. </connor>
<connor> And then that worked great
until I did something stupid. </connor>
<connor> I started blabbing my mouth about it. </connor>
<connor> (hosts groaning) </connor>
<garnt> So unfortunately I
lived in a shared house. </garnt>
<garnt> So this 72 minute, </garnt>
<garnt> the 72 minute limit became
like five minutes where </garnt>
<joey> everyone in our house
started watching Megaupload </joey>
<joey> and you use like the same network </joey>
<joey> and use the same, same IP address. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, rookie mistake. </joey>
<joey> - And yeah, that was, </joey>
<joey> and then I realized it's just much better </joey>
<connor> to live by yourself and just
not have to deal with people, </connor>
<connor> sharing your internet. Do
you remember having to, </connor>
<connor> do you remember trying to game online </connor>
<connor> on university internet? </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] It was terrible. </connor>
<garnt> - And how fucking awful that was. </garnt>
<joey> - Terrible. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - That's a memory I don't
want to think about. </joey>
<garnt> - I have like flashbacks of just </garnt>
<connor> the ping going from 10 to like 500 </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Who's uploading porn? </connor>
<joey> - I mean, it wasn't even
that bad for me because like, </joey>
<joey> because of Australian interest, </joey>
<joey> our default ping was like 300. </joey>
<joey> So it was more like going
from like 300 to like 900. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah I remember when I
gamed with an Australian </joey>
<joey> and they were like, </joey>
<joey> "Yeah, I've got great ping". </joey>
<joey> "Oh, what is it?" </joey>
<connor> "Oh 300". </connor>
<connor> I'm like, that's not, by no
measurement is that a good ping. </connor>
<joey> - If you have below 250, you're like, </joey>
<joey> damn, this guy's paying for
like the premium internet. </joey>
<joey> (hosts laughing) </joey>
<connor> - I dunno. I, I feel that
a university internet </connor>
<joey> was just the most
temperamental thing ever. </joey>
<joey> But it was really cool 'cause I remember </joey>
<joey> that because a lot of them
use the eduroam network. </joey>
<joey> I remember one time I went to Germany </joey>
<joey> and I walked past the
university and I was like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, I connected to the internet, </joey>
<joey> "I connected to that
university's internet." </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I, it shared the same
ID for like WiFi or something </joey>
<joey> or something like that. </joey>
<joey> But if I walk past any university, </joey>
<joey> you get free WiFi when
you're a university student. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Wow. </joey>
<joey> - If it was using the same
network, which most of them </joey>
<joey> were I think in Europe,
it's really cool. Fun fact. </joey>
<joey> - (connor) Wow. </joey>
<joey> - Life hack. </joey>
<joey> - Life hack. Just, I
don't know, do something. </joey>
<connor> - Walk past the university. </connor>
<joey> - Just get free WiFi. </joey>
<connor> - Just get free WiFi. </connor>
<joey> - Stop complaining. It's free. </joey>
<joey> - I actually have a really awkward story </joey>
<joey> about when I set up
the WiFi here in Japan, </joey>
<joey> - Go on. </joey>
<joey> - Story time. </joey>
<connor> - Obviously, obviously we, you know, </connor>
<connor> we just moved to Japan and
one of the hardest things, </connor>
<connor> especially when we moved here was fucking </connor>
<connor> setting everything up initially. </connor>
<connor> - Joey knows all too well. </connor>
<connor> - [connor] Joey knows all too well, </connor>
<connor> Connor moved here like
two weeks before me. </connor>
<garnt> So Joey, Connor had the cheat sheet </garnt>
<garnt> of just having Joey set
up everything for him. </garnt>
<connor> - I was like, </connor>
<garnt> I wanted to get in first
with Joey. I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Joey, I need help. </garnt>
<joey> "connor's coming. I know you're
going to be sick of connor" </joey>
<joey> - He went and perfectly planned
out where I'd be burnt out </joey>
<joey> right as connor was about to ask me. </joey>
<garnt> - 'Cause like I could
see when you asked Joey, </garnt>
<joey> like to help you set up,
I could see like the, </joey>
<garnt> just the hope just wash over
his face and be like, "Oh, </garnt>
<joey> "this is the last time Connor.
This is the last time". </joey>
<joey> And I remember when you were
talking about setting up </joey>
<joey> like your driver's license and like, </joey>
<joey> I could see Joey's just like, </joey>
<connor> "No, don't ask me Connor. </connor>
<connor> "I'm not going to do it." </connor>
<garnt> - I'm not doing it. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, that I feel bad. </joey>
<joey> Luckily there was someone
else who I hadn't bothered yet </joey>
<joey> to help me with, </joey>
<garnt> (hosts laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - So yeah. So as I was
setting up the internet </garnt>
<garnt> as, as you know, I have like </garnt>
<joey> really, really slow internet
compared to you guys. Right. </joey>
<joey> - Peasant.
- Peasant. </joey>
<joey> - Peasant internet. I can't
remember who I'm with. </joey>
<joey> It's not au, it's the other, </joey>
<joey> - Softbank? </joey>
<joey> - No, it doesn't really matter. </joey>
<joey> - It doesn't matter but they have the, </joey>
<joey> they have like English support, </joey>
<joey> which is why I picked them. Right. </joey>
<joey> Because I had to, I had to try
and sort this out by myself. </joey>
<joey> So when they said they
have English supports </joey>
<joey> it's it's the most. </joey>
<joey> It's basically just like, </joey>
<garnt> here's a person who translates
using Google translate. </garnt>
<garnt> Right? </garnt>
<connor> - Japanese companies that
are like English support or </connor>
<connor> for foreigners only, </connor>
<connor> 95% of the time, </connor>
<connor> it's just someone who doesn't
really speak good English </connor>
<connor> and it's just a way for
them to hike up the price. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Oh yeah.
- [connor] Oh yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Like if you go to the like, </connor>
<connor> what is it like, GaijinPot,
is that what it's called? </connor>
<connor> - [connor] Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Like that, that real estate website, </joey>
<joey> if you go and find the same
properties on a Japanese </joey>
<joey> website, they're much cheaper. </joey>
<joey> It's just like, </joey>
<joey> - It's like 30% cheaper at least. </joey>
<connor> - And it's just like, </connor>
<joey> (Connor exhales) </joey>
<connor> - Okay, it's being taken
advantage of because you know, </connor>
<connor> - They do do that. </connor>
<joey> - Just ask someone who's
Japanese to help you </joey>
<joey> you'll save a shit ton of money, </joey>
<joey> but you might lose a friend. </joey>
<joey> But you'll have at least saved </joey>
<joey> a few hundred bucks.
- Just make a Japanese friend </joey>
<joey> to eventually lose said Japanese friend. </joey>
<connor> - Pay him the money that you saved. </connor>
<garnt> - Honestly, there should be a service </garnt>
<garnt> for someone to help you. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause that would have, that
could save you a lot of money, </garnt>
<garnt> - Someone start a service. </garnt>
<garnt> Hire a Japanese who speaks English </garnt>
<garnt> to come with you to stuff. </garnt>
<joey> - Basically. </joey>
<joey> - That's my first really, right there. </joey>
<garnt> - Like the reason I was able
to set up my phone was 'cause </garnt>
<garnt> luckily, my cousin was here
at the time and I asked, </garnt>
<garnt> I asked her to do it and she works for JAL </garnt>
<garnt> so she can speak pretty fluent Japanese. </garnt>
<garnt> And she helped me set it
up. Perfect. No bumpy roads. </garnt>
<garnt> Setting up the internet
was a fucking nightmare. </garnt>
<connor> - I have one on my phone. </connor>
<connor> So I'll tell mine after yours. </connor>
<garnt> - Okay. Because like, firstly, </garnt>
<garnt> you, firstly like you have to, </garnt>
<garnt> set up with the internet
provider and then also set it up </garnt>
<garnt> with something else as well. </garnt>
<connor> - I didn't have to do that for mine. </connor>
<connor> - You didn't, you didn't have to do that? </connor>
<connor> - Because I, I've like, </connor>
<connor> I get billed from two companies </connor>
<connor> and I don't exactly understand. </connor>
<connor> - Bruh. Bruh. </connor>
<joey> - That sounds like a scam. </joey>
<connor> - No, no, no. It wasn't a scam. </connor>
<connor> I made sure I wasn't a scam because </connor>
<connor> - How would you know? </connor>
<connor> - Because I, I, </connor>
<garnt> - Because his English support. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no because </garnt>
<connor> - The Google translator
surely wasn't a scam. </connor>
<connor> - Not a scam. </connor>
<connor> - Microsoft tech support. </connor>
<connor> They were very nice. </connor>
<connor> They assured me that my Windows PC, </connor>
<joey> - There was an Indian guy on
the phone. They assured me. </joey>
<connor> (hosts laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I pay through Google
Play cards. You know, </connor>
<connor> it's totally legit. </connor>
<garnt> - From what I understand, </garnt>
<garnt> you have to set up with like the ISP, </garnt>
<joey> the person who provides the ISP. </joey>
<joey> - I did not have to do that. </joey>
<joey> - And then the guy, I think </joey>
<joey> 'cause I think au provides both services. </joey>
<garnt> Whereas my, my company did not
provide both services at once </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah I think yours is like </joey>
<garnt> Yahoo Mobile or something
right? Where it's like. </garnt>
<connor> - Yahoo Mobile. </connor>
<connor> - It's probably like a, it's probably like </connor>
<garnt> a version of like Yahoo
or something like that. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I remember I had that </garnt>
<joey> and I had to do something similar. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. 'Cause, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause the person that provides the line </garnt>
<garnt> and the person that like
installs the router, </garnt>
<connor> and rents out the router
and stuff for you, </connor>
<garnt> it's like two separate companies. </garnt>
<connor> - Rents out the router?
They're like fucking 40 bucks. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. I know. No, no, no. </garnt>
<connor> But the thing is you can rent one out </connor>
<garnt> and have them set up for you
or you can set it up yourself. </garnt>
<garnt> And so I chose, no, with
the internet option I had, </garnt>
<connor> I didn't even have that option </connor>
<garnt> because I would have loved
just to rent out a router </garnt>
<garnt> and have the engineer set it up. </garnt>
<connor> No, I wasted a day </connor>
<garnt> trying to figure out how
to set up my fucking router </garnt>
<garnt> and connect it to the
ISP engine in Japanese </garnt>
<connor> and Japanese menus and everything. </connor>
<garnt> It was, it was fucking hell blah, blah. </garnt>
<garnt> But before that, I had to even just </garnt>
<garnt> set up the deal that I was getting. Right? </garnt>
<garnt> And so I phoned up and I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> Okay. Yeah, I'm living here. </garnt>
<garnt> I choose, I choose the English option. </garnt>
<joey> And even then it's, it's like, </joey>
<joey> - It's rough. </joey>
<joey> - It's a fucking rough kind of, </joey>
<joey> kind of like, it took me, </joey>
<joey> I think an hour of, an hour phone call </joey>
<joey> to communicate 10 minutes worth of stuff. </joey>
<joey> And just to make sure that
everything was correct. </joey>
<joey> And I tell them all my details </joey>
<joey> and so we're going through it. </joey>
<joey> And then they, they tell
me that, "We're sorry, </joey>
<joey> "this is the fastest internet
you can get at this house at </joey>
<joey> "this apartment". And I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> that's like your lowest option </joey>
<joey> that you have on your website. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause they have like, </joey>
<joey> they have like different tiers, right? </joey>
<joey> They have, they have like the, </joey>
<joey> high paying option and they have like the </joey>
<joey> fucking peasant option. </joey>
<joey> - As they always. As they always. </joey>
<connor> - As they always do. </connor>
<connor> And they were like, </connor>
<connor> "We're sorry, you can only
get the peasant option". </connor>
<connor> - Why? </connor>
<connor> - And I was like asking why. Right? </connor>
<connor> And they were saying, they told me that, </connor>
<garnt> "I'm sorry, your building
is not new enough. </garnt>
<garnt> "And yeah, it doesn't have the
newest internet installed". </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. That's the problem
with Japanese internet </joey>
<joey> is that like it, depending on the building </joey>
<garnt> and the wires built into it. </garnt>
<garnt> They just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "We can't do it. Sorry." </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. So, </joey>
<joey> - It's ridiculous. </joey>
<joey> - So I was like, there's
no way that this is true. </joey>
<connor> Because I my, </connor>
<connor> my apartment's pretty
modern. It's like it's, </connor>
<connor> it's I think it was built, </connor>
<connor> - It's newer than mine. </connor>
<connor> Much newer than mine.
- Yeah it's newer than yours. </connor>
<connor> And I heard about the
speeds you're getting. </connor>
<joey> So I was like, I was like, </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] No problem. </joey>
<joey> I was like doubt.
- [Connor] Fuck Connor. </joey>
<connor> - Where is this phantom speed coming from? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. I was like, doubt. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm actually stealing the
next door building you know. </connor>
<garnt> - So, so, so like, so like I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> let me consider this deal right? </garnt>
<garnt> So I, so I hang up, </garnt>
<joey> I phone out the next day </joey>
<joey> so I could talk to
someone different. Right? </joey>
<joey> So I can just make sure that, </joey>
<joey> - It wasn't just that person. </joey>
<connor> - It wasn't just that person
that I was miscommunicating to. </connor>
<connor> Right. So I phone up, I go through </connor>
<connor> the same fucking hour phone call </connor>
<connor> that doing it again, explaining, </connor>
<connor> "Yes. I just want to make sure </connor>
<connor> "that this is the best
option I can go for. </connor>
<joey> "This is the best option and
there isn't a higher option." </joey>
<joey> And, and the second person that
I was talking to, she goes, </joey>
<joey> "Hold on a second. Let me
just talk to my manager". </joey>
<joey> And so she gets her manager
and her manager comes on. </joey>
<joey> It's the same fucking guy
I talked to yesterday. </joey>
<joey> And so I was just like, </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Noooo. </joey>
<joey> - "Yeah, can I just make sure </joey>
<connor> "that this is the highest
option available?" </connor>
<connor> And he goes, </connor>
<connor> "You're the guy that phoned
yesterday didn't you?" </connor>
<connor> - Aren't you? </connor>
<connor> - And I was like, </connor>
<connor> "Yeah, this is, this is awkward. </connor>
<joey> "Can I just double, double make sure?" </joey>
<joey> And he's like, "Yeah. I
mean, I just made sure again, </joey>
<garnt> "it's the best option available and," </garnt>
<garnt> - This motherfucker. </garnt>
<garnt> - I wonder, </garnt>
<connor> I wonder if you tried a
different internet company. </connor>
<garnt> - I wanted to. and so I, I go, </garnt>
<garnt> I go through the ordeal again and I, </garnt>
<garnt> you know, give them all my details again. </garnt>
<garnt> And this time I actually have to send my, </garnt>
<garnt> send my ID or scan my ID just
to make sure everything's all, </garnt>
<garnt> everything's all kosher. </garnt>
<garnt> Shit you not, first bill I get. </garnt>
<garnt> Right. I open up, Grant Maneetapho. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> I send them my ID </garnt>
<connor> so that they can verify
my name and address. </connor>
<garnt> And they. And they fucking
auto correct my name again. </garnt>
<connor> - Grant Maneetapho </connor>
<connor> - No, no, no. His name on
the ID must've been wrong. </connor>
<connor> - No, no, no. </connor>
<connor> - A lot of fucking idiots in the UK. </connor>
<joey> - I think the visa people
just spelled it wrong. </joey>
<connor> - Fuck the visa people.
Fuck the government. </connor>
<joey> - What the fuck's a
connor? That's not a name. </joey>
<connor> - So what, you just
bought the shitty internet </connor>
<connor> and it's shit? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. I mean, </connor>
<connor> - I'm sorry. I bought the shitty internet. </connor>
<connor> It turns out it was shit. </connor>
<garnt> - So yeah. I mean, I couldn't be bothered </garnt>
<garnt> to fucking go through another like </garnt>
<garnt> two hour phone call with another company </garnt>
<garnt> and I just settled for it. And, </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, trust me, like, </joey>
<joey> even if you were perfect in Japanese, </joey>
<joey> it probably would've taken
just as long like 'cause </joey>
<joey> my God. </joey>
<connor> - Well actually when Joey
helped me try to get my </connor>
<connor> internet and SIM card. </connor>
<joey> And originally I got
internet and a SIM card </joey>
<joey> with the same company. </joey>
<joey> Turned out the SIM card just
didn't work on my phone. </joey>
<joey> And 'cause they were like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, we don't sell this
model of phone in Japan". </joey>
<joey> So in, in Europe, </joey>
<connor> I don't know if it's the same as the US </connor>
<connor> but you can basically
buy SIM cards anywhere </connor>
<connor> and they'll work with every phone. </connor>
<connor> Like it doesn't matter what it is. </connor>
<connor> You just put it in. It works. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. But yeah, </connor>
<connor> apparently that's not the case in Japan </connor>
<connor> because of course it isn't. </connor>
<connor> I found out that Japan is
the only country on Earth </connor>
<connor> that uses the very specific
type of like, bandwidth </connor>
<joey> or whatever it is that
the phone lines use. </joey>
<joey> So a lot of phones don't work in Japan </joey>
<joey> because Japan was like, </joey>
<joey> "No, no, no, we're going to be different". </joey>
<joey> And it's like, </joey>
<joey> "Of course you are Japan". </joey>
<joey> - Of course you are. </joey>
<joey> - Everything's gotta be different. </joey>
<joey> And that's why like getting a phone here </joey>
<connor> is fucking hell. </connor>
<joey> And that's why like SIM
cards is so expensive. </joey>
<joey> I think recently they
did something about that. </joey>
<joey> They're gonna change it </joey>
<joey> because I think the government is like, </joey>
<connor> it's getting out of hand,
like the prices of phone, </connor>
<joey> phone carriers here are ridiculous. </joey>
<connor> - I mean, I'm paying more for my phone </connor>
<connor> than I am my internet. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. Me too. </connor>
<connor> I'm paying 90 bucks a
month for my fucking phone. </connor>
<connor> And that doesn't include, </connor>
<connor> that doesn't include the phone. </connor>
<connor> That's, I bought the phone myself. </connor>
<garnt> - I think I'm paying like 70 bucks a month </garnt>
<connor> and I get like </connor>
<connor> 4 gigs of data.
- [Connor] It's insane. </connor>
<connor> It's insane. It's like, what is this shit? </connor>
<connor> This shit is stupid. This
is way too much for shit. </connor>
<connor> It's okay. It's good. </connor>
<connor> But I mean, it's good service, but, </connor>
<connor> - It's good but. </connor>
<connor> - But it's shit. But it's shit </connor>
<connor> that they're charging
me this much. I paid, </connor>
<connor> I paid $15 In the UK for what I was, </connor>
<connor> 10 pounds, for what I was getting. </connor>
<garnt> - I think I paid like 20
pounds a month in the UK. </garnt>
<connor> - That's expensive. </connor>
<garnt> - For like unlimited data. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah it's ridiculous. </connor>
<garnt> - And when in the UK, </garnt>
<garnt> when they say unlimited data, </garnt>
<connor> they actually mean unlimited data. </connor>
<garnt> I've never been throttled
in my data in the UK at all. </garnt>
<garnt> - The speeds are fantastic
here. Don't get me wrong, </garnt>
<garnt> - [connor} Speeds are great. </garnt>
<garnt> - But not to the point where we're at </garnt>
<connor> we're talking a hundred
dollars a month speed. Come on. </connor>
<connor> It's more than my internet bill. </connor>
<joey> You're having a bit of, come on, </joey>
<joey> a bit of a joke. </joey>
<joey> I mean it works really
well, but I just, yeah. </joey>
<joey> And that's why like a lot of people I know </joey>
<joey> don't even bother getting SIM cards </joey>
<joey> because you have to sit there for like </joey>
<connor> four hours talking to them, asking, </connor>
<connor> answering dumb questions. </connor>
<connor> And they're trying to
sell you a ton of stuff. </connor>
<connor> Like, 'cause I think
Aki doesn't even use a, </connor>
<joey> - No, she still has an American thing. </joey>
<joey> It just pays for pocket WiFi. </joey>
<joey> Because she's just like she looked at like </joey>
<joey> all of her friends getting, you know, </joey>
<joey> the SIM cards and whatnot, </joey>
<joey> she's like, </joey>
<joey> "I'm not going through
that shit. Fuck that." </joey>
<connor> - It's hell, </connor>
<connor> but I just don't want to
have to charge a fucking </connor>
<joey> portable WiFi thing all the time. </joey>
<joey> Having a Japanese number
does help sometimes </joey>
<joey> and things like a lot of forms require you </joey>
<joey> to have Japanese numbers for some reason. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah she just uses
my number for that so. </joey>
<connor> - Wow isn't that convenient? </connor>
<joey> Where's my Japanese
fucking fluent boyfriend </joey>
<connor> who translates and does
everything for me huh? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. No, if I were her, </joey>
<joey> I would totally do the same
thing to be honest. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Honestly like, the only reason </joey>
<joey> I wanted a phone was because
I didn't want to carry </joey>
<connor> an extra thing with my
phone just to get WiFi. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Same, same, same. </connor>
<garnt> - And you're like not carrying like </garnt>
<garnt> a purse with you all the time. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - It's just annoying. </joey>
<joey> - Exactly. Exactly. But yeah. </joey>
<joey> I know several people who
just have pocket WiFi here, </joey>
<joey> just 'cause it's </joey>
<joey> they don't want to go
through the trouble of </joey>
<joey> switching their phones or, </joey>
<joey> - Well I mean Reina still has pocket WiFi. </joey>
<connor> She's been living here for
like however many years. </connor>
<connor> - It's insane. Do we even have? </connor>
<connor> Pocket WiFI isn't popular
in like Europe I don't think </connor>
<connor> and in the US it's like not mainstream. </connor>
<connor> - I'd never really heard
of it until I moved here. </connor>
<connor> - It exists but like it's, it's not, </connor>
<connor> - It's not common. </connor>
<connor> - Nearly common as you see here, </connor>
<joey> because clearly they've made
a market where the phone, </joey>
<joey> the cell phone carriers
are so fucking awful </joey>
<joey> that there's a whole
industry about avoiding them. </joey>
<joey> It's ridiculous. </joey>
<joey> And the price of these pocket WiFis </joey>
<joey> are much cheaper than the cell phone. </joey>
<joey> - Much cheaper, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - It's just stupid. </connor>
<garnt> - Like I legitimately dread
whenever I have to sort out like </garnt>
<garnt> the smallest thing within
like my living situation </garnt>
<garnt> here in Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> - Cause like they, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know how they all
somehow always turn like </garnt>
<garnt> a five to 15 minute meeting
to like a fucking hour long. </garnt>
<connor> An hour long ordeal. </connor>
<connor> - I'm waiting for the day
where you know how sometimes </connor>
<connor> when you get on a website,
if you change your email, </connor>
<connor> they'll be like, </connor>
<connor> "Please come in-person
to change your email". </connor>
<connor> And it will be like four
hours. And it's like, </connor>
<connor> I could've just done this online. </connor>
<garnt> - Okay. Fucking Japanese banks, man. </garnt>
<garnt> I, I'm about to go fucking mad. </garnt>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Oh God, he broke the table. He's so mad. </connor>
<connor> - Jesus Christ. </connor>
<connor> - I have so much salt towards, </connor>
<connor> - Foreigners complain
about Japan, volume 10. </connor>
<garnt> - Honestly, Japanese banks. </garnt>
<connor> - Do you want to preface
before we get into this? </connor>
<connor> And we do love living in
Japan, very kind country. </connor>
<joey> But we are British and we
complain about everything. </joey>
<connor> I complain about everything in the UK. </connor>
<joey> - I'm an innocent bystander in this case. </joey>
<connor> - Oh bullshit. Like you don't
complain about the banks. </connor>
<joey> - We complain about everywhere we live. </joey>
<joey> And especially if something
like is inefficient to a Brit. </joey>
<joey> You know, we, we will
happily wait in line. </joey>
<joey> But if, </joey>
<joey> if that meeting takes any
seconds longer than it needs to, </joey>
<joey> we are, we are going to
complain the shit about that. </joey>
<joey> So, so Japanese banks, we have to fucking, </joey>
<joey> since our visa only lasts six months, </joey>
<joey> we have to re, we have to
go to the bank every time </joey>
<joey> to tell them not to
cancel our card. Right? </joey>
<joey> And the thing about Japanese banks is that </joey>
<joey> you can do fucking nothing
on the phone. Right? </joey>
<joey> So just, just so they don't cancel a card. </joey>
<joey> Every time my visa runs out.
Every time we renew our visa, </joey>
<joey> we have to go there in person. </joey>
<joey> And not just any branch of our bank, </joey>
<joey> we have to go to the, </joey>
<joey> - Branch that you
started the bank account. </joey>
<joey> - We have to go to that specific branch, </joey>
<joey> which if you don't live
anywhere near the branch, </joey>
<garnt> you open your bank account.
You're pretty much fucked. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - They didn't give me a warning. </connor>
<garnt> They didn't tell you why. </garnt>
<garnt> So you could be stranded </garnt>
<garnt> in the middle of fucking nowhere in Japan </garnt>
<connor> and not be able to get any money out. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause they've, they've canceled your card </connor>
<garnt> and not told you. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. And another thing is,
I needed to go there for like, </garnt>
<connor> I needed a bank statement. Right? </connor>
<connor> You think for a bank statement,
that's a pretty normal, </connor>
<connor> - Just go on the app, go online. </connor>
<connor> - That's a pretty normal
document you can obtain </connor>
<connor> from a bank. Correct? </connor>
<connor> So I go to the, I go to the bank </connor>
<connor> and I asked for a bank
statement and they have like </connor>
<connor> fucking 70 million different
kinds of bank statements. </connor>
<connor> And I'm just like, what? </connor>
<connor> How hard is it to? </connor>
<connor> - Tommy, Tommy money go in, money go out. </connor>
<connor> Print money go in, money go out. </connor>
<connor> - What is the document where you can see </connor>
<connor> money go in, money go out transactions? </connor>
<joey> You spend money here. I
just need that document. </joey>
<joey> And they're like, </joey>
<joey> "Okay, maybe we can do that." </joey>
<joey> - Maybe.
- Maybe. </joey>
<joey> - Let's see. They go, they go, they go in. </joey>
<joey> - I gotta go talk to
the manager about that. </joey>
<joey> - Literally. Literally they
go, they talk to the manager. </joey>
<joey> They give me like two forms
to fill out and go and go. </joey>
<garnt> "So are you okay getting
this in three weeks?" </garnt>
<garnt> Um I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Is there any faster way
to get this document?" </garnt>
<garnt> And they're like, </garnt>
<garnt> "No, if you, if you want this document </garnt>
<garnt> "because you didn't sign up for it before, </garnt>
<garnt> "you have to wait three weeks </garnt>
<garnt> "and we'll send it to you. </garnt>
<garnt> "Now, do you want this document monthly? </garnt>
<garnt> "Or do you want us to like, just hold it?" </garnt>
<garnt> And then I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> "No. From now on give me this monthly." </garnt>
<garnt> because there is no other
way to obtain a statement if, </garnt>
<garnt> unless you just go to
the bank and ask for it </garnt>
<garnt> and you have </garnt>
<garnt> to ask for this option when
you sign up for a bank account, </garnt>
<garnt> or when you, </garnt>
<garnt> when you realized that
you need a bank statement </garnt>
<garnt> for whatever, you know. </garnt>
<joey> - What is the point of like </joey>
<joey> the 900 printers that
they have back there? </joey>
<garnt> - I know. </garnt>
<joey> - Like, what are you
using these printers for? </joey>
<joey> - Paper airplanes yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And so I'm waiting for this
document for like, for like, </joey>
<joey> 'cause I needed to file some stuff. </joey>
<connor> I needed a bank statement. </connor>
<connor> It took five weeks for it to get sent. </connor>
<connor> I didn't realize when
they said three weeks, </connor>
<connor> they meant three, like three, </connor>
<connor> - Three weeks minimum. </connor>
<connor> - Three weeks minimum. </connor>
<connor> Basically Japanese banks.
I don't know if we've </connor>
<garnt> just been really blessed with UK banks. </garnt>
<connor> - Our banks are really good in the UK. </connor>
<connor> The apps work amazingly. </connor>
<garnt> - The apps work amazingly. </garnt>
<garnt> You can just transfer money on an app. </garnt>
<garnt> It's pretty, it's pretty secure. </garnt>
<joey> And I can have my statements if I, </joey>
<joey> I have like three to four,
no fucking five years </joey>
<joey> worth of like bank
statements that I can have. </joey>
<garnt> - Download them in PDF. Do
whatever I want with them. </garnt>
<joey> - No Japan has those as well. </joey>
<joey> Like I use a bank currently
that has a great fucking app </joey>
<joey> and I can do transactions all on my phone. </joey>
<joey> The problem is, they're
not the major banks. </joey>
<joey> All of the major banks are like, </joey>
<joey> "You have to go in, in person, </joey>
<joey> "bring your fucking stamp and
sign like 17 pieces of paper. </joey>
<joey> "And we'll send you
something in two years." </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah because I've
wanted to transfer money </garnt>
<garnt> back to my UK account for like, since, </garnt>
<garnt> since I moved here. I just don't, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just dreading the ordeal
I have to go through just to </garnt>
<garnt> just so I can move money
from one place to another. </garnt>
<joey> - It's like a whole day event. </joey>
<garnt> - It is. It fucking is. </garnt>
<joey> - When it should be five minutes long. </joey>
<garnt> - Like every time I go to the bank, </garnt>
<garnt> I lose at least an hour or two of my life. </garnt>
<connor> - That's unfortunate that like things </connor>
<joey> that should take 10 minutes
or 15 minutes, tops, </joey>
<joey> are always like four hours in Japan. </joey>
<joey> That's where the frustration
comes from where it's like, </joey>
<joey> you've put middlemen and checks in places </joey>
<connor> where there didn't need
to be any, you know? </connor>
<joey> And it's just, </joey>
<joey> - It's like, why do you
have to ask your manager </joey>
<joey> if this dude needs a bank statement? </joey>
<joey> - Everything and anything you do, </joey>
<joey> they will always ask
the manager. It's like, </joey>
<joey> do any of your employees </joey>
<connor> have the ability to do
anything on their own? </connor>
<connor> - Are your employees like trained at all? </connor>
<connor> Just make a fucking decision for yourself. </connor>
<garnt> Jesus, what are you employed for? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah I mean like, by the
time I got the statement, </connor>
<connor> the statement was like already out of date </connor>
<joey> because it was a month
old statement. Right? </joey>
<connor> So I had, </connor>
<connor> I had to, fuck. </connor>
<connor> I like fucking begged because, </connor>
<connor> 'cause I was filling
out tax stuff and I was, </connor>
<connor> I was fucking begging my
accountant and be like, </connor>
<garnt> please let this be like, please,
please let this be usable. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I don't want to
fucking do this again. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't want to go
through this ordeal again. </garnt>
<connor> - I want to wait five weeks again. </connor>
<connor> - I think the most
frustrating part about it </connor>
<connor> is that when you're like, </connor>
<connor> please help me with this thing, </connor>
<connor> they make it seem like
you're the weird one </connor>
<connor> for like wanting to like,
make stuff go quicker </connor>
<joey> or do things simpler. </joey>
<connor> They're always like, "Why
would you want to do that? </connor>
<joey> "This is the way we do it." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. This is, this is
the, this is the way that </joey>
<connor> where it's a hundred percent success rate. </connor>
<connor> So I was like, </connor>
<joey> why else would you make it any other way? </joey>
<joey> - Well, I remember, cause I think, </joey>
<joey> I think Dogen did a video about
the Japanese banks as well. </joey>
<joey> He did and he mentioned something else </joey>
<joey> one time where he was like, </joey>
<joey> sometimes you just have
to tell them like, no. </joey>
<joey> Like just tell them no,
that's not going to work. </joey>
<connor> And then maybe be like, </connor>
<connor> you have to do this or help me do this. </connor>
<connor> And the manager might be like, okay. </connor>
<connor> But it's sad. Isn't it? </connor>
<connor> That sometimes you have
to put your foot down </connor>
<connor> to get anything done here. </connor>
<connor> It's just terrible. It's just so sad. </connor>
<joey> - It's that you have to
like pull tooth and nail </joey>
<joey> to get the best service that they offer. </joey>
<connor> - Right. Which is why I hate, </connor>
<connor> sometimes I feel bad when I ask </connor>
<connor> Japanese people to help me
with it. 'Cause if I'm like, </connor>
<connor> "Can you ask them to do this?" </connor>
<connor> Like, "No, no, no, no. </connor>
<connor> "They don't do that here." </connor>
<connor> It's like, if you have a foreigner friend </connor>
<connor> they'll at least ask, they'll be like, </connor>
<connor> "Hey, can we do this?" </connor>
<connor> But if I'm asking a
Japanese friend to help me, </connor>
<joey> like who's a hundred percent
Japanese and you know, </joey>
<joey> fluent in English somewhat, I'll ask them, </joey>
<joey> "Hey, can you ask them this?" </joey>
<joey> They'll just be, they won't even ask </joey>
<joey> 'cause they'll be like, </joey>
<joey> "No, no, no, no. You can't ask them that". </joey>
<joey> I mean look, just ask, just ask. </joey>
<connor> Like try, you know. I don't know like, </connor>
<connor> - That's such a Japanese way
of thinking though. Right? </connor>
<joey> Because they don't want to,
like embarrass themselves. </joey>
<connor> - They don't want to ask
questions that they feel, </connor>
<joey> they already know the answers
to because they feel like that </joey>
<joey> that's like humiliating at times. </joey>
<connor> Whereas I think I always
have the mindset of </connor>
<connor> there's no harm in asking. </connor>
<garnt> - Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah I, I never thought
I would go to a place </garnt>
<garnt> where it's like, it's like a 50/50 on </garnt>
<connor> whether you'd be able to get </connor>
<garnt> a fucking credit or debit card. Right? </garnt>
<connor> - Well I got rejected for all my cards </connor>
<garnt> in the start. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly. Right? </garnt>
<garnt> - I had to apply two, no. </garnt>
<connor> Two or three times until I
finally got a debit card. </connor>
<connor> - Really? Fucking hell. </connor>
<connor> - And it was like the worst one. </connor>
<garnt> - So, so yeah. So in Japan, right? </garnt>
<connor> When, whenever you sign
up to a bank account </connor>
<connor> in most countries that I know, </connor>
<connor> you get a fucking debit card. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah you too. This is so, </connor>
<connor> - Yeah yeah. So, </connor>
<connor> in most other countries
you get a debit card </connor>
<connor> in which you can spend your money, </connor>
<garnt> which you put in your bank. </garnt>
<garnt> In Japan. they're like, </garnt>
<garnt> "We do not do that here." </garnt>
<connor> - We do not want you spending your money. </connor>
<garnt> - We'll give you a bank card. </garnt>
<joey> - Well, they will give you a cash card, </joey>
<joey> - A cash card yeah. </joey>
<joey> - In which you can take
out money at the ATM </joey>
<joey> and also charge you a fee for
taking money out of the ATM. </joey>
<joey> So when you go to the, </joey>
<garnt> when you go to the ATM and get money out, </garnt>
<garnt> you better be taking a
large amount of money out. </garnt>
<garnt> Otherwise you'd just be
like fucked for fees. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh, by the way, </connor>
<connor> you can't pay with anything
with the cash card. </connor>
<connor> This cash card can only be used
to take out cash from ATMs. </connor>
<connor> You also can't take out any
money with your debit card. </connor>
<connor> Debit card can only be
used to pay with things. </connor>
<garnt> - Yes. Of Which if you
apply for a debit card, </garnt>
<garnt> you have the possibility
of being rejected. </garnt>
<garnt> I, like, why? Why? Why? </garnt>
<connor> Like credit cards, maybe? </connor>
<connor> - I understand credit cards
'cause it's like, you know, </connor>
<connor> you're using their money. </connor>
<garnt> - But like for most countries I know like </garnt>
<connor> fucking America, </connor>
<connor> they give out credit cards
like they give out free candy. </connor>
<connor> You know like, </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah. Same in the UK, same. </connor>
<connor> - Same in the UK like, </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause they want you to get in debt. </connor>
<connor> So they can make your life hell, </connor>
<connor> take you for all the money. </connor>
<connor> - It's like, "Do you
have a pulse? Brilliant. </connor>
<connor> "Here's a 2000 pound debit", </connor>
<garnt> - You joke but that's how it is. </garnt>
<connor> - That is how it is. </connor>
<connor> - All the credit card companies </connor>
<connor> make all their money off the people who </connor>
<connor> are failing to pay back
their credit cards. </connor>
<garnt> Like that's where they
make all their money from. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah in Japan, it's just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh, you want to pay for
stuff not using cash?" </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know what, I don't
know about that one chief. </garnt>
<connor> - It's like, if </connor>
<connor> I'm paying for like my
rent or something or I pay. </connor>
<connor> I don't want to pay in cash.
Why do you make me pay in cash? </connor>
<connor> This is like $1000. Don't
make me carry $1000 around. </connor>
<joey> I don't want to do that. </joey>
<joey> - After paying the ATM fee. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah so like, I tried
to buy a new camera </joey>
<connor> and my card, my debit
card had a limit on it. </connor>
<connor> I didn't know that. </connor>
<connor> How do I change the limit? </connor>
<connor> Gotta fucking call them up haven't I? </connor>
<connor> Oh for fuck's sake. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Of course you do. </connor>
<connor> - There's not an app
or anything I gotta do. </connor>
<connor> I gotta call them up, explain to them. </connor>
<connor> And they're like, </connor>
<connor> "Why would you want to
increase the limit?" </connor>
<connor> None of your fucking business
why I want to increase. </connor>
<connor> It's my money. I want to
use it. What do you mean? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah it's, it's, </garnt>
<garnt> it's like now that I've
lived here for like </garnt>
<garnt> one and a half years, I've realized that </garnt>
<garnt> it would be more convenient for me to use </garnt>
<garnt> my foreign card here
than it would have been </garnt>
<joey> to like set everything up. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause like the fees that they charge you, </joey>
<joey> whenever you take money
out, it's exactly the same, </joey>
<joey> like it's about the same fees they use. </joey>
<joey> - Sometimes. </joey>
<joey> - Sometimes yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And the only real difference I feel </joey>
<connor> is like the exchange rate. </connor>
<connor> You know, that, that
obviously goes up and down. </connor>
<garnt> - You get fucked by the exchange rates. </garnt>
<garnt> That's why I always, </garnt>
<garnt> that's why I wanted the
debit card. 'Cause I was, </garnt>
<garnt> I was like losing a lot
of money 'cause I was, </garnt>
<joey> I was having to use my, </joey>
<joey> my British card and I
was just losing money </joey>
<joey> on exchange rates and fees. </joey>
<joey> - Because the pound is so
strong compared to the yen. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah like right now, </joey>
<joey> I want to use as much yen as possible </joey>
<joey> because the rest of my money is in pounds </joey>
<connor> and it's really strong and
I don't want to use that. </connor>
<connor> I want to get rid of the
weak money that I have like, </connor>
<connor> spend it all, spend it. </connor>
<garnt> - But like in, in that
case it would be like, </garnt>
<connor> it's way more convenient to
use like a third party company, </connor>
<connor> like Revolut or like
TransferWise, like get it. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause you can actually
get like a physical card </connor>
<connor> where you put money into this account. </connor>
<connor> - Well yeah I used to have one. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<connor> - I used to have a card but
when the UK left the EU, </connor>
<joey> I lost that card and then they
stopped banking within the UK </joey>
<joey> so I had the one good card that I had </joey>
<joey> that was perfect for transferring </joey>
<connor> for using foreign exchange was
just useless after a while. </connor>
<joey> Big sad. </joey>
<joey> - Well look at us talking
like adults about credit cards </joey>
<connor> and banks and whatnot. </connor>
<joey> - Well it's just sad because </joey>
<connor> they've made a system that
makes it hell at every turn </connor>
<garnt> and you need to answer for
every, like little things </garnt>
<garnt> that you've just like, comfort </garnt>
<garnt> or you have to explain why you want them. </garnt>
<joey> I shouldn't have to explain to you </joey>
<joey> why I want to up the limit
on my card. Like that, </joey>
<connor> that should be a me. Why do
I have to tell you? Like, </connor>
<connor> well I'm getting interrogated </connor>
<connor> because I want to buy a fucking
camera. Like, what is this? </connor>
<connor> I don't like this. I, I, </connor>
<connor> it's not that I don't mind telling them. </connor>
<connor> I'm like it's for a camera. </connor>
<connor> But the fact that I have to
answer to you, like, like what? </connor>
<connor> Like if it's for like a
couch that you don't like, </connor>
<connor> you'll say no, fuck you? </connor>
<joey> - That's an ugly ass couch. Fuck that. </joey>
<connor> - Yo send me the link.
Let me check this out. </connor>
<connor> Yo really? The thread count
on those sheets suck bro. </connor>
<connor> I'm not upping the card. What? What the? </connor>
<connor> Why are you asking me this? Is there, </connor>
<connor> is there a situation where you like, </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna launder my money. </connor>
<connor> Well then of course
you're going to say no, </connor>
<connor> 'cause I'm fucking doing
something illegal. When, </connor>
<connor> why is this ever going to work? Like, </connor>
<connor> what is this point of this question? </connor>
<connor> Don't ask me this shit. </connor>
<connor> You're making conversation.
If so fucking stop. </connor>
<garnt> - We want like UK banks. </garnt>
<garnt> I just got a text the
other day being like, </garnt>
<garnt> "We've upped the limit
on your credit card." </garnt>
<connor> And I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> Well, I didn't ask, but. </connor>
<connor> (hosts laughing) </connor>
<connor> I guess. </connor>
<garnt> - Cheers. </garnt>
<garnt> - Cheers. </garnt>
<garnt> - But UK banks are always really good. </garnt>
<connor> They update me all the time
you know. The app is fantastic. </connor>
<connor> I can transfer money to anyone.
No questions asked you know. </connor>
<joey> - Well, I mean like
fucking bank apps are like, </joey>
<connor> I think only, maybe like
a thing that was invented </connor>
<connor> two or three years ago here. </connor>
<joey> When I first moved here like
none of the banks had an app. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. Did you have online
banking when you moved here? </garnt>
<garnt> - No. </garnt>
<joey> Literally I and I still don't
have it here because it's a, </joey>
<joey> because it's fucking horrible. </joey>
<connor> - I don't know how to transfer
money online in Japan. </connor>
<joey> I still haven't figured
it out. I don't know. </joey>
<joey> - Well I mean, some banks
don't even let you do it. </joey>
<garnt> I don't even know if it's possible. </garnt>
<connor> All I know is that
somehow when I buy things, </connor>
<garnt> - Have you been able to log
in into your online banking? </garnt>
<connor> - I've logged in. </connor>
<connor> So the online banking that
I have to send money is like </connor>
<connor> I, okay. I have logged into my bank, </connor>
<connor> but if I want to send money, </connor>
<connor> it's through like a different,
it's through my card. </connor>
<connor> It's really weird. Again, this whole shit. </connor>
<connor> It's been separated. </connor>
<connor> I don't understand what's going on. </connor>
<connor> It doesn't make any sense. </connor>
<connor> Japanese banks suck, please, please. </connor>
<connor> This is why, if you're a
tourist, you got it lucky man, </connor>
<connor> you don't have to deal with this stuff. </connor>
<connor> This is why everyone says Japan
is the best place to visit, </connor>
<connor> worst place to, not
worst place to live but. </connor>
<connor> - No, it's, it's, it's
an amazing place to live. </connor>
<garnt> - It's an amazing place to live. </garnt>
<garnt> There's just a lot of things
that I took for granted </garnt>
<garnt> that I thought were just
little conveniences or just, </garnt>
<garnt> just the way the world works </garnt>
<garnt> in first world countries I guess. </garnt>
<connor> - You get mega angry
and then you go outside, </connor>
<garnt> you go to Matsuya and you get
your matsuya and you're like, </garnt>
<joey> Nice. All right. </joey>
<joey> - Lots of little distractions </joey>
<connor> - It's all worth it but for that one day </connor>
<connor> when you're dealing with this stuff, </connor>
<garnt> you're like, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm finna book a flight home. </garnt>
<connor> I'm getting real tired of this. </connor>
<connor> - Actually no, 'cause it's not just Japan. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause, 'cause I've lived
in Thailand as well. </connor>
<garnt> And even they've got their
banking system more convenient </garnt>
<connor> than they do. And I've
got, I got, I have an app. </connor>
<garnt> That's all I can transfer my
money in my Thai bank account </garnt>
<garnt> to my Japanese bank
account if I wanted to, </garnt>
<garnt> I can't do that in Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> And Japan is a first world country. </garnt>
<garnt> Thailand is like a second world country. </garnt>
<connor> - When I left the UK, </connor>
<connor> closing everything and
getting everything all sorted, </connor>
<joey> moving, everything I needed to do. </joey>
<joey> I did everything in like half a day. </joey>
<connor> Just making phone calls, just being like, </connor>
<connor> "Hey, can I do this? I'm, I'm leaving." </connor>
<connor> They're like, "Oh yeah,
totally fine okay." </connor>
<connor> Can I do blah blah blah? </connor>
<connor> Yeah, it's all good. </connor>
<joey> Or every phone call lasted
like at most, the whole, </joey>
<joey> the being on hold took
longer than the phone call. </joey>
<joey> It was like, it's so easy. </joey>
<connor> Like it's, it's so frustrating. </connor>
<joey> - Whereas here it's
like, oh you're moving? </joey>
<connor> - Oh you're moving? That's
a whole month process. </connor>
<joey> That's not because you got to
unpack and move stuff around, </joey>
<joey> that's because you got to go to the, </joey>
<joey> - You gotta call up and go to
fucking in store everywhere. </joey>
<joey> It's ridiculous. </joey>
<connor> - So absurd. So again, we complain a lot </connor>
<connor> about these aspects of Japan, </connor>
<joey> but you know, </joey>
<joey> we are very grateful to Japan
for allowing us to be here. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, there's a reason
why you don't just leave. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah we love it. You know, </garnt>
<garnt> - We're probably going to stay here for. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm going to be living
in Japan for a long time. </garnt>
<joey> I just, you know, I think
that when you live in a place, </joey>
<joey> you have the right to
complain about certain things. </joey>
<joey> - Absolutely. </joey>
<connor> - I complain about everywhere equally. </connor>
<joey> You everywhere socks, everywhere sucks. </joey>
<joey> - Exactly. There's no utopian country. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> And so, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't want people to get the idea </garnt>
<connor> that we're not fucking grateful. </connor>
<connor> Or we're not like happy. </connor>
<joey> - Because sometimes we get
comments like that sometimes. </joey>
<joey> - We do get comments like that sometimes. </joey>
<joey> And we are very happy here in Japan. </joey>
<joey> - We're just being real
with you guys that's all. </joey>
<joey> - We just, we just like to complain </joey>
<garnt> about the little things. </garnt>
<joey> You guys like it when
we're annoyed about shit. </joey>
<joey> That's why we're annoyed about shit. </joey>
<connor> - If you guys are going
to move to Japan. I, </connor>
<connor> I want to be honest with you </connor>
<joey> and tell you what's going to be fun </joey>
<joey> and what's gonna suck. </joey>
<connor> - There's going to be, </connor>
<connor> there's going to be lots of </connor>
<garnt> fucking great things about it, </garnt>
<garnt> but just be prepared for
those little conveniences. </garnt>
<joey> - Whenever you have to do
anything to do with like </joey>
<joey> Japanese bureaucracy or just setting, </joey>
<joey> setting up your living situation. I, I, </joey>
<joey> - You will be writing your name, address, </joey>
<joey> and phone number more times
than you'll ever think. </joey>
<garnt> - You will lose at least a
week just trying to figure out. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah I think that's
the thing that annoys me. </joey>
<joey> In the UK when I had to deal
with this stuff, it was, </joey>
<joey> it was maybe an hour
out of my day at most. </joey>
<joey> And I'd get on with my day. </joey>
<connor> If it happens here, it
derails your whole week, </connor>
<connor> like it takes a completely, </connor>
<connor> you have to reschedule everything, </connor>
<connor> cancel everything you're doing </connor>
<joey> because you've got a call from the bank </joey>
<joey> and they said that your card is canceled </joey>
<joey> and they didn't tell you
until now it's canceled. </joey>
<connor> - I just remembered, like, </connor>
<connor> I don't know if you guys have in the UK, </connor>
<connor> but like in Japanese
and Australian airports, </connor>
<joey> there's like sometimes
that service where like, </joey>
<joey> you know how on your suitcase, </joey>
<connor> you can put like a belt around
it so it doesn't burst open. </connor>
<connor> Some people forget that or,
you know, don't buy that. </connor>
<connor> - I've never had to use that. </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<connor> - So instead you can, like, </connor>
<connor> you can use a service that
you can like wrap up your bag </connor>
<connor> in like plastic. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] I see that in the UK. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - In Australia it's like
10 seconds you just like, </connor>
<connor> wrap this up. Here's the money. </connor>
<connor> They do it. All right. See you later. </connor>
<connor> I did it in Haneda once in Japan. </connor>
<connor> And they were like, </connor>
<connor> "Okay, can you fill out this form? </connor>
<connor> "Write your name, address
and phone number." </connor>
<joey> I'm like, I'm never
going to see you again. </joey>
<connor> Just wrap up my goddamn bag. </connor>
<connor> - Get the fucking cling
film out, wrap it around </connor>
<connor> and I'll give you 20 bucks. </connor>
<joey> - I like deadass, I looked
at this woman. I was like, </joey>
<connor> what do you need this for? </connor>
<connor> Like, why do you need to know my name, </connor>
<connor> phone number and address? </connor>
<connor> And they're like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh you know, like just in case." </connor>
<joey> I'm like, because you're
wrapping my bag in plastic. </joey>
<connor> - I'm a customer. </connor>
<connor> I will do it myself.
Give me the cling film. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah give me the cling wrap. </connor>
<connor> I'll fucking do it myself. </connor>
<connor> - I will pay you to not fill in that form. </connor>
<connor> - It was ridiculous. </connor>
<connor> - It's frustrating, man. </connor>
<joey> - And I just wasted, like, you know, </joey>
<joey> two minutes of my life filling
out this form, that for one, </joey>
<connor> I don't even know what
they're going to use it for, </connor>
<joey> but second of all, completely unnecessary. </joey>
<joey> - It's just frustrating </joey>
<connor> giving out your whole
fucking information to, </connor>
<connor> to shit that you feel like it
just totally doesn't need it. </connor>
<connor> Like, I just don't want to deal with that. </connor>
<connor> I hate doing that. </connor>
<joey> - But it's also like, you
know, I feel as well like, </joey>
<joey> there's so many situations </joey>
<joey> where you're canceling
something or, you know, </joey>
<connor> you're upgrading something. Right? </connor>
<connor> And you're just like, </connor>
<connor> "All right, can you write your
phone number and address?" </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, </connor>
<connor> I'm pretty sure all my
information is on system. </connor>
<joey> Just look it up. I'll
give you my fucking name. </joey>
<joey> Just look it up. </joey>
<connor> - If it changes, I'll let you know. </connor>
<joey> I'll keep you updated. </joey>
<connor> - Like how often do you think </connor>
<garnt> I'm changing my name and address? </garnt>
<garnt> - Like one, one thing I'm
fucking dreading when we move, </garnt>
<connor> because we're all planning to
move from where we are now. </connor>
<connor> I mean, you're already
in process of moving </connor>
<connor> is just the process of </connor>
<connor> changing my address in
every bill that I've had. </connor>
<connor> And I'm just, I wake up
in a cold sweat at night </connor>
<joey> sometimes being like, </joey>
<garnt> I gotta do that. I gotta do that. </garnt>
<connor> - I have been suffering
for the past month on that </connor>
<joey> and it shouldn't be a suffering thing. </joey>
<connor> - It just sucks because I feel like </connor>
<connor> your life just comes to a
halt for a month because </connor>
<connor> they've designed systems that make it so. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. And it's got nothing
to do with like, you know, </joey>
<joey> people who don't understand the language, </joey>
<connor> having a hard time, no. </connor>
<joey> Even if you're fully Japanese, </joey>
<joey> it's still hard as shit to do. </joey>
<joey> And it shouldn't be that hard to do. </joey>
<connor> - Like you get pretty good
customer service in most aspects </connor>
<connor> of, of Japanese life I think. </connor>
<connor> But for some reason with
personal information companies, </connor>
<connor> I feel like it comes to
a halt and it doesn't, </connor>
<connor> it doesn't improve at all. </connor>
<joey> The customer service
isn't any better for it. </joey>
<joey> I think that's why I think </joey>
<joey> Japan has one of the lowest
productivities out of, </joey>
<joey> of first world countries. </joey>
<joey> - I'm not surprised. </joey>
<joey> - Because they work the most. </joey>
<joey> - We would have flying cars by now. </joey>
<joey> - They work more hours
than any other country </joey>
<connor> and have less to show for
it. You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> Like, you know, I think
in some European countries </connor>
<connor> they're considering a
four day workweek even, </connor>
<connor> and you know I was just like, fantastic. </connor>
<joey> - You bring that up to
government officials in Japan </joey>
<connor> they're like. </connor>
<connor> "How does, how does that country run?" </connor>
<connor> "How is that not a third world country?" </connor>
<connor> "How's their economy not
crumbling to the ground?" </connor>
<connor> - Again. It's just
like, how do you fix it? </connor>
<connor> When everything in society has
been made to be long-winded, </connor>
<connor> bloated and slow? Like, what do you do? </connor>
<joey> Like how do you fix that? </joey>
<connor> 'Cause it's like a whole
cultural thing at that point. </connor>
<connor> - Well this is a country where, </connor>
<connor> a lot of schools are
still six days a week. </connor>
<joey> It's ridiculous. Let alone
four day workweek what? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah I mean, </joey>
<connor> it took like a fucking
global pandemic, right? </connor>
<connor> For the country to
embrace working from home </connor>
<garnt> and online meetings. Right? </garnt>
<joey> It's like. </joey>
<joey> - They were throwing out
like the buzzword of like </joey>
<connor> home workstation or whatever
the fuck it was like, </connor>
<connor> it was a new thing that was
just invented. It's like, </connor>
<connor> we've come up with this
revolutionary thing. </connor>
<connor> Get this, you can work from home. </connor>
<connor> And Japanese people
are like, "Impossible." </connor>
<connor> That that is. </connor>
<connor> - Telework. </connor>
<connor> - Telework that's it. </connor>
<connor> - Telework. </connor>
<connor> - They call it telework. </connor>
<joey> - I think also, I think they're now </joey>
<joey> slowly starting to phase
out the hanko because of it. </joey>
<connor> They're finally putting in like, </connor>
<connor> the government they're
bringing it up. And trying. </connor>
<garnt> - Have we ever explained
hankos? I don't think we have. </garnt>
<joey> - Hanko are basically, is
like the, it's like a stamp </joey>
<joey> essentially that has your
surname on it or, you know, </joey>
<joey> company name or whatever. </joey>
<joey> Basically it's the Japanese
equivalent of a signature. </joey>
<joey> But incredibly tedious. </joey>
<garnt> - It's incredibly tedious because </garnt>
<garnt> that means you have to
carry your hanko everywhere. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Whenever you're like, if you forget. </joey>
<joey> - I've had moments where I'm like, </joey>
<joey> I have everything except the hanko </joey>
<joey> and they just don't accept it. </joey>
<joey> And I'm just like, this is a
stamp I bought at Don Quijote. </joey>
<garnt> for like 200 yen. </garnt>
<connor> Don Quijote is like the dollar shop here. </connor>
<garnt> You can, you can just
get it at a dollar shop. </garnt>
<connor> - Imagine your name is Connor, right? </connor>
<connor> And then, you know, you can, you know, </connor>
<connor> you can go those gift shops </connor>
<connor> and they have like the license plates, </connor>
<connor> like Connor. It's like that. </connor>
<connor> Like imagine you just go to the store, </connor>
<connor> you find your name on the license plate </connor>
<connor> and then you bring it and go look, </connor>
<connor> it's my name. It's my
name, take a picture. </connor>
<connor> - The thing is, is like, I, </connor>
<joey> I wrote up a thing as to why
Japan still uses the hanko </joey>
<connor> and not signatures and
the most accepted like, </connor>
<connor> excuse, I guess, </connor>
<connor> I'm just going to call
it an excuse as they, </connor>
<connor> as why they don't use
signatures, they were like, </connor>
<joey> "Well, anyone can copy a signature." </joey>
<connor> Anyone can go to Don
Quijote and buy a $2 stamp. </connor>
<joey> What are you on? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. It's so dumb. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. I mean, if you have a popular name. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - What happens if you have
a popular name, right? </garnt>
<connor> - What is it? What is it? </connor>
<joey> What's the one that you see,
Tanaka? Is that the one? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah Tanaka or like
Sato or like any of like </joey>
<joey> the common ones. </joey>
<connor> - Everyone probably, </connor>
<joey> every Sato probably has </joey>
<connor> the same fucking Don Quijote stamp. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, this is bullshit. </connor>
<joey> Like signature is way harder
to copy than buying a stamp. </joey>
<garnt> - Did you hear about the
fucking Josh battle royale </garnt>
<joey> that happened recently? </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] Yeah yeah. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] What? </joey>
<joey> - [connor] Did you hear about this? </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] No. </joey>
<joey> - So like, I think like a year ago, </joey>
<connor> some guy in like some state or something, </connor>
<connor> he looked up every, he was, his name was, </connor>
<connor> - Josh Swain. Josh Swain. </connor>
<connor> - Josh Wayne? </connor>
<joey> - Josh Swain. </joey>
<joey> - Josh Swain. </joey>
<connor> He looked up like every Josh on Facebook </connor>
<connor> in his area and added
them to a group right? </connor>
<connor> And he just sends a message, </connor>
<connor> "Guys. You know why we're here." </connor>
<connor> - We're going to battle
for name Josh Swain. </connor>
<connor> - [connor] There are already Joshes here. </connor>
<connor> We are going to have a
battle royale and whoever, </connor>
<garnt> whoever emerges victorious
can keep the name Josh. </garnt>
<connor> - So that's how it works with hankos. </connor>
<garnt> - There's literally a movie. </garnt>
<garnt> - I feel like they have to
do that with hankos right? </garnt>
<garnt> - There's literally </garnt>
<garnt> a fucking battle royale movie in Japan </garnt>
<garnt> where it's that exact same concept. </garnt>
<garnt> - Is it really? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah yeah. It's called, it's called </garnt>
<garnt> "Riaru Onigokko", "Real Tag" </garnt>
<garnt> where basically it's, </garnt>
<connor> it's like a survival horror movie. </connor>
<connor> It's actually a really
good movie and book, </connor>
<connor> but basically in the it's
set in like the future </connor>
<connor> where the king of Japan, his name is Sato, </connor>
<connor> which is the most common surname in Japan. </connor>
<connor> And he's like, </connor>
<connor> "I want to be the only Sato." </connor>
<connor> So what he does is
every night at midnight, </connor>
<garnt> he's like all of the Satos in the country </garnt>
<garnt> have to come out. </garnt>
<garnt> - He picks legend game. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. Literally. </garnt>
<garnt> And they're like, and they're like. </garnt>
<connor> "To all Satos of Japan.
There are too many of you. </connor>
<connor> "So we're going to get
rid of some of you." </connor>
<connor> And it's like literally
a survival horror movie </connor>
<connor> where all the Satos are
like running for their life, </connor>
<connor> not to get fucking eliminated. </connor>
<connor> - That sounds epic. I want to watch this. </connor>
<connor> - It's a great fucking movie. Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - It sounds like an anime. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it really does. </joey>
<connor> No, it's a great movie, but
it's literally like that. </connor>
<connor> - I'm just trying to think.
Is there anything in like </connor>
<connor> UK or Australia that is like
unnecessarily like slow? </connor>
<garnt> I feel like we just kind of get rid of it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Internet. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, we've already
complained about that. </garnt>
<garnt> - I feel like as in like
the systems that we have. </garnt>
<connor> I don't really think there's
anything that's like, </connor>
<connor> everything's been like easy to do. </connor>
<joey> - Like I didn't really have
experience living on my own </joey>
<connor> in Australia. So I can't
really say much about. </connor>
<joey> - I mean in the UK everything
that could be done online </joey>
<joey> is done online. You know, I, </joey>
<joey> I cannot even, </joey>
<joey> I don't even think I ever
went anywhere in person </joey>
<joey> for anything like government. </joey>
<joey> Like it could all be done
by phone or by online. </joey>
<joey> Water bill, internet, phone, </joey>
<connor> government documents like local tax. </connor>
<connor> Like all of it was done online. </connor>
<joey> - I think the only thing
really is like, you know, </joey>
<joey> going to get like a driver's license fixed </joey>
<joey> or something right? </joey>
<joey> Like you probably have
to go in person for that. </joey>
<connor> - Even then in the UK you can, </connor>
<connor> you can get it mailed to you. </connor>
<garnt> - When I renewed my driver's license, </garnt>
<connor> I literally just sent, sent
them the license in the mail, </connor>
<joey> uploaded a scan of my picture </joey>
<joey> and then they just renewed it for me. </joey>
<garnt> - Okay. You can't do that in Australia. </garnt>
<garnt> - We've really been like, </garnt>
<garnt> the UK has gotten really
good at making things, </garnt>
<garnt> - It's efficient. I guess I
just took that for granted. </garnt>
<joey> Right? </joey>
<joey> - You sure did connor. You sure did. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah yeah yeah. </joey>
<joey> - You're like, "Everywhere's like this". </joey>
<joey> - Like I'm, I'm like, I thank God </joey>
<garnt> that we're signed with GeeXPlus </garnt>
<garnt> and they handle our tax. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> 'Cause like, </joey>
<joey> - Oh God. I can only imagine doing. </joey>
<connor> I've heard horror stories. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, I did my tax
before joining GeeXPlus </joey>
<connor> and it was the fucking worst. </connor>
<connor> If you are a freelancer in Japan, </connor>
<connor> good luck doing tax. </connor>
<joey> - I've heard. I've heard that
freelance tax forms in Japan </joey>
<joey> are the worst thing,
- It is godawful. </joey>
<garnt> - Doing tax in the UK is bad enough. </garnt>
<connor> And I'm just like, if, if that was bad, </connor>
<joey> how was it in fucking Japan? </joey>
<garnt> - God awful. I hate it. I regret it. </garnt>
<garnt> - I thought it was bad in the UK, </garnt>
<connor> but not now I look back at
how doing taxes in the UK, </connor>
<connor> like everything can be
done online. From home. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah everything can
be done online at home. </connor>
<connor> - It's pretty good. There's
an app you know, like. </connor>
<joey> - In Japan you have to take a
fucking bag full of receipts </joey>
<connor> to like the town ward and like scan. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] No. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, go through all of them
and like fill it in yourself. </connor>
<joey> - [Connor] Oh my. </joey>
<joey> - It is the worst. </joey>
<joey> That's why, </joey>
<joey> that's why there's no freelancers in Japan </joey>
<joey> because they're like, </joey>
<garnt> "Fuck that. I don't want
to deal with that shit. </garnt>
<garnt> "I'll join a company." </garnt>
<joey> - That's so sad. </joey>
<joey> - That's the worst. </joey>
<joey> - I will say though,
that it was pretty cool </joey>
<joey> the first time I discovered
the hanko and it, you know, </joey>
<connor> - It's cool for 10 seconds
until it becomes a burden. </connor>
<connor> - It's, it's cool for like the first week </connor>
<connor> you're living here in
here when you're like, </connor>
<connor> "Ooh, I'm stamping my" </connor>
<connor> - "I'm part of Japan now. </connor>
<connor> "I'm part of the culture here guys". </connor>
<joey> - "Let me, let me put my signature per." </joey>
<garnt> - "Look at my clan. It's
the Maneetapho clan." </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause that's what it feels like. Right? </garnt>
<garnt> When you're fucking stamping
your second name down, </garnt>
<joey> you're like, </joey>
<joey> - Bro this is like a
really like traditional, </joey>
<connor> like kind of swirly like </connor>
<garnt> feudal Japan style stamp. It looks dope. </garnt>
<joey> - It looks dope. I could, </joey>
<garnt> I could see why they haven't
like gotten rid of it. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause it feels like I feel cultured </garnt>
<connor> as I'm stamping my fucking name down. </connor>
<connor> You know, you know when you see like </connor>
<connor> an old, in old films where you know, </connor>
<connor> they're writing a letter
and they fucking stamp down </connor>
<connor> the wax.
- The wax. </connor>
<connor> - That's what it feels like every time I, </connor>
<connor> every time I stamp down my hanko. </connor>
<connor> But then it gets to a point where </connor>
<connor> you live here for a year </connor>
<connor> and you're just like, </connor>
<connor> "Fuck's sake. </connor>
<connor> "Can we not just go back to signatures?" </connor>
<garnt> - Just give me a pen. </garnt>
<connor> - You know, you stamp it. </connor>
<connor> And they're like, </connor>
<connor> "No, it's not good enough. </connor>
<connor> "You haven't stamped it good enough." </connor>
<connor> - I'm like, what do you
mean? I can read it. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, it's slightly crooked. </connor>
<joey> Can you fill it in again, please? </joey>
<joey> - If it's slightly crooked, </joey>
<joey> and if there's slightly
not enough ink on it, </joey>
<garnt> they just won't accept it. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah well so I remember, I filled out </connor>
<connor> like this three page document </connor>
<connor> and I made one mistake and
I did the line through it. </connor>
<connor> And the guy at the driving
lesson place is like, </connor>
<connor> "You gotta redo it all." </connor>
<joey> I'm like, why? </joey>
<joey> "You made a mistake.
You got to redo it all." </joey>
<garnt> - I'm like you can't
cross things out here. </garnt>
<joey> - I'm like, I crossed it
out right there. It's, </joey>
<joey> - A hundred percent
accuracy only in Japan. </joey>
<connor> - I'm like, what do you, what do you mean? </connor>
<connor> You can clearly, </connor>
<joey> - There is no any percentage in Japan </joey>
<joey> only a hundred percent wrong. </joey>
<connor> - I'm like you can clearly make out </connor>
<connor> that there is absolutely no problem here. </connor>
<connor> You know that I don't mean
the thing that I crossed out </connor>
<connor> and you know the thing,
what I meant to put. </connor>
<connor> Why are you going to make me fill out </connor>
<connor> this three page document again?
Because I made one mistake. </connor>
<connor> It's like, it's like, </connor>
<connor> everything is a fucking like trapeze act </connor>
<connor> where if you fuck up, you've
got to redo your whole life. </connor>
<connor> Born. Do life again. Reset life. </connor>
<garnt> - Jesus. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah only perfection here. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm surprised that they you know, </connor>
<connor> when you fill out a
document wrong they're like, </connor>
<joey> "Nope, no license for
you. Come back next day. </joey>
<joey> "Gotta redo it again." </joey>
<garnt> - Basically, if you want to live in Japan, </garnt>
<connor> I hope you like filling
out forms because you are, </connor>
<joey> - Correctly. </joey>
<joey> - Correctly because you are </joey>
<joey> - No mistakes. </joey>
<joey> - Expect perfection in every way. </joey>
<garnt> - Moving here is kind of like
Form Simulator 2021 honestly. </garnt>
<connor> - So Papers, Please but every day. </connor>
<connor> (hosts laughing) </connor>
<connor> It's exhausting, man. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. That's, </garnt>
<garnt> that's kind of why like I'm dreading </garnt>
<garnt> these next few months when we
move studios and move houses. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm going to be in a
foul mood in like October </connor>
<joey> when I have to move, </joey>
<joey> I'm just gonna not want to talk to anyone. </joey>
<joey> Like fuck you. </joey>
<joey> Yeah if we're complaining now about this, </joey>
<garnt> when we actually start moving, my God, </garnt>
<garnt> our podcast show will be
so much more depressing. </garnt>
<connor> - 'Cause I know I'm going
to lose at least a week </connor>
<connor> just from this alone. So, sorry. </connor>
<connor> Sorry if you don't get any
videos for like that month. </connor>
<joey> - My fucking video schedules is like </joey>
<joey> the slowest it's ever been. </joey>
<joey> - Because of this shit. </joey>
<joey> - Because of this shit. </joey>
<joey> It's, it's, it shouldn't
shouldn't be like that. </joey>
<connor> It's ridiculous. </connor>
<connor> - How do, </connor>
<connor> how do normal people
who work nine to five? </connor>
<connor> Oh, sorry. I mean, sorry. </connor>
<connor> Nine to 12 in Japan. </connor>
<connor> How do they have time to do this stuff? </connor>
<connor> I don't understand because
people don't stop working here </connor>
<connor> and stuff closes on weekends here. </connor>
<connor> So what do they do? I don't understand. </connor>
<connor> - They take paid leave. </connor>
<connor> - [Meilyne] They take a week off. </connor>
<connor> - They take a week off, are you serious? </connor>
<garnt> - They take a week off to move.
Don't they only have by law </garnt>
<garnt> a week of paid holiday anyway? </garnt>
<joey> - [Meilyne] No, no, no.
They get like 20 days. </joey>
<joey> - 20 whole days in a year. </joey>
<joey> - So you lose what, like five. </joey>
<joey> You lose a quarter of your paid holiday </joey>
<joey> if you want to move here in Japan. </joey>
<joey> - Japan, the country
where moving is a luxury, </joey>
<connor> - If you want to do anything in Japan, </connor>
<connor> you got to take a day off
to call them up and do it. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> - It's ridiculous. </connor>
<connor> Oh, you know you can't, </connor>
<connor> you want to change your phone provider. </connor>
<connor> You've got to take a day
off work. How weird is that? </connor>
<connor> What the fuck? It's weird. </connor>
<connor> - The fact that you can't just do it </connor>
<connor> like during a lunch break is ridiculous. </connor>
<garnt> - It's tragic. It's tragic.
It really is tragic. </garnt>
<garnt> - So as someone who
has moved before, Joey, </garnt>
<garnt> what is the moving experience
like here in Japan? </garnt>
<garnt> - Hell. </garnt>
<joey> In one word. </joey>
<garnt> - 'Cause you already moved
once here in Japan right? </garnt>
<garnt> - I've moved twice now. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, you've moved twice. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah so the place I'm about to move to </connor>
<joey> will be my fourth place. </joey>
<connor> - Oh shit. Okay. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - You moved twice, but
you've had four places? </connor>
<joey> - Well, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - How does that work? </connor>
<connor> - Well, I mean, I mean, </connor>
<connor> I moved in here and then I
moved two separate times. </connor>
<connor> - Oh okay.
- Oh okay. </connor>
<connor> - Sorry sorry. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I was like, wait those
numbers don't add up. </connor>
<garnt> - Two plus two equals four. </garnt>
<joey> - Well, the first time I moved, </joey>
<joey> when I moved from Australia to Japan, </joey>
<connor> it was a lot easier for
me because I had help. </connor>
<connor> I had help from my, like my auntie. </connor>
<connor> So she did all the paperwork for me. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I didn't know fucking how to do it. </connor>
<connor> But then she was like, all right, </connor>
<connor> well now you know how to do it. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, What? Do I? </connor>
<connor> Do I? </connor>
<joey> - It's like when someone
builds a PC for you. </joey>
<garnt> Like great. You can do it on your own now. </garnt>
<joey> - Like you've passed the tutorial stage. </joey>
<joey> - But I hope you were paying attention. </joey>
<garnt> I'm like, thanks. </garnt>
<joey> - Expert mode begin. </joey>
<joey> - It's not even like a, </joey>
<joey> "Would you like to listen
to that again?" option. </joey>
<connor> It's just like, I hope you were listening. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. So the first time
when I moved here was fine. </connor>
<connor> But then from the second time on </connor>
<connor> when I moved to my own place. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, it was hell and
it's and it's still hell, </connor>
<joey> This is the third time I'm doing it now. </joey>
<joey> And it's not easier at all. </joey>
<joey> Like the only thing
that makes it easier now </joey>
<joey> is that you know exactly the
list of things you need to do. </joey>
<joey> But the list of don't, </joey>
<garnt> but the process of
going through that list. </garnt>
<garnt> - The time is not any more efficient. </garnt>
<garnt> - The time is not any more efficient. </garnt>
<joey> It is just as time consuming
and fucking ridiculous. </joey>
<joey> - It's why no one moves right? </joey>
<joey> No one wants to improve that
life because they're like, </joey>
<joey> Well, I do want to improve my life. </joey>
<joey> - But that's what I'm saying right? </joey>
<joey> - You know, I've got
asbestos. I've got mold, </joey>
<connor> but you know, frankly,
putting up that paperwork, </connor>
<connor> - Well that's what I'm saying. </connor>
<joey> It's not an understatement to say that or </joey>
<connor> not an overreaction to say that
moving in Japan is a luxury </connor>
<joey> and it shouldn't be a luxury.
It's fucking ridiculous. </joey>
<garnt> - That's, that's why they're
able to charge the same amount </garnt>
<connor> when you have to renew
your contract right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Which is why I don't know
where you're explaining this, </connor>
<connor> but the reason we're all moving is because </connor>
<connor> when your contract ends for
like your rental period, </connor>
<connor> normally you'd think it
can just easily roll over </connor>
<connor> and stuff like that </connor>
<connor> - That's how it does in the UK. </connor>
<connor> - That's how it does in the UK. </connor>
<connor> That's that's how it
did in Thailand for me. </connor>
<connor> - Most countries yeah. </connor>
<connor> - That's how I did in most countries. </connor>
<garnt> Nope. You've got to go
through the same process again </garnt>
<garnt> and pay the same fees. </garnt>
<connor> - So you gotta pay two
months of rent for free. </connor>
<joey> For no reason. Just, because they want it. </joey>
<joey> It's like, No fuck you. </joey>
<connor> I'm not giving you two
months of money for free. </connor>
<connor> For what? For this shitty
apartment? Fuck off. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. It's ridiculous. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. I hate it. </joey>
<garnt> - Did you use like a moving company </garnt>
<garnt> the first time you moved? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah I got a moving
company, but I mean the, </joey>
<joey> the moving company we're using for now, </joey>
<joey> the new place is like </joey>
<joey> has like a service where like </joey>
<joey> they'll come in and like pack it for you. </joey>
<joey> Like wheeling off the moving company </joey>
<joey> is probably the easiest thing
to sort out when moving. </joey>
<connor> It's everything else that's
a pain. Like the inter, </connor>
<connor> the internet is the fucking worst. </connor>
<connor> - Oh I can imagine. </connor>
<connor> - Like setting up internet
for a new place is, ugh. </connor>
<connor> - That's hard in the UK as well. </connor>
<joey> That's like the hardest one
because they're just like, </joey>
<joey> they're just like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh yeah. So are you okay with </joey>
<joey> "going four months without
internet in your new place?" </joey>
<connor> It's like, </connor>
<connor> No. No I'm fucking not. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah but at least like
with our current place, </joey>
<joey> like they'll give us like a, </joey>
<connor> like a kind of portable or not portable, </connor>
<connor> but like a rental WiFi kind of thing. </connor>
<connor> So you're not like
completely out of internet. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Still sucks though. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah it still sucks that
I have to wait for like </joey>
<connor> the full price to like kick in. But yeah. </connor>
<joey> Yeah. I mean, yeah. </joey>
<joey> The moving company is
weirdly the smoothest thing. </joey>
<connor> - Sick. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Awesome. </joey>
<joey> - I remember in the UK, </joey>
<joey> when I moved all my stuff
to my parents' house, </joey>
<joey> I, again, I was trying to
do it as cheap as possible. </joey>
<joey> And there was like a
service that had like vans, </joey>
<joey> but for Uber. </joey>
<joey> It's called like AnyVan
or something in the UK. </joey>
<connor> Pay the guy. </connor>
<connor> Guess how much it cost to go basically </connor>
<connor> from London to North Wales, </connor>
<connor> like that's like basically half the UK. </connor>
<connor> How much do you think that costs </connor>
<connor> to hire that van? </connor>
<connor> - Like, like one van? </connor>
<connor> - Just one guy in a van just driving. </connor>
<joey> - Normally I'd think maybe like, I dunno, </joey>
<joey> 300 pounds maybe? </joey>
<connor> - It was 120 pounds. I think I paid. </connor>
<connor> - That sounds sus as fuck. </connor>
<connor> - And I was so fucking
scared the whole time </connor>
<connor> when this put my, because
this guy was just like, </connor>
<joey> "All right, what are we doing? </joey>
<joey> "Where are we putting the boxes?" </joey>
<joey> What are we doing, it
was just like some guy, </joey>
<joey> like, again, again, like
Uber for vans just chilling. </joey>
<joey> He was really nice. And my mom was like, </joey>
<joey> "Yeah, he was really nice." </joey>
<connor> when he got there. </connor>
<joey> I was like, sick. </joey>
<joey> It was so cheap. And I was like, </joey>
<joey> this guy can't be getting
much so I gave him a fat tip. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause apparently he was really nice </joey>
<connor> and was really helpful to my mom. </connor>
<joey> - That sounds scary though. Isn't it? </joey>
<joey> That just calls for some dude </joey>
<joey> who has all your stuff
in his van and then just </joey>
<connor> drives off into the middle of nowhere. </connor>
<connor> - There was just, there was
a GPS tracker on his car. </connor>
<garnt> But again, he could just take, </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh you went with him? </garnt>
<garnt> - No. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, okay. </garnt>
<joey> - That's even more scary. </joey>
<garnt> - Just give them all my,
all my valuable stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> Like see you later. </garnt>
<connor> - Jesus Christ. </connor>
<connor> - So your laptop, your PC, everything. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah everything, everything. </joey>
<connor> - Geez. That's, </connor>
<joey> - That's scary. Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - And somehow we fit it
all in a van and everything </garnt>
<garnt> and yeah, somehow it was fine.
The service was great, paid. </garnt>
<connor> It was pretty much cheap as fuck. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah Jesus. </connor>
<connor> - I'm thinking I'm like, </connor>
<connor> the fuel must've been
like half of that cost. </connor>
<joey> Like this man cannot be
getting any money from this. </joey>
<joey> That's why I was like, fat tip. </joey>
<joey> - He might be living
just strictly off tips. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. I don't know.
Fuck, I feel bad. But. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah I don't know 'cause
like tipping culture, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> Tipping culture is different
everywhere in the world. </garnt>
<connor> And in the UK, it's you guys </connor>
<connor> are kind of in the middle I
guess, of tipping culture. </connor>
<connor> Japan is nonexistent,
which, you know, there are, </connor>
<connor> there are times when I wish </connor>
<joey> that I could tip people in Japan. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I get some of the
best customer service here </joey>
<joey> I've ever had worldwide. </joey>
<garnt> And I can't tip people here </garnt>
<joey> - It's because it's the whole
philosophy of, you know, </joey>
<joey> the best customer service is expected. </joey>
<connor> - Wait what was the
tangent that we were on </connor>
<connor> before I started talking about my van? </connor>
<joey> - We were talking about
your moving company right? </joey>
<connor> - Moving company. </connor>
<joey> - I basically just said
the moving company was </joey>
<joey> - Doing it. Oh yeah. Sure easy. </joey>
<joey> - Because when I moved in the UK </joey>
<garnt> from London back to Brighton
like just use Gumtree </garnt>
<garnt> and I, I feel like with the UK, </garnt>
<joey> I, I don't know anyone </joey>
<garnt> who's actually moved,
used the moving company. </garnt>
<garnt> Everyone's just knowing a mate, whoever. </garnt>
<joey> - Everyone has mates to do it. </joey>
<joey> - At least one friend
has like a giant van. </joey>
<connor> - I mean that's because putting our age. </connor>
<connor> But I think when the people
who use moving companies </connor>
<connor> are like families. Just
absurd amounts of stuff. </connor>
<joey> - That makes sense. </joey>
<connor> - At my age, I, I, </connor>
<connor> when I moved out I recycled or threw away </connor>
<joey> probably about 70% of my belongings. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I'm like, I
don't need this anymore. </joey>
<connor> Like, 'cause I was like,
oh, well, you know, I like, </connor>
<joey> I put everything on for free on Gumtree. </joey>
<joey> All my stuff was like, come get it. </joey>
<joey> Who wants my wardrobe? </joey>
<connor> Who wants my fucking? </connor>
<joey> - Well I did with like,
without car movers as well, </joey>
<garnt> there's like a Japanese
site that we can just </garnt>
<garnt> throw like couches and beds for free. </garnt>
<joey> And people just come pick it up. </joey>
<joey> - People will go on like Craigslist, </joey>
<joey> like fucking give things, </joey>
<connor> - Because like throwing out
trash here costs fucking money </connor>
<connor> and like an absurd amount
of money to throw out. </connor>
<joey> Where I'm just like, why
would anyone do that? </joey>
<connor> - Just give it to someone. </connor>
<connor> - True, true. Shit, I
just remembered banks. </connor>
<connor> Sorry. Sorry to shit on banks again. </connor>
<connor> You can't, I remember </connor>
<connor> I was in, I was out in Shibuya </connor>
<connor> and I was out till like 2:00 AM </connor>
<connor> and I was like, all right,
well I want to go home now. </connor>
<connor> So I'll go get a taxi. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, great,
well, I've got no money. </connor>
<connor> So I'm just gonna quickly go </connor>
<connor> and get some money from the ATM. </connor>
<connor> It turns out that after working hours, </connor>
<connor> you just can't withdraw
money. So you know, fuck me, </connor>
<connor> I was stranded in the middle of nowhere. </connor>
<connor> I can't get money. </connor>
<connor> I have to wait until what 8:00
AM until the banks open up. </connor>
<joey> For some reasons the ATMs
stop fucking working. </joey>
<joey> - I've never, I don't
think I've ever had to. </joey>
<joey> - I don't think I've ever had
to take money out like that. </joey>
<connor> - No, sometimes I have a good night. </connor>
<joey> You know, I spend more than I intended to. </joey>
<joey> I got no more cash left. </joey>
<joey> No biggie. I'll get some
from the ATM. No. Fuck me. </joey>
<connor> Fuck me. And even if it
is during working hours, </connor>
<connor> I got to pay anyway, what am I paying for? </connor>
<connor> It's an ATM. </connor>
<connor> There's no one there, </connor>
<connor> there's no one in the machine
giving you money is there? </connor>
<connor> Is there just a small man
sleeping in the machine </connor>
<connor> who's awake during these
hours? Why is it this much? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. Like, like there are
some ATMs like to, to explain. </garnt>
<garnt> There are some ATMs in
the UK that do charge </garnt>
<joey> to take money out. </joey>
<joey> But they are like, they're like the like </joey>
<joey> no branded ATMs </joey>
<joey> - Sketch as fuck ones. </joey>
<joey> - At some, at some
sketchy like corner shops, </joey>
<joey> - Those are the ones where like, </joey>
<joey> there's probably a man inside.
Just taking your money. </joey>
<joey> - Those are the ones where it's fucking </joey>
<joey> 2:00 AM or something. </joey>
<joey> You just need some fucking money out </joey>
<joey> to go to the club or something. </joey>
<connor> And you're like, sure. </connor>
<connor> I'll pay five pounds to take out my </connor>
<connor> 20 pound entry fee to this club, whatever. </connor>
<joey> I'm drunk enough to do it. </joey>
<joey> Now, imagine now, imagine that. </joey>
<connor> But for every transaction you do </connor>
<garnt> and that's, that's taking
out money here in Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> You have to take out a lot of money. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. They charge like five
bucks each time or something. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah they charge like five bucks every, </garnt>
<joey> - I want to access my fucking, </joey>
<joey> - Unless you go to that
bank's branded ATM. </joey>
<connor> - But even then sometimes
though, they charge you. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. Because yeah,
because you have a limit </joey>
<joey> as to how many times you can
take money out per month. </joey>
<connor> - But that depends. If, if you, </connor>
<connor> for some reason you're a rich motherfucker </connor>
<connor> and you have X amount of
money in your bank, it's free. </connor>
<connor> They're like, no, no, no. it's on us. </connor>
<connor> You have a lot of money with us. </connor>
<connor> We ain't going to charge you. </connor>
<connor> - Punish the poor. Feed the rich. </connor>
<connor> - Why? Why are you taxing
the fucking poor people? </connor>
<connor> What the fuck? That's
just like what's wrong. </connor>
<connor> It's like everything in this system </connor>
<connor> is designed to make you hate them. </connor>
<connor> - Damn you capitalism. </connor>
<connor> - Like I, what I was, when I, </connor>
<connor> when I wanted to get the
taxi home, I was like, </connor>
<garnt> I'm so goddamn lucky that
I have a foreign card </garnt>
<garnt> that I just carry on me at emergencies. </garnt>
<connor> 'Cause I'm like, you never know. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. For my, my
foreign, my British card </garnt>
<joey> is just like my getaway,
get out of jail free card. </joey>
<connor> It's like 100% more reliable </connor>
<garnt> than using the card in the
country it was made from, </garnt>
<garnt> like how does that work? </garnt>
<garnt> - My British bank card
works at every single ATM, </garnt>
<garnt> any time of the day, whenever. </garnt>
<connor> They don't charge me. </connor>
<connor> They just charge me the exchange
rate cost, which I accept, </connor>
<connor> you know, cause I'm changing the money. </connor>
<connor> Whatever. They got to do
that. But you know, I don't, </connor>
<connor> I genuinely don't know how I
would've got home that night </connor>
<connor> if I, if I didn't have my British card. </connor>
<connor> What do Japanese people do in this? </connor>
<connor> Do they just go to the </connor>
<connor> fucking manga cafes don't they? </connor>
<joey> - Well, no, because then </joey>
<connor> you'd have to pay for the manga cafe. </connor>
<joey> - Oh shit yeah. That's true. </joey>
<connor> - They literally sleep
outside the station. </connor>
<connor> - Homeless Simulator for like six hours. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, you've probably seen it before. </garnt>
<connor> They just literally sleep
outside of the station. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh is that like the
Shibuya Meltdown shit? </garnt>
<garnt> - Shibuya Meltdown is something else. </garnt>
<garnt> But like sometimes I've seen, you know, </garnt>
<connor> walking past the station or whatever </connor>
<connor> there's like couples and
like, you know, businessmen </connor>
<connor> just sleeping outside
of the station, waking, </connor>
<connor> waiting for it to wake up. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Like it's ridiculous. </garnt>
<connor> - Absolute insanity that
this is what it has come to. </connor>
<garnt> - Like talking about this
now. I'm like, I I'm, I'm, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm really starting to
sweat this year right? </garnt>
<connor> Because, because of the world's situation, </connor>
<connor> haven't been able to track
to travel back to the UK. </connor>
<connor> And I look at the expiry day
on my card and it's like, </connor>
<joey> it's like creeping up. Right? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause it was, it was like,
'cause before I moved up. </joey>
<connor> - It's like the "Death Note" counter. </connor>
<garnt> - They send you an automatic one though. </garnt>
<connor> At least my bank does. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah it sends me to my UK address, </garnt>
<connor> which no one is living in right now. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause my parents are in fucking Thailand </connor>
<connor> and I'm here in Japan. </connor>
<joey> So my, my I'm not going to
say what the exact date, </joey>
<connor> - My exact address. </connor>
<joey> - It is, it is in 2021, my
expiry date for my British card. </joey>
<connor> I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> - Wait when does mine expire? </connor>
<connor> - I'm, I'm starting to
sweat 'cause I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> Shit man. </connor>
<garnt> If I can't travel back to
the UK to get my new cards </garnt>
<garnt> then I'm kind of just like
resting on my Japanese cards </garnt>
<garnt> to work now. </garnt>
<connor> - Mine's 2023. We good. We
gucci. We gucci. Fuck you connor. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. It's scary. Fucking hell. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. I mean that was a,
that was a nice little rant. </garnt>
<garnt> - Thanks a hell here.
Sorry. I'm sure most people </garnt>
<connor> have absolutely no care in the world </connor>
<connor> about Japanese banks, but now you know </connor>
<connor> a lot more about them
about how shit they are. </connor>
<connor> - Well there's probably a lot of audiences </connor>
<connor> of Trash Taste who are like, </connor>
<joey> one day I want to live in
Japan and live that weeb dream. </joey>
<connor> Just be prepared. </connor>
<connor> - I think we've done a good
job at least, you know, </connor>
<garnt> bigging up the stuff
that is worth, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> giving praise to. </garnt>
<connor> And we're brutally honest
about the shit parts. </connor>
<garnt> - Honestly, like all things
considered Japan is like, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know if it's the best, </garnt>
<garnt> but it's definitely like either
comparing the UK to Japan, </garnt>
<garnt> it's been a fucking amazing place to live. </garnt>
<garnt> And I don't know if
I'd put it as the best, </garnt>
<garnt> but it's definitely, </garnt>
<joey> - Well the pluses definitely
outweigh the minuses. </joey>
<connor> - I think I enjoy living here
more than the UK. More so. </connor>
<connor> - I mean I'm definitely have enjoyed </connor>
<garnt> my previous year and a half
more than I have in the UK. </garnt>
<joey> We'll see how I am five years
down the line, you know? </joey>
<joey> But right now I can, I'm definitely </joey>
<joey> - I'm approaching my fifth year. </joey>
<garnt> - I'm definitely gonna
be here for at least </garnt>
<connor> two, three more years I think. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Definitely. Definitely. </connor>
<garnt> Because I fucking love it
here. It's so much fun. </garnt>
<joey> It's an amazing country. </joey>
<joey> - So expect Trash Taste </joey>
<joey> for at least another two or three years. </joey>
<joey> - Just don't, just don't
tell me I have to move house </joey>
<connor> or fucking change my internet </connor>
<connor> or change my phone because I
am going to get a headache. </connor>
<joey> - Just tell me ahead of
time when that happens </joey>
<connor> 'cause I'll just fucking wooo, </connor>
<connor> get out of there before I'm
like trying to like this, </connor>
<garnt> this rant is me like mentally
preparing for like the, the, </garnt>
<garnt> the month in like the month
and this year that I'm going to </garnt>
<garnt> have to dedicate to moving. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. I mean paying taxes
was way more, like much, </connor>
<connor> much more enjoyable than, </connor>
<joey> than doing any of the
forms I had to do in Japan. </joey>
<joey> It's weird. But anyway, </joey>
<connor> you know who doesn't
charge us to use ATMs, </connor>
<connor> our wonderful patreons. </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God, look at them. </connor>
<connor> - But look at this guy here on screen. </connor>
<joey> - They live rent free in our heads. </joey>
<connor> - I would've charged them to
get their money outta here. </connor>
<garnt> - I bet they have a good banking system. </garnt>
<joey> That's why they're supporting us. </joey>
<joey> (hosts laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Touche. </joey>
<connor> - But I bet this guy could
get his bank statement online. </connor>
<garnt> - I bet they can play or pay
all their bills online right? </garnt>
<joey> - Of course they can. </joey>
<garnt> Hey, if you'd like to
support the show man. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's what they're doing right now. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, make sure to go to
