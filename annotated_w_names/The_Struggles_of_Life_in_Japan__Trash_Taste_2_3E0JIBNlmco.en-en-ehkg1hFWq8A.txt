<SPEAKER_03> - I fell asleep in the bath once </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with a nose bleed and it
was scary waking up to that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> You ever fell asleep in a bath? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, that's how people die. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, it was like a shallow bath. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - You could still die.
- You could still die. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - How am I gonna like...
(guys laughing) </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_03> - Wow, that was a lot more
energetic than last time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I know, right?
- Yeah, I just like came in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> nonchalantly like I guess
welcome to the podcast. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Hey guys. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Welcome to Trash Taste Podcast. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I should be like that 'cause
I'm gonna say right now, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> apologies if I'm a bit out of
it, I'm slightly hung over, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause it was my birthday
celebrations yesterday. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Woo!
- How old are you? 47? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I am, well, in YouTube years,
yes, because I've been around </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> since the beginning of YouTube basically, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but no, I've finally
hit my dirty thirties. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's scary, dude. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I always forget the huge
age gap between us three. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because between Connor
and Garnt, there's what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Seven.
- Seven years? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Seven years.
- I'm 23, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's fucking insane. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I forget all the time that you are 23. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Everyone thinks I'm like
30, especially in Japan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- I mean, it's the beard. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, everyone is just beard, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you immediately have like four mortgages, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a car and two kids. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (guys laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - But because it is or
it was Garnt's birthday, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I got him a gift. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I wonder what this could be. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I wonder.
- I wonder. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's manga. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - See, we've just reached that age </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where this just a acceptable
gift that you can give anyone. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- So let's do the unboxing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> shall we?
- ASMR unboxing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - ASMR unboxing time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And you see we've already got wine glasses </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause we had no idea what
this could possibly be. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> But ooh.
Ooh, ooh fancy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Ooh, okay.
- Yeah, it is fancy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So basically at our supermarket, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll tell a story while
you're opening that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> So basically at the supermarket
that we all live near </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which I'm not gonna say, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's like a booze section,
like a liquor store section. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I didn't know for the longest time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that not only is there
a liquor store section </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but there's like a
dedicated section to wine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay.
- Like a wine room, I guess. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> So I got an Italian one I think. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Barolo.
- Barolo. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I misread this, at
first I was like Boruto? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (guys laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, is this the anime one? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Boruto wine.
- Boruto wine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It just sounds like a
generic "Dragon Ball" villain. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Barolo.
- Barolo. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Goku Barolo. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Thank you very much, Joey.
- Yeah, no worries. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know too much about wines </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> apart from if they're in- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Red or white.
(guys laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, what color is it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - If they're red or white
or if they're one of the 10 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> from "Drops of God."
(guys laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't think it's
that but Barolo is like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I think it's like pretty
well known in Italy, I think? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The guy was like, "Oh yeah, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you want like a well known
Italian wine, get Barolo." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> So hey, if anyone's watching this episode </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or listening to this
episode and you're Italian </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> let us know if you know Barolo. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just think they're gonna
be like the fuck is a Barolo? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (guys laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> We don't drink Barolo. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's what they call Boruto in Italy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (guys laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just think it's funny
because how I got into wine, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because how I got into wine initially </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was literally "Drops of God." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because before that I was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> why does anyone drink wine? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just want a cold beer. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't want to like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but you read "Drops of God" once </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and you're like, I love wine! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Wine's great! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I read "Drops of God" on a flight. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I think it was, when was the flight? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know it was from
like America or somewhere. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I remembered reading "Drops of God" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you know when like
the little cart comes by? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - And they're like, "What
do you want to drink?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was like of course I want wine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm a connoisseur of fine tastes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Of course, why even ask me the question? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I was about to ask, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I hope you were drinking
wine on the flight </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> while you were reading it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So she gets out the
little bottle of wine, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they crack open, and pours it
into this plastic cup for me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it was like the most
pathetic drink I'd ever had </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I was sitting there
like swirling this plastic cup </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that like a 10 year old
would drink a drink out of. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just being like, "Yeah, that's good." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, because table wine,
we all know table wine </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on flights is basically
just like grape juice </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with hand sanitizer in
it, like it's disgusting. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, 'cause you, you can't even taste </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like things that aren't like
super salty on flights anyways. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like wine is the worst thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel like it's that
point when you're watching </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> something that's super good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like for example, when
you're watching "Shokugeki"- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And you just wanna cook. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're like this food looks amazing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you're sitting there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with your fucking takeaway convenient meal </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you're like "Mm, this
is this is kind of like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> A5 beef that I'm eating now." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (guys laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's A5 beef if I just
imagine hard enough. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's nothing more orgasmic
than Kraft Mac and cheese. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (guys laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Wow, thank you, wow.
- Oh yeah, let's pour that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Ooh.
- It's quite light. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - From such a height!
- From such a height. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (guys laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Which was another meme that originated </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from "Drops of God." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (guys laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, come on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm sorry, okay? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Absolute amateur hour.
- Oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I love how you're like tilting that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm sorry, okay? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm sorry!
(guys laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not a waiter. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - When is the podcast
actually gonna start? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - The podcast is starting now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Happy birthday. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Cheers.
- Cheers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Happy birthday, Garnt.
- Thank you very much. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Congratulations. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - So boys, what are we discussing today? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What are the topics on mind? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, on the topic of, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> we talked about, 'cause we live
quite close together, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We live within walking distance. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - A five minute walking distance. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, so I guess I think
a good topic would be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> what our experiences are
like living here in Japan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> now that we've all finally moved here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause we just moved here, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how many months have we
been living here now? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's actually like eight.
- Eight months. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which is crazy 'cause-
- Really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> October so it's just hit June. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So it was like, and this
was like middle of June. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was like seven and
a half months I guess. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. Yeah.
- Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - But yeah.
- That's scary. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It does not feel like it at all. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no.
- Well, to be fair, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the last two months I might as well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> have been living in fucking Australia. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (guys laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Quarantine does things to you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I hadn't heard anyone speak Japanese </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for like about two months </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> except for like that brief moment </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when you'd go out to buy groceries, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and I just forget that
I was living in Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. Legit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember catching the train </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for the first time in like two months. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the world is full of wonder! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (guys laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I felt like I was, like "Cast Away." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Like when he like came back- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Tom Hanks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Tom Hanks after "Cast Away" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when he came back to humanity. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> He's like (gasping). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (guys laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Wilson, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know if you guys have yet </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> but I still haven't gone into Tokyo yet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I went there for-
- Like central Tokyo. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think the first time I
went there was like yesterday </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and that was literally
just 'cause it was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> quarantine was over just on
like the day of my birthday. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So I'm like woo, this is fate. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm gonna go out and have some nice food. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But even now, there's like a
lot of places are still closed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so it's still not like
everything's open yet, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but yeah, it's been a
really fast eight months. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It hasn't felt like eight months at all. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I guess my first question to you guys- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (glass dings) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> My first question to you guys is like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what made you decide to move
to Japan in the first place? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause you've been here
for how many years now? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've been here four years now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. I guess for you,
it's more obvious though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, yeah, 'cause I've spent what? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Like half my life here </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and I have family up north and in Tokyo. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> At least with me like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm pretty sure I've said
this in videos before, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but like I was gonna move to Japan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> after I graduated from uni anyway, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because I think this
was like back when I had </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> maybe like 20K, 30K subs. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I wasn't doing it full-time at all. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was in my second year of university </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I was interning at
like a Japanese IT company, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> which I believe is now defunct. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like it doesn't exist
anymore I don't think, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so glad that internship
never went through. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- But yeah, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so I was gonna move to Japan anyway, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because like it just makes sense for me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I'm fluent in
both English and Japanese, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which is such a huge plus here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like if you know both languages, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you can pretty much get a job anywhere. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We'll get to that. We'll get to that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And like no one in
Australia gives a shit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you can speak Japanese. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, exactly.
- Like my dad works </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> at like a Japanese IT
company for 30 years. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He can't speak a word of Japanese. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's because no one in the
office can speak Japanese, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> but here it's like if
you can speak English, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> you can do business with
anybody in or out of Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So it just was like a natural
process for me to like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> okay, I get my paper, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I work at some fucking IT company in Japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then we're all good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it's funny </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I reckon one of the few industries </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where Japanese can be
super, super important </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> is anime and manga, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Exactly. Exactly.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - You maxed out your luck there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So either way, It was
just a natural path for me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> to move here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But instead of doing that desk job </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I had set my plans on, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> YouTube, for me, blew up
like in my third year of uni </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when I graduated. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I was just like, all right, I'll- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Guess I'll do this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Guess I'll do YouTube
for as long as I can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and then-
- You're still doing it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm still doing it,
somehow I'm still doing it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I know, it's crazy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The story of or I guess
like the original plan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that was brought up to
you guys about moving here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> was like a year ago? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, 'cause I wanted
to move here for a while. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I remember since we first met each other </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and since my first trip to Japan, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like I could really
see myself living here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And this is not like the
typical weeb kind of fantasy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (guys laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I actually never had that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember back in the day
when it was like mid 2000s, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the weeb dream was to live in Japan and- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Work in the anime industry.
- Work in the anime industry. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was just like a fucking dream </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that nobody had ever proven or, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So it was just that weeb dream, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I never really wanted that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like I'm happy with a normal career. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'd never really fantasized
about going to Japan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I remember the first time I came here, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it was so eye-opening for
me because it was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know that feeling
when you're like, man, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this country just works in a lot of ways </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's do with my job
so I'm like this could be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a really good opportunity for me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I definitely felt the same thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> with how I thought about Japan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I couldn't have cared
less about living here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I thought people who
were learning the language, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> at the time I was like 15, 14, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, that's kind of cringe, bro. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (guys laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But like now, that I've
actually started to learn it- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - God, I regret it so much. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I regret that I didn't learn any </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> because I could have been like
a few months ahead at least </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of learning the language. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I wish I was more weeaboo. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Like now that the cringey
weeaboo phase is over. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I wish I was that cringey weeaboo </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because that would give me so much more </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> of an advantage now
that I'm her ein Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And a part of me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I remember when I used to think that way, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like anyone who's learning
it, is was just like wow. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's so sad, you're never
actually gonna learn it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But to be fair if you're
learning anything, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> any other kinds of language, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> especially if you only speak one, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think that's like good on
you, better yourself, you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like who gives a shit? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I really regret that
I thought that everyone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> who's learning Japanese </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because of anime's pathetic. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But then again, I was like
an edgy teenager, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And we all think that
and yeah, like you said, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I had no intention or want to live here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was pretty content in the UK. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And even when I visited
here, I thought, wow, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this is an amazing place
to come visit, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But I don't think I was
still sold yet on moving here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> because I think, I don't
know about you guys, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I really need friends. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (guys laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I need that social interaction. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm not speaking for every weeb, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I do need to have
friends that I see often, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> otherwise I really get like upset. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're like the
antithesis of every weeaboo. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I need to socialize </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> or it really starts to take a toll on me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I was just like, I really like worried </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> that I wouldn't be able to
have a good social circle </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and meet people
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, luckily that
hasn't been the case, but- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause I guess the big
difference between you and me is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I've already like, before Japan, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I had already lived in Thailand
for a good like three years. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> So I had experience moving
to a different country </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and finding new friends and
to me it was like, okay, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just starting the
process all over again. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Then it's just a new adventure, I guess. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> So it was a lot easier for me to decide, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hey, I'm gonna move to Japan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I guess the biggest thing
that made me think is that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> do I really want to go
through this process again? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> How long do I see myself
actually living here? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And to me it was like,
this is the last big move </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm gonna do before I kind
of start to think about- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, that's crazy.
- Staying in one place </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> instead of flying to different
countries every few months, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> which is what I was doing before. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know how you
were doing that for like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- 'Cause you were going </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> from Thailand's a UK to America and then- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Full triangle. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I had three offices. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I had one in Thailand, one
in the UK and one in America. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's major entrepreneur
moves right there, dude. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I have three offices all over the world. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Look how many corner
offices this man has. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The traveling just gets to you, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Oh, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know when you're at university, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're like I just want to travel, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I want to get out, I want
to experience new things, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but you do it every year
for about a good four years </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it fucking gets to you.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I think I'm definitely
starting to phase out of that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like just any excuse to travel is great, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause now I'm really starting
to detest some travel. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Remember when traveling
to AnimeCons was exciting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and now the thought of
having to go on a plane </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> to get somewhere, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> to me, it's a lot harder
than it used to be. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I guess, because it was just, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of because how it's become, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's always a 10 plus hour flight </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and that's like the thing
that is really draining. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> We must sound, God, I'm so annoyed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> we have to travel so much. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I hate it when these
cons pay for our travel. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Ugh!
- Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, I guess it happens
when you travel a shit ton. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm sure anyone who has
like parents or family, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> friends who work, their
whole business has to travel, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it does become draining pretty quickly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because it is a job
at the end of the day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> People want to travel, but if
you've ever had a office job, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which I did for the BBC and
you had to travel to Europe, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you have to travel to these places </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's just hours and hours
of traveling for the job. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It drains you no matter
where you're traveling to, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> if you travel there enough, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it'll eventually drain you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's a massive difference </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> between traveling for pleasure
and traveling for business. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, it might not seem
there's a huge difference, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> especially to someone
who doesn't travel a lot. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> But after a while,
you're just like, oh man, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I have to go on this flight. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Versus yay, I get to go on this flight. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think the only time
I'm excited for a flight </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> is when Netflix drops a whole show </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I'm like super hyped for. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, sweet, I got 10 hours </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of no one bothering me.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can watch this, hell yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's like the only time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But the worst is when you get to the app </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and you're like fuck, I
didn't download anything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh God.
- And you're like oh no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I have to pay for shitty wifi </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to scroll on Twitter for 12 hours. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Cool. I have to play this
solitaire game for 10 hours </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that doesn't require any internet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like when you sit down for a shit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and you realize your phone's on 1% battery </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you're like what do I do
when this battery runs out? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - So.
- Oh, go on. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Another thing is time differences </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and adjusting sleep schedule. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I got a question for you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because we went through
the same kind of flights. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> How did you find the traveling </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to the Crunchyroll Anime Awards? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Because to put things in perspective, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we were there for like one day, two days. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And we had to travel, how
long did you have to travel? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - 16 ish hours I think it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> for the Crunchyroll Anime
Awards, yeah, it was around that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - For me it was 21 hours of traveling. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, because you were
in the UK at the time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no, I was in Thailand
which is even worse. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Jesus. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That was the straw that
broke the camel's back. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> After that, I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if I'm traveling too far, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> there's gotta be something, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I remember hanging out with you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> after you came back from that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you were still pissed off about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that you had to endure that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, all right, well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just want to say cheers Crunchyroll </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> for not inviting me to that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> You saved me a lot of trouble. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's a great experience. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm trying to be brand friendly here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (guys laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Thank you brand. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm not saying the experience is bad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The thing that was bad was me
having to adjust immediately </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> to like a 16 hour time difference </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and then two days later
have to adjust back </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and try to be in a working state. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Not to mention, in between
that you have to go on stage </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in front of thousands of
people and be like, yeah, yeah, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> just nail this, don't
act like you're sleepy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah.
- No pressure. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was fun overall though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I liked networking with people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and meeting other YouTubers
you don't get to see often </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> is pretty fun. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But anyway, cycling
back to the Japan stuff. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> When in your timeline, did you get </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I guess presented with the
idea or the offer of moving? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like when was that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Do you remember the date-ish? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I can't remember the dates. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - The exact time and
location, like roughly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - When was it for you
because if you remember- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I know that you knew, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the offered had presented
itself to you before me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And I think it must have been </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> in either like February, March-ish. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was like three or months
before AX I know that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I remember it was
like at least a year ago </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when I heard about it.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, so it was, I think,
I guess from the timeline </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where it came up to me
knowing it was a possibility </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to me actually like finishing the move </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> is probably like what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Seven, eight months.
- Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It's been well over a year for me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, 'cause I knew
that you knew before me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - So yeah, how it happened for me was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I remember I was just sitting
in a BookWalker meeting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and we were just talking about, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I can't remember, some random stuff </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about what BookWalker
wants to do in the future. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then the person who I
was talking to, which is, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can I mention your name Meilyne? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Meilyne] I guess. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Don't throw me under the bus. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm not gonna throw you under the bus. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I will.
(guys laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So Meilyne, who is
basically our manager, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one of our managers now,
she basically just asked me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Have you ever thought
about moving to Japan?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> And that was just kind of a, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it just kind of came
out of nowhere for me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I didn't know how to react to that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like that's a loaded question, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> but I mean, I'm not gonna say no, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but you know when you're
like asked a question- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And it's obviously for a purpose, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like it's not a hypothetical. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And you're like, oh, this
could actually be a thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And so I went away, I thought about it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I was like, yeah, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if I'm not gonna do it
now than when in my life </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> am I gonna do it?
- Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then I guess the
idea just grew from there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> from it being a hypothetical question </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> to what needs to happen to
be able to bring an anituber </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to Japan as a job? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Right. Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - And so that started my whole process. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> When did you hear about it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I think it was, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It must've been around March or February. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm not a 100% sure. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think I was on call with Meilyne </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and I think Meilyne brought it up to me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it was basically the same thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Where it was like the hypothetical- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Do you like Japan?
(guys laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, something like that, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I think I was just like "Oh wait," </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> well maybe I was in Japan at the time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was something, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The thing where it was like not concrete </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And it was like, hey,
think about it, you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Like do you want to do it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And then I think two or three months later </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it became a bit more serious of like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> okay, do you want to do it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think, was that similar thing to you? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think we had time to think about it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and then seriously they asked us. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah and it went from a hypothetical to, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh, oh, this is actually happening. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm moving to Japan and this- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause yeah, I don't
think I've spoke to you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about your thoughts on it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Maybe I might have at the
time, but I can't remember. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> But were you like from the
first time you got heard </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or you were given the offer,
were you gonna take it or? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I think I was always
going to take it I think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I had wanted to
move to Japan for a while </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> even if it was for a little bit, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hadn't really put much
thought into how long </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I wanted to stay here but I was thinking, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you only get this chance
once in your life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If I hated it, then like great, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> at least at least I've done it, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But I was pretty concrete
when I got the offer </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I was gonna take it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> What I was more worried about was how </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was actually going to happen </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or what the process is- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I think there's
a lot of stuff like that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where I guess 'cause we'd only interacted </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> with BookWalker through Meilyne, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think maybe we were a bit like skeptical </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> about what goes on in the back end, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> We were like I don't know
what's happening, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- But they're great </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> by the way, they took
care of us very nicely. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> And Meilyne will kill
me if I say otherwise. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (guys laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's against the contract
to say anything negative. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> But I think the huge
advantage for at least you two </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was the fact that and
I know a lot of people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who don't do this and definitely should </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is that you guys visited
Japan enough times to- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah, twice. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, I mean, you know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was there for a while- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah but I know a lot of stories </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> of like people who move here </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just thinking like, oh, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Japan is this wonderful place </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you know, like nothing could go wrong </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and everyone's so friendly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then they move here </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and their expectations are
just completely rejected. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. There's a lot of
stuff that's different </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> between visiting and moving here, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which we can get into later. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, because for me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I think it goes back to the mentality of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I never felt like moving here </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or I never thought I
would want to move here </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because of the fact that I liked anime. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think that's the biggest thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If you want to move to
Japan just purely for anime, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you're gonna have a bad time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Throw away the weeaboo dreams, guys. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> It's not real. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's pretty worse reasons, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's pretty one of the worser ones. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, like for me, in terms
of my exposure to anime, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it hasn't actually increased too much </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> compared to when I was living in Thailand </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because there is like a massive
anime fandom in Thailand </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and just Asia in general. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There's a big difference
between say England to Japan, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> but from Thailand to Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I still have to watch anime online </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because you can't watch on TV </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I don't understand it yet. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah and even If you did, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the schedule of airing is so weird. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I'm not gonna stay up till 3:00 am </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> to watch-
- It's so sporadic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's just not worth it.
- Exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It kind of like reminds me of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like old cartoon
broadcast schedule, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like it's all over the place
and repeats constantly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Like it's weird. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, anyway, I think when I
was presented with the offer </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I didn't initially want,
I wasn't that keen on it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> mainly because I didn't
really know anything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And when someone's like, "Hey, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> do you want to come here to this country?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's like, okay, I mean, Japan's cool, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I don't-
- It's a big decision. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I literally don't know anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I think over time, I just,
especially when I found out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that you were gonna go 100%, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think that was like, all right, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> well at least I have my boys here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So if I do get lonely, we good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But I mean, yeah, meeting
friends wasn't a problem anyway </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> but I think-
- It is scary though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think I'll go into later with like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> what I think is important
when you move here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then just got to the point </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where I had nothing better going on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and then people gave me so much shit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for saying that on my video, by the way. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh really? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I literally said in my video, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I said, "I just had
nothing better going on, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's why I moved here." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And people think that
I'm being like nonchalant </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or joking, like I didn't. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> When you're a YouTuber you
don't have anything to do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> other than YouTube and
hang out with your friends </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and do whatever you
need to do to be happy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I literally had
nothing better going on, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so I'm in my head </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's no reason why I wouldn't take this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause it gives me a purpose
to just better myself </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as a person, I get to learn new things, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> get to meet new people. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, that's a huge
reason why I moved as well as </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is because like in Australia like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What are you doing?
- Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (guys laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I had like great friends
from uni and high school </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who I would hang out with
every now and then, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> And I had places to go to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> but it wasn't exciting anymore for me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it was just routine.
- Yeah, that's how it is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I hate getting into
routine with anything, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I was like, yeah, I mean, you know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I haven't like, yes I've spent
half my life here technically </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I haven't really like gone out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to fully explore the country </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and even four years later, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm nowhere near close
to exploring this place. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There are so many more
places I want to go to. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I still haven't left Tokyo. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's been like eight months
and I haven't left Tokyo. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - That road trip that
we planned is happening. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> All right? Once the rona
is gone, it's happening. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I've left Tokyo once. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (guys laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> The decision to move
to Japan funnily enough </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> was probably the easiest
part of the process. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Really?
- Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay, well, first of all,
I mean, you're very lucky. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> If you're half Japanese and
have a Japanese passport, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's gonna be easy to move here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Easy move, baby. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - For anyone else who's
thinking about moving to Japan, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> whatever visa you're
thinking about coming on, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it is going to be-
- It's hell, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's tough. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - And this year or this
year from, oh, sorry, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> from April this year I
believe they changed the rules </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> to make visas more or easier to get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because they need more
immigrants to work here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because the population is getting older. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And they allocated 40,000 worker permits. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And in the article, they only
managed to allocate 4,000 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> this year of the 40,000. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wait, it's 40,000 per year? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - For some specific kind of visa </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for this year I think or something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and they only managed to do 1/10th of that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is like not a problem </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> because I don't think there's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's not demand to move here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This is probably one of the countries </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I think people have most interest </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> in moving to out of a lot of places. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And it's just, I think
that if anything says a lot </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> about how difficult it is to move here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, exactly.
- Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I can't speak on
any other visa processes, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Everyone I've talked to
has had a difficult process </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> unless you're just coming
here for a tourist visa. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Super easy.
- Super easy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just walk in, literally just turn up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Or if you're one of those countries </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that has working holiday visa.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Which unfortunately America does not. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> So sorry Americans. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, if you want advice
on how to move here easily </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> get a working holiday visa. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's probably gonna be- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think those last a year and a half? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is it a year and a half? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think it depends on the country. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> At least Australians
have a year and a half. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Wow.
- I don't know about UK, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe UK has like six months
to a year maybe, depends. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - A lot of paperwork we had to fill out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I think the
hardest part of the process </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> was finding an apartment. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh my God.
- Oh my God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, I'm a Japanese citizen </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and it was still a pain in
the ass for me to do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - You hear about on YouTube
and Twitter and everything </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like it's hard, it's hard. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then you see some people saying like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Yeah, people are over exaggerating." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It is 100% hard.
- No, it's hard. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It is fucking difficult. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Especially if you're
a foreigner as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You basically play under different rules. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's sad to say like you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and you kind of think if you have money, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you get an apartment. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think more importantly,
especially if you're a YouTuber- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God.
- Oh God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because the hardest
thing, at least in Japan, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> from my experience about why it's so hard </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> to get a fucking apartment here is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because freelancing is not a job here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Freelancing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> you might as well be unemployed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> according to this government's- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - The government's like
that typical Asian parent. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Who's like, "What? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> You're not a doctor or
an engineer or a lawyer?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Get out of here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - You're unemployed, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> You're working part time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And that's due to,
because they're worried </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> about if you can pay all whatnot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> But the thing is, is that
they don't even like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, at least in like,
I don't know about the UK </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or Thailand, but at least in Australia, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when you sign up for
like an apartment, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Usually the landlord will be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Okay, can I see your bank account?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like just to see how much money </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you have saved up, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Regardless of what job you
do, we just want to see </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you have money in
the bank and if you do, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> then you're like okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> But here in Japan, they
don't check your bank. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They check your work status to make sure </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that there's like a constant
flow of money coming in. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it's not just that as well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause if you're not Japanese </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and especially if you
can't speak Japanese, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> most places aren't even gonna
talk to you or consider you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause that was a big problem we had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because we went through an agency </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and we just made a list of
about 10 to 20 apartments </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that we were interested in. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And we sent it off and applied- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Rejected from all of them.
- Rejected from all of them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - And we had a company as a guarantor </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so having the payments
secured wasn't the issue. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was like a lot of the time
it was really dumb stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Like can you sort the bins
properly and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like yes, we're not 12 year olds. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like the main concern
you'll hear all the time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is can you sort your trash properly? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's like, okay, it might be different </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from where I'm from but like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can learn.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like the government
councils in the area </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> give you an English manual
that tells you how to do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It is tedious and it is a lot more complex </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> than most places, but it's not like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's not rocket science. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it's not like you're having to do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the weirdest stuff
imaginable to this stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like it's basically just rinse your stuff, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> separate all of it, that's pretty much it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And I know there's some places in Europe </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that do it way more thorough </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that probably don't have this concern </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> when they're letting people rent houses. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because it's the least of your concerns. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It's, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. It's ridiculous. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah and the thing is that
if you go through an agency, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for example, that
specializes in foreigners </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and people who can't speak Japanese, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're gonna be paying
so much more as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, you pay a premium for that bill. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You pay like a premium
for that bill and that rent. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So you either have a
fucking difficult time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> finding a place and getting
past all the barriers </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or you're just gonna
pay a shit ton of money </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and those aren't two very good options. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The only concern that they often cite, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> building managers, etc, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that I find is like somewhat,
all right, that's fair enough, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is their worried that you'll run away, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> run away and not pay the rent. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But if you have a guarantor,
that's the whole fucking point </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of that problem, which- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You can't run away. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - If you run away, you're
still getting your money </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and the house is vacant. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Great, no damage to it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> This is a win-win for the company. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't understand. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> You play by their rules in every way. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's because it's just like typical, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> this is like one aspect
of Japanese work culture </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I learned very quickly is that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it doesn't matter what the business is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If they're not 100000000% sure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that this is going to go through, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it might as well be 0%. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No risk, yeah, they don't risk here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's no risk in any business venture, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> whether that be paying
for rent or anything, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like if they not 100000000% sure </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> in every possible avenue ever, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just not happening. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And you know, it's ridiculous. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think that'd be interesting
to talk about later on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> when we get to more of the stuff </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that we've experienced here, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but was there any part of the
visa process applying for it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause I'm sure people are
wondering, I got a lot of emails. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm sure you did as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> People asking, "Hey,
how did you get a visa? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Was it hard?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Et cetera, et cetera. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If there's any advice you can give someone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who's watching who wants to come to Japan, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> what would you say is like
the main piece of advice? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If they want to get a working visa? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, I didn't
apply for a working visa </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> so I don't have too
much experience with it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We didn't apply for it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We had an immigration lawyers help us. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. We had immigration
lawyers help us, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> but I mean, I've applied for visas before. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And the worst, the most
painful part is just waiting. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - And you're gonna be waiting a lot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're gonna be waiting a long time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and you're just gonna be
in this limbo kind of- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause we had what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was like the initial
thing where they file </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for something called a
Certificate of Eligibility </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which is basically if
the government decides </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you can have a visa,
which isn't the visa itself, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which already sounds to me like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that sounds like we're adding steps </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where steps don't need to be. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But as you move to Japan, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you'll learn that's what they love to do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So yeah, we had to wait, what was it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Six weeks for that, six to eight weeks? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, six to eight weeks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It could have been six to eight weeks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for this piece of paper to arrive, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which then they send by post </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which makes you feel so uneasy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because you're like they're
sending me a piece of paper </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> through the mail that
I've waited two months for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and you're just like
something's gonna go wrong. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Someone's gonna take it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So you get this piece of paper, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> To get this thing you need to prove </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you have a good
reason to work in Japan, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that the job or, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause you have to say what your work is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They need to check that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you are actually in that
field, et cetera, et cetera. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - We had to send so much evidence </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that we were doing
valuable work that could- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which I'm sure some people would argue </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> YouTube isn't, but you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> At the end of the day,
if we bring in money </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to the government and pay taxes,
it's valuable work, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, basically just how many
companies we've worked with, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what's work that's notable that- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then why we need to be in Japan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> to do more work. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - What it felt like was
I was applying for a job. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> It was like here's all my achievements. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Here's what I can bring for your country. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Please, please, please- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Let me play on your team, coach. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (guys laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And then yeah, so we get that
Certificate of Eligibility, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is we get that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And then you have to go to the embassy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - So you turn that into a visa </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and then they'll put a- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, which again, there's more steps </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause first of all,
if you live in the UK, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the only embassy is in London. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Now I would feel bad for someone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who lives in the North of Scotland. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't think they have
an Embassy in Scotland. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - In Wales, I had to go all
the way from Wales that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, luckily there's
fast train, doesn't matter. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But point is one embassy, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so you're going to be taking
a day trip to get this thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Worst part is, is that then
if you go to the embassy, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which you might've have to
traveled to across country for, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you have to wait five days
to then actually get the visa </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is a little thing
they just print out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and staple in your passport. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So you have to go back to the embassy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. You have to go back, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I just went home, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause I'm like not staying
in London for five days. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If you're poor, you haven't got much money </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and you can't, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the train tickets in the
UK are expensive, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's a lot of things
where it's just like, my God, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> why are we doing this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - But then again like realistically, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how many people in the butt
fuck middle of Scotland </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> is going to apply for a visa- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm sure, I bet there's one person from </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the North Island in like Scotland, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who's like, "Dude, I had
a fly, fuck that shit." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - If you are that one
person watching, subscribe. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (guys laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - And to make matters even more stressful, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you lost your passport.
- I did. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You lost your passport. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - This mother, we were
meeting up at the embassy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to collect our visas </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and this mother fucker lost his passport. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - When I heard that story,
I couldn't fucking believe. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> That was like one of the
worst days of my life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like you can't write that shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I know, it was horrible. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - All because you didn't
have a fucking backpack. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I carry my passport in my jeans pocket, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> which I'm hearing people like oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - The worst!
- Oh my God! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The worst idea. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm like cringing hearing that, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So okay, I've traveled
like all over the world </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just having my passport in my pocket. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay, I have lost it before
and you guys know I have. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I lost it in America as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I found it though luckily, but anyway, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so I was going to the train
station to go to the train, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> go to London. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And as my train arrived, I
always tap my pockets, right, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just to make sure it's there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I tap my pockets. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's not in there, it's not I'm there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm like fuck. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And what's running through my head is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> all of this months of work, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel bad for the company,
they paid for lawyers. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> All these people who
have banked on me coming </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and I've put so much work into this, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> myself and other people. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was like having a mental breakdown. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't think I've ever had that much </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of a quick mental breakdown in my life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It's to be expected. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And it was like gradually getting worse </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> in the hour I couldn't find it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I scoured this train station,
a tiny train station in Wales. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> It's called Flint. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You can look it up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's literally just like a platform. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There's no where this should have gone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where I couldn't have found it, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Could not find it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Check my car, quickly drove
home to find it, didn't find it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Came back to check
again, couldn't find it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Go in to the police station. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Literally everything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I could not find my passport. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So you have no idea what happened to it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I have no idea what
happened to my passport. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then eventually it was
getting like three, 4:00 pm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was like, okay,
I'm gonna just call up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the British government and tell them, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hey, can you just cancel my passport. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I wanna apply for another one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And that whole thing was an ordeal. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then my main concern
was like, all right, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> well, I lost my passport. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Do I have to restart the
whole visa process again? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Luckily the embassy were like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "No, as long as you have the certificate", </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> which I didn't lose. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Great. I could redo it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You lucky fucker. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I had to scramble to get a new passport </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and that was a whole thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I got one within
like five days luckily. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And luckily it all went well,
but it was just so stressful </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on top of already the stress that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was already at my limit with stress </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that whole period, because
of this whole thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and that was just like the full, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I had a full breakdown that that day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That was horrible. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And I think I like joked
about it on Twitter, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but like I was like not okay that day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah.
- No, no, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And the worst part is, right, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is when you fuck up this badly, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you can accept that yo fucked up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> but it's messaging your
friends being like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Hey, I'm not gonna be
in London in two hours." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They're like, "Oh, why, what's up?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, "I lost my passport." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (guys laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I remember reading that text, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I was waiting for
you outside the embassy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when you were like, I get a
message from Connor being like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "I'm gonna be a bit like 30 minutes late." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (guys laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Little did I know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Was like oh, all
right, I'll get a coffee. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I see the event unfold
as he's just texting me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> So he goes, "Yeah, I
can't find my passport. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm just gonna go look for it quickly." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then it was just you
like just breaking down </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> every message and it just ends with, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Yeah, I don't think I can come." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I'm still annoyed to this day </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because I went around, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> this is a very small town where I lost it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I went around like
every shop in that area. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I asked literally everyone in that area. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Hey, if you find this passport,
can you call me right away? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because if not, I'm gonna
just cancel it today. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I still never heard anything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was crazy and I don't
know how I lost it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - So from your experience
for anyone who's listening </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if there's anything they need to know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to make the process easier,
what would you guys say? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Get a degree. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, a degree helps a
lot, especially if it's- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Not an associate's,
like a bachelor's degree. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I think a lot of their forms </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> didn't recognize associate's. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think it actually said, it's
specified like bachelor's. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't think associates
is a thing in Japan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's not a thing in
the UK, I don't think. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it's not a thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's not a thing in Japan, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, it is a thing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but like it's not as heavily emphasized </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> on as a bachelor's degree. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I saw a lot of people are asking like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh, how do we get it, et cetera. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You need to have, especially
with a country that's strict, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you need to have concrete proof </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you can do something here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You can't just come here on a whim. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That you're worth something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Unless you are like
extremely, extremely rich </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and they want your tax money
I think the only other reason, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like you need some good reason. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Even then you need a
degree for something anyway. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They'll find a way to- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, 'cause then they'll be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Where are you getting
this money from, bro?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I imagine just having
like a fair amount of experience </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> in what you're doing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and the reason for coming
here will help a ton. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, I can't talk about most, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just what we went through. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Or basically just come
here to teach English. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - That is like the instant get in button. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. Pretty much. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like I can speak English
and I can teach it somewhat </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then they're like you're hired. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's probably not a bad way to, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if your goal ultimately is
living in Japan forever, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's probably not a bad way to
transition into living here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, because I know a
lot of friends personally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> who did start off with teaching English </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and then gradually moved
on to something else. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause by teaching English, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you can gain connections in the country </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and then maybe that transitions </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to an like a normal office
job or something like that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or working with a company. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> But if you just want to get
your foot through the door, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think teaching English
would be the easiest way </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> for anyone to be able to do it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But you still need a degree. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I agree, you need a degree. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - But they pretty much
accept everyone on that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> as far as I'm aware as long as,
again, if you have a degree. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, It doesn't matter how good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> your high school essays were. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> If you don't have a degree in that, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which is why I'm so glad
to drop out of university. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Listen to your Asian parents, go to uni </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you want to go to Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - You guys have all got degrees, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Engineering baby, let's go. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh really?
- Yeah. Engineering. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I never actually have known what degree, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you have an engineering degree, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I have. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, he has an electrical engineering </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I have mechanical engineering. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, wow.
- But he has a master's, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I have a bachelor's. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I got a fucking master's mother fucker. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (guys laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Look at this boy spending
more than four years at uni. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I got to the third year, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, I can't do it anymore. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't do this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I gotta get out, I gotta get out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Connor's like have I
got the required minimum? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah. Get me out of here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (guys laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't want to be here
for another year, dude. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So now that you guys moved to Japan, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> what would you say are the pros and cons </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of actually living here? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, I want to know
from you guys, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Because I mean, I've experienced Japan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> pretty much for half my life so I know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> to me the pros and cons are
just very natural to me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I feel like you,
the most of the cons </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that we might, me and Garnt might have, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> you won't ever experience because one, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you can speak the language
and read it fluently. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know, man, I have
the face of a foreigner. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, true. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like I'm just gonna say it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There's a lot of discrimination here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (guys laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - But I mean, what country doesn't? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I would say, I like understand it more </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because growing up in an Asian country, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> there's definitely discrimination in Asia. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's just very different from
what you see in the West. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I think.
- That's the thing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's not racism. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It's more xenophobia.
- Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right, and if you guys
don't know the difference </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> between that, racism is where it's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> oh, you're a different race to me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> so therefore you are worse than me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And xenophobia is like,
oh, you're not from here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> therefore you're, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think it comes more
from a place of ignorance. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's just ignorance I think. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause it's just, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause you guys didn't
open the country for ages. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, Japan has been a closed island </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for like the past 2000 years, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Exactly.
- So it's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what do you expect?
- Exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> So it makes sense to me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But like for example,
finding an apartment, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that was my first experience with that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where if you didn't,
if you're not Japanese </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and if you didn't speak Japanese </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then they were very scared
to even touch you, you know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Or even consider you in that case. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Especially when you have
a company backing you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> In my mind, I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't see what the problem is here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like the model tenant here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm single. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The problem is we can't
write your name in Kanji. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, right?
- That's the problem. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Kata Connor name? Ew, gross. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - But I mean, I have a problem too, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> because even though I am Japanese </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I have a Japanese name, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the fact that I don't look it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is already a huge wall </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> that regular Japanese
people find a difficulty </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in getting over because,
it's really funny as well, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> because during my intern days as well, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I had to be the guy to like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if there was like a business
partner coming to the office, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I had to be the one to
get on the phone with them </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and being like, "Okay, you
guys are coming at this time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and this day, okay, I'll
come down to meet you guys </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and greet you up to the office." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But when I speak Japanese, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't have an accent
and my name is Japanese. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> So there were so many
times where I would go down </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to greet them and they'd
be like who the fuck- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (guys laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> She's like, "You're not the
person on the phone, right?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, "Yeah, I am." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's like, "Oh, Oh, we
thought you were Japanese." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, "I am Japanese." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And they're like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> To so many of like the older
generation, especially, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they just can't fathom that there are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> these things called hafus. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just not a thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like you're either
Japanese or you're not Japanese. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause the way I it is that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I treat it like exactly the same </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how I would treat my
grandmother or my granddad </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> who lived in Thailand
in this small village </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> their entire fucking life, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> knew nothing about the outside world. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So they just didn't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's the same way with
a lot of Japanese people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where some of them,
especially like older people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who've never interacted with a foreigner </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or even like got to
know them or even knows </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what the outside world is like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> beyond what they see on the
news and what they see on TV. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - And you don't want
to like input anything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> from Japanese TV. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, you don't. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - My god. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Some of the stuff they air is like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We're called Trash Taste Podcast. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> If there's anything trashier
than Trash Taste Podcast </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it is fucking Japanese TV. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It is full of absolute garbage. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- It's something I wish that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like a lot of YouTubers whose channel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is focused all about Japan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> would speak about it a little more. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause it's not something you can ignore. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like if you're foreign or even
look foreign and live here, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're gonna experience it like totally. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I didn't know anything about this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> because no YouTubers talk
about it or anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I feel like it's
such an important topic </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> especially when you talk
about living in Japan, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's gonna be a factor,
you're gonna be stared at. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's not like you've said, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's not a place of
like hatred or anything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just like they don't
see kind of people a lot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think the problem
was a lot of J-Vloggers </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that do cover the topics like that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause when you live here, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> you pretty much get to
know every J-Vlogger. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's just natural, it's
such a small community. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I know pretty much every
like notable J-Vlogger here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And there's been a number
of them that I know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that have made topics on
the blatant xenophobia </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> here in Japan.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But the problem is I
think a lot of those videos </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> aren't taken seriously by the internet </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because it's seen as like
a privileged problem. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like you get to
live in Japan, you know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So therefore you should just be able </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to put up with this shit, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because you get to experience
all this other cool stuff. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> When that's not the point
of the video, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like it's still a problem
regardless of how privileged </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you may seem living here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think the worst
thing that happened to me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> was the time, one time we
got the police called on us. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you wanna explain why
we got the police called? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We didn't do anything illegal. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We just played Mario Party really loud. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah at like two in the morning. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (guys laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Very drunk. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - That was our bad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We can't really complain about that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay, so basically we've
got a noise complaint. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> So the policeman came and
he basically asked Joey, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who is he with?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I remember you saying like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh, there's one American,
one British person." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then there was me, who I'm Thai. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> So he mentioned that
I'm with a Thai friend. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And as soon as he mentioned
that he was with a Thai friend, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the policeman was like, "Oh." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - "Can we see your Thai friend?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - "Can we see your Thai friend?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I go up there and I
started getting grilled </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about why I'm here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They want to see my
passport and everything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And they asked me for my visa. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But you showed them your
British passport, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, as soon I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, I have a British passport though." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They were like, "Okay, you're free to go." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (guys laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was so messed up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I was like, "Oh, what
the fuck just happened? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What was that?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was so messed up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And the fact that they
only called you up there, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even though there was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was like the most multicultural room </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in probably the entire apartment building. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm gonna say it now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I wasn't making the noise. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (guys laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - You were like the
quietest there, if anything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And that was the first time
I ever experienced that too. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm just like, Jesus Christ, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like they couldn't even
be subtle about it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, no.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I'm like you do know like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is like not cool, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But to them it's just, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think you just, I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I know I get starred at a
lot which is weird for me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because obviously coming </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> from like the whitest place on earth, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was just like another person. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> And I've never experienced
this in my life, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which I guess is also strange. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And also, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this is gonna sound so
odd, but okay, in Japan, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> not exactly known for the best
legal system, if you will. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Normally if you're arrested
or whatever or convicted, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> charged with a crime,
you normally get like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like a 98, 99% conviction rate. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know where this is going but- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right, but also this is
the first time I've ever been </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> around police where I'm like, shit, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> please don't stop me,
Please don't stop me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (guys laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I guess this is like Connor
checking his white privilege </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> for the first time ever. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But like, because if the
police stop me, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can't explain to them why I might, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like I don't know what
I might do that's wrong. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't wanna get fucking arrested </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause like how do I get
myself out of that hole? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then, yeah, it's just
a weird experience for me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I've never felt before. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm sure people are like, wow, Connor, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> really seeing his white
privilege for the first time ever </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in his life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But it's weird though, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause that's like stuff
that I never considered </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'd have after like worry about ever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right, you have to like
kind of experience it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> unfortunately firsthand to
fully understand it, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And that's the problem is
that there are so many, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like, I guess, controversial
topics like that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> concerning being a
foreigner, living in Japan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I'm sure a lot of
J-Vloggers want to talk about, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but because from the
position that they're talking </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> about it for them, it's
very difficult to make- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Hard to bring it up like,
oh, they hate Chinese people. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right, because it's
also like for someone, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> for a foreigner who's never lived in Japan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's very hard to like swallow
and understand being like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no, that doesn't happen, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That must be just you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Whereas it's very much a common occurrence </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> for any like foreigner who
lives here unfortunately. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's unfortunate, but it's just a thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> where you move here and
you realize there's- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Pretty quickly.
- Yeah, pretty quickly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that it works differently </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and people view you differently as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But I think to me, that is
the worst experience I've had </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> about moving to Japan apart from, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Can we talk about how slow
Japanese businesses work? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - My fucking god. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Everyone has this image that
Japan this like super tech- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Optimized place, the most
optimized system on earth. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They figured it out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Speed running business. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Things just work. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You go to a restaurant, you
press a button on a tablet </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the food just appears in front of you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You're like this is the future. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then you go to a Japanese business </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and you're like, "Oh,
is that a fax machine? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Are you using a fax machine right now?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Or just like stuff you
never even considered </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a problem or asking for permission </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for the slightest thing on earth. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just like you show a
logo or something in a video, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we got to find permission to do that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like just fucking upload it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If it's a problem,
they'll tell us, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - See, but that's the thing, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Is that Japan doesn't understand- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No risk.
- Well, no risk as well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but at least with like
what we do business wise, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Japan doesn't have fair use. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So it's so difficult to
get permission for any, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like if you ask like as you said, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like can I just show
this logo of your company </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that is like publicly
available to anybody? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Just like slap it on for like two seconds. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm not even gonna mention
your name, just slap it on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It has to go through like 100 layers </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of the company just to get a simple yes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And that could take like a
couple of days if you're lucky, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> usually a week to maybe a month. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's just like ugh. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's a business model
where there's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> imagine if every employee was a boss </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and everyone had to ask
for permission constantly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like employees can't
make their own decisions. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They have to ask their boss
who then asks their boss </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and their boss and that takes a week. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And that's just to see </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you can sharpen your pencil, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We haven't got to business yet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like we're just trying to figure out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what the fuck's happening. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's not even just business. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just signing up for- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Everything.
- It's everything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Everything moves so slowly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember when we signed
up for our gym membership. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It took us an hour- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - An hour and a half I think. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - An hour and a half to
sign up for a fucking, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to get a gym card, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause you know in America
or like basically everywhere </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where you get the terms
and conditions, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You fucking scroll
through, you click accept. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> No, in Japan, you're gonna sit there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you're gonna read every term </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you're gonna agree to every
fucking term individually. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And they're gonna sit there with you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to make sure you read it all. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (guys laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, you're not only
subject to going through </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the fine print, which is no longer fine, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just print. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> But they're like, "Let
me read it out for you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in case you're a fucking
illiterate piece of shit." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like no, see that's
why like when I signed up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for the gym membership </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> because it's all written
in Japanese, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I straight up just said
like, "I can read it." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> (guys laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I saved myself like an hour
of pain of just like listening </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> to this fucking hour long
monologue from this like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think that's 'cause we are foreign, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> he was like, he really,
really wanted to make sure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we understood and bear in mind </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> these weren't terms and conditions </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> of any like social things. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was like literally the
bare bones of what a gym </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> needs to make sure you know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like don't run on the treadmill </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if your legs don't work, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Just stuff like, basically
don't sue us stuff, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Stuff you wouldn't take for granted. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I remember he was like asking us, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> our translator, if we
understood every single point, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and every one of them was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Do you understand that on the treadmill </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you have to have your hands on
the treadmill at all times?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I looked at like our friend Nabby, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I was like, "Is he serious?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's not a joke, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He wants me to like agree-
- He legally has to say that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I have to agree that
I'm gonna put my hands on, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have you ever seen like anyone, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like a crippled old man
run on the treadmill? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yes, because that's how I run, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just like free hands. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - No one does that and
you're literally like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're signing this agreement </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you turn your head to see
10 people on the treadmill, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> none of them holding their hands. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And you're like, "Yes, I agree." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just, it's all bullshit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's all you do. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And this is the stuff
that you never experience </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> as a tourist, because it's
like perfectly separate </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> the stuff that you
experienced as a tourist </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to the stuff you experienced living here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And the moment you do something
that is remotely permanent </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or reoccurring in a contract, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you better be ready to
bring every document </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that you've ever had in your life </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and the hanko which you'll lose a lot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm surprised they didn't ask </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for our fucking birth certificate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when signing up for the gym, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> because it's so formal with everything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, you don't need
to know my life story. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's the perfect word. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Everything in Japan is so formal </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you don't see it as a tourist, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause when you're here
in Japan on tourism </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and you're just sight seeing,
everything just works, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You go to a restaurant, it just works. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Living here, all the little intricacies </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and all the little things
you take for granted </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that should be quick, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just takes a million processes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> when it's just the most
un-optimized thing in the world. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And there's just a lot of
things that don't make sense </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> in contracts, like going
back to paying rent. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There's this thing called a key fee. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What was it like? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - The fucking, this is the most obnoxious, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like key money, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Key money.
- Key money. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I mean, you can
explain it if you want. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Go ahead. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But it's the most
obnoxious thing on earth. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What can I explain? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's two months of rent, sometimes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - So the amount is
about two months of rent </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you pay to the rent
owner to say thank you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for renting me your place. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - For free, you don't get it back. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's not a deposit, you
just pay two months of rent. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which you also have to
pay a deposit and then. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, on top of the
deposit that you have to pay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's basically a dick suck fee. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's what it is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, thank you so much </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> for letting me stay in your apartment. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's what it is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then it doesn't end there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because you then have to pay the rental, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the agency that got you the house, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you have to pay a month's
rent to them as a fee, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which is just stupid because I
think in every other country, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they take that split from
the person renting the house. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Not from you because renting
a house shouldn't be, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you shouldn't have to pay like
six to eight months upfront. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's ridiculous. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I think it's the reason
why a lot of homeless people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> here also struggle to get housing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because how the fuck are
you gonna get six months </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> worth of rent and money? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Are you kidding me? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like that's insane. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - When you look at the
rent you expect like, okay, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> this is how much I'm gonna
pay for the first month. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I pay a deposit, maybe two months. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, like maybe like
a month or two deposit, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but like no, it's like
double or triple that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm just like, Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's ridiculous.
- Yeah, stupid. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like, yeah, six months
worth of rent in one sitting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And you're not gonna get two
months of that back at all. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because they want you
to stay in that apartment. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> They don't want you to leave. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I like going around. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I like moving, getting a new place, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> seeing how things are, knowing
what I like and don't like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but now it's pretty much just solidified </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I'm not leaving this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> because I'm gonna charge
out the ass if I wanna move. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because it's like a minimum of two years </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> to stay in one place.
- Two years, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And even then if you're moving, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like the amount that you
paid in that first month, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that if you split that
across two years of rent, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it'd be way over paying for what you got. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I think that's why,
that's one thing, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> About like living in
Japan that I've personally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> never understood for the longest time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But I think finally now I do understand </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is when people say like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Man, Japan is such an expensive place." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> But when you think about it, it's like no, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> cause when I think, "Oh, Japan
is such an expensive place", </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Eating out, drinking.
- Eating out or drinking. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like, no, it's relatively cheap. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> But then you think about- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - All the bills.
- Six months worth of rent </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> in the first month kind of bullshit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like, okay, maybe, yeah, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it is a little bit
ridiculous and expensive. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. I mean, you
can live frugally here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's not too hard to live frugally. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, you can live cheap. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like not a problem. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, konbinis you can live off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We can do a whole episode. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But that's basically the
best thing about Japan, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like no matter where you are, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you are in with like 100 meter radius </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> of everything you need
like no questions asked. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Japan is the only country
where the word convenience store </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> actually lives up to its name </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because it is actually one
of the most convenient places </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that you could go. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - God, I love konbini
so fucking much, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like not even the
food, the food's amazing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like you expect this, like
if you go to a gas station </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in any country in the world </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and you try and convince
me to buy something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's been cooked in that building, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I would rather like just get salmonella. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not gonna risk
seeing what they give me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Those nasty hot dogs that
have been in rotation </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for like 20 hours at least. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But the one thing that I thought was just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> the most genius thing that Japan does, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which I do not understand
why every other country </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> doesn't do this, is the
fact that they just have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> a printing machine in there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, a printer, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So no one needs to
buy a printer or buy it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can just go to this place </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that's probably within 100 meters of you, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 200 meters at most. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Max.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You pay like 10 cents or whatever </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and you can get a printed
A4 copy of whatever you want </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because no one needs to
print that much shit, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've never needed to print
more than like one document. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And ink's fucking expensive. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right? And it dries as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So you might print one
thing, it's gone dry. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I feel so bad for
admitting that I've done this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but in the UK, in university,
when we had to have a printer </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I was printing a of documents, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I used to like, the ink
was more expensive to buy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on its own than just buying a new printer. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So every time I ran out of ink, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I bought a new printer. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (guys laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Are you serious?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's like 200 IQ move though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I know, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Bear in mind, right, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is the time when
you're in university, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Where losing 20 pounds, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is like like 30 bucks at the time, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was like a big deal, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You don't get any money. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't afford to lose 30 bucks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's like 10 instant ramens, dude. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right, that's like two
nights out if I'm good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I would go to like the charity shop </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and just give it to them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And every single month on cue,
I'd come in with a printer </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and just the exact same Amazon
basics printer and give it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I just thought like I can
appreciate this so much now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that in Japan if you
want to print anything, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you don't have to buy a printer, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you don't have to fuck
around worrying about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which ink cartridge
matched with your printer. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You just go to the convenience
store and you print it off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's just like, it makes sense. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - And the best thing is if
you do need to print out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> a document or anything,
you can just be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> oh, I can do that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but you know, I can also buy a drink. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, at the same time, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Or I can stock up my
fridge. It's all there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can pay my bills. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> You can pay your bills. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's the best thing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you can pay your bills at-
- The convenience store, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's wild to me.
- It's insane. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't anymore because
that just takes time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but I did at first. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It was a novelty at first. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause I think the best
and worst part of Japan to me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> is that it's like a dichotomy, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it either works exceedingly well, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it's well exceedingly optimized, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or it's just 100 processes
to do the simplest shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There's no middle ground. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Nothing here works okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It either works exceedingly well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> or it just doesn't work at all. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think it's normally
like a public demand, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Convenience stores, trains. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Everyone is using them 24/7. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We want this easy as
possible, (indistinct), </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> all that, it all works flawlessly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- I think where it comes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> into play mostly is with
government agencies, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> big companies that have higher ups </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that don't want to change
things very fastly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And if you thought like
companies in the West </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't want to change things, my God, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you are in for like a surprise. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Most Japanese companies haven't changed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> since like the 70s. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because not only do they
not want to change things, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> even if the person before them dies, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they're like, "Well, they
didn't want to change it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I really don't want
to step on their toes, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> even though they don't exist anymore." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, we've got to keep
everything the same way it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that's been working. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's the problem though </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> is Japan has such a double edged sword </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> in terms of like maintaining culture. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It does. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it works in great ways. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - And maintaining tradition </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> is the word I was looking for, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's very traditional in
a lot of ways like, man, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm looking at Japanese web design. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my God, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I take it for granted
how good we had it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I didn't realize that I
cared about user interface. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was interning, I was in
the web division department </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> because that's what I
majored in at uni, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> So I had to like go around fixing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> basically clients old websites </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and anybody who ever did
anything like HTML or CSS related </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> can relate to this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I almost had a stroke when
I looked at the source code </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I saw a table
(guys laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm like, that's
something we haven't used </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> since like the early 90s. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> This is like early 90s type of web design </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they're still using it to this day. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't think I've
seen a single animation </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> on a webpage in Japan.
- No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's no graphics at all. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It literally looks like the
first windows iteration. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It just looks so fucking cluttered. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Weirdly enough, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the best web design I have seen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> is landing pages for new anime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's the only good
websites that I've seen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like damn. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> They used JavaScript for the shit, Jesus. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Before we move on to the logistics, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I want to talk about staying to the pros, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how good the fucking food is here, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God.
- Moving here from England. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Where good food is you either, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's you either have to pay a lot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or you have to cook it yourself. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Everything here tastes good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's just true, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You never have a bad
experience in Japan with food. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I swear to God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's like the difference </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I tell my parents the most, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like in the UK, I
don't know about Australia, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but when you go to the
restaurant, it's not a gamble, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> but it kind of is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You don't know if it's
gonna be okay or amazing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's always a coin flip. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You just don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And you have to go to find out- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh no, that's 100% how
it works in Australia. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause it might just
be a restaurant owned </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> by a guy who has no idea what he's doing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He doesn't give a shit about the food. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> But in Japan it is like guaranteed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no matter where you go,
you will get good food. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You are never overcharged either. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> You always pay a fair amount. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - And when you are overcharged, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it is like the taste and
experience is worth it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Exactly. Exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I remember saying very
harsh words to my mom </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> when she used to just, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like how dare you give me
this bland food all my life </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> when this stuff existed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> How many times must I have
beans and toast, mother? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> How many times can a
man eat beans and toast? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I actually still like beans and toast. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - When the konbini food here is better </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> than a lot of the restaurant food </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you can find in British
restaurants I go to, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, man, there's
something wrong from here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> There's something wrong here, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's the insane thing is that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know if Japan is the
only country that's like this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but it's cheaper to eat out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> than it is to cook your own food. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's the same thing in Thailand. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think a lot of the Asian
countries are like that, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, because at least in
Australia, like Jesus Christ, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> no one goes to restaurants
because it's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't want to gamble if this $25 pasta </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is gonna be good or not like I'm sorry. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like I'm not that rich. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I'd rather just go to a supermarket </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and just cook a $5 pasta myself. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Here in Japan and to
get like a single lime, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a single lime, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I pay $2. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> $2 for a single fucking lime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> What the fuck! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't think anyone's
mentioned that on YouTube. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> People don't tell you how
expensive it is to cook here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know if this is just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> maybe in America it's different. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> We're not from America </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I know the prices
for fresh food in America </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> is like ridiculous.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But in the UK, I don't
know about Australia, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> in the UK buying ingredients
is so incredibly cheap. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Same in Australia, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Which is why nobody, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> eating out is not so much
you do it for the food. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's more of like an
experience with your friends. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's not for an event, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's a luxury.
- Yeah, it's a luxury. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - You don't do it because
like you have the money. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like you do it for a reason. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If you speak to someone in the UK </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and I know that if you say
like you eat out every day </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in the UK, everyone's like
what's the fuck wrong with you? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, because it in the UK, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you don't eat out alone, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's very rare to do something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like eating out alone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And here, more people eat out
alone then cook, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because it's just more convenient
and it's cheaper as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause my God, vegetables
here, meats are okay, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but vegetables are so expensive. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know why. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And the biggest offender in
my mind, limes, terrible, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> peppers, you know like
normal bell peppers? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - In the UK, I distinctly
remember in like Aldi </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or even Tesco, it's like
one pound 29, right, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> for a pack of three bell peppers, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's like what, $1.60. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> In Japan for like a single bell pepper, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> which comes with its own packaging, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like 180 yen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> So if you want to have three peppers. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like two bucks.
- So that's two bucks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like $6 for three bell peppers. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Are you fucking kidding me? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Can we talk about the
biggest offender though, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> which is fruit? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my God.
- Oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Fruits- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, they're good, they're good, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> first of all, they're good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - They're amazing.
- They're good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But Jesus, talk about overpriced. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I know like, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Japan has this like weird obsession </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when it comes to fruits where it's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh, it's from this- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You gotta massage it.
- No, no, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's not even that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, oh, it's from
the specific prefecture </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that specializes in that, therefore, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if you want to buy an apple
from like Aomori prefecture, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is like known for their apples, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like a regular Apple,
like I don't know about the UK, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but at least in Australia it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> if you want like a freshly grown- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We don't fucking know
where it's come from. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Good quality, like a home grown apple, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> the most you'd pay is maybe like a buck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've never paid more
than 50 cents for an apple. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think I'd be shocked if I
paid more than like 30 pence. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Where as here, if you want
a specialized branded apple </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is like the only kind of apples </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they have here for some reason, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like, oh yeah, 600 yen, please. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because there's no cheap brand here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Every brand has a certain story. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's like that, it's like, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> when you have Asian
grandparents or something, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everything they feed you has
health benefits or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh my God.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They feed you like this
vegetable or this fruit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And then you're like, oh,
this is really good for X. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It says, it's not proven,
but it's like a wives tale. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The amount of like fat
products they sell here </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is like incredible. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> You think that we're in
the age of science, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I thought that people like
knew that half the shit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they see on packaging is bullshit, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The amount of just weight loss things </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I've seen here is incredible. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Like put this pad on your belly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it will just magically
go because of the gels. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's like that's just
not how the body works. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know what's kind
of incredible as well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> when it comes to weight
loss culture here in Japan, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> apparently I saw somewhere </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and I don't know, don't quote me on this, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I saw it a while ago that
Japan is really interesting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> when it comes to weight loss </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because we're one of the most- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Healthiest country. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Healthiest countries in the world </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and yet I think it's something ridiculous, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like one in three people diet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's crazy, I don't understand. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I'm like you don't need to diet </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and that whole thing comes from the whole </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ridiculous standard of
beauty here in Japan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> where everybody needs to be bulimic </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> otherwise you're not considered beautiful. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But going back to the fruit thing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I remember me and Arki went
to this new supermarket </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that opened up near our place. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I wanted to check
out the fruit section </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I'm always curious. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like how can we
get ripped off anymore? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And there were like these packet of, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there were these cherries, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I love eating cherries.
- Oh God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - There were these packet of
like cherries from America. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Which are like, there
was 30 of them in there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it was like 400 yen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, okay, a tad
expensive, but not too bad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Right next to there, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there was a pack of another 30 cherries, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> but they were from like
Ibaraki or somewhere local. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it was obviously some
kind of brand, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Guess how much these cherries were? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just going off Japan
experience, like 30 bucks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay. So like 3000 yen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> How much do you think it was? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like 2,500 yen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 2,500 yen, right?
- 25 bucks. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, think of 6,500 yen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, Jesus.
- Oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - For 30 cherries home grown. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like what? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I was really tempted to
buy it just being like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I swear to God if one cherry
doesn't give me an orgasm, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like it's not worth it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. I know right?
- It's just not worth it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's good fruit, don't get me wrong. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But is it worth the fucking
premium that I'm paying? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right.
- I don't think so. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't think so.
- It's so stupid. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's already a luxury just
to buy regular fruit here, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> regular non-branded fruit.
- Exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like who is buying this? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's my biggest concern is like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> what kind of fruit elitist is
buying these like $60 cherries </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from like down the road? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Five star Michelin fucking cherries. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like who is buying these? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And being like mm, yes, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I can definitely taste the
homegrown quality in this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's the fucking elderly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It's the grandma that's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "This is hidden health benefits." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (guys laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is low GMO. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - This cherry will fix
your erectile dysfunction. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (guys laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - This isn't from America. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It's home grown. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Going back to people
who stay thin in Japan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think one preconception I had is that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I would just move to Japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because Japanese food is so healthy, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> you just like lose weight automatically. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'd like zero effort,
lose weight automatically. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Most restaurants have a menu. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Surprise. Surprise. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And i you just pick the unhealthy option, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you get the unhealthy option. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yep, you gain just as much weight. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think the whole
preconception is that like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I think especially when
it comes from Americans- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's not so much about the actual fact </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that like the food is healthier </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm sure like if you
like constantly go eat out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of like traditional Japanese restaurants </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that serve traditional Japanese food, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yes, you're probably
getting healthier stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But I think it just seems healthier </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> especially when compared to like Americans </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because the portion
sizes are just smaller. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - That and like the whole konbini, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> all that stuff is definitely not healthy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh no, no, no, no.
- That stuff's awful for you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's delicious, but it's not healthy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's the problem,
everything's delicious </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so you just want to keep
eating more and more. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Right, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think we mistake it as
like a food culture thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> as to why everyone's so thin here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but it's definitely like
when you've live here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you realize really quickly
it's a lifestyle thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. It's definitely a lifestyle thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because they walk so much, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> most people do exercise unless
they're super busy with work, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I mean, that's
already draining enough, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> but I've noticed that people
don't really eat lunch </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> or breakfast much here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like a light bite most of the time, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> unless it's a business meal, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then that's when they'll eat lunch. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But most people I think
just have like an onigiri </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> or like a small snack. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, like a CalorieMate?
- Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And even then I think most
people are just too exhausted </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> by the time they finish work, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they just have something
just 'cause they need to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then they go to bed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Where, I mean, when you're a YouTuber, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I eat because I'm bored and trust me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> there's more than enough stuff to eat here </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that is like terrible for you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm sure the amount of food </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> they're just like are
used to eating as well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is greatly different to any
standard of a Westerner, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh no, like for me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> whenever I have like a
sweet, like an ice cream- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Everything is sweet here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, everything.
- Everything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And it's so good.
- It's amazing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Normally I hate sweets, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but now when I go to a konbini </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I have to get at least
one snack or one sweet. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - But like the one thing I can't forgive, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> especially, this is not just Japan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is all Asian
countries is sweet bread. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh.
- Oh. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just think they- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't understand it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can't speak of other Asian countries, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but this country's bread is a joke. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's still bread. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Half the bread that you can choose, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I have not seen a single bread </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that is like multi-grain bread. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like just brown bread, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Finding anything but white bread </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and then sometimes like
bread with custard in it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Who the fuck wants bread
with custard in it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, I fuck with
bread with custard in it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I fuck with it because I
grew up eating that shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then there's other stuff, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's like in the UK, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the one thing that I realized
now I took most for granted </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> was just a loaf of bread.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like the one thing
that everyone feels entitled to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in the UK is a loaf of bread. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It is like the staple of the house, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Everyone has a loaf of bread. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You just go to like
fucking Tesco's, Waitrose. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's one pound at most. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You could even get the cheaper option, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> still a whole loaf of bread
for like 80 cents, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> 80 cents, ADM, whatever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - How many slices of bread
do you get in the UK? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You get like 12, like
12, you get a full loaf. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like this big. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> In Japan, you get half the fucking loaf </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and they've cut it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - You get six slices. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You get six slices, but
it's not only six slices, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like a brick of fucking like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's not even a slice. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It's too thick to make a sandwich out of. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's so thick that the toaster struggles </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> to toast it all the way through. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You have to like put that
bitch in for like 10 minutes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's like lightly brown. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just like, I just want toast! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I think bread has been the thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I've missed the most. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If not that, cheese. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, don't get me started on cheese. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You can get good cheese here, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but for the same block
of cheese in the UK, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a kilogram of cheese, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I would pay like two, three pounds, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> So that's like, what? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Four or five bucks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Here, if I want like
200 grams or 500 grams </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of good actual cheese, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not that God awful shit they have here, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like 15 bucks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm not paying that much for cheese </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I just can't like In my head. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, it's a bigger struggle for me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> considering that Australia
is known for its cheese, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like all supermarkets in
Australia have an aisle </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> specifically for cheese, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Here, you have to go to a
specific specialized supermarket </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for foreign cheese and
everything like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I just want to grate cheese on shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Or it's in a tiny corner
of the dairy section. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, and it's like the
most processed fucking cheese. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's American cheese. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - They'll have like 10000 meters of tofu. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Don't you worry about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They'll have every single tofu imaginable. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> They'll have like, it's the same tofu </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's like instead of
0000F on the color grade, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's 000.1F. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's one shade whiter. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's literally like
the shit they'll sell. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> But like cheese, no way. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Get that shit out of here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We don't need cheese. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know it's fucked when we
have more variations of natto </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> than we do cheese. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (guys laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, not that I'm
complaining, but yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know how you handle natto, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just grew up with it, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm open to things.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think I have a really good palate. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can eat anything but natto, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know what the fuck that is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't want to be that guy,
but it's an acquired taste. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (guys laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You can say that again. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know, I feel that
I'm pretty international </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I'm open to try new things. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There's a few things in the
world that I just don't get. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Natto is one of them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm sorry to betray my own country. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Durian is another one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm sorry, guys. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've never tried real durian. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've never tried durian as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - But I've always wanted to. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What are some like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I guess while we're talking about it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what are some misconceptions about Japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you think you experienced? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause for me, I know, I
thought for some reason </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I thought I was gonna eat way more fish </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> by just being, I mean, in comparison </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I guess I do eat slightly more fish </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I thought fish was gonna be way more </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of a factor in my life
than it actually is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel like if you want
to avoid fish in Japan, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it is so easy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah, very, very. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, I think that also
comes from the whole fact </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> that because there were
more foreigners living here, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like there were just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> especially between the four years </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> that I've been living here, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there are so many more vegetarian
and vegan places open now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> It's incredible, especially in Tokyo, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> but like, yeah, no, I agree. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I love me my fish don't get me wrong. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Same, same. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But I'm definitely not
going to eat sushi every week </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like most my fans think I am. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I can't eat sushi every day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like a nice little treat. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know what you guys are on about. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If I could eat sushi every week, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I would and I do most weeks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Pre-quarantine, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> going to this dollar sushi chain, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I fucking love it because
you get better sushi </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> than you do for paying 30 quid
or whatever you do in the UK. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah.
- For a fucking dollar. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's fucking amazing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I do eat quite a lot fish </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> mostly because I eat sushi a lot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and when you cook at home,
you know cooking salmon. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah, I love cooking salmon, cod </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like that's so good.
- Yeah, yah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And because there's so
much fish, like in the UK </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sometimes you could get like meat </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's been like seasoned already. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And you can get like fish
and supermarkets here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's already been
pre-seasoned, everything, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so literally all you gotta
do is open that bad boy up, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> throw it in a pan and you've
got an amazing tasting fish. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's so good.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think it's just habit basically, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> because if you don't have
the habit of eating fish, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's so many other
shit that you could eat </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> because it's so readily available. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Pizza potato, that's the best. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (guys laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you don't know what pizza potato is, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> come to the Japan, it's amazing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I fucking stand by it.
- But that's the thing right- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Sorry, I interrupted you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think most people think that like, oh, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> all there is to eat is just
like sushi is because like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> as obvious as this is gonna sound, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Japanese food culture is
just so much more than that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It is so much more than fish. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I have consistently had
the best Italian food here </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> as opposed to-
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's someone Italian
out there just cringing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, he's like what the fuck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Going to Italy, it's no contest, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But compared to the UK where
it was literally like again, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it was a coin toss, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You'd go to a place and the
pasta was like god awful. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like it's the saddest
carbonara, which you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how can you fuck that up? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's like pasta 101, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> You come here and I feel
like you just always </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> consistently have a good
experience with every kind of food. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Right?
- Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, you know this, Chinese
food in the UK is a joke. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - We're not gonna get into that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (guys laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I could spend a lot
talking about Chinese food- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Any kind of cuisine you can imagine, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> except maybe like American
food like portion heavy- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like diner food. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah meat, like really ribs and stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, it's hard to get that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but I'm fine with going to
America or going back to the UK </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and having that myself every now and then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for the overall trade-off of all right, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> consistently I get better meals, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is there anything else that
haven't met your expectations </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or haven't met your preconceptions? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I want to know as like
a non-resident, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Or like non-Japanese. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is gonna sound
dumb as fuck, all right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I know it's going to sound dumb, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> but I knew things were
going to be difficult </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I couldn't speak
Japanese or read Japanese. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> More so read than anything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like for some
reason you can be fine </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not speaking Japanese
here, but if you can't read </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like you're in for a storm of trouble </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> because there are so many things, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I think we all can agree on this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If Amazon didn't exist here and- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - If Amazon didn't have
English settings here, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I genuinely don't know what I would do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because the websites here in Japanese, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like I don't know if
they've done this on purpose </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> or due to the old interface, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they do not work well
with Google Translate. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, it's all going
back to that 90s web- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, they don't know how
to design their websites. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's not user-friendly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So if you can't speak
Japanese or read Japanese </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're kind of fucked.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And Google Translate does not help. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, it doesn't help. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> It can help you kind of
feel your way through </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but you cannot tell what
the fuck you're doing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The only reason we've been
able to get through it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is because we've had a fucking- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Got friends, we got
a company helping us. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> It makes it so much easier. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh yeah, Joey, shout out to Joey. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I am that friend.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Joey helped me a lot when we moved here, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like helped me out doing all the dumb- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I had to go to the town hall with you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to fill our your papers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's the thing, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like you think like
in the big population areas </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they'd have like a lot of English support, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I think they said if you
come on these certain days, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like setting up internet, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> do you remember how much
of a hassle that was? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my god. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I remember the AU, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> They say they have an
English location in Shinjuku. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah.
- That's a fucking lie. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, their English location
is that they have a tablet </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> which can call a call center </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that can translate the
person for you kind of, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but not really but that's the closest- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But did you even get that far? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I didn't even get
to the guy on the tablet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I just turned up saying on the website, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> this says this is the English location. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And they were like, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like, well, what do I do? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> How the fuck do I get internet now? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Help me! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Luckily I had a cousin
who worked in Japan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so she could speak Japanese. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> She helped me through so much </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I don't know what
I would do without her. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And same with you.
- Yeah, same, same. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I need a lot of help. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - You feel like a baby. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I genuinely don't know how, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> there are some foreigners here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who can't even speak English </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who somehow made it here on their own. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, how the
fuck did you do that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because at least they have
a lot of English words, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And a lot of English options sometimes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> but if can't speak English,
fuck, I don't know what you- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know how they do it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know, like English
is hard enough as it is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If you can't speak Japanese </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> then I think you're pretty much fucked. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (guys laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Real positive message
coming out of this episode. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, no, because that's the thing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a lot of people don't talk about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which is how hard it is to live here, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> actually live here
without speaking Japanese </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> because coming on, like
we said, it's so different </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> living here as working here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and just live visiting here as a tourist. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There's a world of difference. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And there's so many little
things like for example, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> registering with the town hall. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> How the fuck am I supposed to do that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if I don't speak Japanese? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause they don't speak English. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And all the forms were in Japanese. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, the forms, they tell
you that you need to do that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> within two weeks of moving
here are also in Japanese. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's simple, just learn Japanese </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the two weeks that you're here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The only reason we knew is
because the lawyers told us, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Hey, you've got do this." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But if we didn't know
that, I don't know what, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I would have just carried on living- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - You need a dedicated
agency just to help you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with all the admin stuff- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, I can understand the language </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I still have to learn
from my cousins who live here, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like this is just how it works. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like oh shit, I have
to go to the town hall </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and register for my address </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and my health certificate
and all of that shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I never had to experience
that living in Australia. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I never had to experience that
while visiting here, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So it's just, it's overwhelming. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And like it's like massive kudos </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> to people who don't know Japanese </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or even don't know English. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gain, I don't know how the fuck they do it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> without the help of an agency. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - To clarify, you can live here </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you don't speak any Japanese
or for if you're learning. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> But I think if you're
somehow coming here alone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> without anyone helping you,
it's gonna be hell on earth. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause it was hell enough </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with multiple ways of
us having help, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I felt so bad for Joey, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the amount of times I
have to ask him for help. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, he fucking
hates me at this point. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Every day I'm coming over with a form. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I still like you, don't worry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (guys laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like hey Joey, what does this say? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then also until you
figure this out, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If you miss a package in the post, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you get a little form through your mailbox </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that's all in Japanese
and you need to figure out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how the fuck you're gonna
reschedule this thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Luckily, I found a way eventually </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which was scan the barcode
with whatever thing you have, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it'll take you to a website, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> use Google translate to translate it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and then hope that the
translation are rough enough </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where you can like figure
out what's being said </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and that's what I do every time now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But for the first week
where I didn't know that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> every time I missed a package, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, "Hey Joey,
can you call them up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and tell them I'm gonna be home by 12?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - There was like a month where
I was calling up these guys </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> more often for his packages
than it was for my own packages. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I felt so bad, but I was
like I need the package. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It's my fucking desk. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And again, okay, let's
trace it back again. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I hate being like nice
to a trillion dollar company </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like Amazon, but without
them and the English, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause you can just change
it to English, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And they also they have
support in English. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'd know, 'cause I've had to
like return items and stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> It's literally no different </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> from using Amazon in the UK. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Except maybe sometimes the translations </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> don't work one for one, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> but you can pretty much
find what you want. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You can type it in in
English and it comes up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - We basically furnished our entire- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, my whole house is Amazon. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Using Amazon.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because they have like a Japanese Ikea </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is called Nitori, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> but you have to go to the store, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you have to register, you
have to put in your address </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and all that stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - And it takes like 20
days to deliver anything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Did you know that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> How crazy is that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If you want like their version of like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> there's Ikea here as well,
but it's very expensive. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> If you buy stuff from Nitori, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> which is like their version
of Ikea like you said, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like, there's a lot,
there's a lot of waiting time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like 20 days I think for some products. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Geeze. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I was like I can't
wait 20 days for a bed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I want to sleep. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Like what do you mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Let me just sleep on the
hard floor for 30 days. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, what am I gonna do? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And yeah, just also any advice
to someone moving to Japan, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> please make sure your house
has AC before you move in, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I didn't and I had to
pay I think it was like 2005- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Your previous tenant jacked the AC. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - He gutted, he fucking
gutted the whole place. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He took everything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He took the light bulbs. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Who takes light bulbs? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah, that's a frequent
occurrence you'll see, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like going into a new apartment, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> there won't be any lights. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You'll have to buy your own lights. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - When I move out of a place, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll leave stuff that I
think is like super generic </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you don't need to think about. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll leave the bulbs in. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If I have like a doormat,
I'll just leave the doormat. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like whatever, they can throw
it away if they don't want it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> But like they took everything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> They took everything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They took everything from me! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So I moved in with no AC </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and it was getting really cold. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I think there's one cosplay video </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where I was fucking
freezing during this video </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was getting like naked for it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like (shivers). </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Not only that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but you were in like the
coldest rooms in the house. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> The tatami room. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The tatami room, which retains no heat. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - So just like before you move, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> please, before you move into an apartment </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> please make sure there's AC there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> otherwise that's gonna be
a huge cost when you move. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I had to pay 2000 plus
dollars for two AC units. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Jesus. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I don't know what
I'm gonna do with that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> if I ever move back to the UK. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Jack it, dude, jack it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I guess I have to sell it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Bring it with you, UK could use AC. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - But okay, let's say you
pay for an apartment, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You paid for the AC in
that apartment, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like that's part of your bill. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Whereas I had to pay 2000 independently </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so that you could argue
that my rent has gone up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's just like dumb shit like that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that I didn't consider. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - No. So, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> One thing that was different for me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> is how much I thought I
would go to Akihabara. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (guys laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Versus how much I
actually go to Akihabara. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Onsens too. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. Yeah. Because every time we- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We haven't gone since you guys moved. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I know, I know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I know, I know! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It makes me so sad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause I remember like
every time we visited here </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> on holiday, we'd spend half our time there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> or something like that.
- Akihabara, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, of course. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Going to Akihabara is
the proper weeb experience. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm not proud should
admit that but it was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> imagine every single anime
convention shoved into one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It is like the mecca of the weebs. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It is just the holy land for weebs. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - But then you move here
and you're like, man, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Akihabara is not only a long way away, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but you can get a lot of shit
better online for cheaper </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you can figure out
Japanese websites, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Not only that, but there are cities that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> are better for all round experiences. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> That's why I love like Ikebukuro. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because with Akihabara, you
only go there for anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And if you want to do something else, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then it's not the best place to go. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But if you go to somewhere like Ikebukuro, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can still shop for anime figurines. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You can still go down- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Go down Otome Road.
- Exactly, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Go go to the Animate there,
which is also in Akihabara. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But then you could also
go to Izakaya afterwards </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> or go karaoke or you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> A lot of other things,
it's a lot more varied. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> There's a lot more variation
outside of Akihabara </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then if you want just- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Not to downplay Akihabara though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - No.
- It's amazing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It's great. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Every weeb should go to Akihabara. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's an experience. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You'll have a spiritual awakening </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when you go to Akihabara. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It is crazy like the
first time you go there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like holy shit, what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - This is what I dreamed about. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Three Sega Arcades right
next to each other, why? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's just kind of like
information overload, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You get blasted with so many lights </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with so much shit just around you, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you don't know where to go. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> You can spend an entire fucking
day in one store easily. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah.
- Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause if you want to
look for deals, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And figures, you got to
pull out the whole shelf </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause they hide shit
like way in the back. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And sometimes you might find that one deal </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that is like all you fucking talk about. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> When I found that one thing
for like 20 bucks, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I want to get a figurine
for like the best price </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> you got to create a Google Spreadsheet. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - All right, this still
has it for this price </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but the store down there
has it for 10% cheaper. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> So you just gotta like
keep track of everything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then you ultimately realize </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that it's cheaper on Yahoo Auctions. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like half price on Amazon. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's way better to buy online. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, even Amazon here, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the figures are way cheaper
sometimes than the stores, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> which is like weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - See, because for me like Amazon itself </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> was just like a huge revelation </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because we don't have Amazon in Australia. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Wow.
- Oh, you don't? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, we don't. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's so weird to think
there's a world without Amazon. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - How does a country
function without Amazon? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - We have eBay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> And we have like our own
version of Amazon called Gumtree </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which is just- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, we have Gumtree.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Gumtree is where I used
to sell sketchy stuff </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to sketchy people. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's like the
Craigslist of Amazon though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, pretty much. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But like Gumtree, I'm pretty
sure was an Australian company. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> And so we have Gumtree
and eBay and that's it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> We don't have Amazon. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So back when I was living in Australia </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and talking to American YouTuber friends </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who were like, "Oh yeah, I
just got that off Amazon." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm just like, yeah, about that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I, uh, they're seeling it for
three times the price on eBay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Does that count?
(guys laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I hated it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So when I moved here,
Amazon was just like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Whoa.
- Holy shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's gonna arrive tomorrow?
- Next day delivery? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Fucking hell, yeah, so that was amazing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because the thing about Akihabara </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel it's more of an
experience than the actual, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you don't go there to actually shop, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you go there for like
the Akihabara experience. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause like I remember
one of the biggest things </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I noticed going to Akihabara is that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can walk into one shop </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and you think it's like
this single store shop </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you're just gonna
come in and come out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And then it turns out to
be seven fucking stories. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Of shops.
- Yeah, of shops. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then you waste five hours there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause there's so much
stuff in this one shop. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's so tightly packed in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Buy used figures as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Their version of used here is a joke. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's immaculate, it's immaculate. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like I feel bad now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because when I use something,
it's fucking messy as fuck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I have books that have
like one single folded page </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or something that I like
placed it down wrong. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And that's just unusable here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. They'll be like
damaged goods, looks very used. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like what the fuck? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Used in the UK is like if
it's just barely functioning. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, barely functioning, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> probably has like an STD. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't fucking know
what it's been through. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Whereas here it's like
have you opened the box? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, it's used. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Which is fucking amazing how Connor, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you found probably the
only used product in Japan, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which was your fridge. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, God.
- Can we talk about that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'll let you tell the story, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it definitely was
not in immaculate shape. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - So we had spent A lot
of money on moving, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> As anyone knows moving is very expensive </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I'd heard of these like Sayonara Sales </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as they're called. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> People who move from Japan, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they basically sell all that stuff- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Is that what they're called? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, Sayonara Sale. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And so they sell all
their stuff on Craigslist </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and Meilyne, kept
telling me at BookWalker, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> kept telling me like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Dude, just buy all your
stuff on Craigslist. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like dirt cheap." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I thought, wow- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Great idea, Meilyne. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Wow, call her out on this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And you know, I thought, all right, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> well, Japanese people are really great </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with like keeping their stuff immaculate. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I order, I speak to
someone on Craigslist, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> a sauna fridge and a laundry machine, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is that what you call it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - A washing machine.
- A washing machine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't fucking know.
(guys laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - A laundry machine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - A laundry device machine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Anyway, I bought it for like,
it was like 50 bucks, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> For a fridge and a laundry-
- That's already a red flag. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> But there were some people who were giving </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> their stuff away for free.
- Oh really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, 'cause they
we're gonna get charged </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> by the local council. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - To get rid of the stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So I didn't pay for anything else, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> not the moving fee or anything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So you were there when
my houseman turned up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like a guy from New Zealand. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, he was a Kiwi, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, he just turned up and he was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "All right, I'll fucking
install the machine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is that your Kiwi accent?
- Yeah, fuck it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> He's just like "I'll
fucking install it for you." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And so he was like I'll install it for you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I think I discussed with
the person on Craigslist. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> They were going charge me
like 10er for installing it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So the guy was like,
"Oh no, fuck it, mate." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And so he installed it
and then I got like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> do you remember? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I got like angry fucking texts </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> off the person off Craigslist. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They were like bombarding my phone. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I picked up the phone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then there was like an
Indian woman shouting at me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Being like, "Why didn't
you pay him the 1000 yen?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like, "What the fuck? Shut up." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (guys laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause he said it was cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm like, "He said it was fine, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> why are you fucking spamming my phone?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah and so I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I just hung up the phone. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, yeah, no, he left now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What the fuck you want me to do? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What am I supposed to do? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Stop shouting at me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I told her, I messaged her. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> If you send me one more
message shouting at me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm blocking you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (guys laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Giving it a hard block. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah I was like, "I'm gonna block you, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't you fucking dare talk..." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Don't at me.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - And the guy, the Kiwi called me up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and he's like, "All
right, mate, listen here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> She wants the money. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm gonna come back and get it." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then I was like, "All right, fine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll just give you the 10er, I don't care. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Can you just all stop calling me?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I just enjoy my evening. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So I met him at the konbini, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> gave him the 10er and then went back. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Next day I opened my fridge, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's like five
cockroaches in my fridge. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, holy fuck, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> No wonder they didn't want
a foreigner in their house. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Imagine being the only
foreigner in your building </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and that guy has cockroaches. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - The cleanest country
in the fucking world. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I swear to God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm the asshole who brought
cockroaches into this place. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> So I bought a cockroach fridge. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I fucking tore this fridge apart, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I literally tore, you know the felt </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you have on fridges?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I tore all that shit off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I took everything out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I bleached the fuck out of this thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> My house must've smelled </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like a murder scene being cleaned, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I bleached the hell out of this thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it was the most vile thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know the felt thing, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was shaking it out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and maybe like 100
cockroaches must've fell out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Ugh! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't even want to know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the living conditions of the person </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who sold me this fridge. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But fuck you if you ever watch this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You are horrible. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Do not sell people your fridges </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> if they are in that condition.
- Exposed! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - How can you get cockroaches
in the most cleanest country </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> that I've ever been to? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You go on the streets here </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and you don't see any fucking rubbish. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - There are less cockroaches </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the back of like a fucking Denny's here </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> then there were in fridge.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - So that was my first
experience buying used in Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (guys laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah and it was awful
because I just thought </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like God damn it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Like I just got this house
and I've cockroaches now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And so I had to like
scour my whole apartment </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just making sure these
cockroaches didn't go anywhere. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And two months after I
kept finding one or two </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm like How? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I bleached everything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There is no reason these
things should be existing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's cockroaches 101, man, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> once you thought you got rid of 'em all, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're still around. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So now I got rid of the fridge </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I just thought enough is enough. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This thing looks disgusting. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I threw it out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It wasn't a nice looking fridge anyways. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was gross. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It looked like something like
a homeless man would sleep in. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Your apartment probably
has a cockroach infection </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that you just put into there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I got 'em all. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's somewhere in the building. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I got 'em all. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I got all those fuckers, I'm just saying. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I spent a lot of time.
- That's what you think. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (guys laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But before we end this episode, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I'd like to know especially from you, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause I know I experienced this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> When you announced that
you moved to Japan, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I kept mine
secret for like a month. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah, yeah, same here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I didn't tell anyone about the process, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I only really told close friends but- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just kind of dropped it down like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just kind of like made a tweet </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> being like I live in Japan now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What's up?
- Everyone was like what! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - What reaction did you
experience when you tweeted that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, everyone just assumes that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I was following that weeb dream
that we talked about earlier </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where I'm just like,
oh, you're finally being </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the final form of every weeb. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> You're finally in Japan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> You're gonna watch so much anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (guys laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're basically Japanese now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm basically Japanese.
- Konichiwa. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - And everyone assumes I
could already speak Japanese </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I've been to Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, same.
- Really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think a lot of people
just rightfully just, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay, not rightfully, I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I would never assume if
someone moves to a country </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that they can automatically
speak the language. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But I got so many comments
of people being like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> "But you can't speak Japanese, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so why would you move there?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like I don't read. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It's not really that much of an issue. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm gonna learn it.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, but It did become an issue </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and it is an issue if we
didn't have someone to help us. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It is an issue but if you have agency </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> or friend's helping you- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's not a requirement. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - If you have Amazon. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - If you have Amazon.
Jeff Bezos, shout out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Thank you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But yeah, I mean carry on, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is that all you got? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Like everyone just assumed
the weeb dream, etc? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I mean, I didn't get
too much of like a reaction </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> apart from just everyone was happy for me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everyone wanted to know how I moved here </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> or what I went through- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Now you know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, exactly, now you know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Much of the advice I can
offer isn't too helpful </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> because we were kind of
the first of our kind. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We were like some of the first YouTubers </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to be able to move here
for being an anituber. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Basically we got so good at being a weeb </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the Japanese government allowed
us to continue being weebs </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and we're being paid. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> They gave us a visa for
being a super fucking weeb. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, pretty much. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - We're the anomaly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We're the exception. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, Arki technically was- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, no she was the first. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm saying like we're one of the first. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, of course, of course. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause Arki was the first. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, of course. Of course. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, no, it's kind of incredible how, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, I felt the same way with RQ, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> but with you guys as well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that like, wow, like anitube
has gotten to that point now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause even like three years ago </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was fucking unheard of.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right, it's like oh
yeah, you talk about anime </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> on the internet for a living. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, good luck staying in your country </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for the rest of your life, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But like now it's just an
actual viable career option. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - If you can give back
more than you take out, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> then there's no reason why </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I guess a government agency would not want </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> to have that job there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you're giving more money </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you're not doing any harm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and you're respectful like
why wouldn't they want you? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's been really humbling
to actually be working here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> officially doing anime YouTube. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's been really weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Especially talking to people
who work in the companies, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Like directly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, how'd you feel your
careers have been affected </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> after moving here? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, I think mine's
increased dramatically </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> because now I do have access directly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to a lot of these productions. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I knew like a lot of people in
the industry, quote unquote, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> while I was living in Australia- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The anime industry.
- The anime industry. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> But like it is a
completely different story </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when you move here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh no, exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because like most of
these Japanese companies </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't know what the fuck an email is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And they require you to meet in person. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, want you to meet in person. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, if you're gonna
do business in Japan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> you need to have a face-to-face meeting, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> no email, no fucking Zoom call. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Not even a phone call. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like you need to come to our office </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and we need to make sure
that you're a real person. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, exactly. Exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> So it's all very traditional here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So to do business with any anime company </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is why things move so slowly is that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you have to follow the tradition. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You have to do that face to face meeting. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> They call a meeting
for any fucking reason. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Somebody sneezed in the office. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We need to discuss </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> whether this is a potential
anthrax infection. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Get HR on the phone.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, career wise, I
guess for me the biggest thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> is that I just want to
experience something else </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and also maybe learn another language. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Although it's painfully
difficult to learn Japanese. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] It is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just think getting more
life skills can only be a plus, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> right?
- Of course. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - If I continue doing what
I was doing in the UK, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was doing a lot of voiceover which sure, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I could probably go and maybe go into that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when for some reason I stop doing YouTube, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I think I just want to
learn more skills in my life </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> while I'm still young as well, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And while I'm still open to doing things </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and putting myself out there.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I think if anything from my career </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> definitely that benefit
of hopefully learning more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and making new connections with, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> maybe not the industry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know what I'll go into, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I mean, we've definitely
made connections as well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just from being in a company under- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - yeah, not even the anime industry, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just like lots of industries. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - You meet people that you
never knew that you would. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - A lot of creatives, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> A lot of cool people. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - But like I think the biggest barrier </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is the language barrier. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Japanese really need to
fix their difficulty curve </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because you go from fucking
playing Animal Crossing- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - To Doom Eternal Nightmare. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (guys laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like Katakana and Hiragana </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is like you're play just
playing Animal Crossing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And then suddenly you're
doing like a no hit run </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in Dark Souls or something
when Kanji gets in. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And you're like, what
the fuck is going on? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> This is not the difficulty curve I wanted. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - And the problem is with Kanji at least, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> not problem, I mean,
it's a really beautiful </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> system of writing and
I've come to appreciate it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> more and more, but it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> if you don't understand a baseline amount, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> you just can't read anything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because the moment you do,
you're like what's that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Welcome to the past 25 years of my life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it's not like if
I was learning French </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> where I can sound it out and maybe like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just can't like, I'm like
what the fuck is that thing? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then you're like, oh,
I know what this Kanji is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Turns out the Kanji has five
different pronunciations </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and meanings and you don't
know which one's which </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause you just got here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - You just have to know that shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is bullshit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think that's what's
the most difficult, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Is that like Japan is like an
anti-phonetic country, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause you can't spell shit out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You just have to know it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And that's why it's so
difficult for a lot of people. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - We know a lot of people
who can speak Japanese </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but I have not even attempted
to learn to read Japanese. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It is a completely different ball game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, it's crazy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Even like me having learnt it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> pretty much my first language, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I still struggle with
it every now and then. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It is like a constant
learning process for me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And like thank God that
my mom did whip my ass </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to learn it when I was
little, because Jesus Christ, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> my life has been a million times easier </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I can read it and understand it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's the one time when she said, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> "You'll appreciate it when you're older." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And you did actually appreciate
it when you were older. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was like thanks, mom. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> You helped build my career essentially. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Everyone said that with Welsh. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (guys laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Didn't quite pan out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, I appreciate the culture </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but that's about as far
as the usefulness goes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - But here's the question
I want to ask you guys, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> well, now that you've
experienced living here for what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Essentially seven, eight months now, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> how long do you intend to stay here? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Mhm, that's a good question. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think I've lived here
long enough to know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that I don't want to live here forever. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right, right.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think there's just at least right now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> in how Japan is a lot of stuff </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that I just like don't gel with. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think I can definitely
see myself 'cause I've- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - But a long time though.
- Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because I've lived there for eight months. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's felt like I've
lived here for a month. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I haven't even reached
close to my final form. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (guys laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is that an anime reference? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I know we've hardly talked
about anime on this podcast, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but yeah, I mean, I feel like
I want to explore Japan more. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I want to learn the language
way more proficiently </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> than I have now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I want to take advantage of it way more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I want to experience
Japanese cultures more. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah, same. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because the one target
I've set myself I should say </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> is being able to have a conversation </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with some of the businesses </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and go into some of the office parties </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and actually being able to participate </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in the conversation and
everything like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's my goal when it
comes to learning, you know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. Same. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I just wanna be able to communicate </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and learn a bit of Kanji, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Learn the basics just
so I can like figure out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> what the McDonald's menu
says, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like yeah, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I can definitely see it being
like a second home to me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like a place where maybe
I can easily go back </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to it months periods. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But I think like when
I'm like 50 or whatever, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think I'm gonna miss the how, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I think I've been really ingrained </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> in British culture of like
how friendly and open it is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I really like that, especially in Wales, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> you just rock up to a pub and
you can speak to anyone there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in the small pubs in Wales. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I love that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I kind of miss that a bit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I think, yeah, I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean I'm eight months in,
maybe in a podcast in a year </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we'll talk about it and our
minds will have changed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll be like I want to
live here forever, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think 'cause right now I
feel like a foreigner still. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And I think that's
probably never gonna change </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but maybe at some point I'll finally feel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like I can call this place home. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It might smoothen out a little bit more. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Probably, I imagine it will. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Unless I get arrested
and convicted of a crime </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I was accused of and
I'm in prison for 100 years, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but what are the odds of that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Before we end the podcast, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there was one story I wanted to end on, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is like it completely
shattered what my preconceptions </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of moving to Japan would be. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And that was one of the company
parties that we attended </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with a look BookWalker and GeeXPlus </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and Kadokawa in general </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it was to do with my fiance, Sydney. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So what happened was we
went to a company party, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everyone got pretty merry. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And then we went a bar afterwards, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, I think I know
what you're gonna say. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
(guys laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And so it was like a very intimate bar. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> So it didn't fit a lot of people. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Room for like 10 people maybe. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, a good 10 people. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And there were a lot of
people from the company, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> some pretty high up from the company </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and then we started
singing karaoke together. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And so Sydney being the drunken
little weeaboo that she is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - She's such a weeaboo. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Unlike us, unlike us </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> she went through her weeb phase, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> She went proper full cringey
weeb phase, unlike us. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Sydney, I love you if you watch this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Isn't she like kind of the face </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> of the cringey weeb person on a video? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - According to the internet, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Sydney is gonna fucking
kill me for saying that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - She had that phase where she went there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So we started singing karaoke </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and she starts singing
the Anohana end, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And me and Garnt were
like fuck, why, why? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What the fuck are you doing? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You're in front of a lot of
important people in the company. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And she starts bailing
the fucking Anohana ending </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then the fucking
businessmen start clapping </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and cheering her on and
started singing along. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm just sitting there like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - We were both shocked, I remember. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I couldn't believe what I was seeing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I looked at Connor and I'm like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> "Is this r/really happened right now? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Are we living a 2007 Tumblr post?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Like oh yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So like I moved to Japan and yeah, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was in a important business
meeting, a business party. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And then we started singing
the Anohana opening, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ending even. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then everyone started clapping </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and cheering and it was amazing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like this is so surreal right now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's literally an r/that
happened post, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like this definitely happened. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my god. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But it's great </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I feel like when you
do sing stuff like that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they never like, "Oh my God </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they're trying to be like us." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They're like "Oh my God,
they care about our culture. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> That's so cool."
- Yeah, they really do. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And I guess that's what I want to end on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which is like I think it's, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> we started on the good sides
and the bad sides of Japan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I think they really
do care about our culture. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They really care about learning more </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and they are open to foreigners. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There's just sometimes a lot of barriers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that come between that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I guess one of the
biggest things you can do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is learn Japanese because that's such a- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They love it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> They love it if you speak Japanese. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - To them, it's like,
you've made an effort </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to learn their culture. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, I mean, and likewise, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> If somebody comes over to your country </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they can understand your language </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like that immediately, like, oh yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah, dude, if you
could speak Welsh in Wales, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like you're immediately like loved, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause people in Welsh can't even Wales. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Welsh people can't even
speak Welsh, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I can imagine it's like
one of those, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I think like you said, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> All differences aside and
all complaints that we have, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like at the end of the day, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't think I've ever
spoken to a person here </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who's been rude to me and
everyone has super nice </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and you might get stared at or anything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but that's not a place of
aggression or anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They just don't see it often. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And at the end of the day, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're really, really nice people. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, the positives definitely
outweigh the negatives. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh 100%. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, I'm just British, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So to me, it's like 1%
negative, 99% positive. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I only see this, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's what your raised as British. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But overall, it's an amazing country </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm glad that we had
the chance to move here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm having a great fucking time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, yeah.
- I'm glad you guys </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are having a fun time.
- With the boys. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - With the boys!
- With the boys! </SPEAKER_00>
