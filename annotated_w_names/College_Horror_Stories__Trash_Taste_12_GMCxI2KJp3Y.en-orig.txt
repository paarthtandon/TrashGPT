<joey> ready to get this bread gamers </joey>
<connor> welcome to this episode of trash taste i </connor>
<joey> am monkeybrain </joey>
<connor> and here today i have two galaxy brains </connor>
<connor> you are correct on that </connor>
<garnt> anything is to go by </garnt>
<garnt> except when it comes to chess when this </garnt>
<garnt> comes out </garnt>
<garnt> the only thing i'm competing at </garnt>
<garnt> apparently that's it everything else i'm </garnt>
<joey> just </joey>
<joey> robin sticks together this goldfish </joey>
<joey> brain yeah man i just can't </joey>
<joey> i can't fathom anything else in my life </joey>
<connor> so what can i do i'm useless man </connor>
<connor> shout out to everyone who defended me </connor>
<connor> for my monkey brain um today </connor>
<connor> i want to talk about fellas i had a </connor>
<connor> thought last night i was like wow </connor>
<connor> i've got my life together </connor>
<joey> we all know we all know that's a lie no </joey>
<connor> one just thinks that </connor>
<connor> okay okay i've got my life more together </connor>
<connor> okay yeah </connor>
<connor> that's better and i was wondering i'm </connor>
<connor> like well i i've had like a </connor>
<connor> drastic life change from moving to japan </connor>
<connor> and that's not because of anything to do </connor>
<connor> with </connor>
<connor> right that's probably because of i think </connor>
<joey> the fact that someone's </joey>
<joey> holding me accountable yeah before if i </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] up a sponsor </connor>
<joey> it was on me yeah yeah right now there's </joey>
<connor> someone else involved </connor>
<connor> i was wondering because i'll explain </connor>
<connor> mine but did you you know when you guys </connor>
<garnt> moved to japan </garnt>
<garnt> and you know maybe when you joined the </garnt>
<garnt> agency did your life change that much </garnt>
<connor> did you like have a lifestyle change or </connor>
<garnt> just same [ __ ] i think the biggest </garnt>
<connor> change for me has been actually this </connor>
<connor> podcast </connor>
<connor> yeah well we have a specific day we come </connor>
<connor> in and film </connor>
<connor> and having something on my schedule has </connor>
<connor> just completely changed my entire weekly </connor>
<connor> schedule just because i have </connor>
<connor> i have one day that's always booked off </connor>
<garnt> and have to like plan around that </garnt>
<garnt> instead of being like i'm gonna wake up </garnt>
<garnt> and i'm gonna feel like maybe i'll feel </garnt>
<garnt> like working on something today maybe </garnt>
<garnt> i'll just </garnt>
<garnt> feel like playing um ghost with sushi </garnt>
<joey> tsushima i don't [ __ ] there's nothing </joey>
<connor> worse i feel than </connor>
<connor> like it being a monday morning right </connor>
<connor> it's a it's a fresh start to a new week </connor>
<connor> and you're like all right </connor>
<joey> let's see what i have to do this week </joey>
<joey> and you look on your calendar it's just </joey>
<joey> nothing this way </joey>
<joey> i'm just like what do i what do i do how </joey>
<joey> do i how do i do things now </joey>
<garnt> especially especially after quarantine </garnt>
<garnt> you just wake up and you you don't even </garnt>
<joey> know what day of the week it is </joey>
<joey> and weekends don't feel like weekends or </joey>
<garnt> days or just </garnt>
<joey> other days i don't know yeah most people </joey>
<joey> wake up being like oh yes it's a friday </joey>
<joey> it's the end of the week i just wake up </joey>
<connor> it's like it is morning </connor>
<connor> but youtubers every day is the same day </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah </garnt>
<connor> when when when we everyone started </connor>
<connor> working from home and everyone was like </connor>
<connor> oh yes this is </connor>
<connor> such a refreshing change to my lifestyle </connor>
<connor> we're just like yeah </connor>
<garnt> yeah welcome to your youtube live it's </garnt>
<garnt> fun when everyone's doing it and </garnt>
<joey> everyone's in the same boat right then </joey>
<joey> when </joey>
<joey> you know everyone's doing their normal </joey>
<joey> life and working it's like it's hell </joey>
<joey> i mean that's how i felt though like </joey>
<joey> when we as as you said like we </joey>
<connor> started to be like all right every week </connor>
<connor> this day this time we're going to come </connor>
<connor> to the studio </connor>
<garnt> right now and i'm just like oh this is </garnt>
<connor> how normal people </connor>
<connor> feel it's quite liberating i drink </connor>
<garnt> coffee with other people </garnt>
<garnt> i know it's great because you know when </garnt>
<garnt> i worked at the bbc </garnt>
<garnt> i worked for there for like two years um </garnt>
<garnt> like close </garnt>
<joey> close to three years and i did not enjoy </joey>
<joey> it after a while but </joey>
<joey> after moving to youtube and being </joey>
<joey> freelance and just going by my own </joey>
<joey> schedule </joey>
<joey> i kind of missed the office environment </joey>
<joey> because yeah about like a year after </joey>
<joey> doing youtube i kind of realized </joey>
<garnt> man if i don't like actively go out and </garnt>
<garnt> seek social interaction it just </garnt>
<connor> doesn't it doesn't happen that's me like </connor>
<joey> three or four years to realize that </joey>
<joey> so why do i have no friends </joey>
<connor> unless they like drag me out yeah it's </connor>
<joey> weird i i kind of </joey>
<joey> yeah i kind of got that same thing </joey>
<connor> because i never had uh like a business </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> like a corporate uh experience right </connor>
<connor> like working in an office or whatever </connor>
<connor> so it's like extra exciting for me </connor>
<connor> because i'm just </connor>
<connor> because it is liberating because i've </connor>
<connor> always been even during school i've </connor>
<connor> always been one of those kids where it's </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> i couldn't study on my own like i had to </connor>
<joey> one of those yeah like i couldn't go </joey>
<connor> home and just sit in my room by myself </connor>
<garnt> what do you mean one of those </garnt>
<connor> like when they'd always be like y'all </connor>
<connor> want to study together i'm like no </connor>
<joey> oh no i was always like yes no i'm </joey>
<connor> exactly the same because i can't because </connor>
<joey> i know </joey>
<connor> that if i go home and i'm in my own room </connor>
<connor> then i'm not going to want to study </connor>
<connor> because no one's judging me for just </connor>
<connor> being like well i couldn't just like </connor>
<joey> play some games yeah but when i'm around </joey>
<connor> my friends i want to </connor>
<connor> talk to my friends no same here we never </connor>
<connor> when we </connor>
<garnt> when there was always a group study </garnt>
<garnt> session we'd have in university i </garnt>
<garnt> remember we'd always have like the first </garnt>
<connor> hour was </connor>
<connor> like nice and productive we'd start </connor>
<connor> going over problems and then it would </connor>
<connor> just </connor>
<connor> people would get bored and then we just </connor>
<connor> wanna watch this youtube video </connor>
<connor> yeah exactly that's always what would </connor>
<joey> happen </joey>
<joey> no i was a model asian son so i i </joey>
<connor> genuinely just like </connor>
<connor> hey do you want to go to the library and </connor>
<connor> do some study sessions </connor>
<connor> and then we put our headphones in and we </connor>
<joey> just study because if there's people </joey>
<connor> around that's a [ __ ] lie no no way </connor>
<connor> there's no way that </connor>
<connor> we and we all met up and we all studied </connor>
<joey> yeah it's like </joey>
<joey> what is why do you think i'm so galaxy </joey>
<garnt> right i'll tell you the real mvp </garnt>
<garnt> which wasn't my lecturer but my actual </garnt>
<garnt> real lecturer was </garnt>
<garnt> shout out to those indian youtube </garnt>
<garnt> lectures that were always uploaded khan </garnt>
<connor> academy </connor>
<connor> yeah what's that it's like if you did </connor>
<joey> maths or anything engineering yeah </joey>
<joey> there was always like this channel i </joey>
<joey> don't remember it might have been khan </joey>
<joey> academy or something like that where </joey>
<connor> they were just </connor>
<connor> upload the lectures that are shorter and </connor>
<joey> way more informative yeah </joey>
<joey> oh like kind of like cliff notes yeah </joey>
<connor> but like </connor>
<connor> somehow they explained it better in 10 </connor>
<connor> minutes than the 2-hour lecture you went </connor>
<garnt> to yeah </garnt>
<garnt> you go to your lecture you sit there for </garnt>
<garnt> an hour you wouldn't take any of this in </garnt>
<garnt> and then when you're revising you you </garnt>
<connor> search up hey um x topic like </connor>
<connor> how do i use how do i do second order </connor>
<joey> integrate uh into </joey>
<connor> integra i can't even just integers </connor>
<joey> um uh and you there'd just be always </joey>
<garnt> this is it was always an indian guy </garnt>
<garnt> doing the lectures i don't know why </garnt>
<connor> they're just no maths man </connor>
<garnt> they get it they get it man yeah i never </garnt>
<joey> had anything like that i just i just </joey>
<joey> went </joey>
<connor> if you did any traditional route if you </connor>
<connor> did anything maths or engineering at </connor>
<joey> some point an indian man on the internet </joey>
<joey> would save you </joey>
<joey> like that's just how it is like that's </joey>
<joey> just because they i don't know why is </joey>
<joey> that maybe like only a uk thing </joey>
<connor> no no no because like it was like </connor>
<connor> americans too i think would use these </connor>
<connor> i think it's an engineering thing must </connor>
<connor> be an engineer yeah i never did </connor>
<joey> engineering </joey>
<joey> all the sciences yeah maybe yeah i never </joey>
<connor> had anything like that i mean i had like </connor>
<connor> indian lecturers like at school who were </connor>
<connor> like teaching me stuff and they were </connor>
<connor> usually like the best lecturers </connor>
<connor> but yeah there's so many in engineering </connor>
<connor> yeah i didn't have like any </connor>
<connor> youtube i wish i had like a youtube </connor>
<connor> channel that i could just [ __ ] go on </connor>
<connor> so i'm being like yes </connor>
<connor> solve all of my problems for me please </connor>
<connor> thank you so i don't have to go to </connor>
<connor> classes </connor>
<connor> i felt so p when i went to university </connor>
<connor> and it was in english and i was like </connor>
<connor> wait the internet's useful to the work </connor>
<connor> because like welsh internet like isn't </connor>
<connor> really a thing so anytime i'd want to </connor>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> cheat i just couldn't because i couldn't </joey>
<joey> google any of this [ __ ] right </joey>
<joey> so i didn't know what i was looking up </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah but yeah no man oh my god </joey>
<garnt> my lifestyle university was so unhealthy </garnt>
<joey> you guys really unhealthy oh definitely </joey>
<connor> is there any uni student who lives a </connor>
<connor> healthy life there was there was one guy </connor>
<connor> in my </connor>
<connor> my like uh year and he was like the the </connor>
<connor> peak form of </connor>
<connor> everything he like wouldn't drink he </connor>
<connor> went gym like every single day </connor>
<connor> and he always was the best but like had </connor>
<garnt> what clubs was he part of because i </garnt>
<garnt> remember people who were like part of </garnt>
<garnt> the rowing club or </garnt>
<garnt> some kind of sports club would have </garnt>
<garnt> always the peak optimal lifestyle </garnt>
<garnt> and then there was like everyone else </garnt>
<garnt> who just like </garnt>
<joey> yeah but that would usually be the one </joey>
<joey> where they would be walking down </joey>
<joey> you know the campus and people would </joey>
<joey> know that they're part of their club and </joey>
<joey> i would just be like look at this wanker </joey>
<connor> because they they wear like they're like </connor>
<joey> i'm in this club yeah yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> look at this wanker wearing a polo shirt </joey>
<joey> he can afford a polo shirt </joey>
<connor> get out of here [ __ ] off i i feel like </connor>
<garnt> because i went straight into youtube </garnt>
<garnt> from uni </garnt>
<garnt> yeah like you got the uni lifestyle i </garnt>
<garnt> kind of just </garnt>
<garnt> didn't change anything except for like </garnt>
<garnt> like i even like </garnt>
<connor> i even like had an approach to youtube </connor>
<connor> making in uni like i was like </connor>
<connor> procrastinating my videos the way i was </connor>
<connor> doing with my lectures </connor>
<connor> right right where i would like not do </connor>
<connor> anything and then one day i would just </connor>
<connor> do </connor>
<connor> everything and then i'd be like wow what </connor>
<joey> a healthy what the hell </joey>
<joey> i was the opposite because i started </joey>
<joey> youtube when i started uni yeah </joey>
<joey> right so i kind of live like a double </joey>
<joey> life but usually </joey>
<joey> it's supposed to be the opposite where </joey>
<connor> it's like you should focus on </connor>
<connor> your studies right and like keep you </connor>
<connor> know maintained </connor>
<joey> and you know just because it's a hobby </joey>
<joey> right you can just procrastinate and </joey>
<joey> just do whatever now for me was the </joey>
<joey> complete opposite i was like all right </joey>
<joey> upload videos every day at this time get </joey>
<joey> it edited </joey>
<joey> get it done oh [ __ ] i have an assignment </joey>
<connor> in two days i think </connor>
<connor> everyone who is who's like seeing good </connor>
<joey> growth </joey>
<connor> does that though because i knew that i </connor>
<joey> should have put engineering first but i </joey>
<connor> didn't </connor>
<garnt> no i put the youtube first yeah i don't </garnt>
<garnt> know how you managed to do daily uploads </garnt>
<garnt> while also going to university and still </garnt>
<joey> passed </joey>
<joey> it's some of the easiest content that </joey>
<joey> i've ever made and like also </joey>
<joey> like compared to videos now i wouldn't </joey>
<connor> call my old videos </connor>
<connor> good editing because there was barely </connor>
<connor> any editing it was like </connor>
<connor> lots of cuts lots of zoom ins it's like </connor>
<connor> the easiest [ __ ] editing </connor>
<connor> put some background music in boom you </connor>
<connor> got a video right but yeah my computer </connor>
<connor> because </connor>
<connor> i really struggle with that because </connor>
<connor> obviously the upload speed in australia </connor>
<connor> is </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] horrendous like do you want to </connor>
<connor> connect yeah the internet like </connor>
<joey> the download was fine we had like 20 </joey>
<joey> down right we're just like </joey>
<joey> not bad not bad right but you know what </joey>
<garnt> our upload speed was like 0.1 </garnt>
<connor> pretty close like 0.3 oh my god oh god </connor>
<garnt> so </garnt>
<joey> uploading a like 500 meg video file </joey>
<connor> yeah which is like nothing right yeah </connor>
<joey> would take me like </joey>
<joey> eight hours jesus so what i would have </joey>
<joey> to do </joey>
<joey> is i would go to my classes i'd come </joey>
<connor> back </connor>
<connor> i would work on a video i'd edit it </connor>
<connor> until the night and then i would </connor>
<connor> upload it and then go to sleep and by </connor>
<connor> the time i got up in the morning usually </connor>
<connor> it was like </connor>
<connor> almost finished or it was done and it </connor>
<connor> would just be public by that point and i </connor>
<connor> would do that </connor>
<connor> every day for three years and </connor>
<connor> unsurprisingly </connor>
<connor> it was like i think it was like a month </connor>
<joey> before i decided to move to japan right </joey>
<connor> my computer just exploded like </connor>
<connor> physically like i was sitting there i </connor>
<connor> was editing i remember i was editing a </connor>
<joey> nekopara episode right that i was doing </joey>
<connor> and then one day just went boom it's </connor>
<connor> nekopara </connor>
<joey> that's nekopara like it's just it just </joey>
<joey> explodes like the cpu just exploded </joey>
<connor> and there's smoke coming up and </connor>
<connor> everything i'm like oh my this house is </connor>
<garnt> going to go down like </garnt>
<garnt> this house is gonna catch on get out mom </garnt>
<garnt> this fire starts yeah this is this is </garnt>
<garnt> how like house fire starts </garnt>
<joey> and yeah so we got rid of it and i open </joey>
<joey> up i remember i opened up the computer </joey>
<joey> and my cpu was just </joey>
<garnt> gone it was disintegrated it must have </garnt>
<garnt> been constantly on you must have never </garnt>
<joey> constantly on it was constantly on and </joey>
<joey> yeah and the computer was just like nah </joey>
<joey> can't do it anymore man wait did did you </joey>
<connor> live at home when you're at university </connor>
<joey> yeah oh [ __ ] that's been such a </joey>
<joey> different experience yeah yeah because i </joey>
<joey> i never got the experience of like </joey>
<joey> living in like a dorm right because i </joey>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> having roommates i moved out at 18. and </connor>
<connor> i just turned 18 </connor>
<connor> and i've pretty much lived alone or like </connor>
<joey> not with my parents since then </joey>
<joey> yeah i moved out after uni sounds like a </joey>
<joey> fun idea until it's really not after </joey>
<joey> about two months of living with other </joey>
<connor> people </connor>
<connor> yeah you realize man i really hate </connor>
<garnt> people they're like well </garnt>
<connor> you don't get a say in who you're put </connor>
<garnt> within at least british university </garnt>
<connor> and uh yeah sometimes you get put with </connor>
<connor> people you're like i hate this </connor>
<connor> i was put with like the rugby team </connor>
<joey> basically right and they were like </joey>
<connor> destroying everything constantly and </connor>
<joey> yeah i remember one time </joey>
<connor> i had like a pan specifically for </connor>
<connor> putting oven pizzas on right right </connor>
<connor> and he was like can i borrow it and i </connor>
<joey> was like well you know he's like </joey>
<connor> seven foot ten built like a brick [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> house i was like </joey>
<joey> sure it was like a it was like a one </joey>
<connor> pound tray from little right </connor>
<connor> i was like yeah sure anyway i go in the </connor>
<connor> kitchen at night to go and get like a </connor>
<connor> beverage </connor>
<connor> and i see my pizza tray and there's just </connor>
<connor> a carcass of a whole chicken </connor>
<connor> a whole chicken was cooked on my pizza </connor>
<connor> tray and he just left it </connor>
<connor> and i was like there's no way i can get </connor>
<connor> this [ __ ] off it's like charred on </connor>
<connor> yeah it's not even worth saving the tray </connor>
<connor> i'm like you didn't borrow it you just </connor>
<connor> liberated it you just took it from me </connor>
<connor> and destroyed it </connor>
<connor> i just couldn't believe it i was like my </connor>
<connor> mom's going to be furious </connor>
<connor> at that one pound friendship furious </connor>
<joey> how do i explain this to mother i just </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> i don't know i i hear stories of your </joey>
<garnt> people living in like dogs </garnt>
<connor> there was always one person who was like </connor>
<connor> the most disgusting person </connor>
<connor> like you you would you would be made to </connor>
<joey> believe by by your mum that you're a </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] slob when you go to university </joey>
<joey> oh yeah and like </joey>
<joey> you need to wash your dishes you need to </joey>
<connor> do this but then you'd meet that one guy </connor>
<connor> and you don't know how he like </connor>
<connor> functioned his entire life he would just </connor>
<connor> we had this one guy in our dorm who </connor>
<connor> would </connor>
<connor> just take everything take all the </connor>
<connor> utilities and you know any like spare </connor>
<connor> plate knives and forks and he just like </connor>
<connor> would leave it in his room and just </connor>
<connor> wouldn't wash it so </connor>
<connor> we would often get times where we were </connor>
<connor> just looking for like i would be looking </connor>
<connor> for my plates and lives and forks </connor>
<connor> and i like had to ask him and one time i </connor>
<connor> remember looking for </connor>
<connor> i think i think it was like a wine glass </connor>
<connor> or something yeah </connor>
<connor> and he found it in his underwear drawer </connor>
<connor> and i was just like you know what just </connor>
<connor> just keep going </connor>
<connor> i don't want it anymore god how how did </connor>
<garnt> you how did you even </garnt>
<garnt> how does that even end up in that </garnt>
<garnt> underwear drawer that's so disgusting </garnt>
<connor> yeah what the [ __ ] dude </connor>
<connor> i have so many horrible stories from </connor>
<connor> that like that period </connor>
<connor> and some of the [ __ ] they used to do to </connor>
<connor> each other like it wasn't even hazing </connor>
<connor> right it was just them being dicks like </connor>
<connor> like i remember </connor>
<joey> they didn't like this one guy in my dorm </joey>
<joey> because he was kind of pompous </joey>
<joey> he was like from south uh england and he </joey>
<joey> had a very posh accent and he was </joey>
<connor> very very like oh you're you're too poor </connor>
<connor> to talk to me yeah immediately sounds </connor>
<connor> like a wanker yeah </connor>
<connor> he was he was like an [ __ ] right like </connor>
<connor> and he would like </connor>
<connor> unironically call people peasants like i </connor>
<connor> call people </connor>
<connor> like is that how is that where you got </connor>
<connor> it from that's where i got it from </connor>
<connor> because i thought </connor>
<connor> i thought it was so funny that he called </connor>
<connor> people peasants and he used to think </connor>
<joey> that like i was laughing </joey>
<joey> at the people he was laughing at right </joey>
<connor> but i actually find it so funny that </connor>
<connor> we're in the year 2000 and he's using </connor>
<connor> the word peasant as an insult </connor>
<connor> so he would call these rugby players to </connor>
<connor> their face like </connor>
<connor> peasants and he's not like big but they </connor>
<connor> knew they shouldn't punch him right yeah </connor>
<connor> so what they would do multiple times </connor>
<connor> was like piss on all of his stuff in the </connor>
<connor> middle of the night </connor>
<connor> and like leave it outside yeah so they </connor>
<joey> pissed in all of his like </joey>
<joey> uh kitchen stuff yeah and so he went to </joey>
<joey> go and cook </joey>
<joey> the next day right and he was like where </joey>

<connor> me yeah i mean they would still use my </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] all the time it was really nice </connor>
<garnt> were you in like the really cheap dorms </garnt>
<connor> oh i was in the ones that cost </connor>
<garnt> 70 bucks a month okay </garnt>
<connor> i had like what would have been like a </connor>
<connor> psychiatric prisoner room </connor>
<connor> like it's like the bear but bear but </connor>
<connor> they gave us a mattress and i wish they </connor>
<connor> didn't </connor>
<connor> because i immediately when i got there i </connor>
<connor> pick up my mattress and it's </connor>
<connor> bright yellow the bottom of it and i'm </connor>
<connor> like oh god </connor>
<connor> and i remember i remember getting </connor>
<connor> homesick the first day i'm like mom i </connor>
<joey> can't do this this is disgusting </joey>
<connor> it was literally like a tiny room with a </connor>
<connor> shit-stained bed </connor>
<garnt> that they'd obviously never changed no </garnt>
<garnt> it was obviously like university dorms </garnt>
<garnt> are basically just remodeled prison </garnt>
<joey> cells </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah like i think i'd rather go to </joey>
<garnt> jail connections </garnt>
<joey> i think i'd rather go to jail at that </joey>
<joey> point because the bed that they they </joey>
<joey> gave us i remember thinking oh it's </joey>
<connor> probably going to be a single bed i </connor>
<connor> didn't know there was a size smaller </connor>
<connor> than a single guy </connor>
<connor> wait there is how do you hear that i saw </connor>
<joey> it because it was way smaller than the </joey>
<joey> single one you </joey>
<joey> you you'd like to sleep like this like </joey>
<joey> you </joey>
<joey> anything else and like my feet because </joey>
<garnt> i'm like a fairly tall guy i'm not even </garnt>
<garnt> that tall </garnt>
<garnt> i'm six foot my feet was would always be </garnt>
<garnt> off the bed </garnt>
<joey> that's how small my bed was just like </joey>
<garnt> three pillows stitched together </garnt>
<garnt> so there's your mattress jesus christ </garnt>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i'm glad i never experienced that i i </garnt>
<garnt> would just i would just bite the bullet </garnt>
<joey> and just take the two-hour travel </joey>
<joey> between yeah </joey>
<joey> my uni and my house and i'd just be like </joey>
<connor> i'm in the comfort of my own i learned </connor>
<connor> some important life lessons university </connor>
<connor> though </connor>
<connor> right i learned like you gotta sometimes </connor>
<connor> you just gotta say </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] everyone else and put yourself </joey>
<joey> first sometimes </joey>
<joey> i mean i i i learned that afterwards </joey>
<joey> people will just [ __ ] take advantage </joey>
<garnt> of you </garnt>
<garnt> oh yeah definitely yeah </garnt>
<joey> like because there was only like one bus </joey>
<joey> that made it to </joey>
<connor> the campus on time like it was like half </connor>
<connor> an hour bus </connor>
<connor> it's only one bus and uh this line would </connor>
<connor> be </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] huge to get on this bus so if </joey>
<joey> you were late it was just whatever yeah </joey>
<joey> and i got to the point where i was just </joey>
<joey> like i'm going to be so late for my </joey>
<joey> lecture if i wait in this line i would </joey>
<joey> literally just like when people were </joey>
<joey> getting on the bus i would just walk to </joey>
<joey> the front of the line just </joey>
<joey> kidding i would literally just like act </joey>
<joey> as if i was on the bus i would just walk </joey>
<joey> up </joey>
<connor> awesome and then everyone would look at </connor>
<connor> me like the [ __ ] we can you can do that </connor>
<garnt> i was like [ __ ] it i don't care that's </garnt>
<garnt> like that's like sacrilegious </garnt>
<connor> in in england british yeah that is that </connor>
<connor> is like a cardinal and i would never do </connor>
<connor> that but i thought because they're all a </connor>
<connor> bunch of university students i'm like </connor>

<connor> like other than like one being you know </connor>
<connor> one of my friends being like a drug </connor>
<connor> dealer like i'm like not really like </connor>
<joey> wow yeah i mean i don't really have to </joey>
<joey> go into detail on that obviously but </joey>
<joey> you just see so much [ __ ] in you know </joey>
<joey> like you know your story about like you </joey>
<joey> know throwing the poop at the bungalow </joey>
<joey> like i don't have anything that crazy </joey>
<joey> no that was that was really common for </joey>
<joey> us like </joey>
<joey> that was really common did you say yeah </joey>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> what [ __ ] universities did you go </connor>
<connor> just walking around campus and i'm just </connor>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> i didn't know i could ever see [ __ ] in a </garnt>
<garnt> location like this </garnt>
<joey> yeah yeah you see vomit and [ __ ] where </joey>
<joey> they're like </joey>
<joey> understand the vomit right because like </joey>
<joey> we had like a whole bunch of like pubs </joey>
<joey> and restaurants like within the campus </joey>
<joey> right so obviously </joey>
<joey> you get a little bit crazy as you do as </joey>
<joey> a uni student and you you know throw up </joey>
<joey> a little bit but i'm just like </joey>
<joey> why is there like poop on this sidewalk </joey>
<joey> it's like we're not actually i i'm now </joey>
<joey> that you guys are mentioning it </joey>
<joey> i'm remembering so much poop that i've </joey>
<joey> just like </joey>
<joey> blocked out my memory like i'm like this </joey>
<garnt> is bigger than an </garnt>
<garnt> apple it's not an animal it's clearly </garnt>
<garnt> not an animal like this is a human poop </garnt>
<garnt> i know what human works they are an </garnt>
<garnt> animal </garnt>
<garnt> but it's like it's like it's not even </garnt>
<connor> like it's not even like a kangaroo or </connor>
<connor> like a big animal like this </connor>
<garnt> this clearly came out of a human i think </garnt>
<garnt> i think it must have been pretty bad at </garnt>
<garnt> my university because they had like a </garnt>
<garnt> row of porta-potties that would just pop </garnt>
<joey> up on friday through sunday yeah where </joey>
<joey> where all the clubs were so clearly </joey>
<connor> people must have been </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] enough and pissing that they </connor>
<connor> were like we gotta sort this out </connor>
<joey> pooping everywhere but there's this i </joey>
<joey> just keep remembering there's so much </joey>
<joey> poop where there shouldn't be like </joey>
<joey> i remember one day are like most amazing </joey>
<joey> podcasters </joey>
<joey> there's one time when uh came home came </joey>
<connor> home from one light out and there was i </connor>
<connor> was in the common room and it just </connor>
<garnt> smelled like some someone had died there </garnt>
<garnt> it smelled like an animal or died maybe </garnt>
<joey> it was a dog or something </joey>
<connor> start looking around like searching for </connor>
<connor> where where this smell is coming from </connor>
<connor> i'm like playing the game of where's </connor>
<connor> wally </connor>
<connor> just just with this smell right i'm like </connor>
<connor> searching everything </connor>
<connor> it was around christmas time and and so </connor>
<connor> i searched behind there was there was i </connor>
<connor> searched behind the christmas tree </connor>
<connor> because it was </connor>
<connor> like coming from the christmas tree so i </connor>
<garnt> i look behind </garnt>
<garnt> and there's just this turd like sitting </garnt>
<connor> where there should be presents and </connor>
<connor> my first thought is surely this can't be </connor>
<joey> a turd </joey>
<garnt> right and like you said it's not it's </garnt>
<garnt> not like a dog turd it's like a full-on </garnt>
<connor> it's like it's clearly a human being </connor>
<connor> right like yeah yeah it's </connor>
<connor> it's not like rabbit poop or something </connor>
<joey> it's like a big full-on turd my first </joey>
<joey> thought is </joey>
<joey> surely there's no way this is a turd </joey>
<joey> this is in your house </joey>
<joey> huh in your house uh yeah in my dorms </joey>
<joey> what in my dorms </joey>
<joey> so it was it wasn't a house we lived in </joey>
<connor> like a shared shared dormitory of like </connor>
<joey> 200 people so we have like a common area </joey>
<joey> so so i get this [ __ ] stick right i </joey>
<joey> start </joey>
<joey> poking it just think maybe it's </joey>
<joey> something else other than the turn maybe </joey>
<joey> it's like a </joey>
<joey> maybe it's like a toy chocolate </joey>
<connor> and and the stick just sinks in i'm like </connor>
<connor> oh oh this is a [ __ ] turd oh </connor>
<connor> i am smelling [ __ ] right now how did </connor>
<connor> this get here </connor>
<connor> because it was in the common room </connor>
<connor> because it was pretty late but people </connor>
<joey> come here people come in the common room </joey>
<connor> pretty often </connor>
<connor> and i i was just like i was just </connor>
<connor> thinking there must be a story behind </connor>
<joey> this how how did this turd appear here </joey>
<joey> i never found out oh my god that's such </joey>
<joey> a wish all i remember was coming coming </joey>
<joey> in the next day in the morning and it </joey>
<joey> was just </joey>
<joey> magically gone and i was like i feel </joey>
<garnt> sorry for the person who had to </garnt>
<garnt> clean that turd up man see i just hear </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] like that i'm just like </garnt>
<garnt> yeah but don't you me like you get some </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] stories that you're like </connor>
<connor> you're never gonna forget oh yeah of </connor>
<connor> course but like i like hearing it from </connor>
<joey> other people i don't want to like go </joey>
<connor> through the [ __ ] trauma of like </connor>
<joey> experiencing a lovely christmas morning </joey>
<connor> with a turd right like </connor>
<joey> i don't need that in my life it doesn't </joey>
<connor> affect him he's like i'm going to match </connor>
<connor> my room </connor>
<connor> yeah i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm out that's </connor>
<connor> someone's story </connor>
<connor> this is right okay this is why people on </connor>
<connor> the comments are like why does khan have </connor>
<connor> so many stories because i just say yes </connor>
<joey> to the dumbest [ __ ] thinking like okay </joey>
<joey> if this goes horribly wrong at least i </joey>
<joey> get a banger of a story out of it right </joey>
<joey> probably so i'm just like yes i'll do </joey>
<joey> that thing that's probably very </joey>
<connor> questionable yeah </connor>
<joey> like sure let's go there let's do this </joey>
<connor> thing because i'm like </connor>
<connor> i'm gonna get a banger of a story out of </connor>

<garnt> of stuff sometimes i go through my life </garnt>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i get like flashbacks when sometimes </garnt>
<garnt> we're talking yeah [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> like speaking of poop i remember i </garnt>
<garnt> remember that story no because like </garnt>
<garnt> going back to lifestyle in university i </garnt>

<garnt> i shouldn't a human body shouldn't be </garnt>
<connor> able to do that many all-nighters </connor>

<connor> just consisted of mostly red bull </connor>
<connor> how many how many red bulls would you </connor>

<joey> yeah that sounds about right but like on </joey>
<joey> on like some all nighters when i had an </joey>
<joey> assignment that was never ever done </joey>

<connor> like super chubby during </connor>
<connor> university i know ghana's like connor </connor>
<garnt> you never look chubby but dude </garnt>
<garnt> connor connor swears to me that he was </garnt>
<garnt> chubby when i first met him and i just </garnt>
<joey> have completely blanked out this memory </joey>
<joey> of mood and put this image on screen </joey>
<garnt> this was like </garnt>
<joey> two years ago though i look back at old </joey>
<joey> photos right how about you </joey>
<connor> and i'm like man this boy's face is </connor>
<connor> around right </connor>
<connor> i never thought i was chubby right no </connor>
<joey> but i didn't think yeah </joey>
<joey> at the time yeah i think because it was </joey>
<joey> just the way i'm built like i don't look </joey>
<joey> that choppy </joey>
<joey> but i remember like a year ago like i </joey>
<connor> saw </connor>
<connor> like an image like someone's taking a </connor>
<connor> photo of me and it was like from the </connor>
<connor> side right yeah i just saw like my </connor>
<connor> stomach </connor>
<connor> like hanging over a little bit and i'm </connor>
<joey> like what the [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> when did that happen yeah and you're </joey>
<joey> like what and then then you start </joey>
<joey> realizing oh [ __ ] i'm chubby like i'm </joey>
<joey> actually chubby </joey>
<joey> it's so weird because i had such [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> diet and just like lifestyle choices </joey>
<garnt> in uni but i was so [ __ ] like you you </garnt>
<garnt> guys like when you first met me i was </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] emaciated </garnt>
<joey> you were so scared everybody everybody </joey>
<joey> always says that i was so [ __ ] you </joey>
<connor> are so </connor>
<connor> skinny to put in comparison right like </connor>
<joey> all throughout high school </joey>

<connor> 75 now oh [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> yeah i get </connor>
<connor> and i was just going ham and i didn't </connor>
<joey> realize that oh </joey>
<connor> metabolism is a thing yeah yeah i i </connor>
<garnt> realized that during university </garnt>
<joey> obviously </joey>
<joey> i'd been going taking advantage of my </joey>
<connor> body weight </connor>
<connor> oh yeah yeah then pretty much last year </connor>
<connor> i just went ham on myself and like just </connor>
<joey> cut out everything kind of energy drinks </joey>
<connor> went gym like five days a week and </connor>
<joey> lost like 10 kilograms yeah because i </joey>
<joey> remember back then i </joey>
<joey> didn't know if i had a bigger tolerance </joey>
<connor> in alcohol or caffeine </connor>
<connor> but it always it was like i was drinking </connor>
<garnt> equally much of both </garnt>
<connor> equally destroying my body with as much </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] that i was eating yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah i was probably eating in food alone </connor>
<connor> like 3000 calories </connor>
<connor> probably consuming like 2 000 calories </connor>
<connor> at least an alcohol </connor>
<connor> and that's not even like the monster </connor>
<connor> energy drinks that were probably like a </connor>
<connor> thousand calories plus all that </connor>
<joey> so i was going like ham on my body </joey>
<joey> because you know when you're like 19 </joey>
<joey> you're like yeah bro </joey>
<joey> i don't gain weight i've never been </joey>
<joey> through yeah i'm not going to get </joey>
<garnt> anything i mean that's the thing and </garnt>
<connor> like i had like an insane </connor>
<connor> diet when i was in high school yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> as well and it's not just like the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> i was eating but just </connor>
<connor> how much of it i was eating like lunch </connor>
<connor> like lunch </connor>
<connor> you know like high school lunches for </connor>
<connor> like a lot of people is like you know </connor>
<connor> maybe like a sandwich or you know </connor>
<connor> like a hot dog maybe or something like </connor>
<connor> that dude i used to have </connor>
<joey> 10 slices of bread i do i could do that </joey>
<joey> and just like devour that before the </joey>
<joey> noon hit </joey>
<joey> i was just like i just got to school i'm </joey>
<joey> feeling a little bit hungry i just eat </joey>
<joey> like three sandwiches </joey>
<joey> and i and i was still skinny as [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> people like how like </joey>
<joey> jealous how how violent are your shits </joey>
<joey> because that's the only way you're </joey>
<joey> getting rid of it i think it's that </joey>
<connor> asian blood man because i've </connor>
<connor> consistently </connor>
<connor> like i've i've been about the same </connor>
<joey> weights my entire adult life </joey>
<joey> i'm jealous yeah so jealous well i don't </joey>
<connor> know i think my body just </connor>
<connor> when i eat when i like start getting </connor>
<connor> weight my body just shuts off and it's </connor>
<connor> just like i don't want any food </connor>
<connor> like i'm just never hungry so it's i </connor>
<connor> don't know it's never been </connor>
<connor> a big deal [ __ ] superpower i mean i'm </connor>
<connor> okay with it now because i went from </connor>
<connor> dangerously skinny to just normal weight </connor>
<connor> yeah but obviously people have like </connor>
<connor> stuck around on my channel and have seen </connor>
<joey> me in that like emaciated state i just </joey>
<joey> like joey's going really fat </joey>
<connor> i'm like no i just went back to normal </connor>
<connor> that's all that happened i'm not </connor>
<connor> fat we all know youtube comments like to </connor>
<connor> nitpicks yeah exactly </connor>
<connor> with like university life did you go do </connor>
<joey> you guys feel the same way </joey>
<joey> you know my parents always told me you </joey>
<connor> know when you go to university that's </connor>
<connor> where you grow up that's </connor>
<connor> that's you know that's how that's that's </connor>
<connor> what they said </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah because that's where you're </joey>
<connor> like treated as an adult </connor>
<connor> right right with responsibility and </connor>
<connor> stuff but anyone who's still in </connor>
<connor> university </connor>
<connor> is such a warped experience of what </connor>
<garnt> adult life is like </garnt>
<garnt> yeah you know what i mean it's i yeah </garnt>
<connor> because i guess university is kind of </connor>
<connor> like the ramp </connor>
<connor> to being an adult the way i saw it like </connor>
<connor> there was people there who </connor>
<connor> left university who i'm like you you </connor>
<connor> should not be living alone </connor>
<connor> you cannot take care of yourself and </connor>
<connor> then there's other people who i'm like </connor>
<connor> yeah you know they'd be fine you know </connor>
<connor> like i feel i feel like if you can't </connor>
<connor> take care of yourself at uni you're </connor>
<connor> really gonna have a hard time taking </connor>
<connor> yourself after </connor>
<connor> uni as well we've definitely met those </connor>
<connor> people </connor>
<connor> like half people i lived with were like </connor>
<connor> incapable like one of them was like a </connor>
<connor> serial gambler and like lost all his </connor>
<connor> money </connor>
<connor> and like one of my friends was the same </connor>
<connor> yeah he one one time he </connor>
<connor> won 10k 10k for uni students </connor>
<connor> which is insane basically a millionaire </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah yeah you're basically a </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] millionaire and everyone's like </connor>
<connor> no [ __ ] way you won that much he lost </connor>
<connor> it within two weeks </connor>
<connor> two weeks because he was so addicted to </connor>
<connor> gambling </connor>
<connor> it's it's [ __ ] insane oh gosh i asked </connor>
<connor> him so how how could you spend the money </connor>
<garnt> you could have paid off your student </garnt>
<garnt> loans and everything yeah and i remember </garnt>
<connor> him just saying oh because it just </connor>
<joey> didn't mean anything to me </joey>
<connor> because there was like a guy in </connor>
<joey> the house next to me the one that got </joey>
<connor> pooped in um </connor>
<connor> as you gentlemen know as we all know and </connor>
<connor> he was like </connor>
<connor> basically like a neo-nazi and he was </connor>
<connor> really [ __ ] weird </connor>
<connor> and he would always come over and bring </connor>
<connor> like two </connor>
<connor> 40 year old women and and he was like </connor>
<connor> having threesomes with them both </connor>
<connor> and he would exclusively refer to them </connor>
<connor> as like sugar tits </connor>
<joey> like did he like time travel from the </joey>
<connor> 50s </connor>
<joey> and he was like and i remember one time </joey>
<joey> because my friends </joey>
<connor> give me a sugar date so yeah he was like </connor>
<connor> he was literally like </connor>
<connor> my friend was telling me he was like </connor>
<joey> yeah it's really weird he was like </joey>
<joey> mixing chemicals in his room and i was </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> bro tell the [ __ ] university people </joey>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> what do you mean he's mixing chemicals </connor>
<connor> in this room you're really you're really </connor>
<connor> doing a good job like selling on whales </connor>
<joey> yeah like this where'd you go again i </joey>

<connor> really mad at me but </connor>
<connor> bristol university represents sydney uni </connor>
<connor> you can find out what university </connor>
<connor> it's all that hard it's somewhere out </connor>

<connor> guns too much </connor>
<joey> he he brought up like mine camp like </joey>
<garnt> uncomfortable </garnt>
<connor> like an uncomfortable amount of time </connor>
<connor> right like i remember </connor>
<connor> my favorite piece of literature he was </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> i remember one time it's like his excuse </connor>
<connor> for not doing an </connor>
<connor> assignment was because he was too </connor>
<joey> in-depth into reading about nazi history </joey>
<connor> and how interesting it was and like </connor>
<connor> that's always like a double-edged sword </connor>
<connor> like a red flag yeah it's like are you </connor>
<connor> interested in or like </connor>
<connor> interesting yeah are you like this </connor>
<garnt> sounds like an episode of peep shows </garnt>
<connor> luckily never had to deal with it my </connor>
<connor> friend did yeah </connor>
<connor> apparently one time uh he he </connor>
<connor> my friend who was telling me all this </connor>
<connor> had borrowed something from the the </connor>
<connor> neo-nazi character </connor>
<connor> yeah and um he it was in his room and </connor>
<connor> his </connor>
<connor> his room was locked and so this guy </connor>
<joey> didn't want to wait 30 minutes to do it </joey>
<connor> so he just took all the bolts off his </connor>
<connor> door with like a screwdriver set and </connor>
<joey> just removed the door and went in </joey>
<joey> and never gave him his like door back </joey>
<joey> like the stuff </joey>
<connor> but like two weeks before the university </connor>
<joey> came and fixed it the dude had no door </joey>
<connor> and he had like a gaming pc and </connor>
<connor> everything like that you just had no </connor>
<connor> door </connor>
<connor> and the front door to this bungalow was </connor>
<connor> always left open </connor>
<connor> there's like there's there's taking you </connor>
<garnt> know like utensils </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and then there's taking a door he </garnt>
<connor> like took the like the door </connor>
<connor> like with all the like the what the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> handle all the hinges he just took it </connor>
<connor> off </connor>
<connor> and just removed the door to like the </connor>
<connor> side like it's like a caveman with a </connor>
<connor> stone entrance </connor>
<connor> like um i need my my keys or something </connor>
<garnt> whatever it was and you just </garnt>
<garnt> did like this dude was insane he was the </garnt>
<garnt> kind of guy who like when you're around </garnt>
<garnt> him for five minutes you're like i don't </garnt>
<connor> want to be around you anymore </connor>
<connor> you've said too many uncomfortable </connor>
<garnt> things in five minutes and when he </garnt>
<garnt> brought his two </garnt>
<connor> 40 year old woman girlfriends around </connor>
<connor> like they're disgusting get them out of </connor>
<connor> my house </connor>

<joey> i was like 20 like cleaning my dishes </joey>
<connor> like what the [ __ ] is happening </connor>
<joey> so like how did you transition from </joey>
<joey> university life to like your working </joey>
<joey> youtube </joey>
<joey> schedule adult life the real adult life </joey>
<joey> or whatever we want to call it </joey>
<joey> so i think for me i'd finish university </joey>
<joey> i broke it to my parents that i didn't </joey>
<joey> want to do a masters </joey>
<joey> yeah they were like fair enough you </joey>
<connor> clearly didn't want to do a bachelor's </connor>
<connor> which i did i passed it with a good </connor>
<connor> grade so that's fine yeah and i was like </connor>
<connor> you know what </connor>
<connor> i go to london a lot why not [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> move to london yeah on a whim </garnt>
<garnt> i i've moved to japan on the win move </garnt>
<connor> went there and just uh </connor>
<connor> that was kind of it really yeah because </connor>
<connor> when you met sydney for the first time </connor>
<garnt> we had you already decided that you were </garnt>
<garnt> going to london </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah i knew pretty much like i was </garnt>

<joey> right so i'm going to move to london and </joey>
<connor> i know the prices were like insane </connor>
<connor> yeah managed to find a roommate to help </connor>
<connor> me split the costs and yeah and then </connor>
<connor> just kind of </connor>
<connor> went into it and it was really weird </connor>
<garnt> because it was like i don't know just </garnt>
<garnt> doing the same [ __ ] in just </garnt>
<connor> a different city i guess yeah but like </connor>
<connor> no one like teaches you about that [ __ ] </connor>

<connor> you just gotta do it and just hope for </connor>
<connor> the best you're like oh [ __ ] i have to </connor>
<joey> pay taxes how do i figure that out and </joey>
<connor> it's like oh [ __ ] okay i need to figure </connor>

<joey> right </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah i don't know like what was it </joey>
<connor> for you like because obviously you did </connor>
<connor> like a way bigger </connor>
<connor> like leap yeah because i mean i </connor>
<connor> i had like a gap year where </connor>

<connor> like that was when i went all out on </connor>
<connor> youtube before i just completely </connor>
<garnt> stopped yeah so the period before i </garnt>
<joey> completely stopped i i like </joey>

<joey> had basically nothing else we were still </joey>
<joey> not making any money during that time </joey>
<joey> yeah i wasn't making any money oh [ __ ] </joey>
<garnt> um it was just </garnt>
<garnt> because i had nothing else to do and i </garnt>
<connor> was really enjoying it and </connor>
<garnt> yeah because that was about what about </garnt>
<garnt> the time like potaku started and a lot </garnt>
<garnt> of a lot of new things </garnt>
<garnt> right right happily invested in it yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i was pretty heavily invested in that </garnt>
<garnt> and i remember i this was like such a </garnt>
<garnt> weird year for me because i would spend </garnt>
<garnt> my time like all over the world </garnt>

<joey> um because because at the time a lot of </joey>
<joey> my friends were online </joey>
<connor> and a lot of them unfortunately were in </connor>
<connor> north america right which </connor>
<joey> the best time to talk to them was either </joey>
<joey> like probably like really late for us </joey>
<joey> you know so </joey>
<joey> you just get used to staying up super </joey>
<joey> super late so </joey>
<joey> that was fine when i was in university </joey>
<joey> because it was easy to do all nighters </joey>
<joey> anyway </joey>
<connor> but when i was working at the bbc um i </connor>
<connor> had a nine-to-five job </connor>
<connor> so i'd need to get up i lived five </connor>
<garnt> minutes away from my workplace </garnt>
<garnt> that was a good thing because if if i </garnt>
<garnt> didn't my sleep schedule would be even </garnt>
<connor> worse than it already was </connor>
<joey> so i would stay up until about </joey>
<connor> um till about four a.m yeah every day </connor>
<garnt> right it's pretty normal yeah </garnt>
<garnt> but i would wake up at eight so i'd have </garnt>
<garnt> i would have like </garnt>
<garnt> i would have four hours of sleep do you </garnt>
<connor> do my nine to five month preparation </connor>
<connor> do my nine to five four hours of sleep </connor>
<connor> be [ __ ] dead for the entire day </connor>
<connor> um and then go back home at around five </connor>
<connor> six o'clock </connor>
<joey> have have a two hour nap and then that </joey>
<joey> was my sleep schedule </joey>
<joey> i never had one long sleep it was always </joey>
<joey> like intermittent </joey>
<joey> like i would i would have a maximum of </joey>
<joey> like three to four hours </joey>
<joey> at a time every night just like space </joey>
<joey> spaced out by like eight hours </joey>
<joey> yeah that was my sleep schedule for a </joey>
<connor> full year jesus i think </connor>
<connor> being friends with americans especially </connor>
<connor> in the uk because of how the time zones </connor>
<garnt> work you're like five hours ahead you </garnt>
<connor> end up like you're talking to them </connor>
<joey> you're having a good time and you're </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> yeah i can talk for an hour extra and </joey>
<garnt> yeah it'd constantly like the hour extra </garnt>
<garnt> ads </garnt>
<joey> yeah exactly yeah before you know it the </joey>
<joey> sun's rising and you're like </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] yeah i i mean schedule </connor>
<connor> oh yeah of course oh okay yeah like i </connor>
<joey> was the similar thing because like </joey>
<joey> as you said like a lot of my like </joey>
<connor> youtuber friends were in north america </connor>
<connor> or </connor>
<connor> not in australia essentially so i always </connor>
<joey> had to adjust to their time zones and </joey>
<joey> that was usually like three or four a.m </joey>
<joey> right but but at least i didn't have to </joey>
<joey> get up at like </joey>
<connor> 8 a.m i would get up at like maybe 2 p.m </connor>
<connor> yeah that was like </connor>
<connor> if i got up if i got up before noon that </connor>
<connor> was weird for me </connor>
<connor> i'm just like that's this this isn't </connor>
<joey> right i can feel the morning sun </joey>
<connor> i felt the morning sun before i went to </connor>
<garnt> bed </garnt>
<garnt> i don't know if you guys did this but i </garnt>
<connor> would like just slowly </connor>
<connor> deteriorate my sleep schedule to go to </connor>
<connor> the point where i was going to bed at </connor>
<connor> like six </connor>
<connor> seven a.m yeah and then i would you know </connor>
<connor> wake up at like four p.m </connor>
<connor> yeah right um like i would do the thing </connor>
<connor> where i would </connor>
<connor> completely [ __ ] it and then i'm like i'm </connor>
<connor> gonna fix it today </connor>
<connor> and then i fix it and then i immediately </connor>
<joey> start just chipping away at it </joey>
<joey> it like offsets by an hour then an hour </joey>
<connor> turns yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah two hours and it's three hours </connor>
<connor> you'll have that one night you and you </connor>
<connor> i'm sure you've had it where you're just </connor>
<joey> like </joey>
<connor> for some reason you stayed up until like </connor>
<joey> 8 a.m yeah and you're like </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] there's no coming back for some </joey>
<connor> reason when it's when you step to 8 a.m </connor>
<connor> it's easier to keep on that </connor>
<connor> sleep schedule and keep on a healthy </connor>
<connor> sleep schedule right yeah it's so </connor>
<connor> it like i physically like i remember </connor>
<connor> last year it was </connor>
<joey> so hard for me to try and fix this like </joey>
<joey> i would try and stay up i would fail </joey>
<connor> and then i would try and wake up early </connor>
<connor> and i would fail so i was just in this </connor>
<connor> loop for like i remember like two months </connor>
<connor> i was trying to [ __ ] fix this thing </connor>
<connor> and i could not do it and then when i </connor>
<connor> did </connor>
<joey> i had to fly to america and then come </joey>
<joey> back and just immediately fight yeah </joey>
<connor> like so it was like i couldn't win and i </connor>
<connor> know this sounds so stupid like just </connor>
<garnt> wake up early connor yeah like </garnt>
<connor> lolita just wake up early just do it but </connor>
<garnt> it's like for some reason when you're a </garnt>
<garnt> youtuber and you have no </garnt>
<garnt> responsibilities </garnt>
<garnt> it's like impossible to fix this just </garnt>
<garnt> put an alarm on your phone yeah it takes </garnt>
<connor> so much willpower </connor>
<connor> to fix your sleep schedule oh yeah it's </connor>
<connor> it's it's really difficult when you </connor>
<connor> don't have any responsibilities or a </connor>
<connor> schedule to stick right or people </connor>
<garnt> relying on you apart from your viewers </garnt>
<garnt> like this is probably the first year </garnt>
<garnt> that i think almost every day i've </garnt>
<garnt> gotten up at like a normal human time </garnt>
<joey> yeah cause i remember when i first moved </joey>
<joey> here you were still waking up pretty </joey>
<joey> late </joey>
<connor> oh yeah when i was like when i was first </connor>
<joey> living here like at my previous place </joey>
<connor> before rocky moved here with me </connor>
<joey> i was getting up at yeah like you know </joey>
<joey> maybe like </joey>
<garnt> 12 1 p.m yeah and i'm just like yeah </garnt>
<joey> this is </joey>
<connor> reasonable time yeah i went to bed like </connor>
<connor> 5 a.m last night so i got my sleep </connor>
<joey> yeah i think being on this time zone </joey>
<connor> like americans are always asleep </connor>
<joey> when i want to like do [ __ ] so it's i </joey>
<connor> just go to bed and then they're all </connor>
<connor> awake </connor>
<connor> i don't feel any pressure to stay up </connor>
<connor> here there's like no reason unless i'm </connor>
<joey> out </joey>
<joey> yeah cause i remember you talking before </joey>
<joey> about how you would record videos at </joey>
<joey> 2am yeah i'd record because i woke up at </joey>
<joey> like six i don't want to do anything </joey>
<connor> when i wake up 6 p.m by the way i would </connor>
<garnt> wake up at like 6 00 p.m </garnt>
<garnt> in wales right before i moved to japan </garnt>
<garnt> because i was i was kind of like </garnt>
<garnt> i don't know i was pretty depressed i </garnt>
<garnt> was like i hated it yes i was just like </garnt>
<garnt> i just wanted to move to japan </garnt>
<connor> i was just stuck in this shitty bedroom </connor>
<connor> that i didn't like yeah </connor>
<connor> my brother's bedroom wasn't even mine i </connor>
<connor> hated it it was in the attic room </connor>
<connor> no no no no no no [ __ ] it i wish it was </connor>
<connor> actually more space </connor>
<connor> i hated this room i hated being in wales </connor>
<connor> i'm sorry parents i love you but </connor>
<connor> they know i hate living in wales i hated </connor>
<connor> it so much i had no friends really </connor>
<joey> yeah and so i i would just stay up until </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> 9 10 a.m yeah and then i would go to bed </joey>
<joey> yeah wake up at 6 p.m </joey>
<joey> and then i couldn't do anything as well </joey>
<joey> because everything was closed right so i </joey>
<joey> just </joey>
<joey> i was just a perpetual cycle everything </joey>
<joey> opens and then closes </joey>
<joey> while you're literally literally </joey>
<joey> everything would open and close while i </joey>
<joey> sleep and then when i wanted to eat </joey>
<connor> anything like i couldn't </connor>
<connor> i had to like preemptively go to the </connor>
<connor> shop to buy things that i think i would </connor>
<connor> want later </connor>
<connor> yeah for dinner i think like i had a </connor>
<connor> similar problem like that in japan but i </connor>
<connor> think it's because i was relying too </connor>
<connor> much on the convenience of </connor>
<connor> the 24 yeah yeah because like i would </connor>
<connor> get up but you know i'd stay up till </connor>
<connor> maybe like 3 a.m and i'd be like i'm a </connor>
<joey> bit hungry </joey>
<joey> everywhere else in the world you're </joey>
<garnt> pretty much [ __ ] like you have to look </garnt>
<garnt> in your fridge oh america </garnt>
<garnt> i mean you know you could do like </garnt>
<joey> delivering stuff like that but it's no </joey>
<joey> you know </joey>
<joey> in my case like i would get out of the </joey>
<joey> house literally walk 20 meters </joey>
<joey> to the 7-eleven that was like across the </joey>
<garnt> road from my house yeah and just grab </garnt>
<joey> something and come back i'm like </joey>
<connor> well yeah of course i'm going to stay up </connor>
<joey> because there's no time limit </joey>
<joey> with food especially or anything like </joey>
<connor> that right yeah but </connor>
<connor> yeah recording at 2 am though like </connor>
<connor> that's that's insane </connor>
<joey> how would your yeah 2 am foreign how did </joey>
<connor> your neighbors find it </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] them dude dude i would be like in </connor>
<connor> bed at like </connor>
<connor> like what was it ok this is why my </connor>
<connor> signature wasn't too bad like 4am </connor>
<connor> and i would hear [ __ ] peppa pig </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] blasting through my walk </connor>
<connor> it's like like muffled </connor>
<connor> i'm like shut the [ __ ] up it's 4 00 am </connor>
<connor> so i didn't give a [ __ ] i was like [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> they were still [ __ ] to me so i was </connor>
<connor> like you know what you should have just </connor>
<joey> blasted </joey>
<joey> back dmx through the wall like peppa pig </joey>
<connor> version </connor>
<connor> like i have like a similar experience to </connor>
<connor> the first house i lived in london </connor>
<connor> because </connor>
<connor> if you live in london you could live </connor>
<connor> you're gonna live in a shared house </connor>
<connor> that's just the way it is in london so </connor>
<connor> we had </connor>
<connor> paper thin walls right and i would live </connor>
<joey> next i lived next to this couple </joey>
<joey> who just like would not stop having sex </joey>
<joey> and it was just not good on them good on </joey>
<joey> them get on them but it wasn't it wasn't </joey>
<connor> like the </connor>
<connor> discreet sex that like they were loud </connor>
<connor> and it wasn't even like sexy loud like </connor>
<connor> the girl just sounded like a dying dog </connor>
<connor> okay that's the kind of like the kind of </connor>
<joey> that's kind of like the noise i had to </joey>
<joey> live with but i think they would </joey>
<connor> i think they did that because they got </connor>
<joey> annoyed at me recording podcasts and </joey>
<joey> videos so they would feel like i'll show </joey>
<joey> him they would choose to have sex </joey>
<connor> right like whenever i start recording </connor>
<connor> like like </connor>
<connor> it was it was coincidentally every time </connor>
<connor> i started recording a video i just hear </connor>
<connor> these [ __ ] moans </connor>
<connor> on on the on on the wall um and i would </connor>
<connor> have to wait like a good </connor>
<connor> like sometimes it was an hour i like i </connor>
<connor> don't know how what couple constantly </connor>
<connor> has sex for an hour every time i swear </connor>
<connor> they were like </connor>
<connor> taking </connor>
<connor> but yeah i think they were just having </connor>
<connor> like shouting contests because they were </connor>
<connor> just annoyed at me </connor>
<connor> recording videos and podcasts yeah some </connor>
<connor> episodes </connor>
<connor> you can kind of hear like we had we had </connor>
<connor> to blank out my audio because there's </connor>
<connor> just like moans in the background </connor>
<joey> release the uncensored footage they were </joey>
<connor> like the moment they're like they </connor>
<joey> they just look they're just like you </joey>
<joey> putting their ear to the wall in the </joey>
<joey> moment they hear </joey>
<joey> warning they're just like all right </joey>
<joey> let's go let's go right now come on put </joey>
<joey> your pants out </joey>
<joey> let's go honey start moaning honey </joey>
<joey> i do and it wasn't even the videos that </joey>
<connor> i was loudest for it's like sometimes i </connor>
<connor> would record like </connor>
<connor> voiceover that was like full-on battle </connor>
<connor> cries yeah </connor>
<connor> it would literally be like and i can </connor>
<connor> shout loud oh yeah </connor>
<connor> it would be like full-on battle cries in </connor>
<connor> my [ __ ] house at like </connor>
<connor> 1am because i was i was the only time i </connor>
<connor> was awake i'm like ready </connor>
<joey> anywhere else in the world nothing like </joey>
<joey> a murder was happening yeah they were </joey>
<joey> here </joey>
<joey> they didn't give a [ __ ] in london they </joey>
<joey> were like oh it's you know we live in </joey>
<joey> south </joey>
<joey> south south london </joey>
<joey> i would god dude that yeah i did not </joey>
<joey> like my neighbors they were they were </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] and the one time they stole my </joey>
<joey> package as well </joey>
<joey> so [ __ ] them [ __ ] you for stealing my </joey>
<joey> package </joey>
<joey> yeah i see the only experience i've ever </joey>
<joey> had of like living or having neighbors </joey>
<joey> to worry about is </joey>
<joey> here in japan but it's never been </joey>
<joey> anything like that i mean i had that </joey>
<joey> like really one </joey>
<joey> recently that one really passive </joey>
<joey> aggressive woman </joey>
<joey> she gave me like a good it's not the one </joey>
<connor> time either that's like the third or </connor>
<connor> fourth letter she sent me </connor>
<connor> can you explain the whole story i'm </connor>
<connor> interesting so i i don't know the </connor>
<connor> timeline so basically i don't even </connor>
<connor> remember when the first one was but </connor>
<connor> basically i came home once </connor>
<connor> and like the in in japan i don't know if </connor>
<connor> it's in other </connor>
<connor> countries as well but at least in </connor>
<connor> japan's and apartments they have like a </connor>
<connor> mailbox downstairs on the first floor </connor>
<connor> and they also have like a little like </connor>
<connor> male entry thing i think that's on the </connor>
<connor> door i think </connor>
<connor> i think i don't know but basically i </connor>
<connor> came home and i was about to open the </connor>
<connor> door and i </connor>
<connor> saw like a piece of paper sticking out </connor>
<joey> so i'm like oh okay maybe it must be a </joey>
<joey> flyer or something you missed a package </joey>
<connor> yeah i missed a package or something i </connor>
<connor> pulled it out and i opened it and it's </connor>
<joey> this really </joey>
<joey> it was really creepy because it was like </joey>
<connor> to nobody </connor>
<connor> it was clearly typed out and there was </connor>
<joey> just it was just in english </joey>
<joey> and i read it i'm like this sounds </joey>
<joey> google translated and i read it and it's </joey>
<joey> the woman down </joey>
<joey> it's a guy or a woman now says i don't </joey>
<joey> even know who it is because when you </joey>
<joey> first moved to an apartment in japan </joey>
<joey> it's customary to like go to everybody </joey>
<joey> every room that's adjacent </joey>
<connor> yeah so the two rooms to the left and </connor>
<connor> right of you and the person above and </connor>
<connor> below you if there are any </connor>
<joey> and go and like basically say like hey i </joey>
<garnt> just moved in here you know </garnt>
<joey> if you ever need anything i'm in this </joey>
<garnt> room kind of right the p two people to </garnt>
<garnt> the sides of me </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] great i love i love both my </joey>
<joey> neighbors person the woman at the top </joey>
<joey> super nice barely talk to her but the </joey>
<connor> woman at the bottom </connor>
<connor> she didn't even come to the door like i </connor>
<connor> rung the doorbell i clearly </connor>
<connor> heard her running up to the door to look </connor>
<connor> in the peephole you should put your </connor>
<connor> thumb on the people yeah </connor>
<connor> and then and i guarantee the moment that </connor>
<connor> she like looked at the peephole and like </connor>
<connor> saw a gaijin she's like oh hell no </connor>
<connor> i'm not going out there dude are you </connor>
<connor> kidding me so immediately i was like oh </connor>
<connor> okay i have that kind of neighbor right </connor>
<joey> well </joey>
<joey> whatever yeah and uh and then yeah so i </joey>
<joey> immediately knew </joey>
<joey> it didn't say when this letter it didn't </joey>
<joey> say it was who it was </joey>
<joey> but man like she must have not thought </joey>
<joey> this through because in the letter she </joey>
<joey> said </joey>
<connor> i always hear you guys stomping around </connor>
<joey> so i'm like well then clearly you live </joey>
<joey> behind me </joey>
<joey> you're not even hiding it now and she's </joey>
<connor> like yeah um </connor>
<connor> your stomping is so loud in the night uh </connor>
<connor> that i am getting uh </connor>
<joey> insomnia and i'm just like okay </joey>
<joey> i mean sorry like like you must hate me </joey>
<garnt> then in my previous place because i was </garnt>
<garnt> up till like [ __ ] four a.m </garnt>
<joey> like i'm living a normal [ __ ] life in </joey>
<joey> this place </joey>
<connor> um yeah and she kept sending me it and </connor>
<connor> i'm just like oh my god what am i gonna </connor>
<connor> do with this woman so </connor>
<connor> the moment she sent this like recent </connor>
<connor> letter like a couple of weeks ago i was </connor>
<connor> like you know what </connor>
<joey> i'm gonna [ __ ] show this woman </joey>
<joey> because i'm getting [ __ ] annoyed </joey>
<garnt> because she threatened to like </garnt>
<garnt> burn down her apartment so i unscrewed </garnt>
<joey> the hinges in her door </joey>
<joey> i broke down her door and threw poop at </joey>
<connor> it </connor>
<connor> i shut in her mailbox </connor>
<joey> honestly honestly would have got him </joey>
<joey> actually yeah </joey>
<joey> no so uh so i was like i'm gonna show </joey>
<joey> this woman so cause like clearly </joey>
<joey> by writing by typing not even like </joey>
<joey> handwriting by typing out a clearly </joey>
<joey> google translated letter to me </joey>
<joey> she obviously thinks like oh these </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] dumbass foreigners don't know </connor>
<connor> anything and </connor>
<connor> there's this like mentality of like </connor>
<connor> xenophobic like japanese people usually </connor>
<joey> very senile </joey>
<joey> who think that they can get their way </joey>
<connor> because they're a senile japanese </connor>
<connor> person and we're just a dumb foreigner </connor>
<connor> who doesn't know the rules </connor>
<connor> so i'm just like all right i'll show </connor>
<joey> them so i wrote a handwritten letter </joey>
<joey> in japanese in the most like keigo as </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] like </joey>
<joey> the most businessman the most polite </joey>
<joey> japanese that you could ever see right </joey>
<joey> like i might as well have like written a </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] like invitation letter like a </joey>
<joey> resume to the </joey>
<joey> kingdom right and so i wrote it down and </joey>
<joey> i basically said like </joey>
<joey> i'm sorry but we got to do it because i </joey>
<joey> work at you know sometimes late at night </joey>
<joey> and like we're not trying to be noisy or </joey>
<joey> whatever and it's like </joey>
<joey> and i basically said at the bottom i was </joey>
<connor> like rather than you like taking it to </connor>
<connor> like the housing company and trying to </connor>
<connor> threaten me </connor>
<connor> maybe we should talk like you know face </connor>
<connor> to face </connor>
<connor> which is basically the most passive </connor>
<connor> aggressive way of saying come at me </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> it's like [ __ ] meet me outside like </connor>
<joey> come at me been to your house you don't </joey>
<joey> stomp no we don't look like pretty at </joey>
<connor> all </connor>
<connor> and it was like really rude as well like </connor>
<connor> she wrote down being like your footsteps </connor>
<connor> sound like uh you are dropping an iron </connor>
<connor> ball </connor>
<connor> onto the ground i saw the google </connor>
<joey> translation </joey>
<joey> what the [ __ ] like it's not like we're </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] neanderthals and just like </connor>
<joey> stomping around in our apartments right </joey>
<garnt> here [ __ ] around tick tock dance </garnt>
<joey> yeah so i sent that so i went down i put </joey>
<connor> it in her </connor>
<connor> letterbox surprise surprise she hasn't </connor>
<connor> complained since </connor>
<connor> she never took it to the housing company </connor>
<connor> because i guaranteed the moment she read </connor>
<connor> that letter she was like </connor>
<connor> oh [ __ ] he ain't a gaijin </connor>
<connor> [Laughter] </connor>
<connor> as well the one to the uh so i'm on the </connor>
<joey> end so which is great because yeah where </joey>
<joey> i film is also </joey>
<connor> on the end that is just nothing like </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah so it's great so i </connor>
<connor> i'm i'm you know i can be loud during </connor>
<connor> the day or whatever but so </connor>
<connor> the neighbors to the the right of me </connor>
<joey> weren't in and so </joey>
<joey> we went to go to the neighbors below and </joey>
<joey> mainly do you remember that you remember </joey>
<joey> this story right </joey>
<joey> when we went to say hi to the neighbors </joey>
<joey> below oh yeah because you went with him </joey>

<garnt> someone from geeks plus and the housing </garnt>
<garnt> agent person </garnt>
<joey> right and they press the like </joey>
<connor> button the thing that goes </connor>
<joey> they pressed it and you know they start </joey>
<connor> speaking in japanese and they start </connor>
<connor> having a conversation </connor>
<joey> and slowly i see like the two japanese </joey>
<connor> women with me looking slowly more and </connor>
<joey> more like displeased yeah </joey>
<connor> what's being said right and like if i </connor>
<connor> remember correctly what was roughly </connor>
<connor> translated was like oh </connor>
<joey> my husband doesn't let me talk to </joey>
<joey> foreigners without him there </joey>
<joey> or something and i was like and the </joey>
<connor> housing company </connor>
<connor> put woman was like i'm so sorry i'm so </connor>
<joey> sorry </joey>
<garnt> don't worry about it this is it's just </garnt>
<connor> old or whatever </connor>
<connor> i was like oh great what a warm welcome </connor>
<garnt> like my husband won't let me talk to </garnt>
<garnt> foreigners like jesus </garnt>
<connor> like what am i gonna do yeah i'm like </connor>
<connor> mike wazowski at the door like what are </connor>
<connor> they saying </connor>
<connor> that's being said so what are they gonna </connor>
<connor> do </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] in my mailbox they're like i hear </connor>
<connor> they [ __ ] through mailbox </connor>
<connor> pumpkins these dirty foreigners break my </connor>
<connor> daughter </connor>
<connor> i'd laugh if they were just actually </connor>
<connor> talking the mad as [ __ ] yeah and then it </connor>
<connor> translates </connor>
<connor> like yeah she just uh doesn't yeah </connor>
<connor> i wouldn't be surprised i mean i wish i </connor>
<connor> you know knew </connor>
<connor> i could understand japanese level i can </connor>
<connor> now maybe i wouldn't yeah just like i </connor>
<connor> wish death upon it </connor>
<connor> is like she's feeling unwell </connor>
<joey> it was probably something like that yeah </joey>
<garnt> it's probably something like that yeah </garnt>
<garnt> but i mean i i bump into my other </garnt>
<garnt> neighbors all the time and they're </garnt>
<connor> pretty chill they always say hi to me </connor>
<connor> yeah my neighbors next to me are like </connor>
<connor> this like really old couple who </connor>
<connor> used to live in l.a so their english is </connor>
<connor> actually like productive </connor>
<connor> as well and like and that's good because </connor>
<connor> like aki isn't like the most proficient </connor>
<connor> in japanese right yeah </connor>
<connor> but they obviously know that and so </connor>
<connor> every time they like meet on it was </connor>
<connor> really weird because like i was walking </connor>
<connor> to my local supermarket and my neighbor </connor>
<connor> like walked past and it was really weird </connor>
<connor> because i was expecting you know like a </connor>
<connor> very </connor>
<connor> like traditional japanese like oh yeah </connor>
<connor> kind of thing </connor>
<connor> no instead she was like how you going </connor>
<connor> like a really like weirdly like </connor>
<connor> australian british accent as well </connor>
<connor> and i'm like i thought you said you </connor>
<connor> lived in l.a </connor>
<connor> that doesn't sound very los angeles like </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah and it was just i was just </connor>
<connor> like oh oh </connor>
<connor> hi i guess oh because i was fully </connor>
<connor> expecting to do like the whole bow thing </connor>
<connor> right but she was just like </connor>
<garnt> sup some some old people are real </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] nice here and they love speaking </connor>
<connor> to you </connor>
<joey> yeah and then other times like they they </joey>
<joey> just they want you dead </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah i mean i guess that's old </joey>
<joey> people everywhere with foreigners right </joey>
<connor> there so no </connor>
<connor> that's not good but i think japan takes </connor>
<joey> it to like a whole other level it's just </joey>
<joey> it seems like one one extreme or the </joey>
<connor> other yeah it's hard for me to say i </connor>
<joey> mean i'm </joey>
<joey> white and grew up in a white place so i </joey>
<joey> don't know i mean in england nobody </joey>
<joey> like nobody talks to each other or like </joey>
<joey> no like acknowledges </joey>
<connor> generally talking is frowned upon </connor>
<connor> i remember actually the first time i </connor>
<connor> went to america i was i was in new york </connor>
<connor> and this was the very first like my very </connor>
<joey> first experience in america because i've </joey>
<joey> like </joey>

<connor> they were like because they were i did i </connor>
<joey> remember one time i the way i explained </joey>
<connor> it so i was like </connor>
<connor> if there's an american on public </connor>
<joey> transport everyone knows </joey>
<connor> everyone knows they know the loudest </connor>
<connor> yeah they know they know they hate it </connor>
<connor> yeah because we're so like like </connor>
<joey> everything we consume obviously is like </joey>
<joey> american media we just use so much </joey>
<connor> american stuff so we're so desensitized </connor>
<connor> to american media </connor>
<connor> and obviously to americans it's like oh </connor>
<connor> it's a flavor of british </connor>
<connor> i thought she's interesting very </connor>
<joey> international i think it's also because </joey>
<joey> we've been to america so often now </joey>
<connor> four like conventions because i remember </connor>
<connor> back in high school but i think even </connor>
<joey> just general british people aren't like </joey>
<connor> impressed by americans </connor>
<joey> accents i mean i remember back in </joey>
<joey> university whenever someone had an </joey>
<joey> american accent they would definitely </joey>
<joey> stand </joey>
<joey> out maybe less so now because there's </joey>
<connor> more i think there's more americans </connor>
<connor> coming over to england to study here </connor>
<connor> yeah we had that like one </connor>
<connor> american exchange student in our high </connor>
<connor> school and </connor>
<connor> everybody [ __ ] loved it they were </connor>
<connor> like yeah like keep talking </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah many things have changed i </connor>
<garnt> don't know man at least in my my </garnt>
<garnt> university </garnt>
<garnt> i mean i definitely i mean we're all </garnt>
<garnt> used to it but i think god and i </garnt>
<connor> definitely used to because we live with </connor>
<garnt> an american </garnt>
<garnt> yeah right i'm definitely used to it now </garnt>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<connor> before before then it was definitely i </connor>
<joey> do think it was </joey>
<joey> more exotic before i because i remember </joey>
<joey> like american accent sounding so </joey>
<connor> harsh yeah like you could clearly hear </connor>
<joey> like the the hard </joey>
<connor> r like i mean yo what is that </connor>
<joey> i can cancel the heart </joey>
<garnt> because we don't pronounce the r's in </garnt>
<garnt> all of our words right so like when we </garnt>
<garnt> when we hear the r in like like the </garnt>
<connor> sound right like i'm just like </connor>
<joey> oh oh god why stop please </joey>
<joey> i don't know hearing americans say </joey>
<garnt> british swear words is like the most </garnt>
<connor> disgusting yeah we've said this yeah we </connor>

<garnt> australia no we have a bunch of british </garnt>
<garnt> ones you guys have australians </garnt>

<connor> heard an american say wanker </connor>
<connor> i was like yeah i was like oh speaking </connor>
<connor> of wankers </connor>
<connor> the most the one that i hear sometimes </connor>
<garnt> americans say that i'm like please don't </garnt>
<garnt> they're like [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> i'm like yeah </garnt>

<connor> like </connor>
<connor> you know as i mentioned earlier like my </connor>
<garnt> first couple of like youtube friends </garnt>

<garnt> then i didn't really have like </garnt>
<connor> international friends like all of my </connor>
<connor> friends were just aussies yeah basically </connor>
<joey> um and so like when you speak a lot of </joey>
<joey> like especially in australian slang </joey>
<connor> right which is like pretty much a </connor>
<joey> different language in and of itself </joey>
<connor> in your head you're just like oh yeah </connor>
<connor> this is just a universal word that you </connor>
<joey> use </joey>
<joey> so i remember like saying a bunch of </joey>
<connor> slang to my like american youtuber </connor>
<connor> friends like uh i don't know if you guys </connor>
<connor> say like arvo </connor>
<connor> no that's australian that's definitely </connor>
<connor> australia it's too uncivilized </connor>
<connor> it's a peasant's language i'm ironically </connor>
<connor> peasant </connor>
<joey> yeah so like we say like you know </joey>
<joey> instead of like five in the afternoon we </joey>
<joey> say five in the other </joey>
<joey> you're just cutting out stuff that </joey>
<joey> doesn't need to be cut out yeah like </joey>

<joey> chris hemsworth to whisper into their </joey>
<joey> ears </joey>
<joey> of course but chris hemsworth is like </joey>
<joey> the .001 percent of australians </joey>
<connor> as as every british actor yeah right </connor>
<connor> anything like that and it's like it's </connor>
<connor> it's </connor>
<connor> like i think i saw like an article was </connor>
<connor> like the top three are like australian </connor>
<connor> british and irish people is pretty good </connor>
<connor> too </connor>
<joey> scottish is like i understand scottish </joey>
<joey> and uh irish yeah i think that's like </joey>
<joey> kind of cute i like scottish irish yeah </joey>
<joey> scottish and irish are really really </joey>
<joey> nice right but like </joey>
<joey> i hear like the majority of british </joey>
<joey> accents and the australian accent i'm </joey>
<joey> just like nah </joey>
<connor> i can't i i grew up in the north and </connor>
<joey> like i was surrounded by those accents </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah and that's why i get i get </connor>
<connor> mocked when i go back they're like </connor>
<connor> you're not </connor>
<connor> from here yeah you you definitely don't </connor>
<joey> sound like the area that you're not no </joey>
<connor> no and i don't know if </connor>
<connor> that evolved over the time it did if you </connor>
<joey> go back to my </joey>
<connor> my very first youtube video i sound like </connor>
<garnt> someone </garnt>
<joey> from the area that i grew up oh yeah </joey>
<garnt> when i first met you you had like </garnt>
<garnt> quite a heavy like welsh accent yeah i </garnt>
<joey> wasn't even wow she was like more </joey>
<joey> northern but like because the </joey>
<joey> the welsh accent sounds like this you </joey>
<connor> know </connor>
<joey> and i never sounded like that yeah but </joey>
<joey> everyone in my village talked like this </joey>
<garnt> but you don't but you definitely didn't </garnt>
<joey> sound like you do now no no i didn't i </joey>
<joey> sounded like more </joey>
<joey> just like general northern english yeah </joey>
<connor> yeah cause i've lost my accent quite a </connor>
<connor> bit people yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah when i look back at old videos i'm </connor>
<connor> like ew yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> because because i was strong because you </connor>
<connor> like really iron out your like </connor>
<connor> you enunciate a lot more yeah i think </connor>
<connor> that's it's just a youtuber accent right </connor>
<connor> where you have to </connor>
<connor> we have to like stop mumbling and start </connor>
<connor> paying attention to what you're saying </connor>
<connor> because </connor>
<connor> people from all different races are </connor>
<connor> going to be like listening to you yeah </connor>
<connor> because like because like the word </connor>
<joey> literally yeah i </joey>
<joey> in australia we say literally yeah that </joey>
<connor> sounds like yeah but i can't say </connor>
<joey> literally anymore i have to say </joey>
<connor> literally </connor>
<connor> i don't know why and my dad gave me so </connor>
<connor> much [ __ ] for it the last time i was </connor>
<joey> home he's like </joey>
<connor> what the [ __ ] did you say literally you </connor>
<connor> sound like a [ __ ] american man </connor>
<connor> i was like say literally like a true </connor>
<connor> aussie i'm like all right </connor>
<connor> thank you for your patriotism i got </connor>
<joey> accused on one of the comments they were </joey>
<connor> like </connor>
<joey> connor isn't from wales connor no one </joey>
<connor> i'm from where connor is no one speaks </connor>
<connor> like that that's right yeah </connor>
<joey> and like it just didn't cross their mind </joey>
<joey> that like your accent can evolve </joey>
<joey> yeah exactly i think there was a study </joey>
<connor> that was uh done in antarctica where </connor>
<connor> they like sent </connor>
<joey> you know when they go to the scientists </joey>
<connor> go yeah and they wanted to see from all </connor>
<connor> these european scientists like what </connor>
<connor> would happen to the accents </connor>
<connor> right over like the three-month period </connor>
<connor> and it would fight like normally they </connor>
<connor> would all </connor>
<connor> for some reason pick up one person's </connor>
<connor> accent the most right </connor>
<connor> generally start to talk the way they did </connor>
<connor> yeah and i think that's </connor>
<connor> how it is like it can quickly change </connor>
<connor> your accent if you're surrounded by </connor>
<connor> people who sound </connor>
<connor> and i think that's why like i've lost my </connor>
<connor> accent a lot of the times because i have </connor>
<joey> spent like just from what i do i've </joey>
<connor> spent more time with non-aussies </connor>
<garnt> yeah i spend a lot of time in london and </garnt>
<joey> then spend a ton of time in japan a ton </joey>
<garnt> of time around america </garnt>
<garnt> yeah there's words like that i pick up </garnt>
<garnt> from like you know british english and </garnt>
<garnt> like right </garnt>
<connor> right yeah it's just it kind of just </connor>
<connor> becomes like a conglomerate of just a </connor>
<connor> bunch of different languages </connor>
<connor> right it's it's just kind of a mixture </connor>
<joey> of like internet language as well pretty </joey>
<joey> much one of the international pretty </joey>
<connor> much yeah </connor>
<connor> i'm sure if i move back to england my </connor>
<connor> accent would like slowly develop slowly </connor>
<joey> back </joey>
<connor> uh slowly back into more of a bridge i </connor>
<connor> haven't noticed that though when i go </connor>
<connor> back to australia and i talk to like my </connor>
<connor> high school friends or whatever i just i </connor>
<connor> just immediately kick into like </connor>
<connor> australia </connor>
<connor> like i remember uh when i met uh robert </connor>
<connor> ninja </connor>
<connor> or ross yeah you know he's an aussie </connor>
<garnt> right yeah yeah but he's </garnt>
<connor> been living in america for so long that </connor>
<connor> his natural accent is just american now </connor>
<joey> yeah but i remember </joey>
<connor> the first time i met him at aex the </connor>
<joey> moment he heard my accent he was like </joey>
<connor> oh yeah man he's just [ __ ] like he </connor>
<joey> just completely changed to an aussie you </joey>
<joey> know it's just like </joey>
<connor> you could all you could talk like this </connor>
<connor> the entire time and i reckon like more </connor>
<connor> people would be like </connor>
<connor> into it yeah yeah that happened to me </connor>
<connor> when i went back to wales i definitely </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> regained some of my my my older accent </connor>
<connor> yeah i didn't like i don't like my old </connor>
<connor> accent i prefer this one </connor>
<connor> i like to like speak clearly and like </connor>
<connor> you know yeah like more concisely yeah </connor>
<connor> more of a voice acting accent yeah it's </connor>
<garnt> more generalized and </garnt>
<connor> allows me to say words easy </connor>
<connor> before i struggled with words so you </connor>
<connor> know </connor>
<connor> so then i'm curious how like since you </connor>
<connor> guys have moved to japan right </connor>
<connor> about like your lifestyle changes like i </connor>
<connor> think it's because doing youtube </connor>
<connor> here i feel is completely different to </connor>
<connor> doing youtube anywhere else </connor>
<connor> in the world yeah yeah i don't know if </connor>
<joey> it's because we have like an agency here </joey>
<connor> that keeps us in track </connor>
<connor> yeah because i'm my own worst enemy and </connor>
<connor> if i can be lazy i will be lazy </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah so having an agency has really </joey>
<connor> helped me like just </connor>
<connor> stay responsible you know and i don't </connor>
<connor> want to let them down </connor>
<connor> right right right not that i was letting </connor>
<garnt> myself down anyway </garnt>
<garnt> i don't really don't want to [ __ ] up </garnt>
<garnt> because meleen will kill me </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and also having like </garnt>
<garnt> japanese class two times a week that i </garnt>
<garnt> have to be awake i have to be there by </garnt>
<connor> nine so i have to be awake at like </connor>
<connor> 7 30 to get there which i did this </connor>
<connor> morning yeah </connor>
<connor> this </connor>
<joey> like i basically have no choice but to </joey>
<joey> maintain like a healthy lifestyle </joey>
<connor> before coronavirus [ __ ] i was going gym </connor>
<connor> like five times a week i was so hyped </connor>
<garnt> for that and now i don't care </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i know because i don't want to go </garnt>
<connor> to a gym and [ __ ] have to run in a </connor>
<joey> mask right </joey>
<joey> it's just not yeah i mean you can't and </joey>
<joey> you can't even do it outside anymore </joey>
<connor> because it's like 35 [ __ ] degrees </connor>
<connor> yeah like 80 </connor>
<joey> humidity i just like don't every time </joey>
<joey> i've been working out recently i'm like </joey>
<joey> it's just </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] i'm not i'm not doing a good job it </joey>
<connor> just feels bad where you would make </connor>
<connor> such good progress and then you have to </connor>
<connor> take it like two months off yeah and you </connor>
<connor> go back to the gym and you're </connor>
<connor> like i was getting so many gains bro my </connor>
<connor> arms were getting beautiful </connor>
<connor> yeah i mean we're all going to the gym </connor>
<connor> together and it it's just yeah it's it's </connor>
<connor> just sad now that </connor>
<connor> that's okay but overall other than that </connor>
<connor> i mean like </connor>
<joey> it's i don't know what exactly it is if </joey>
<connor> it's just the different time zone that's </connor>
<connor> forced me to </connor>
<connor> i can't talk to americans as much as i </connor>
<connor> used to yeah i </connor>
<connor> have to take care of myself i eat better </connor>
<connor> here just because there's more healthy </connor>
<connor> options </connor>
<connor> like the whole thing where you're like </connor>
<connor> you know why are people so thin in japan </connor>
<connor> it's just because the healthier food is </connor>
<connor> more readily available and you walk a </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] ton </garnt>
<garnt> yeah you really have to like search for </garnt>
<connor> crap food here oh yeah i don't think you </connor>
<connor> do </connor>
<connor> you don't but like there's let's go to </connor>
<connor> the conbini and half the [ __ ] and that </connor>
<connor> will make you fat as [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> yes but it's just like whereas in the uk </connor>
<connor> it was like </connor>
<connor> you had to pay a lot and find the </connor>
<connor> healthy food it's like it's equally </connor>
<connor> distributed where it's like </connor>
<connor> you can have extremely healthy food and </connor>
<joey> right next to us the bad stuff and it's </joey>
<joey> like it's not a question of can i get it </joey>
<joey> it's do i want to get the healthiest </joey>
<joey> yeah it's it's not like in america where </joey>
<joey> like you know a mcdonald's is like </joey>
<connor> readily available five minutes down the </connor>
<connor> road </connor>
<connor> right you have to like [ __ ] look up </connor>
<connor> like you have to go deep on yelp to find </connor>
<joey> like a vegan restaurant i mean that's </joey>
<joey> i mean that's the tldr of why i think </joey>
<joey> people are thin in japan is you walk a </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] ton </garnt>
<joey> and there's way healthier food yeah it's </joey>
<joey> just it's just a lifestyle thing where </joey>
<joey> people because you're surrounded by </joey>
<joey> people who have a much healthier </joey>
<garnt> lifestyle </garnt>
<garnt> you kind of like you you kind of they </garnt>
<garnt> kind of guide you into having a more </garnt>
<garnt> healthy lifestyle </garnt>
<connor> yeah because everyone else around you is </connor>
<connor> not eating like [ __ ] and not like yeah </connor>
<connor> sitting in the past like when i order a </connor>
<connor> domino's pizza and then joey's like yeah </connor>
<connor> i had a salad i'm like [ __ ] i mean </connor>
<connor> you think last night yeah yeah yeah i </connor>
<connor> had like a meal </connor>
<connor> last night dude matsuya's my favorite </connor>
<joey> place on earth </joey>
<joey> the best when i joined you wanna explain </joey>
<joey> matzia so there's like three </joey>
<joey> like beef bowls the big three the </joey>
<joey> basically the big the big three of like </joey>
<joey> beef bowls and just general like meat </joey>
<connor> and rice </connor>
<connor> yeah fast food chains so there's matsuya </connor>
<connor> yoshinoya </connor>
<connor> and oh my god what's the third one </connor>
<connor> everyone will everyone on like the vlog </connor>
<connor> channels be like go to yoshinoya like </connor>
<connor> no don't go to yoshinoya let me tell you </connor>
<connor> why matzia is the best straight away </connor>
<joey> first of all in the australia you have </joey>
<joey> to speak to people i don't like that </joey>
<connor> right </connor>
<connor> you have to like tell the person what </connor>
<connor> you want i'm not for that i like it when </connor>
<joey> the machine </joey>
<garnt> takes my order and i give the the man </garnt>
<connor> the ticket i don't say anything </connor>
<joey> yeah i just get my meal right right </joey>
<connor> right i love that first of all because </connor>
<garnt> it's an english option as well </garnt>
<connor> not that like you know everything should </connor>
<connor> have an english option i'm not here for </connor>
<garnt> that i'm just saying that it's nice that </garnt>
<connor> i don't have to worry </connor>
<connor> when i'm eating because sometimes in </connor>
<connor> japan you're just like [ __ ] man i just </connor>
<connor> want to order without having to [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> myself </connor>
<connor> like japan japan makes it like a lot of </connor>
<connor> places in japan make it very easy just </connor>
<connor> to not have human interaction </connor>
<connor> yeah which i appreciate which as a </connor>
<joey> british person </joey>
<connor> that's fan [ __ ] tastic what i hate </connor>
<joey> though </joey>
<joey> also as a british person in any </joey>
<joey> restaurant in japan if they don't have a </joey>
<connor> button </connor>
<connor> that calls the waiter to you you have to </connor>
<connor> call them yourself </connor>
<connor> and so in england the etiquette is that </connor>
<connor> you try to be as quiet as possible you </connor>
<joey> you like look for eye contact okay you </joey>
<joey> look far </joey>
<joey> like excuse me yeah yeah even the hand </joey>
<joey> hand is a risky move </joey>
<joey> oh yeah you even the hand you're kind of </joey>
<connor> making a scene there yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> it's kind of just it's like it's a lot </connor>
<joey> of this like yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah yeah like you want the </joey>
<connor> bill it's like uh </connor>
<connor> okay and that's as much as that's as </connor>
<joey> much as you do to get a waiter's </joey>
<joey> attention </joey>
<connor> in japan you gotta shout out you gotta </connor>
<connor> shout out the top of your lungs </connor>
<connor> dude koreans are like laughing their ass </connor>
<connor> off right now they're like these </connor>
<connor> peasants </connor>
<connor> but the worst part is is that like me </connor>
<connor> and gone will go like i'll go like full </connor>
<joey> volume like sumacer </joey>
<joey> and the silence </joey>
<joey> they're like coming over the speed of </joey>
<joey> light i'm like what the [ __ ] i don't get </joey>
<connor> that </connor>
<joey> because like the other like last week we </joey>
<joey> went to like an izakaya afterwards </joey>
<joey> after we finished recording and because </joey>
<connor> it's the user guide that doesn't have </connor>
<connor> the button so yeah </connor>
<joey> conor mcgregor just like oh with this </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] again it's like so fulfilling </joey>
<joey> prophecy the moment you sit down right </joey>
<joey> it's like i know that it's okay to shout </joey>
<joey> publicly like to get their attention </joey>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<connor> like my body has been like crafted yeah </connor>
<connor> it's conditioned </connor>
<connor> yeah should never ever ever make any </connor>
<connor> public disturbance </connor>
<connor> it's the same in australia so like i </connor>
<connor> remember like the first couple of years </connor>
<connor> i lived here like i never did it </connor>
<connor> yeah i always just kind of just did this </connor>
<connor> like a lot of the eye contact like </connor>
<connor> nodding </connor>
<garnt> because in japan they just don't want to </garnt>
<garnt> make eye contact they do everything to </garnt>
<garnt> avoid eye contact so doing that's </garnt>
<connor> impossible so </connor>
<connor> every time i have to shout out i die a </connor>
<joey> little bit yeah i think my life </joey>
<joey> expectancy goes down by a few months </joey>
<joey> every time i assume </joey>
<connor> and especially if it fails yeah but then </connor>
<connor> have you ever had the the pity one where </connor>
<connor> i've said it like suma said and then </connor>
<connor> they won't ignore me but one of the </connor>
<connor> customers will have heard me </connor>
<connor> yeah and he'll go like so am i saying </connor>
<connor> and they like point at me </connor>
<connor> you want your attention </connor>
<connor> but anyway back to matsuya the best </connor>
<connor> place in japan </connor>
<connor> you basically can get like a banger of a </connor>
<connor> meal that fills you up to like the brim </connor>
<connor> for like eight bucks maybe like less if </connor>
<connor> you want to get the cheaper ones </connor>
<connor> like even less like there's a the set i </connor>
<connor> go for it's like you get this like oh </connor>
<connor> it's amazing this grilled ginger pork </connor>
<connor> and like rice you get a potato salad you </connor>
<connor> got a ton judo which is like miso soup </connor>
<connor> with extra [ __ ] in it yeah it's amazing </connor>
<connor> i [ __ ] love that [ __ ] yeah </connor>
<garnt> but like you can get like a regular like </garnt>
<joey> beef ball with all of that for like 600 </joey>
<joey> yeah like like no if you want to go ham </joey>
<garnt> you can get it and like you can like </garnt>
<garnt> like less than 10 bucks </garnt>
<garnt> you can like double that [ __ ] up as </garnt>
<garnt> well for like an additional like two </garnt>
<garnt> bucks and it's like a whole pig </garnt>
<garnt> it's like amazing i love it like every </garnt>
<garnt> time i come in like [ __ ] connor's coming </garnt>
<garnt> in get to get the whole pig carcass out </garnt>
<connor> like because i'm like max everything </connor>
<connor> because i'm like i want </connor>
<connor> meat and rice i'm there it's so good </connor>
<garnt> and you'll see you get these like </garnt>
<garnt> pathetic little bowl sizes like what am </garnt>
<garnt> i going to do </garnt>
<garnt> no i like it okay okay are good i just </garnt>
<garnt> think manchester is like the best </garnt>
<garnt> oh yeah yeah yeah but like you could but </garnt>
<connor> that's because you don't order like what </connor>
<garnt> they specialize in no </garnt>
<connor> you get like the side menu [ __ ] right </connor>
<garnt> yeah i mean yeah i guess because in </garnt>
<garnt> terms of like actual like beef balls </garnt>
<garnt> like udons like i i reckon </garnt>
<connor> yoshinoya have it better than matsuya </connor>
<connor> man just saying </connor>
<connor> we're gonna we're gonna make a [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> japanese fast food tier list here </connor>
<joey> this is the best one yeah i remember </joey>
<joey> this one time um </joey>
<joey> i i went to this very like local place </joey>
<connor> with sydney because this was when we </connor>
<connor> were staying outside of japan </connor>
<connor> no not not outside outside of tokyo yeah </connor>
<connor> so it's a bit more in the countryside </connor>
<connor> um so we went in this like what we were </connor>
<connor> craving ramen so we were looking for </connor>
<connor> like a </connor>
<connor> like a local ramen place and we go to </connor>
<connor> this place um obviously </connor>
<joey> neither of us can you know speak </joey>
<joey> japanese or read it too well </joey>
<joey> so we go to this place and the entire </joey>
<joey> menu </joey>
<connor> is hand written in kanji oh yeah </connor>
<connor> no but like we had to kind of try to </connor>
<connor> figure out what everything is </connor>
<connor> and so we we we go we we pick </connor>
<connor> something that's you know looks </connor>
<connor> reasonable because we </connor>
<joey> we were looking at the price and the </joey>
<joey> price was about 1300 yen which is about </joey>
<joey> 13 bucks </joey>
<joey> forgetting that in japan like ramen is </joey>
<joey> cheap </joey>
<joey> in japan it's super super cheap and we </joey>
<joey> were ordering something that was like </joey>
<joey> 13 bucks when he should have in the </joey>
<joey> middle of nowhere yeah in the middle of </joey>
<joey> nowhere should </joey>
<joey> be like seven eight hundred yeah when it </joey>
<joey> should be about seven or eight hundred </joey>
<joey> yen </joey>
<joey> um and we forgot that and i remember </joey>
<joey> we we ordered it and the waiter just </joey>
<connor> looks to us and i think he was asking </connor>
<connor> are you sure he was are you sure you </connor>
<connor> want this you want this one </connor>
<joey> two of them and we were like you should </joey>
<joey> have known that that yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah did we just want some it was like </joey>
<connor> we just won ramen yeah we want it </connor>
<connor> and so he he goes back he says something </connor>
<joey> to he says something to the </joey>
<connor> chef and the chef's eyes just goes </connor>
<connor> okay oh </connor>
<garnt> you you seriously like seriously their </garnt>
<garnt> keys out and unlock the safe </garnt>
<garnt> so what comes out is they bring us this </garnt>
<connor> like extra large </connor>
<joey> ramen and then with it was just this </joey>
<joey> extra large beef bowl </joey>
<joey> and then he brings out one of them puts </joey>
<joey> it in front of me and i just think </joey>
<connor> i've made a massive mistake i look at </connor>
<garnt> sydney sydney's just staring at this </garnt>
<garnt> ball being like that </garnt>
<joey> cindy seems like we ordered two of those </joey>
<connor> two to one each </connor>
<connor> because it would be impossible for one </connor>
<joey> of us to finish this let alone </joey>
<joey> uh uh two of us finishing both of them </joey>
<connor> yeah and </connor>
<joey> so so we bring it out and he brings he </joey>
<joey> brings it over to sydney and i don't </joey>
<connor> know what the etiquette is if you don't </connor>
<garnt> finish your food </garnt>
<garnt> but we we [ __ ] try to devour as much </garnt>
<joey> as we can we don't even get through half </joey>
<joey> of it </joey>

<joey> i would rather like like behead myself </joey>
<joey> than leave food in a japanese place i </joey>
<joey> don't know why i'm so scared of it </joey>
<connor> like one time in matsuya funny enough i </connor>

<garnt> double </garnt>
<garnt> l size sets right which is like way too </garnt>
<garnt> much fruit it's like i think it's near 4 </garnt>
<garnt> 000 calories </garnt>
<garnt> like it is like a mountain of rice and </garnt>
<joey> and i don't know how i actually did this </joey>
<connor> i should have realized </connor>
<connor> how much i paid and it came and i was </connor>
<joey> like [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> i wasn't even that hungry i was like </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] so i </joey>
<connor> i like forced this inside of me yeah </connor>
<connor> i was like when i got home i threw up </connor>
<connor> but like </connor>
<connor> in the restaurant i was like if you </connor>
<connor> could imagine like </connor>
<garnt> a dude literally like if his esophagus </garnt>
<garnt> was full i was literally like </garnt>
<connor> like trying to be so soup to like push </connor>
<connor> it down you know what i mean i was like </connor>
<joey> give me more water i need to push this </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] down with water </joey>

<joey> crying in a mazia like why is he why is </joey>
<connor> he still eating you that's just like the </connor>
<connor> most </connor>
<joey> british thing i've ever heard would </joey>
<joey> rather throw up from eating too much </joey>
<joey> food and feel the shame of leaving food </joey>
<connor> i'd rather throw up in like an alleyway </connor>
<connor> than like </connor>
<garnt> like order way too much clearly and then </garnt>
<joey> you have to give them it back and be </joey>
<joey> like throw it away yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> like yeah okay was it very unhealthy and </joey>
<joey> extremely questionable but yeah but </joey>
<joey> you know sometimes you have to make a </joey>
<joey> decision but i got the respect from </joey>
<joey> those martials but when i said </joey>
<joey> i [ __ ] meant that </joey>
<garnt> i'm like walking out like </garnt>
<connor> like my bowls stacked on top of each </connor>
<connor> other i've never eaten that much food in </connor>
<connor> my life </connor>
<connor> i tell you the one place i don't feel </connor>
<connor> shameful for leaving food on the plate </connor>
<joey> though and that's whenever i go to </joey>
<connor> america </connor>
<joey> and oh yeah just witness the food sizes </joey>
<joey> there for </joey>
<joey> everything like i had that in [ __ ] </joey>
<garnt> chicago when i was at a conal delete i'm </garnt>
<joey> sure i'm sure it's no surprise to </joey>
<garnt> americans that they're food portions </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and i'm just like i had that in </garnt>
<joey> chicago when i ordered deep dish pizza </joey>
<joey> for the first time and like </joey>
<joey> because we had never ordered it right </joey>
<joey> most of us never ordered it we were like </joey>
<joey> oh yeah it's just the same as a regular </joey>
<joey> people </joey>
<joey> so it's like what seven of us there yeah </joey>
<joey> we'll get five deep dish pizzas </joey>
<joey> it looks awful am i crazy does it look </joey>
<connor> it does it taste terrible </connor>
<joey> it tastes good but it tastes great for </joey>
<connor> the first slice yeah but one slice </connor>
<joey> is like eating a whole pizza basically </joey>
<joey> because it's it's literally just </joey>
<joey> a a whole pizza just stacked on top of </joey>
<joey> one slice </joey>
<joey> i've had like the like kind of deep ones </joey>
<joey> yeah not like </joey>
<joey> there where it looks oh no we have the </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] dude like it's like a it's </joey>
<joey> basically a basin for the sauce right </joey>
<joey> like it's </joey>
<joey> like it's a pizza lasagna that's what it </joey>
<garnt> is but like at that point it's like the </garnt>
<garnt> whole </garnt>
<garnt> the best part of the pizza is the </garnt>
<connor> synergy between </connor>
<connor> the synergy what are you talking </connor>
<connor> about as well bro the the way the bread </connor>
<connor> the cheese and the sauce is like the </connor>
<connor> perfect amount </connor>
<connor> you get the best bite if there was one </connor>
<connor> too many of those </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] pizza theologists right here i'm </connor>
<joey> telling you man like you </joey>
<joey> if there's too much sauce yeah you've </joey>
<joey> got to drink the pizza what's up with </joey>
<joey> that i like the saucy pizzas though yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah no no like the extra sauce </joey>
<joey> pizzas but i will admit that that deep </joey>
<joey> dish was like </joey>
<connor> damn like could you put a straw in it </connor>
<connor> and drink it probably </connor>
<connor> that's that's true i mean it goes in </connor>
<connor> layers like i didn't realize why so many </connor>
<connor> americans called pizza's pies yeah until </connor>
<connor> until i had a deep dish pizza and i was </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> oh this is this is a [ __ ] part this </connor>
<connor> is a pizza </connor>
<joey> is that where it came from yeah i think </joey>
<joey> so i'm not sure but </joey>
<joey> it it i was definitely eating a pie that </joey>
<connor> was </connor>
<connor> shaped like a shaped like a flavored pie </connor>
<connor> yeah exactly </connor>
<connor> pretty much exactly but i remember as </connor>
<connor> well like when i went to texas for the </connor>
<connor> first time and went to like i don't know </connor>
<garnt> what the italian restaurant was but it </garnt>
<garnt> was like a big italian restaurant and </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> portion sizes in america no </garnt>
<joey> portion sizes in america are already big </joey>
<joey> right yeah but in texas </joey>
<joey> it's like hold my beer yeah levels of </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] food right so we went to this </joey>
<joey> italian restaurant and it was uh it was </joey>
<connor> misty's birthday </connor>
<connor> yeah so we went to an italian restaurant </connor>
<connor> and we were like getting all this food </connor>
<connor> and you know normally when you go to an </connor>
<garnt> italian restaurant anywhere </garnt>
<joey> right it's like you order like one bowl </joey>
<joey> of pasta each right like whatever you </joey>
<joey> want </joey>
<joey> maybe share it around or whatever no in </joey>
<joey> in this italian restaurant it's like </joey>
<joey> one dish of pasta is like </joey>
<connor> can feed like an ethiopian family for </connor>
<connor> like a year like </connor>
<connor> it's it is an insane it's like too much </connor>
<connor> pasta yeah </connor>
<joey> and we thought that was already </joey>
<connor> ridiculous like we couldn't even finish </connor>
<joey> that [ __ ] but then </joey>
<connor> we wanted to order a cake right and we </connor>
<connor> saw oh they sell tiramisu here </connor>
<connor> and misty's like yeah i want a tiramisu </connor>
<joey> and normally when you order cake </joey>
<connor> at a restaurant it's like one slice </connor>
<joey> right yeah no they brought out the whole </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] cake it was like it was like it </connor>
<joey> was legitimately like </joey>
<joey> this big this bigger like this deep how </joey>
<joey> much was it </joey>
<connor> it's like 20 bucks what the [ __ ] it was </connor>
<connor> like i was just like </connor>
<garnt> i think we ordered wrong and they were </garnt>
<garnt> like no there's only one tiramisu on the </garnt>
<connor> menu </connor>
<connor> so it must mean this ordering okay </connor>
<connor> that's like just like </connor>
<connor> the only option of anything is a crate </connor>
<connor> of it yeah yeah i just want a bit of it </connor>
<connor> like and i'm just like and i thought </connor>
<connor> like you know oh maybe it's like a </connor>
<connor> little bit </connor>
<connor> maybe it's like a really fancy tiramisu </connor>
<garnt> right because of the price but no i </garnt>
<connor> wasn't expecting like [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> grandmother like bust into the [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> restaurant just be like here you go </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes when i'm with americans in </garnt>
<garnt> america and they're like yeah that place </garnt>
<joey> is way too expensive you get ripped off </joey>
<joey> and i'm like bro i got like </joey>
<joey> like enough to feed my whole family in </joey>
<joey> my head i'm like no you didn't get </joey>
<joey> ripped </joey>
<joey> you've been there you've been to france </joey>
<connor> bro you get like one string of pasta and </connor>
<connor> sauce and they charge you </connor>
<connor> twenty dollars for that [ __ ] would you </connor>
<joey> like six snails for 20 euros </joey>
<joey> yeah like i'm like in europe like it's </joey>
<connor> you don't get that for that much </connor>
<connor> it's rare like i mean to me yeah la was </connor>
<connor> super expensive but i always got a [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> ton of food so i was like </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah exactly it's just i remember </connor>
<joey> having to learn the hard way that you </joey>
<connor> just never order appetizers </connor>
<connor> when you go to an american restaurant </connor>
<garnt> because there's been a meal </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah because that's why you call it </garnt>
<garnt> appetizers </garnt>
<garnt> when it's like as big as the main course </garnt>
<connor> i don't get it </connor>
<connor> like in every every other part of the </connor>
<joey> world you would happen you have like a </joey>
<joey> three-course meal sometimes you know if </joey>
<garnt> you're feeling frisky in america you </garnt>
<garnt> order one thing off the menu </garnt>
<garnt> and that one thing can feed a [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> family for a week one thing i could </garnt>
<connor> never [ __ ] believe was the concept of </connor>
<connor> bottomless fries </connor>
<connor> at a fast food restaurant bottomless </connor>
<joey> everything bottomless everything like </joey>
<joey> already like free refills was like a </joey>
<joey> whoa at concept because in australia </joey>
<joey> there's no [ __ ] store yeah but </joey>
<connor> i was like oh it's free refills and </connor>
<connor> bottomless fries i'm like </connor>
<garnt> what is this what is bottomless i just </garnt>
<garnt> realized episode is like british and </garnt>
<joey> australian people discover america </joey>
<connor> yeah what is what's up with all of this </connor>
<joey> stuff because i was so used to ordering </joey>
<joey> like a large drink at like a cinema </joey>
<joey> right like in australia because </joey>
<connor> you know you could actually finish it a </connor>
<connor> large drink </connor>
<connor> in the [ __ ] american cinemas like </connor>
<connor> they might they might as well have just </connor>
<connor> given you like </connor>
<joey> four liters of coke right you just like </joey>
<joey> blew my mind i have nothing i found out </joey>
<connor> in the cinemas in america </connor>
<connor> you can refill your popcorn in some of </connor>
<connor> that yeah yeah yeah i'm like what </connor>
<connor> no why is this allowed like i was like </connor>
<connor> why did i buy the launch then if i could </connor>
<joey> just refill it yeah okay here's the </joey>
<connor> concept i never understood right like </connor>
<connor> you can order you go to any restaurant </connor>
<connor> right usually it's free refills right </connor>
<connor> yeah this is the drink machine yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> but there's small medium and large sized </connor>
<garnt> cups why would you not just get this </garnt>
<connor> why would you not just get a small cup </connor>
<connor> and then i asked aki and she's like oh </connor>
<connor> some people are just too lazy to get up </connor>
<connor> to get a refill </connor>
<connor> what and i'm just like are you it's like </connor>
<connor> it's like 20 cents extra dude like are </connor>
<garnt> you really that lazy </garnt>
<garnt> like you just be like yeah i'll pay a </garnt>
<joey> little bit extra so i can sit </joey>
<joey> for longer all americans are watching </joey>
<joey> this they're like is this uh </joey>
<joey> do you agree with the points that we're </joey>
<joey> making are you frustrated that's what </joey>
<connor> i've heard from another american </connor>
<connor> and i've heard from multiple americans i </connor>
<joey> i don't get buttered popcorn </joey>
<joey> i don't think it tastes good i don't i </joey>
<garnt> just don't eat while i go to the cinemas </garnt>
<connor> don't it's like it's like i have to eat </connor>
<connor> i maybe get like a like a packet of </connor>
<joey> candy or something or whatever but like </joey>
<joey> i never get popcorn i need popcorn when </joey>
<joey> i go to the cinema all right </joey>
<joey> i don't want to go i'm i'm the guy who </joey>
<joey> never actively goes out and buys popcorn </joey>
<joey> but when someone like offers it i'm like </joey>
<joey> okay let me just chow down </joey>
<joey> in my head it's like it's not the cinema </joey>
<joey> experience unless i get popcorn </joey>
<joey> and that's probably because they've </joey>
<joey> conditioned me to think that way right </joey>
<joey> but i mean i like i mean do you watch a </joey>
<joey> movie at home and do you have to have </joey>
<joey> popcorn </joey>
<joey> no no no so why do you have to have why </joey>
<joey> because i'm going there </joey>
<joey> it's an experience i need to have the </joey>
<connor> popcorn maybe i don't know i think i've </connor>
<connor> just been conditioned from australia </connor>
<connor> because popcorn and australian symptoms </connor>
<joey> were </joey>
<joey> stupidly expensive i was in the uk yeah </joey>
<connor> right </connor>
<joey> and it's like and as like a high school </joey>
<joey> student it's like you kind of yeah high </joey>
<joey> school i couldn't and i think because </joey>
<joey> maybe </joey>
<joey> my parents never ever wanted to buy it </joey>
<connor> yeah right because like </connor>
<connor> you'd almost be paying a [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> mortgage to get like this popcorn and </joey>
<garnt> drink </garnt>
<joey> something like 10 pounds in the uk which </joey>
<joey> is like nearly like what like 14 </joey>
<garnt> yeah or something like that which is way </garnt>
<connor> more than in america right yeah like a </connor>
<connor> large popcorn in australian cinemas </connor>
<connor> usually cost more than the actual ticket </connor>
<connor> to go watch the movie </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah i'm just like why i'll just go </connor>
<garnt> down to the [ __ ] supermarket </garnt>
<garnt> like blow and just sneak [ __ ] in and </garnt>
<garnt> someone said you know it just doesn't </garnt>
<garnt> taste as good </garnt>
<joey> i don't know man when you bring your own </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] in it tastes kind of like flat </joey>
<joey> you know i'm sorry we peasants won't </joey>
<connor> understand </connor>
<connor> you peasants wouldn't get it as a </connor>
<connor> wealthy 1800s victorian lord of the land </connor>
<garnt> i would say but no like </garnt>
<garnt> in america did you ever go to an </garnt>
<connor> american cinema yeah i did where where </connor>
<connor> they would have like </connor>
<connor> so i went to a cinema in wisconsin and </connor>
<connor> they would just have these butter </connor>
<connor> machines where you could just </connor>
<connor> basically press it i was so confused </connor>
<connor> like poor just </connor>
<connor> like as much butter as you can on the </connor>
<joey> pop we had that we in vegas we had one </joey>
<joey> that had butter but also lard </joey>
<connor> and i'm just like yeah a lot like </connor>
<joey> just pure fat yeah mainly is this a </joey>
<garnt> thing yeah </garnt>
<connor> they put never speak i see i saw it it </connor>
<connor> was in vegas and like another state </connor>
<connor> you just want to put lard on it because </connor>
<connor> it makes it like extra greasy </connor>
<connor> americans this is true what is this yes </connor>
<joey> it is is this true </joey>
<joey> no no no in i saw it in another state </joey>
<joey> too like i i don't think it's common </joey>
<connor> because i only saw it like </connor>
<connor> very very rarely yeah but it was like </connor>
<connor> some kind of like lardy like fatty </connor>
<joey> substance that was sitting next to the </joey>
<joey> butter i'm like </joey>
<joey> is butter not fat enough for you that </joey>
<joey> you need extra fat </joey>
<joey> and extra grease on your popcorn i just </joey>
<connor> i remember like i picked it up and i was </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> oh my hands are oily yeah my hands </connor>
<connor> shouldn't be oily </connor>
<connor> it was like touching the back of like an </connor>
<joey> oven right it was just gross </joey>
<joey> it was like like the deep fried oil [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> yeah what the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> i ruined my whole popcorn i put that </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] on because everyone was doing it </connor>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<connor> it must taste good and it's [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> horrible as well like you can't put that </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] on your lap because then the grease </joey>
<connor> starts to like seep through the bottom </connor>
<connor> of the bottle </connor>
<connor> okay well you're like well like this </connor>
<connor> well while we're ranting about american </connor>
<connor> things </connor>

<garnt> about america and then there's the spray </garnt>
<garnt> cheese </garnt>
<connor> that americans apparently love i i </connor>
<joey> always thought the spray cheese [ __ ] was </joey>
<joey> just like [ __ ] you'd see in the movies </joey>
<joey> and then i went to a walmart for the </joey>
<joey> first time and i saw it i'm like it </joey>
<connor> can't be but they're always like they're </connor>
<connor> always like no it tastes amazing on </connor>
<connor> cheez-its that's what they always say </connor>
<joey> yeah it should never be in a can yeah or </joey>
<joey> when they i remember </joey>
<connor> outside of staying at someone's house in </connor>
<connor> america and they were like do you want a </connor>
<connor> grilled cheese </connor>

<joey> so good yeah like i feel like i'm dying </joey>

<joey> like the food's amazing everyone's so </joey>
<joey> kind </joey>
<joey> the hotels are so spacious in london you </joey>
<joey> pay like 200 </joey>
<joey> for like a closet yeah if you're lucky </joey>
<joey> if you're if you're lucky </joey>
<joey> you might have your own toilet like the </joey>
<joey> hotel game in england is just weak </joey>
<connor> it's the shittest thing on earth it's </connor>
<connor> like the business hotels here right it's </connor>
<connor> like would you like a bed and a hallway </connor>
<connor> 200 please if you want a semi-competent </connor>
<connor> hotel in london you've got to pay like </connor>
<joey> 300 pounds or maybe 200 pounds if you </joey>
<connor> get lucky and find a good one but in </connor>
<joey> america </joey>
<joey> every single hotel i've been to except </joey>
<joey> i've never been to a motel so i don't </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] with those </joey>
<joey> yeah because that's why people die in </joey>
<joey> films </joey>
<connor> i've had an amazing hotel experience </connor>
<connor> that's why fugitives like hide out right </connor>
<joey> yeah everything every single thing </joey>
<joey> that's bad happens near a motel so i've </joey>
<joey> just </joey>
<connor> my brain has been taught don't go to a </connor>
<joey> motel calling a motel a hotel is the </joey>
<joey> equivalent of calling mcdonald's a </joey>
<joey> restaurant right it's like </joey>
<joey> it's like no it's not i remember i was </joey>
<connor> gonna i was gonna get a motel for like </connor>
<connor> my first day x and then the reviews were </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> uh someone was shot outside my room and </connor>
<connor> there was there was cockroaches </connor>
<connor> uh two stars i'm like two stars i'm like </connor>
<connor> how many people had to die for to be one </connor>
<connor> star </connor>
<joey> like that was like the one the only </joey>
<joey> reason why it's a two star is because </joey>
<connor> i didn't die yeah cockroaches didn't eat </connor>
<connor> me alive in my sleep so </connor>
<connor> because i just feel like parts of l.a </connor>
<connor> just feel like another world </connor>
<joey> yeah it is especially someone somewhere </joey>
<garnt> downtown l.a i remember the first </garnt>
<garnt> morning i woke up in like a hotel in l.a </garnt>

<garnt> walk away now yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and so like he grabs something from his </garnt>

<joey> jesus christ cause i'm like [ __ ] i don't </joey>
<connor> know what this guy's gonna do </connor>
<joey> like i'm scared as [ __ ] i don't know </joey>

<garnt> okay and then i thought he was gonna </garnt>
<garnt> like hit me or something </garnt>
<joey> if i see someone reaching for that </joey>
<joey> pocket like that i'd do exactly </joey>
<joey> like he didn't swing at me or anything </joey>
<joey> but he was going for his pocket and i'm </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<garnt> i literally [ __ ] sprinted away i like </garnt>
<connor> ran around the corner </connor>
<connor> in my hotel i'm like yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah and like to put this in perspective </connor>
<garnt> like again our airbnb was like five </garnt>
<garnt> minutes away from </garnt>
<garnt> the intercontinental yeah or something </garnt>
<garnt> like some like very famous hotel </garnt>
<garnt> shade yeah so you just don't get </garnt>
<joey> something like this here </joey>
<joey> or like in europe so we we are just not </joey>
<joey> used to this that you have to </joey>
<connor> literally take you literally drive five </connor>
<connor> minutes down the road not even five </connor>
<joey> minutes down the road because it's a </joey>
<joey> five minute walk yeah just because this </joey>
<joey> this is the [ __ ] that happens </joey>
<connor> that can happen in between yeah i </connor>
<connor> learned my lesson just at that time just </connor>
<joey> probably not walking around </joey>
<joey> yeah don't intervene if you're not </joey>
<joey> willing to push someone over i guess </joey>
<joey> i don't really know i didn't feel great </joey>
<joey> about pushing him over because he was </joey>
<connor> way smaller than me </connor>
<connor> yeah but like i don't know i mean but if </connor>
<connor> you never know if he was going to like </connor>
<connor> just pull out a gun </connor>
<connor> the guy clearly was on something yeah he </connor>
<connor> was </connor>
<connor> out of it like spawning nonsense like he </connor>
<connor> wasn't talking english like i mean he </connor>
<connor> was trying to but </connor>
<connor> you know i mean i don't know what he was </connor>
<connor> on but it was scary it's terrifying yeah </connor>
<connor> anyway is there anything you want to </connor>
