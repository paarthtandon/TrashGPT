<garnt> spicy I still don't know what the [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> this spicy pea is this is a thing I </joey>
<joey> experienced it first time after the </joey>
<joey> charity live stream when I had that </joey>
<connor> ghost pepper when you have something </connor>
<joey> that is of ridiculous just yeah just </joey>
<connor> astronomical spiciness for some people </connor>

<joey> first P that's every subsequently </joey>
<joey> immediately after eating it yeah I don't </joey>

<garnt> experts spice experts want to explain </garnt>
<garnt> you wanna you wanna like uh </garnt>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> what if if he drank spicy pea would it </joey>
<joey> actually be spicy oh that's the real </joey>
<garnt> that's the real question I can't do it </garnt>
<joey> yeah I don't know I've never experienced </joey>
<joey> ycp in my life yeah that's because </joey>
<joey> you're Thai are you sure you don't have </joey>
<joey> like I think your shoes sounds like a </joey>
<connor> painful thing no I'm fine I mean of </connor>
<connor> course it's painful but like what is it </connor>
<garnt> okay get it getting deep </garnt>
<garnt> I I don't really understand how it works </garnt>
<garnt> it just does the thing yeah spicy spicy </garnt>
<garnt> food weird but uh guess you know you </garnt>
<garnt> know what I found weird recently now </garnt>
<garnt> that like I guess the country's opening </garnt>
<garnt> back up and we've complained for so many </garnt>
<connor> backups oh well opening back up by the </connor>
<connor> time this episode's out it should be it </connor>
<garnt> should be kind of completely open where </garnt>
<connor> you don't even need to go on like one of </connor>
<connor> the North Korean tour guides </connor>
<connor> um you don't need a covert test </connor>
<connor> um and you can just come I'm not sure if </connor>
<connor> it'll be open for tourists by the time </connor>
<connor> this comes up but right now more people </connor>
<connor> that we know are coming in the country </connor>
<joey> yeah like recently we've obviously had </joey>
<joey> the safety third crew come on as you </joey>
<joey> know we've had a few of their members on </joey>
<joey> our podcast uh Kevin's finally being </joey>
<joey> gonna be able to come back as well yeah </joey>
<joey> everybody arrives like what is it like </joey>
<joey> two days before we all have to leave </joey>
<joey> exactly and I saw like a few more people </joey>
<joey> on Twitter that said oh finally you know </joey>
<joey> just landed in Japan or coming to Japan </joey>
<joey> yeah I'm like this is so [ __ ] weird </joey>
<joey> we've complained about this so long and </joey>
<connor> now people are actually coming in and </connor>
<connor> now I'm just like damn I don't really I </connor>
<garnt> don't really have the time to show </garnt>
<connor> people around anymore oh [ __ ] I realized </connor>
<connor> I offered too many people yeah of course </connor>
<joey> I'll show you around me yeah and then </joey>
<joey> they get here and I'm like actually you </joey>
<joey> know gone was making me record this </joey>
<connor> trash taste </connor>
<joey> why is God in the Instagram he's a </joey>
<joey> leader but like man's throwing you under </joey>
<connor> the bus I've been playing trash </connor>
<joey> I've just been blaming trash teeth </joey>
<garnt> because I'm like well it's it's like the </garnt>
<joey> boys you know I gotta prioritize work </joey>
<garnt> sorry guys you know </garnt>
<garnt> that's the greatest that's the great </garnt>
<garnt> thing about trash taste because if if it </garnt>
<garnt> was just like your own channel then it's </garnt>
<connor> on you you know you choose your own </connor>
<connor> schedule we're trash teeth we've got a </connor>
<connor> team I don't want to let the boys down </connor>
<joey> you know and they're like why don't you </joey>
<connor> want the rest of the boys I'm like oh </connor>
<connor> you know they're busy as well </connor>
<connor> yeah but uh yeah took the uh </connor>
<connor> safety third people out last weekend and </connor>
<connor> do you know what I realized </connor>
<connor> um after people have started coming in </connor>
<garnt> where you're not gonna you're not gonna </garnt>
<garnt> experience this Joey because you already </garnt>
<garnt> are you already can speak Japanese but </garnt>
<garnt> because people are starting to come in </garnt>
<garnt> they everyone assumes that you're only </garnt>
<joey> hunger Josie now because you've lived </joey>
<joey> here no but I mean I you speak a little </joey>
<joey> bit that sounds like a YouTuber like he </joey>
<joey> was doing a lot of speaking for me it </joey>
<connor> was I was doing a lot of asking a bunch </connor>
<connor> of questions when Emily first came here </connor>
<connor> as well I was talking a lot for her yeah </connor>
<connor> and on the first few days and she's like </connor>
<connor> she's like well you're so good at this </connor>
<joey> I'm like no no </joey>
<joey> say one thing yeah I'm guessing like I I </joey>
<joey> because I'm having like conversations </joey>
<joey> but obviously any conversation at all </joey>
<joey> when you don't speak the language seems </joey>
<joey> like nuts yeah yeah but when you're you </joey>
<connor> know when you when you're with someone </connor>
<connor> who understands it you're like bro why </connor>
<joey> are you doing like a two-year-old so </joey>
<joey> what you're telling me is that it was </joey>
<joey> the first time you actually felt like </joey>
<joey> you had to be the token translator yeah </joey>
<garnt> yeah because because it was the first </garnt>
<connor> time </connor>
<connor> you for the menus that are handwritten </connor>
<garnt> can't you yeah but like the problem is </garnt>
<joey> Joey I'm nowhere near even close to your </joey>
<connor> level but people are assuming that I am </connor>
<connor> your level so people so people people </connor>
<connor> like hanging out with them obviously </connor>
<garnt> like first thing you do you go to the </garnt>
<garnt> taxi you tell them where to go and </garnt>
<garnt> people are like yo what the [ __ ] your </garnt>
<joey> Japanese is so good and I'm like I </joey>
<garnt> literally just said please stop here sir </garnt>
<joey> here is okay please stop here yeah and </joey>
<joey> and then they get like a lot of people </joey>
<joey> ask me oh how do you say this in </joey>
<joey> Japanese how'd you say that in Japanese </joey>
<joey> and like some of the things I do know </joey>
<joey> but I know for a fact that there there </joey>
<joey> is like a Japanese way to say it and I'm </joey>
<joey> doing like the most Brute Force direct </joey>
<joey> translation I can think of of my like </joey>
<joey> baby Japanese yeah do you know what it </joey>
<joey> is though that I have found it's it's </joey>
<joey> not about like whether you have like an </joey>
<garnt> extensive vocab or anything like that </garnt>
<garnt> it's I feel like confidence oh yeah it </garnt>
<garnt> shows such a long way no because like if </garnt>
<joey> you confidently without like even a </joey>
<joey> shadow of a doubt walk up to a Japanese </joey>
<joey> person and just start speaking in the </joey>
<joey> most broken ass Japanese ever like oh me </joey>
<garnt> hungry food like but if you say it with </garnt>
<joey> absolute confidence like like a game </joey>
<joey> face and people see that they're just </joey>
<joey> like damn </joey>
<connor> yeah I had that happen yeah yeah that </connor>
<joey> was not good but it but it's bad right </joey>
<joey> because like sure it might look cool to </joey>
<joey> your Foreigner friends who don't know a </joey>
<joey> word of Japanese but then that Japanese </joey>
<joey> person will probably also to feel the </joey>
<joey> same way being like Oh damn this guy's </joey>
<joey> good at Japanese I'm just going to start </joey>
<joey> speaking at a normal pace and then the </joey>
<joey> moment they reciprocate to that you're </joey>
<garnt> just like I'm like you know like because </garnt>
<joey> being living in Japan you have certain </joey>
<garnt> scripts for certain places yeah you've </garnt>
<joey> heard it a million times it's like </joey>
<joey> playing a visual novel I wouldn't know </joey>
<garnt> how that feels but I'm actually just </garnt>
<joey> like you played like a million times you </joey>
<joey> know all the dialogue options and The </joey>
<garnt> Roots yeah exactly well that's kind of </garnt>
<joey> like learning languages in general you </joey>
<joey> know that's that's it's just picking up </joey>
<joey> patterns yeah you pick up patterns </joey>
<joey> um and if something goes out of that </joey>
<joey> pattern then you're kind of like a dear </joey>
<joey> panic because here's the thing right </joey>
<joey> normally you know when you're by </joey>
<joey> yourself you know sometimes you're just </joey>
<joey> not in the mood to go challenge yourself </joey>
<joey> to go out of your comfort zone or </joey>
<joey> something but when you're showing people </joey>
<garnt> around Japan you got that pressure on of </garnt>
<garnt> course because I look around I'm like </garnt>
<garnt> surely there's someone morning hunger </garnt>
<garnt> Jersey than me no [ __ ] I'm the hunger </garnt>
<garnt> Josie guy here [ __ ] it's me that's got </garnt>
<joey> to sort everything out okay I think it's </joey>
<joey> also worse when you're the one who like </joey>
<joey> reluctantly is like yeah I'll show you </joey>
<joey> guys around right and so you're already </joey>
<joey> suiting that like yeah yeah confidence </joey>
<joey> and then when you're actually in the </joey>
<joey> spot you're like [ __ ] I have to show </joey>
<joey> them around </joey>
<garnt> I don't know what to do so so one thing </garnt>
<garnt> they were all looking for a place to eat </garnt>
<garnt> so um </garnt>
<garnt> where did you take them uh I took them </garnt>
<garnt> to an or you can eat uh Yakiniku place </garnt>
<joey> okay yeah yeah because what I've </joey>
<garnt> realized I asked Maylin where I should </garnt>
<joey> take them and she gave me a bunch of </joey>
<joey> like recommendations and I was just like </joey>
<garnt> I don't think this would be suitable for </garnt>
<connor> a group of like 12. yeah right </connor>
<connor> everything becomes like 500 times harder </connor>
<connor> when you have more than six people in </connor>
<joey> Japan yeah oh easily yeah </joey>
<joey> you either have to go an all-you-can-eat </joey>
<joey> place or an Izakaya yeah it's like no </joey>
<garnt> other choice yeah and I was just like </garnt>
<garnt> life hack you were cheering someone </garnt>
<garnt> around Japan they've never been to Japan </garnt>
<garnt> for if they've been here once go to an </garnt>
<garnt> all you can eat place and that will </garnt>
<connor> impress them yeah you know just it's so </connor>
<connor> it's so easy yeah </connor>
<joey> Japanese hot pot or you can eat and </joey>
<joey> that's like it's insane I've never even </joey>
<joey> been there before have you not no bro </joey>
<joey> it's so good there's like a there's like </joey>
<joey> a billion of them in Shinjuku yeah I was </joey>
<joey> impressed dude it's nuts it's like 40 </joey>
<joey> bucks no it's not even 40 bucks 40 four </joey>
<joey> thousand yen to like 30 something bucks </joey>
<joey> yeah you can and then you get all you </joey>
<joey> can eat as much food as you want and </joey>
<joey> then all you want all you can drink for </joey>
<garnt> two hours it's like eight dollars or </garnt>
<joey> something or like ten bucks </joey>
<garnt> it's actually just like what are we </garnt>
<garnt> doing exactly how are these places </garnt>
<joey> making money I I I I that's because they </joey>
<joey> don't know that's because they don't you </joey>
<connor> know they're not used to foreigners I </connor>
<connor> think because the big thing sound do </connor>
<connor> music exactly because the big thing I've </connor>
<garnt> noticed especially after taking more </garnt>
<garnt> people out to all you can eat places is </garnt>
<connor> that when Japanese people here all you </connor>
<garnt> can eat it's all you want to eat when </garnt>
<connor> you hear like an America when you change </connor>
<connor> it to all you can eat yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah yeah what do you take an </garnt>
<garnt> American or a British person or most </garnt>
<garnt> people in the west to an all you can eat </garnt>
<garnt> place it is a challenge right it is not </garnt>
<garnt> a all you want or you're comfortable to </garnt>
<garnt> eat it is how much can my stomach expand </garnt>
<garnt> before like how how quickly can I </garnt>
<garnt> bankrupt this place to make them feel </garnt>
<garnt> like they made them the biggest mistake </garnt>
<garnt> of their life to make something called </garnt>
<joey> all you can eat that is true actually </joey>
<connor> like I've been to enough Buffets in </connor>
<garnt> Vegas now to know that like seeing like </garnt>
<connor> seeing Americans in a buffet is like you </connor>
<connor> think like the apocalypse is coming </connor>
<joey> where they're just like I was like are </joey>
<joey> you about to fast for three days like </joey>
<connor> why are you eating so much I don't even </connor>
<joey> enjoy it like yeah I just I get to a </joey>
<connor> point where I'm like full and I'll just </connor>
<connor> push like 30 beyond that yeah just </connor>
<connor> because I'm like well </connor>
<connor> I may as well and it's like but yeah no </connor>
<connor> other situation would I ever order this </connor>
<connor> much for you no I would I would have cut </connor>
<garnt> it off like years ago yeah man so so </garnt>
<garnt> like we went to this all week in a </garnt>
<garnt> yakaniki place and immediately we sit we </garnt>
<garnt> sit down and I haven't I haven't like </garnt>
<garnt> had this mindset in a while but </garnt>
<garnt> immediately they start asking me </garnt>
<garnt> questions right because they start </garnt>
<connor> asking me what the rules of the game are </connor>
<garnt> you know like okay hypothetically if we </garnt>
<connor> over order by hypothetically </connor>
<connor> hypothetically speaking if we over order </connor>
<connor> by four plates of food will they charge </connor>
<connor> us for it and I'm like I I don't I don't </connor>
<connor> really know because that's never really </connor>
<connor> happens but I mean I'm sure you could </connor>
<connor> play The Foreigner card and so they're </connor>
<connor> like great that's all we need to know </connor>
<connor> they order like a [ __ ] ton of food and </connor>
<connor> like here's the thing normally this all </connor>
<connor> you can eat Yakiniku plays they have </connor>
<connor> like it's like real coals right so </connor>
<connor> normally uh this restaurant have placed </connor>
<connor> enough coals in this barbecue to last </connor>
<connor> you for about the two hours right </connor>
<connor> normally it's it's like perfectly timed </connor>
<connor> so you have enough time to eat the food </connor>
<connor> and then by the time the two hour ends </connor>
<connor> the calls we kind of died out well </connor>
<connor> that'll be fine because you're like </connor>
<connor> you'll be like oh I'll take like one </connor>
<connor> more plate or something like that yeah </connor>
<connor> not not with these guys so we we get to </connor>
<garnt> like an hour and a half in and the </garnt>
<garnt> waiter comes over and it's just like oh </garnt>
<garnt> last order's in about like five ten </garnt>
<garnt> minutes would you like to order anything </garnt>
<joey> else </joey>
<joey> um </joey>
<joey> like it was like me Sydney uh Liberty </joey>
<joey> who's a Content producer you know that </joey>
<joey> there's like you know the more Japanese </joey>
<joey> Centric table that have that you have </joey>
<joey> that Common Sense acclimated with the </joey>
<joey> culture and then there's the boys on the </joey>
<joey> other side the safety third boys they </joey>
<joey> hear the last orders coming in and </joey>
<garnt> they're they're like um can we order </garnt>
<garnt> like 10 more plates and also can we </garnt>
<garnt> change the coals and I think it would it </garnt>
<garnt> wasn't ordering the 10 more plates yeah </garnt>
<connor> it was the request to change the calls </connor>
<connor> right right because I don't like I don't </connor>
<connor> think in the history of this </connor>
<connor> establishment anyone's asked to change </connor>
<connor> the calls 30 minutes before last orders </connor>
<connor> are coming in they're like the wage is </connor>
<connor> like what you you want me to you want me </connor>
<connor> to change the calls what what I I don't </connor>
<connor> understand why don't you why do you want </connor>
<garnt> to change the calls and so there's </garnt>
<garnt> there's us there's us the Japanese </garnt>
<garnt> residence on one side just being like </garnt>
<garnt> I'm so full I'm so full and then there's </garnt>
<garnt> the American boys on the other side 15 </garnt>
<garnt> minutes in and they're getting like 10 </garnt>
<garnt> more plates of meat I'm like how the F </garnt>
<joey> how are you doing this what the [ __ ] so </joey>
<joey> did they did they even like put a dent </joey>
<garnt> in that or they [ __ ] finished it they </garnt>
<garnt> it like like I said it was a challenge </garnt>
<garnt> it wasn't he like it was it was they </garnt>
<garnt> wanted to make a statement right they </garnt>
<garnt> wanted to make a statement that this </garnt>
<connor> establishment was a [ __ ] idiot right </connor>
<connor> they love breaking news yeah yeah </connor>
<joey> they're like if I'm not bankrupting this </joey>
<joey> place then uh then I've done something </joey>
<joey> wrong no wonder all you can eat places </joey>
<connor> don't [ __ ] last in the US yeah I feel </connor>
<joey> like that's a mindset thing that we get </joey>
<joey> like born into like I I the first time I </joey>
<joey> went to all you can eat in Japan I I </joey>
<joey> know you can drink I'm like I gotta I </joey>
<joey> gotta I'm taking this I'm taking the </joey>
<joey> weights off yeah I'm going in yeah and I </joey>
<joey> don't know why like why do I immediately </joey>
<joey> hear a reasonably priced buffet and I'm </joey>
<connor> like instead of making this into a </connor>
<connor> normal meal where I'm probably gonna get </connor>
<connor> my money's worth anyway I'm just gonna </connor>
<connor> try and ruin myself and ruin this such a </connor>
<joey> weird psychology isn't it because it's </joey>
<joey> like there's no pressure it's not like </joey>
<garnt> you're losing money yeah I think also </garnt>
<joey> like a big thing is just when you're </joey>
<connor> obviously they're traveling around when </connor>
<connor> you're just in Holiday mode oh the rules </connor>
<connor> you know holiday mode the rules are off </connor>
<connor> you know you're not trying to look after </connor>
<joey> you I'm sure it will be the opposite if </joey>
<connor> we went to the US yo actually there's </connor>
<connor> Buffets in Vegas look insane I've heard </connor>
<connor> them Fox yeah they're like like Gourmet </connor>
<connor> buffets or something yeah only America </connor>
<connor> would they want to bastardize food there </connor>
<garnt> man so they're like let's do it yeah </garnt>
<garnt> like when we went to LA I went to so </garnt>
<connor> many [ __ ] all you can eat Korean </connor>
<garnt> barbecues because that's the one [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> thing one [ __ ] thing I miss about La </connor>
<connor> which is the Korean barbecue there is </connor>
<connor> amazing </connor>
<connor> um and I you know like luckily or </connor>
<garnt> unluckily the rules are a bit more </garnt>
<garnt> strict there because they have a bit </garnt>
<garnt> more people who are let's say over order </garnt>
<connor> so they're like you have to you'd have </connor>
<connor> to have those rules yeah if you if you </connor>
<garnt> they're like if you order like one play </garnt>
<joey> over we're gonna charge you I've noticed </joey>
<joey> that actually not a lot of Japanese I </joey>
<joey> think I've been to like maybe one place </joey>
<joey> where they like charge you if you don't </joey>
<joey> finish your food that you order extra </joey>
<joey> off but like for the most part yeah I </joey>
<joey> think Japanese people are more sensible </joey>
<joey> and being like I'll order what I can eat </joey>
<connor> yeah a lot of places where I'll probably </connor>
<connor> just like if you're like one plate left </connor>
<joey> over they're like ah all right yeah all </joey>
<joey> right but obviously you know I'm just </joey>
<connor> thinking like I'm just thinking of the </connor>
<connor> situation that both that rule yeah you </connor>
<connor> know like what what what person went to </connor>
<connor> like an all-you-can-eat Korean barbecue </connor>
<connor> it's just like oh yeah so you kind of </connor>
<connor> just left like 40 kilograms of meat on </connor>
<joey> and I remember like it's normally right </joey>
<garnt> obviously Jackie niku writes poles and </garnt>
<joey> stuff so there's a lot of smoke yes yeah </joey>
<connor> um we go there at like five o'clock at </connor>
<connor> just open middle of nowhere inside to </connor>
<connor> Martin legit middle of nowhere right um </connor>
<connor> and we go in and this is pretty big </connor>
<connor> restaurant for where what I thought was </connor>
<joey> a big ration for where it was so we walk </joey>
<joey> in </joey>
<joey> and the staff are immediately like whoa </joey>
<joey> foreign </joey>
<joey> cook the food yep and I noticed that </joey>
<joey> like the fan isn't on to like suck out </joey>
<joey> all the the smoke yeah yeah and so I'm </joey>
<joey> like I'm like oh I'm like should we ask </joey>
<connor> him Chris to turn it on it's like it's </connor>
<connor> kind of a lot of smoke yeah and the guy </connor>
<connor> comes over and we're like hey um could </connor>
<connor> you could you could you turn the fan on </connor>
<connor> and he's like yeah of course just walks </connor>
<connor> away </connor>
<joey> and then and then I it starts to kind of </joey>
<connor> build up yeah and I suddenly look around </connor>

<joey> big motivator for wanting to learn more </joey>
<connor> Japanese now is now having people come </connor>
<joey> in and being like oh you got to be the </joey>
<connor> hunger Josie person now because </connor>
<connor> um same thing happened to me actually </connor>
<garnt> where where we have we had this uh they </garnt>
<garnt> were looking for a place to eat you know </garnt>
<garnt> beforehand and it's hard to find a place </garnt>
<connor> for 12 people and so 12 yeah 12. there's </connor>
<connor> 12 years yeah there was 12 of us right I </connor>
<joey> would have I literally told a bunch of </joey>
<joey> people I was like can we split this up </joey>
<joey> like yeah this is not happening like </joey>
<joey> we're not getting in anywhere we have </joey>
<joey> two unless you don't book ahead of time </joey>
<garnt> you did one day yeah yeah so that's </garnt>
<garnt> that's the thing that's why I chose um I </garnt>
<connor> forgot the I I forgot the name of the </connor>
<connor> place but the yakaniki place I chose was </connor>
<connor> a brand you know it was a chain </connor>
<connor> it's uh there's only a few Q yeah </connor>
<connor> not Georgian I I forgot what it was but </connor>
<connor> I remember phoning up </connor>
<connor> I remember finding one of the branches </connor>
<connor> and I was phoning up and asking if they </connor>
<connor> had space for 12. </connor>
<connor> um and they did you know it was it was </connor>
<connor> it was all good you know I was like no </connor>
<connor> way as he did yeah yeah they did they </connor>
<connor> did I was like I was like confidently I </connor>
<connor> I can I can [ __ ] do this all of my </connor>
<connor> years in Japan have built up to this </connor>
<connor> moment I can do this I like it's I've </connor>
<connor> I've booked tables before I've like I'm </connor>
<connor> very satisfying yeah yeah very satisfied </connor>
<connor> booking tables </connor>
<garnt> um I kind of know the script and I kind </garnt>
<garnt> of know how to go off scripted just in </garnt>
<garnt> case so I asked if they have space for </garnt>
<garnt> 12. they go great I ask if we can split </garnt>
<garnt> into tables just in case because it's a </garnt>
<garnt> big group and they're like that's that's </garnt>
<garnt> no problem at all </garnt>
<garnt> um I asked for the time I asked for 6 30 </garnt>
<joey> and uh they said they don't have a space </joey>
<joey> for 6 30. uh can you do space at 8 30 </joey>
<joey> and I'm like sure that's okay </joey>
<joey> um and then they said something that I </joey>
<connor> didn't understand and I was like [ __ ] I </connor>
<joey> was like what's so important [ __ ] I was </joey>
<joey> doing doing so well and you know you </joey>
<joey> know how you know how when how does the </joey>
<joey> game of Pluto began </joey>
<joey> thus the Sherlock game begins right so </joey>
<joey> your kids here's here's what it's like </joey>
<joey> being not exactly you know learning a </joey>
<joey> language and knowing some words for not </joey>
<joey> knowing the entire context of what's </joey>
<joey> being said you recognize some words and </joey>
<joey> within that you try to infer what </joey>
<joey> they're trying to say now normally this </joey>
<joey> is much easier when you're in person </joey>
<connor> because you've got you know body </connor>
<connor> language you've got hand signals you've </connor>
<connor> got more context clues it's ten times </connor>
<connor> harder on the phone right uh because </connor>
<connor> you've got you got nothing but just you </connor>
<connor> know your listening skills </connor>
<connor> and so what I heard was I heard uh can I </connor>
<connor> confirm and I and uh and she said which </connor>
<connor> one and then something I was like [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> what is what is she trying to confirm </connor>
<connor> with me and I was just like I remember </connor>
<connor> browsing through their menu and I was </connor>
<connor> and they had like different tiers for </connor>
<connor> whichever menu you wanted this or you </connor>
<connor> need to be yeah so I was like great it </connor>
<connor> must be that one and I was like can I </connor>
<connor> have the menu That's the middles the </connor>
<connor> middle uh the middle menu please </connor>
<connor> and she was like and [ __ ] I heard a PO I </connor>
<connor> heard a pause </connor>
<connor> and I was like oh no </connor>
<joey> oh no not Instagram I was like I have </joey>
<joey> chosen the wrong dialogue I'm correct I </joey>
<joey> have chosen the wrong dialogue option </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] and she was like uh no no I and she </joey>
<joey> she tries and then here's where like </joey>
<joey> goes here's like if I'd chosen the right </joey>
<joey> dialogue option it's like great [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> great genius no hunger josu hello yeah I </joey>
<joey> choose the wrong dialogue option I've </joey>
<joey> opened up another dialogue tree with </joey>
<joey> even more complex dialogue options and </joey>
<joey> I've just gotten myself into a [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> mess you've opened up the explanation </connor>
<connor> you found the Elden ring boss </connor>
<joey> basically so she says uh no no no no </joey>
<joey> um just uh and and then she she starts </joey>
<connor> going into even more complex like goes </connor>
<joey> into detail it goes into detail about it </joey>
<connor> and I just like I understand even less </connor>
<garnt> and so my Panic brain just goes yes </garnt>
<connor> in English no no I go hey I should have </connor>
<connor> started with the high yeah yeah that's </connor>
<connor> just like my default that's everything </connor>
<connor> that's that's my default dialogue and </connor>
<connor> that works I would say 80 it works a </connor>
<connor> shocking amount yeah this was one of the </connor>
<connor> times where it didn't work and she was </connor>
<connor> like uh </connor>
<connor> [Music] </connor>
<connor> goes off away for a minute and I'm like </connor>
<garnt> oh [ __ ] what did I just say yes to what </garnt>
<joey> did I just say yes to like would you </joey>
<connor> like to buy shares in our company </connor>
<connor> you want to get a mortgage </connor>
<garnt> I'm sorry she goes off for five for five </garnt>
<garnt> minutes and then she comes back and she </garnt>
<garnt> starts she starts like spewing me the </garnt>
<garnt> entire [ __ ] gospel she starts getting </garnt>
<garnt> to me like the entire Holy Bible and </garnt>
<garnt> then she ends is that okay and I'm like </garnt>
<garnt> no yes and then and then and then and </garnt>
<garnt> then she was like okay so just to </garnt>
<garnt> confirm you just agree to all of these </garnt>
<garnt> things </garnt>
<garnt> can I can I put you down and I'm like </garnt>
<garnt> yes and then and then she goes and then </garnt>
<garnt> I'm gonna go and then I go and then she </garnt>
<garnt> goes great </garnt>
<garnt> hangs up the phone the first thing I </garnt>
<garnt> immediately do is uh hit up our intern </garnt>
<garnt> Kai and just be like Kai can you find up </garnt>
<garnt> this place and just confirm that I </garnt>
<garnt> actually made a [ __ ] booking </garnt>
<garnt> and then I find out what she was trying </garnt>
<garnt> to confirm with me was I thought by </garnt>
<garnt> phoning this specific number yeah that </garnt>
<garnt> it would go straight to the restaurant </garnt>
<garnt> right but because it was a branch she </garnt>
<garnt> was trying to confirm which branch </garnt>
<joey> which I've I've never been asked I've </joey>
<joey> never heard that before I've never been </joey>
<joey> awesome weird as [ __ ] yeah I've never </joey>
<joey> been asked that question before did you </joey>
<joey> phone up like the company or like </joey>
<joey> I I don't know I just phoned up the uh </joey>
<joey> because normally if you go on Google </joey>
<garnt> Maps and you yeah yeah the location and </garnt>
<garnt> the number is specifically for the </garnt>
<garnt> building yeah yeah exactly yeah I've </garnt>
<joey> never heard of that before yeah </joey>
<garnt> I was just like guys I think I [ __ ] up </garnt>
<joey> but I don't want to look bad in front of </joey>
<garnt> my friends uh can you guys save me </garnt>
<joey> please he's like you guys sleep that's </joey>
<connor> why I like it when the Google Maps has </connor>
<connor> the reservation option in Japan that's </connor>
<garnt> oh yeah I love this so much no no like </garnt>
<connor> it like this Branch had a reservation </connor>
<connor> option but not for more than six people </connor>
<connor> which is why which is why like I knew </connor>
<joey> this one phone call was gonna push my </joey>
<joey> language ability level yeah to to its </joey>
<joey> limit at the time and you know I was </joey>
<joey> doing I was there so well I was this </joey>
<connor> close I was this one yeah </connor>
<joey> stall I've never heard of that that's </joey>
<joey> like doing a boss battle and then you </joey>
<joey> think you've beaten them and then the </joey>
<joey> phase two starts yeah he's like oh [ __ ] </joey>
<garnt> oh [ __ ] there's more </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] oh yeah see I I'm I'm like kind of </joey>
<joey> in a sense I'm kind of jealous though </joey>
<connor> because I haven't experienced that yet </connor>
<connor> because I'm not I'm I'm not good nor bad </connor>
<joey> enough at a current language where I can </joey>
<connor> try to attempt to do certain things yeah </connor>
<connor> it's either I know the language or I </connor>
<joey> know nothing about the language yeah so </joey>
<joey> I want to get to a point where I'm kind </joey>
<joey> of like in the Middle where you guys are </joey>
<garnt> where it's like you're on the cusp of </garnt>
<garnt> going from I'm learning the language to </garnt>
<garnt> I can speak it conversationally yeah so </garnt>
<joey> it's like I don't know I've always </joey>
<garnt> wanted to learn a third language I mean </garnt>
<garnt> I mean like I've got like the Joey </garnt>
<connor> experience once in my life where I was </connor>
<garnt> able to like yeah the Joey experience </garnt>

<garnt> was the longest queue of this entire </garnt>
<connor> Festival right right it was even a </connor>
<connor> festival at that point or is it a </connor>
<connor> glorified </connor>
<garnt> Street show </garnt>
<garnt> I mean it kind of was just okay I went </garnt>
<joey> to like the Compton of summer festivals </joey>
<garnt> basically basically we were me and like </garnt>
<garnt> all of us are starting there we spend </garnt>
<connor> more time waiting for our yukatas than </connor>
<connor> it would have taken to go through </connor>
<connor> everything in this [ __ ] Festival </connor>
<connor> right this this festival and we were </connor>
<connor> just waiting in line to get our like </connor>
<connor> yakisoba and as we're waiting in this </connor>
<connor> line because there was like gated off </connor>
<connor> and we see like railway tracks and every </connor>
<garnt> like 10 10 minutes of the show uh 10 </garnt>
<garnt> minutes or so we'd have this like really </garnt>
<garnt> you know it wasn't even like atmospheric </garnt>
<garnt> right because every 10 minutes or so </garnt>
<garnt> you'd have the train going </garnt>
<joey> laughs </joey>
<garnt> I know and I was just like I got [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> dressed up for this so so why did you go </connor>
<garnt> to this one another good one uh because </garnt>
<garnt> apparently like all the good ones are </garnt>
<garnt> way like you have to travel like an hour </garnt>
<joey> or two outside of the city yeah </joey>
<connor> yeah I saw a big one not too far from </connor>
<connor> where I live that was decently way </connor>
<joey> bigger than the one you guys sent </joey>
<joey> there's a couple of big ones I've been </joey>
<connor> to as well but the problem is is that </connor>
<joey> it's either way too incredibly packed </joey>
<connor> yeah or especially during like the </connor>
<joey> covert season they like really limit the </joey>
<joey> space true yeah the amount of people so </joey>
<joey> like the the they sometimes like ticket </joey>
<joey> these places now yeah so it's like you </joey>
<joey> can't just like rock up to these places </joey>
<garnt> anymore yeah so this place was </garnt>
<joey> incredibly small and also incredibly </joey>
<joey> packed oh yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> um there was like </joey>
<garnt> how sweaty were you I was oh it was so </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] sweaty okay there's poor rentals </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah you must have given them a </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] like damp rag bro I'm pretty </connor>
<garnt> sure they had to incinerate all of our </garnt>
<connor> you know I felt so bad right and I </connor>
<connor> wasn't even like the most sweaty one </connor>
<connor> there was like everyone was like </connor>
<connor> sweating through their [ __ ] colors </connor>
<connor> I'm I'm so glad that they give you like </connor>
<connor> space between like your pets because </connor>
<joey> holy [ __ ] if if if it was like a t-shirt </joey>
<joey> like it would our pits would be would </joey>
<joey> have been absolutely [ __ ] stained </joey>
<connor> gross and I was like there was like one </connor>
<connor> long line I was hoping this was like </connor>
<connor> actually something cool maybe it was </connor>
<garnt> like a mini game or something yeah um </garnt>
<connor> like I could see everyone lining up to </connor>
<garnt> this one [ __ ] queue yeah and I was </garnt>
<connor> like oh cool maybe you know you didn't </connor>
<connor> know what you're lining up for no but </connor>
<garnt> you just joined a line I I I joined the </garnt>
<garnt> line for like five minutes and I thought </garnt>
<connor> I thought it must have been British </connor>
<connor> people when they try and have fun </connor>
<joey> it might it must be something cool it </joey>
<connor> must be something that was fun yeah that </connor>
<joey> was funny I I joined in life and then I </joey>
<joey> realized wait all right I realized five </joey>
<joey> minutes in I should probably check what </joey>
<connor> this line is for so I get Sydney over </connor>
<connor> Sydney wait here in line just in case </connor>
<connor> it's something cool yeah maybe it's like </connor>
<garnt> maybe it's like one of the shooty games </garnt>
<connor> somebody's like the Goldfish thing I go </connor>
<garnt> up right and this is by far the longest </garnt>
<garnt> line where you'd have to wait in line </garnt>
<garnt> for about 30 minutes to get to the front </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] balloon </garnt>
<garnt> balloon kids can go there and buy </garnt>
<garnt> balloons </garnt>
<garnt> and kids were waiting 30 plus minutes to </garnt>
<garnt> go to this one stall to buy balloons and </garnt>
<garnt> that was the highlight of this Festival </garnt>
<joey> now that's not even like traditionally </joey>
<joey> Japanese you can you can get a [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> you can do that at Disneyland as well </connor>
<connor> they sell one dollars </connor>
<joey> it wasn't even like a paper balloon like </joey>
<joey> just like a regular ass like plastic </joey>
<joey> balloon or </joey>
<joey> a lot it's like the stall was like it's </joey>
<joey> literally touchable so basically so once </joey>
<joey> you like you get like </joey>
<connor> you know I wanted to go to this last </connor>
<connor> year but I was sick but I think I dodged </connor>
<garnt> it bullet you kind of did actually so we </garnt>
<garnt> we actually we went we went there we </garnt>
<garnt> stayed for like 30 minutes and </garnt>
<garnt> immediately like we were like can we </garnt>
<garnt> leave just 30 minutes yeah because it </garnt>
<garnt> was literally there was nothing to do </garnt>
<garnt> there there was literally nothing to do </garnt>
<garnt> that and uh the only reason we stayed </garnt>
<garnt> was because mailing was like an hour </garnt>
<garnt> late so we're like oh I guess we gotta </garnt>
<garnt> wait for May Lin uh but there was like </garnt>
<garnt> one Saving Grace to this Festival </garnt>
<garnt> which is uh it wasn't there well there </garnt>
<garnt> was nothing happening at the beginning </garnt>
<garnt> but there was a stage where you know </garnt>
<connor> where music was being played and </connor>
<joey> everything like that the dance around it </joey>
<connor> yeah where they dance around it is is </connor>
<joey> there a name for that can you explain </joey>
<joey> what the tradition is like uh yeah so </joey>
<joey> they're basically at the bigger </joey>
<garnt> festivals what they do is uh they build </garnt>
<garnt> this giant really really high stage </garnt>
<garnt> usually it's like I don't know five ten </garnt>
<garnt> meters up in the air yeah </garnt>
<garnt> um and then they do this dance usually </garnt>
<garnt> at the end of the festival where they </garnt>
<joey> light a fire </joey>
<joey> um and then there are stage performers </joey>
<connor> up on stage and then basically everyone </connor>
<connor> around them they're just dancing like in </connor>
<connor> a clockwise like kind of circle dance </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah it's probably one of the most </garnt>
<garnt> like common types of festivals like </garnt>
<garnt> there's some [ __ ] wacky festivals out </garnt>
<garnt> there but I'd say that's probably the </garnt>
<garnt> most common one yeah so there was </garnt>
<garnt> something there was there was one at </garnt>
<connor> this Festival that we went to and there </connor>
<connor> was nothing happening really on stage </connor>
<connor> when we first arrived yeah but when </connor>
<connor> Malin arrived that's when they started </connor>
<connor> you know the whole dance kind of thing </connor>
<connor> the whole music the whole traditional </connor>
<connor> dance and traditional music and </connor>

<connor> just seeing like Lightning McQueen just </connor>
<joey> up there if it was minions it would have </joey>
<joey> been more on brands </joey>
<connor> minions but uh yeah initially no one no </connor>
<connor> one wanted to like join in and dance </connor>
<connor> because it was like it's hot it's summer </connor>
<garnt> everyone's sweating but then we had this </garnt>
<joey> for like one we called him like the </joey>
<garnt> alpha right there's there's there was </garnt>
<joey> this one alpha yeah who just got got </joey>
<joey> down off the stage and like rallied the </joey>
<joey> crowd together right and he was like he </joey>
<joey> just did the dance of such confidence </joey>
<joey> that you see one person joining him then </joey>
<joey> two people then like somehow he just </joey>
<connor> conjures up an entire [ __ ] line yeah </connor>
<connor> of people just like dancing around the </connor>
<connor> states what a child yeah what what </connor>
<connor> absolute chat yeah and then I remember </connor>

<garnt> next ACT is coming on </garnt>
<connor> um so we're getting ready to leave and </connor>
<connor> they announced the next ACT </connor>
<connor> uh and let's just say this was not the </connor>
<connor> Japanese summer Festival experience I </connor>
<connor> was expecting because the next ACT they </connor>
<connor> bring on </connor>
<connor> they announced them and they're like </connor>
<joey> please into introducing Bobby and I'm </joey>
<joey> like bubbly that does not sound like a </joey>
<connor> traditional Japanese like music act what </connor>
<joey> is this [ __ ] Idol group comes on </joey>
<connor> they say hello we are bubbly let's </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] get it boys let's go let's go </garnt>
<garnt> and they start doing a dance and somehow </garnt>
<garnt> in this Summer Festival it turns to an </garnt>
<garnt> Idol concert right </garnt>
<connor> people have the little things we should </connor>
<garnt> have right yeah because that's that's </garnt>
<garnt> people you people were using their </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] fans instead of like because I </garnt>
<joey> was saying we they're Lightning McQueen </joey>
<joey> fans well you know they do that they why </joey>
<connor> did the visual cave video they also used </connor>
<joey> fans yeah yeah because I don't know yeah </joey>
<garnt> so if you've been to another concert </garnt>
<garnt> normally people have like the glowy </garnt>
<garnt> sticks where they do like the glowy </garnt>
<garnt> dance so they had that kind of dance </garnt>
<garnt> they were trying they were trying to get </garnt>
<garnt> people to like join along with but they </garnt>
<garnt> everyone just kind of used their [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> fans to like join along and it was like </garnt>
<garnt> the most okay here's how you could tell </garnt>
<garnt> who the Brits in the crowd were okay so </garnt>
<garnt> there was like so everyone was like kind </garnt>
<garnt> of like going along with their stance </garnt>
<garnt> going along with this Idol concert </garnt>
<garnt> um and then I I was like ah this is this </garnt>
<garnt> is this is a bit too much for me this is </garnt>
<joey> very this is this this is not getting </joey>
<joey> paid for yeah this ain't it for me and </joey>
<joey> so I like step back and I look to my </joey>
<joey> left and who would I see I see </joey>
<joey> um </joey>
<garnt> I see that only two other Brits in Geeks </garnt>
<garnt> plus just standing alongside me </garnt>
<garnt> we had all thoughts subconsciously </garnt>
<garnt> thought the same thing and we all had </garnt>
<garnt> all taken a step back and just was like </garnt>
<connor> no no </connor>
<connor> [Laughter] </connor>
<connor> that's so funny sometimes you're just in </connor>
<joey> the in the vibe and you're like no yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah no no there's a time and place for </joey>
<garnt> that kind of stuff and just that day was </garnt>
<joey> not the day meanwhile meanwhile died </joey>
<garnt> it's right at the front of the Hugo yeah </garnt>
<garnt> let's go bubbly bubbly let's go </garnt>
<garnt> it was like the most surreal experience </garnt>
<connor> I had ever seen because </connor>
<connor> um because you could tell like there </connor>
<connor> there was like some fans in the crowd </connor>
<connor> that were like hardcore fans you know </connor>
<connor> they knew every dance they knew all of </connor>
<connor> the lyrics and they were like spread out </connor>
<connor> in the crowd like they were like like </connor>
<connor> they were purposely there to like </connor>
<connor> indoctrinate people right because </connor>
<connor> because it was like a proper Idol </connor>
<garnt> concert and then I turned to May Lin and </garnt>
<garnt> I was like this is my first Japanese </garnt>
<garnt> Festival this is my is this is this </garnt>
<garnt> traditional and she just tells me and </garnt>
<garnt> goes no </garnt>
<joey> I I don't know what's going on and </joey>
<joey> remind me again this is all happening on </joey>
<garnt> a [ __ ] basketball court this is </garnt>
<garnt> happening </garnt>
<connor> to give me allow me to paint a better </connor>
<joey> picture of this how many people were at </joey>
<joey> this thing would you yeah how big was </joey>
<connor> this basketball because basketball </connor>
<connor> courts can't hold more like 100 people </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> I said three basketball courts yeah so I </connor>
<connor> thought that's still tiny so you know </connor>
<connor> when you're in school there was a </connor>
<connor> playground I had like a basketball court </connor>
<connor> and maybe something else oh no actually </connor>
<garnt> like a soccer field yeah the stage was </garnt>
<connor> actually on the tennis court I think so </connor>
<garnt> how how many people were at this Summer </garnt>
<connor> Festival I'd say 300. [ __ ] fair amount </connor>
<garnt> for yeah for that size no no it was a </garnt>
<connor> tiny space and it was absolutely packed </connor>
<joey> to the brim full of nothing </joey>
<connor> full of nothing I'm a shaved ice </connor>
<joey> balloons and yeah it was great I went to </joey>
<garnt> a Summerfest full got a free Idol </garnt>
<garnt> concerts no I don't think I don't think </garnt>
<connor> you should say you went to a Summer </connor>
<joey> Festival because from the sounds of it </joey>
<connor> you didn't go to a Subway you weren't </connor>
<connor> sure you went to an uh a Summer Festival </connor>
<garnt> themed Idol concert yeah yeah no no guys </garnt>
<garnt> I went to it like I you know you know </garnt>
<connor> how I got on my mind my money's worth </connor>
<connor> out of that Summer Festival I took one </connor>
<connor> picture I posted it on Twitter got a </connor>
<connor> hundred a hundred thousand likes I was </connor>
<connor> like guys I went to </connor>
<garnt> if people believe I went to a Summer </garnt>
<joey> Festival that's what's important when I </joey>
<garnt> saw that picture I was like I was </garnt>
<joey> imagining you know I saw a lot of people </joey>
<connor> behind I was just like oh wow this must </connor>
<garnt> be like a really massive summer vessel </garnt>
<garnt> if I really I'd seen outside of the </garnt>
<garnt> frame and seeing that it doesn't extend </garnt>
<garnt> that much perfectly framed it so we were </garnt>
<garnt> like you know frame out the train frame </garnt>
<garnt> and like frame out the basketball court </garnt>
<garnt> just make it look like it's a it's a </garnt>
<connor> good Summer Festival how much did it </connor>
<garnt> cost you to rent your ucata </garnt>
<garnt> oh [ __ ] I don't remember it was like I </garnt>
<joey> mean so a lot of places can be 80. yeah </joey>
<connor> a lot of places can be a bit expensive </connor>
<connor> you paid 60 or 80 bucks to get sweaty </connor>
<joey> yeah for like what two hours three hours </joey>
<garnt> yeah two three hours yeah </garnt>
<joey> we just want to karaoke afterwards and </joey>
<garnt> uh uh and uh that was that was the </garnt>
<garnt> highlight because it was like yeah you </garnt>
<garnt> counter huh in your you guys yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> oh my God that sounds like a lot of work </garnt>
<garnt> it's basically just PJs except it's </garnt>
<connor> socially acceptable I I'm like giggle </connor>
<joey> white so it it looks weird I'm not sure </joey>
<joey> when you wear it it just looks like lost </joey>
<connor> Samurai cosplay I do I do look like </connor>
<garnt> every Facebook photo actually it was so </garnt>
<garnt> funny right because when we when we rock </garnt>
<garnt> up we had this whole Geeks plus crew </garnt>
<garnt> that rocked up to the Summer Festival </garnt>
<garnt> yeah like I said we all dressed up for </garnt>
<joey> it we rock up to the Summer Festival </joey>
<joey> look around and I'm like guess who the </joey>
<joey> foreigners were they were the ones </joey>
<joey> wearing the yukatas so it was like </joey>
<joey> everyone else is just normal yeah </joey>
<joey> everyone else was dressed normally so </joey>
<joey> that was that was like the Japanese </joey>
<joey> people all dressing in just like normal </joey>
<garnt> clothes it's like just like normal </garnt>
<garnt> clothes then there was the foreigners </garnt>
<garnt> there was a group of us just rocking up </garnt>
<garnt> in our uconnis and we were just like </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] guys we weren't the only ones who </garnt>
<joey> actually dressed up for this I guarantee </joey>
<joey> all the Japanese people there were like </joey>
<connor> how do we tell them that it's just </connor>
<connor> accidentally turned up in a text to an </connor>
<garnt> elementary graduate like that's what </garnt>
<joey> can't do it was that one time where you </joey>
<joey> you get like the Halloween party invite </joey>
<connor> and you're like I should dress up for </connor>
<joey> this yeah you were the only one who </joey>
<joey> dressed up to this Halloween party </joey>
<garnt> that's the experience we had oh my god </garnt>
<joey> well no yeah it was uh I I almost </joey>
<joey> hearing that story I almost want to take </joey>
<joey> you guys to like an actual problem no I </joey>
<connor> want to go to a problem yeah yeah let's </connor>
<connor> go somewhere like in the middle of </connor>
<joey> nowhere oh yeah the ones in the middle </joey>
<joey> of nowhere nowhere near Tokyo have you </joey>
<connor> guys ever been to like any other like </connor>
<joey> types of festivals because I think I </joey>
<joey> feel as much as as much fun as those </joey>
<joey> summer festivals are the most fun I've </joey>
<joey> ever I've ever had at festivals are the </joey>
<joey> ones that are just [ __ ] bonkers the </joey>
<joey> penis one well the penis Festival as </joey>
<joey> well I mean I did a video on that that </joey>
<garnt> was insane yeah what what is the history </garnt>
<garnt> behind that Festival I don't [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> know I mean it's like a fertility thing </connor>
<connor> I need it yeah yeah it's the celebrate </connor>
<connor> fertility and it's basically think of </connor>
<connor> like think of uh I think the only way I </connor>
<connor> can describe it right is like so there's </connor>
<joey> many of them all over the place uh the </joey>
<joey> one that I went so I think was like the </joey>
<joey> biggest one that they do every year and </joey>
<joey> it basically starts off with like this </joey>
<garnt> parade on the streets there were many </garnt>
<joey> penis festivals yes yeah yeah in </joey>
<joey> different parts of Japan I thought no I </joey>
<garnt> did I thought I thought when you said </garnt>
<connor> many festivals I just thought you meant </connor>
<connor> many Japanese festivals no no there are </connor>
<connor> many penis vessels throughout the year </connor>
<garnt> damn they are they praying hard to that </garnt>
<connor> penis yeah I do they need it they need </connor>
<connor> more they need it this is literally like </connor>
<connor> how do we stop this thing thoughts and </connor>
<joey> prayers </joey>
<joey> actual we do something yeah so like the </joey>
<joey> one I went to was the biggest one I </joey>
<joey> forgot whereabouts it was uh somewhere </joey>
<joey> like closer to Nagoya I think oh no it </joey>
<joey> wasn't nowhere uh or aichi </joey>
<joey> um that one's wild that one was huge uh </joey>
<joey> and the and the penis yeah and like some </joey>
<joey> of these like there's basically like a </joey>
<joey> parade that happens where everyone's </joey>
<connor> like lined up on the side of the streets </connor>
<connor> and then they bring in a bunch of like </connor>
<connor> traditional </connor>
<connor> um you know penis shaped objects </connor>
<connor> and they finish it off with the </connor>
<connor> girthiest schlong I've ever seen in my </connor>
<connor> life it's this like wooden schlong I </connor>
<connor> want to guess it's maybe about 15 meters </connor>
<connor> long what carried no The Good the girth </connor>
<connor> is probably I know many people to carry </connor>
<connor> this thing like 40 guys it's like </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] Johnny Sins equivalence there's </connor>
<joey> 40 guys carrying Johnny since [ __ ] and </joey>
<connor> and they and they carry it through the </connor>
<connor> the parade uh you know they stole </connor>
<joey> through people I don't know at the </joey>
<connor> temple I guess she's got like a storage </connor>
<connor> unit somewhere and then they they walk </connor>
<connor> it through the parade you know people </connor>
<connor> taking photos whatever and then they </connor>
<connor> prop it up in front of the Temple </connor>
<connor> so at the end of the festival there's </connor>
<connor> just this giant 50 meter wooden [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> just just like sitting there in front of </connor>
<connor> the temple and then at the end of the </connor>
<connor> the one I went to they did this </connor>
<connor> tradition I don't know what the the the </connor>
<connor> the you know the history behind it is </connor>
<connor> but it's really dangerous and this is </connor>
<connor> the only one that they do it at uh they </connor>
<connor> what they do is they go up on these like </connor>
<connor> this giant stage that's built up about </connor>
<connor> 5-10 meters tall so kind of like the one </connor>
<connor> you saw yeah at the Summer Festival </connor>
<connor> except instead of a square one it's like </connor>
<connor> a long rectangle right um and there's </connor>
<connor> about </connor>
<connor> 10 15 dudes who are standing at the top </connor>
<connor> of this thing with a basket full of </connor>
<connor> Mochi right and I'm not talking about </connor>
<connor> the squishy Emoji right I'm talking </connor>
<garnt> about oh like the the [ __ ] you put </garnt>
<joey> before it's cooked [ __ ] in these plastic </joey>
<joey> bags yeah and what they do is they just </joey>
<joey> grab handfuls of this [ __ ] and they just </joey>
<joey> Chuck it into the crowd </joey>
<garnt> and these people are just like </garnt>
<garnt> desperately trying to catch these Mochi </garnt>
<garnt> well what's really dangerous about it is </garnt>
<garnt> that if you're not careful because </garnt>
<garnt> there's literal tens of hundreds of </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] Mochi pieces yeah flying out and </garnt>
<garnt> these are Big these are like size of my </garnt>
<connor> fist right kid dies if you if you're not </connor>
<joey> careful that thing can smack you in the </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] head and it and I got smacked in </garnt>
<joey> the head you've got a deck an old </joey>
<joey> grandma yeah I was I was filming it in </joey>
<joey> my video and I got decked in the [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> forehead by one I'm just like pow and </connor>
<joey> then since then he didn't watch anime </joey>
<joey> and then place it back trace it back and </joey>
<connor> then it was just like and I was like </connor>
<connor> what's anime where am I what but I think </connor>
<connor> I think the craziest one I went to </connor>
<connor> though was in nagana was that opinions </connor>
<connor> no not the penis one uh the one I went </connor>
<joey> to in Nagano was uh the fire Festival </joey>
<joey> not the fire Festival that's a different </joey>
<garnt> one this one happened not fyre internet </garnt>
<joey> restoring video yeah I know that one not </joey>
<joey> fyre Festival the f-i-r-e festival </joey>
<joey> um </joey>
<joey> yes also it's extremely dangerous okay </joey>
<connor> so basically what they do is they build </connor>
<garnt> this giant 20 25 meter wooden like </garnt>
<garnt> teepee looking structure right and </garnt>
<connor> people are gathered all around it and </connor>
<connor> then what happens is they set it on fire </connor>
<connor> and then there are people in the back </connor>
<connor> who push the crowd towards the fire what </connor>
<joey> why </joey>
<joey> I don't know but basically if you're </joey>
<joey> standing in the front you are getting </joey>
<joey> cooked alive and you're trying to fight </joey>
<joey> back all these like people trying to </joey>
<joey> basically push you into a fight it's </joey>
<joey> like it's like Mass witch hunting </joey>
<connor> Korean squid game we had to get people </connor>
<joey> who are broke games </joey>
<joey> and I was and and mind you right this is </joey>
<connor> like there are like hundreds of people </connor>
<connor> just all gathered around and there's and </connor>
<connor> when this thing sets a blaze yeah it's </connor>
<garnt> just this massive bonfire so you could </garnt>
<garnt> be like 20 25 meters away from this </garnt>
<garnt> thing and it's hot as [ __ ] yeah I can't </garnt>
<garnt> I can't imagine what it's like it's </garnt>
<garnt> literally fire yeah it's literally fire </garnt>
<garnt> it's like if there was a house on fire </garnt>
<joey> and then someone and you were watching </joey>
<joey> it and then someone behind you was like </joey>
<joey> get close that's what it was like it's </joey>
<joey> like no I don't want to get close to </joey>
<joey> that thing it's hot I they do that for </joey>
<joey> some reason I want to say that like yeah </joey>
<connor> no we don't have any weird festivals but </connor>
<connor> we have that one but we Chase like </connor>
<joey> cheese down the hill Oh that one's the </joey>
<connor> dumbest Festival of all time that's </connor>
<connor> dangerous that's like [ __ ] up is that </connor>
<joey> the one where they push the wheels of </joey>
<connor> cheese now push the wheel of cheese and </connor>
<connor> people just [ __ ] [ __ ] like flip </connor>
<garnt> down the hill to try and get it first </garnt>
<connor> yeah so so they have like an ambulance </connor>
<connor> on call and any Festival yeah where you </connor>
<joey> have an ambulance on call is never a </joey>
<joey> good sign oh yeah </joey>
<joey> um and so the right it's like the wheel </joey>
<joey> cheese wheel rolling Festival where you </joey>
<garnt> just like you they you have a big wheel </garnt>
<garnt> of cheese roll it down like a very very </garnt>
<garnt> steep hill and they have a festival </garnt>
<garnt> where people try to chase the wheel yeah </garnt>
<connor> whoever gets whoever touches it wins </connor>
<joey> whoever touches it first wins no is </joey>
<joey> there any way you can catch up to that </joey>
<connor> thing though uh yeah there's like some </connor>
<connor> people who are in insane and literally </connor>
<garnt> like throw their bodies yeah they don't </garnt>
<garnt> care wow so how people normally go is if </garnt>
<garnt> you run Fallout full speed down a hill </garnt>
<garnt> is normally your body can't trip your </garnt>
<joey> body can't keep up with the moment right </joey>
<joey> so either you're going to fall flat on </joey>
<joey> your face or you're just going to start </joey>
<joey> rolling or most of the time you're going </joey>
<joey> to get some kind of broken bone or some </joey>
<joey> injury because that's what happens when </joey>
<garnt> you run full force down a hill isn't </garnt>
<joey> that isn't that like that scene in Bucky </joey>
<joey> where he's like full bolting it down the </joey>
<joey> stairs and he's like this is boring and </joey>
<connor> he starts yawning but there's probably </connor>
<connor> one dude in that Festival who's like </connor>
<connor> that where he's like yeah I don't give a </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] though and just all for some cheese </garnt>
<joey> the part of me is like I want to at </joey>
<joey> least be there yeah I want to see people </joey>
<joey> just like eat [ __ ] yeah I think that's </joey>
<garnt> the whole point right yeah I think </garnt>
<garnt> that's why people love it yeah I don't </garnt>
<connor> I'm pretty sure the local government is </connor>
<connor> like please can we stop doing the cheese </connor>
<joey> thing and they're like no what's the </joey>
<joey> what's the tradition behind it though </joey>
<connor> like why do they do it oh I don't know I </connor>
<connor> know it's something that is like the the </connor>
<joey> origins are very murky yeah it's not </joey>
<connor> like I feel every Festival is like it's </connor>
<connor> not it's not like this is 100 what </connor>
<connor> happened I feel like I've heard it </connor>
<connor> before because there's a Netflix </connor>
<connor> documentary about weird things more of </connor>
<joey> the episodes is about it because um yeah </joey>
<joey> because I know for a fact that in Japan </joey>
<joey> at least the reason why we do festivals </joey>
<joey> or Matsuri is I think like there's </joey>
<joey> theories that like they used to be used </joey>
<joey> for like sacrificial rituals and [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> like that and then one day someone was </joey>
<joey> like let's take the sacrificial part out </joey>
<connor> and maybe just like dance instead I just </connor>
<garnt> have a good stop </garnt>
<garnt> [Laughter] </garnt>
<connor> supervised </connor>
<connor> that's the cool sign yeah I watched a Qi </connor>
<connor> thing and it was talking about like </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] uh Japanese like celibate monks </joey>
<connor> or something and they were like they </connor>
<joey> would like have to it was wild like what </joey>
<connor> they would do it was like something when </connor>
<connor> you were when you were done with your </connor>
<joey> duties to prove that you were loyal to </joey>
<joey> like the monk HUD you would just trap </joey>
<joey> yourself in like a coffin for like 80 </joey>
<joey> days and just die oh you were not </joey>
<joey> allowed to come out and if you came out </joey>
<joey> as a sign of weakness they put them in </joey>
<joey> like a ditch right like a whole </joey>
<connor> something like I can't remember the </connor>
<connor> exact thing but it's like what is like </connor>
<connor> the the dedication yeah to this [ __ ] in </connor>
<joey> Japan is like next oh yeah because I </joey>
<joey> remember I I saw like a similar video </joey>
<joey> recently where they were talking about </joey>
<joey> this like uh I guess like type of like </joey>
<connor> monk uh training that you can do called </connor>
<connor> usheri and basically they do this thing </connor>
<connor> called the Thousand day walk oh and </connor>
<connor> basically what they do is every day you </connor>
<connor> walk between I think it's like 30 to </connor>
<connor> kilometers through the mountains and </connor>
<connor> meditate and you do that for a thousand </connor>
<connor> days but it's so hardcore that when you </connor>
<connor> sign up for this thing they actually </connor>
<connor> give you a small knife where if you </connor>
<connor> don't succeed in it you have to </connor>
<connor> literally set puku </connor>
<connor> a lot of them </connor>
<joey> and I'm just like bro bro like how far </joey>
<joey> down do you have to be to be like I'm </joey>
<connor> gonna do this I really want to find the </connor>
<joey> celebration it's crazy and this and it's </joey>
<joey> still a thing that they do today that's </joey>
<garnt> insane yeah it's not and there are just </garnt>
<garnt> people who do that that's that's they </garnt>
<garnt> literally they literally said so you </garnt>
<joey> have chosen death yeah it's like we will </joey>
<joey> it's like would you like to be </joey>
<joey> enlightened please walk for a thousand </joey>
<joey> days straight </joey>
<garnt> that's literally like a Hunter x Hunter </garnt>
<connor> test you know that yeah </connor>
<joey> if by the end of the Thousand Days you </joey>
<garnt> don't have Nan like it's not exactly </garnt>
<garnt> yeah like it's not worth it that's part </garnt>
<garnt> of the hunter exam you know you get your </garnt>
<garnt> hunter's license after this or you die </garnt>
<connor> you know that's that's literally that's </connor>
<connor> I wouldn't be surprised and some of you </connor>
<joey> will die yeah someone ran a little too </joey>
<joey> much on time I was like yeah we can do </joey>
<garnt> that it was tagashi and I've read about </garnt>
<garnt> that and I was like I can put that in a </garnt>
<garnt> hunter </garnt>
<garnt> sounds like a good Arc right there </garnt>
<connor> that's crazy dude what are you checking </connor>
<connor> up trying to find this monk thing I've </connor>
<joey> definitely heard about that celibacy </joey>
<joey> thing though yeah um </joey>
<connor> that's right </connor>
<connor> is this the thing that I was talking </connor>
<joey> about Jerry okay yeah so it's basically </joey>
<joey> you you naturally mummify you yeah </joey>
<connor> that's it they mummify themselves </connor>
<joey> willingly yeah and while they're alive </joey>
<joey> and if they're like cave or like they </joey>
<connor> don't go through with it they're not </connor>
<joey> worthy but they have to like starve </joey>
<connor> themselves yeah like in a in a like </connor>
<joey> coffin yeah for like how many days is it </joey>
<connor> or something to stay in there I think </connor>
<connor> it's something crazy and I can't </connor>
<connor> remember why yeah I feel very bad that </connor>
<connor> they stood 80 80 [ __ ] days or </connor>
<connor> something to do this and I can't </connor>
<joey> remember why they did it it's like no no </joey>
<joey> maintenance it's probably something like </joey>
<joey> spiritual no it is cinnamon or something </joey>
<joey> yeah I think I remember on this queue I </joey>
<joey> think they're talking about how like </joey>
<joey> they the I think it was the Japanese </joey>
<connor> government at some point was like Hey </connor>
<connor> can you can you just stop stop doing </connor>
<connor> this please this is really weird and </connor>
<connor> uncomfortable people don't like this </connor>
<joey> yeah people don't want your mind I mean </joey>
<joey> you know you know a lot of people praise </joey>
<connor> Japan for being a few cultures that </connor>
<joey> actually really hold on to tradition but </joey>
<joey> uh I mean maybe there are some </joey>
<joey> traditions we shouldn't hold on to well </joey>
<connor> actually I mean there's a lot of </connor>
<joey> tradition they didn't preserve for some </joey>
<connor> of them they're like all right yeah this </connor>
<joey> is kind of weird modernize this thing </joey>
<joey> yeah let's let's not do that yeah penis </joey>
<connor> vessels though the people's fine as [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> I want to go through it yeah that that </joey>
<connor> just looks like a laugh it's really </connor>
<connor> trying to meet up in Japan </connor>
<joey> sorry and I know and I know like in my </joey>
<joey> video we also found a temple that was </joey>
<connor> dedicated to the women as well I was </connor>
<garnt> gonna say I was I I was hoping it would </garnt>
<connor> be yeah we found a vagina Temple oh okay </connor>
<joey> just say vagina okay I didn't know if I </joey>
<connor> was allowed to say vagina we went to a </connor>
<garnt> vagina </garnt>
<joey> all right fine we went to a vagina </joey>
<connor> Temple it was awesome did you enter </connor>
<joey> through like a a you know something like </joey>
<garnt> a fleshy yeah </garnt>
<garnt> going in </garnt>
<garnt> [Music] </garnt>
<joey> no but what was cool was that like um it </joey>
<joey> wasn't like you know physically like </joey>
<joey> that but like it was uh symbolically the </joey>
<joey> the whole idea was that when you come </joey>
<joey> out of the temple it's like you're </joey>
<joey> rebirthing so you cleanse yourself in </joey>
<joey> the temple and then you come out of the </joey>
<joey> vagina entrance and it's like oh it's </joey>
<joey> like you're being reborn and I'm like I </joey>
<joey> thought that was pretty [ __ ] cool but </joey>
<joey> it would have been cooler if it was a </joey>
<joey> physical like </joey>
<joey> the physical parallelism one you </joey>
<connor> wouldn't want that uh yeah no one wants </connor>
<garnt> that or needs that I I just I just I </garnt>
<garnt> just think about that and I'm like yeah </garnt>
<garnt> so like the the idea of reborn that </garnt>
<joey> sounds like a cool spiritual kind of </joey>
<joey> Awakening in idea walking out of a </joey>
<joey> vagina and saying you're like reborn </joey>
<joey> that I don't know the imagery just like </joey>
<joey> the imagery just doesn't match with the </joey>
<connor> idea to me yeah of course </connor>
<joey> I love how uh in Japan it's like you </joey>
<joey> know they have these really super </joey>
<joey> sexualized things but then they're very </joey>
<joey> hush-hush about sex and other kind of </joey>
<joey> topics oh yeah it's like weird it's like </joey>
<connor> uh it's like oh we'll have a giant </connor>
<connor> Festival celebrating penises yeah but we </connor>
<connor> don't like gays it's not gay it's not </connor>
<connor> gay things yeah that's but that's what I </connor>
<joey> was wondering I was just like when I was </joey>
<garnt> standing there at the penis festival and </garnt>
<connor> I saw a little homerotic 40 dudes </connor>
<joey> carrying this giant [ __ ] I don't even </joey>
<joey> think the Mardi Gras does this </joey>
<joey> has anyone ever like questioned how </joey>
<joey> slightly homoerotic this is and like </joey>
<joey> Japan's making progress slowly with it </joey>
<joey> of course of course yeah I mean I think </joey>
<joey> it's just because it's it's not that </joey>
<garnt> they I'd say that they it's not that </garnt>
<garnt> they don't despise gay people right no </garnt>
<garnt> no they just have an old system and </garnt>
<connor> Japan is very slow to change yeah but </connor>
<joey> most people don't give a [ __ ] oh no of </joey>
<connor> course forget about that sure of course </connor>
<connor> and you go to any of these sex stores </connor>
<connor> bro yeah you know I don't give a [ __ ] oh </connor>
<joey> yeah if anything they're in the future </joey>
<joey> or something yeah yeah exactly a bit too </joey>
<joey> much they're a bit too far I went to uh </joey>
<joey> I mean by the time this is out it's </joey>
<joey> pretty darn I went to uh uh go to sex </joey>
<connor> store </connor>
<connor> um because Ludwig wanted me to get him </connor>
<connor> the idea of the video is that he gets me </connor>
<joey> a box of 500 with the stuff from America </joey>
<connor> that got America themed yeah and he </connor>
<joey> wants a Japanese themed box or right 500 </joey>
<garnt> of the Japanese stuff I've done some </garnt>
<joey> cool stuff you know uh but you know I </joey>
<garnt> had to go to the sex store I was like I </garnt>
<joey> gotta give that because I'm thinking </joey>
<joey> content I want to give him content what </joey>
<connor> is better than content than half the </connor>
<connor> stuff in this goddamn stores yeah but </connor>
<joey> the problem is how do I get stuff that </joey>
<joey> he can show on a live stream yeah and I </joey>
<connor> found stuff well it was just weird </connor>
<joey> enough </joey>
<joey> no that's that's like vanilla from all </joey>
<joey> the stuff I found there was this one </joey>
<connor> like vanilla I'm thinking stream needs </connor>
<connor> again I found the </connor>
<connor> I found these things I'd never seen </connor>
<connor> these before I I know they've only </connor>
<connor> existed before but this is a this is a </connor>
<joey> new thing to me it was it was branded in </joey>
<joey> as face hole TM and it was just Anime </joey>
<joey> characters but there wasn't a flashlight </joey>
<joey> it was just an anime character and you </joey>
<joey> you do the thing to its face </joey>
<joey> way so it's like it's like a it's like </joey>
<joey> shaped like a mouth or something it's </joey>
<joey> shaped like a body and then you it like </joey>
<garnt> it like curves like this like a natural </garnt>
<garnt> you know body you know you had to head </garnt>
<garnt> here yeah oh yeah yeah so it's like and </garnt>
<garnt> on the side there's like a 3D like </garnt>
<garnt> diagram cross-section of what it looks </garnt>
<connor> like on the inside yeah and I guess you </connor>
<connor> just have to put your mouth in it and </connor>
<connor> then go all the way down the thing it </connor>
<joey> was [ __ ] wait so where is like is </joey>
<joey> like the neck hole or like the mouth </joey>
<connor> mouth curves </connor>
<connor> so like yo your pp's doing some </connor>
<connor> contortion </connor>
<connor> um right and they had like the they had </connor>
<connor> a it was like a package deal so you </connor>
<connor> could get this and then down below for </connor>
<connor> like 500 yeah and five bucks yeah you </connor>
<connor> can get some some of that lube for this </connor>
<connor> anime it wasn't any lube it was like an </connor>
<connor> injection Lube because obviously have to </connor>
<connor> get it deep in there right so it's like </connor>
<connor> a little [ __ ] needle yeah I was like </connor>
<connor> this is just too much this is too much </connor>
<connor> and sell the clothes they were selling I </connor>
<connor> was like my goodness I bought like a </connor>
<connor> fake camel toe something I don't know </connor>
<connor> who needs this oh fake Hamilton what's </connor>
<connor> the obsession with camel toe here what's </connor>
<joey> up with that what is the obsession with </joey>
<joey> that I guess some people just really </joey>
<joey> like it yeah I don't know and then I got </joey>
<joey> the sprays obviously of course yeah </joey>
<joey> armpit sprays men some of those things </joey>
<joey> panty sprays yeah well some of them like </joey>
<garnt> I had to make sure the box art was safe </garnt>
<garnt> for work so there's a lot of them are </garnt>
<garnt> just sweaty girls and this is like who </garnt>
<garnt> see I've I've been through like here in </garnt>

<connor> weird and then I'm like this is really </connor>
<joey> weird this is really fun but that's the </joey>
<joey> thing right it's like I feel the the </joey>
<joey> best part about those kinds of stores is </joey>
<joey> like when you have a friend come to </joey>
<garnt> Japan and you're just like yo show me </garnt>
<garnt> some like weird Japan </garnt>
<joey> there was some other stuff yeah and the </joey>
<joey> one in Harbor right next to the station </joey>
<joey> yeah the Green Building yeah dude there </joey>
<joey> was this weird I'd never seen this </joey>
<connor> before it was a body pillow that had a </connor>
<joey> blow up portion to it and the and they </joey>
<joey> were like blow up legs yeah like this </joey>
<joey> yeah oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<garnt> attached to the body pillow I know what </garnt>

<joey> because some dudes just want to grab the </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] legs yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> you know floaty combined with a pillow </connor>
<garnt> yeah it's it's like as how as close you </garnt>
<garnt> can get to a sex doll as possible </garnt>
<garnt> without actually buying a three thousand </garnt>
<garnt> dollar sex doll you know there are </garnt>
<joey> different tiers you know it'd be really </joey>
<joey> funny if you like throw throw one of </joey>
<joey> those into a pool and you just see like </joey>
<joey> a bunch of little eggs </joey>
<joey> because you know the body the pillow </joey>
<joey> part's gonna sing so it's just a bunch </joey>
<garnt> of legs yeah there's so much here oh I </garnt>
<connor> should not exist yeah at all there was a </connor>
<connor> Tenga that was bigger but of course it </connor>
<garnt> was labeled the US Tenga oh yeah yeah it </garnt>

<joey> eventually wait okay so this is a thing </joey>
<joey> right so when I did the Tenga video was </joey>

<joey> expressvpn.com trash taste back to the </joey>
<joey> episode is it is it is it weird that and </joey>
<joey> I've always found this weird and I know </joey>
<joey> I've pointed out many times because I </joey>
<joey> feel Japan is the only one that is so </joey>
<joey> open to that kind of [ __ ] but at the </joey>
<connor> same time it's just like no we don't </connor>
<connor> want to talk about it right because it's </connor>
<joey> like because it because I find it weird </joey>
<joey> that you can go to any Don Quijote and </joey>
<joey> there's just like an open section for </joey>
<connor> Daniel like it's not even behind a </connor>
<connor> curtain I feel like it's it's uh what's </connor>
<connor> the word where you're kind of </connor>
<connor> constricted uh like Society here is very </connor>
<garnt> um what's the word when you're held back </garnt>
<garnt> a little bit um oppressed yeah a little </garnt>
<garnt> bit right like the the </garnt>
<joey> people have to really hold back their </joey>
<joey> personalities a lot in Japan yeah and I </joey>
<connor> feel like that results in them just </connor>
<joey> getting [ __ ] wild you have to hold </joey>
<joey> back yeah when they when they get to </joey>
<joey> like let loose and do their thing it </joey>
<joey> feels like you know if you're gonna make </joey>
<joey> me work like 50 goddamn hours a week and </joey>
<garnt> make me work on like weekends the least </garnt>
<garnt> I can do is just do whatever the [ __ ] I </garnt>
<garnt> want and if I want to have a good Jack </garnt>
<garnt> offset if I if I want to they're gonna </garnt>
<joey> hold they're gonna hold back a different </joey>
<joey> thing is I want to do some weird ass </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] that I I have participated in the </connor>
<joey> society and done what you've asked to me </joey>
<joey> and I'm doing it yeah I mean and so I </joey>
<connor> feel like that's that kind of just that </connor>
<connor> letting loose is where it comes from a </connor>
<joey> little bit oh no definitely well I think </joey>
<joey> it's also the big reason why like a lot </joey>
<connor> of you know that side of the industries </connor>
<connor> for example like you know like the dojin </connor>
<connor> side of things that's why we get some of </connor>
<joey> like the weirdest like what the [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> type of ideas because it's like you're </joey>
<connor> yeah because in a daily life you're not </connor>
<garnt> releasing it as often so it builds up </garnt>
<garnt> and builds up yeah or even discussing it </garnt>
<connor> and so it builds into and tones into </connor>
<joey> something that's just like how the [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> do you think about that yeah right so </connor>
<joey> yeah at least see the people not talking </joey>
<garnt> about it at all not wanting to engage </garnt>
<garnt> with it or going just insane and being </garnt>
<connor> not insane but like going wild with them </connor>
<connor> yeah because like you know people people </connor>
<connor> still have thoughts you know people yeah </connor>
<joey> if there's no if you can't Bonk that </joey>
<connor> away then uh what are you supposed to do </connor>
<connor> you know it's uh I mean there's a lot of </connor>
<connor> things in Japan like even you know going </connor>
<connor> off topic going back to the fire </connor>
<connor> festival thing that you were talking </connor>
<connor> about full circle baby full circle yeah </connor>
<connor> I'm just like it comes back yeah it </connor>
<connor> seems like I've I thought Japan was like </connor>
<connor> really on top of it with health and </connor>
<connor> safety but it seems like to me it feels </connor>
<joey> like some things you have to go through </joey>
<joey> so many red tapes oh yeah just just to </joey>
<joey> get anything done but there are some </joey>
<garnt> things in health and safety in Japan </garnt>
<garnt> that is just a [ __ ] free-frow and you </garnt>
<joey> just kind of mush it up as you go along </joey>
<joey> and I feel a lot of those types of </joey>
<joey> things where the Japan is kind of just </joey>
<connor> like OHS what's that it's usually linked </connor>
<connor> to stuff that's just like well it's </connor>
<connor> tradition yeah so you know people have </connor>
<connor> been doing it for hundreds or thousands </connor>
<connor> of years and uh you know we're still </connor>
<joey> around as a society so yeah sure it's a </joey>
<joey> little dangerous but like you know it's </joey>
<joey> all in it's all for culture it's all a </joey>
<connor> tradition they don't they I mean you can </connor>
<joey> sue in Japan but people don't Sue as </joey>
<connor> much yeah not in the UK especially the </connor>
<connor> US people people love love a good soup I </connor>
<joey> think I think people get lawyers before </joey>
<joey> they get health insurance in America I </joey>
<garnt> mean Japan you leave a bad Google review </garnt>
<connor> and that's like worse yeah right but </connor>
<connor> it's like it's like it's like that's a </connor>
<garnt> business Destroyer yeah like you don't </garnt>
<joey> have to [ __ ] I'm not I feel like there's </joey>
<joey> not that much of a concern for that like </joey>
<joey> yeah if people get food poisoning here </joey>
<joey> they often don't like try and get you </joey>
<garnt> know uh some um yeah we'll try to take </garnt>
<garnt> some recuperates yeah uh recoup any cost </garnt>
<joey> or whatever from yeah the restaurant or </joey>
<joey> something that's true like food health </joey>
<joey> and safety here is actually very relaxed </joey>
<connor> yeah and it's very much just built on we </connor>
<connor> just we trust that everyone is doing </connor>
<joey> what they say they're doing yeah I think </joey>
<joey> I think the the Japanese mentality of it </joey>
<connor> is oh I got food poisoning at this </connor>
<joey> restaurant that's not on the fault of </joey>
<connor> the restaurant that's on the fault of me </connor>
<joey> who couldn't you know properly maybe I'd </joey>
<joey> like to think because because a lot of </joey>
<joey> like this is us well I mean my Japanese </joey>
<connor> side understands that because it's like </connor>
<joey> it's very much this mentality of I don't </joey>
<connor> want to inconvenience other people yeah </connor>
<connor> it's like my problems are my own and I </connor>
<connor> don't want to make it and I don't want </connor>
<connor> to drag people who may perhaps be </connor>
<connor> innocent about it yeah right so it's </connor>
<joey> like I totally understand why you know </joey>
<joey> they wouldn't like you know there isn't </joey>
<joey> like a Karen that just comes down so </joey>
<connor> it's like how dare you food poison me </connor>
<joey> sometimes you get a bad batch as well </joey>
<joey> like that that could be out of the </joey>
<joey> restaurant's control exactly yeah a lot </joey>
<connor> of the time it is due to this not </connor>
<joey> cooking it up or storing it properly but </joey>
<connor> you know it does happen and I can </connor>
<connor> understand that why you'd be like it's </connor>
<connor> just like I'm sick I'll be done I'll be </connor>
<connor> fine in the next day nothing you don't </connor>
<connor> need to make a big fuss about it yeah </connor>
<connor> exactly but you know there's a lot more </connor>
<connor> of a you know culture for that but also </connor>
<connor> you know I mean again the old uh old </connor>
<garnt> traditions uh combined with the fact </garnt>
<garnt> that I think people are generally more </garnt>
<garnt> sensible yeah yeah yeah yeah </garnt>
<joey> or rule we have in the UK or the US is </joey>
<connor> because somebody [ __ ] up yeah like </connor>
<joey> somebody was stupid enough and did said </joey>
<connor> like what if what if I bungee jump </connor>
<garnt> without a car safety what if I run down </garnt>
<garnt> a hill with a ball of cheese yeah </garnt>
<joey> exactly yeah this is why first of all </joey>
<joey> hello this is why we can't have nice </joey>
<joey> things yeah doing bungee jumping into </joey>
<garnt> hours so fine you got to do it yeah I </garnt>
<garnt> want to how did you do it yeah it was </garnt>
<garnt> awesome safety awesome dude I I was like </garnt>
<connor> you hear these horror stories of people </connor>
<garnt> doing it in like countries where you're </garnt>
<connor> like they don't have a great reputation </connor>
<garnt> for health and safety yeah yeah you know </garnt>
<garnt> they'll be like yeah I went to this tiny </garnt>
<garnt> island in the middle of nowhere and </garnt>
<garnt> there was a dude who just had the bungee </garnt>
<garnt> and that was it yeah it's like I was </garnt>
<garnt> always you're always like attached by </garnt>
<joey> like two wires not even just the bungee </joey>
<joey> like it's in like yeah yeah yeah when </joey>
<connor> you do actually do the jump it's just </connor>
<joey> the bungee right every moment up until </joey>
<connor> that you're you're connected with like </connor>
<joey> two three wires it's super safe and yeah </joey>
<joey> it was awesome dude I I still won't do </joey>
<joey> it though bro I want too much of a [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> I want to do a bigger one </connor>
<joey> well how big is the one you did uh [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> I think it was about 100 meters and </joey>
<joey> that's considered small it's generally </joey>
<connor> quite small for a bunch of jumbo right I </connor>
<garnt> think the biggest in Japan is in gifu is </garnt>
<connor> like 210 meters right right and dude </connor>
<connor> it's sick I want to skydive barking I </connor>
<joey> think </joey>
<joey> so I would like to bungee jump but I </joey>
<connor> think I would prefer skydiving yeah same </connor>
<connor> same yeah I just don't let the deer </connor>
<joey> being strapped to someone </joey>
<connor> well </connor>
<connor> well I understand you have to yeah yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah like that's just how it is like I </joey>

<garnt> [ __ ] you you just start even getting a </garnt>
<garnt> license yeah do you see what I mean like </garnt>
<garnt> to me it's like I love the freedom I </garnt>

<connor> yeah that would be [ __ ] awesome and </connor>
<connor> then you could just Skydive whenever you </connor>
<garnt> want yeah I mean but like you have to </garnt>
<garnt> invest rightly so hundreds of like I </garnt>
<garnt> don't know how many hours of like air </garnt>
<garnt> time to be able to get like get a </garnt>
<connor> license probably I don't know </connor>
<connor> how many jumps do you need to get a </connor>
<connor> skydiving license or whatever I don't </connor>
<connor> know how it works can we have Google </connor>
<joey> there yeah dude the bungee was awesome </joey>
<joey> though I wanna I wanna be that but </joey>

<connor> uh Kai has the answer for us </connor>
<joey> that's not that crazy </joey>
<joey> I mean that's a lot of jobs </joey>
<connor> if you were doing a jump every month two </connor>
<joey> years you've got your license it's not </joey>
<joey> very much sorry babe I have to go for my </joey>
<connor> monthly job I'm sure do you act a bungee </connor>
<joey> jump and I got the taste for it dude </joey>
<joey> you got the taste of gravity that one </joey>
<garnt> that one second where you where you're </garnt>
<garnt> jumping and you don't feel anything yeah </garnt>
<garnt> that that's a rush dude what do you mean </garnt>
<garnt> because you mean when you hit </garnt>
<garnt> um before you hit the terminal terminal </garnt>
<garnt> velocity </garnt>
<garnt> I was gonna I was gonna go that fast </garnt>
<garnt> yeah I was gonna say like </garnt>
<connor> you obviously have the bungee jump </connor>
<connor> attached to you yeah uh but it's like </connor>
<joey> dudes who throw it right yeah so for the </joey>
<garnt> first second or so it is literally just </garnt>
<connor> you falling yeah before the bungee kicks </connor>
<garnt> in and it starts to you know stretch and </garnt>
<connor> slow down that first second was just you </connor>
<joey> jumping is nuts and it's it feels insane </joey>
<joey> yeah because you jump and it's like holy </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] this is what it was would look like </joey>
<joey> if I jumped off a cliff yeah this is how </joey>
<connor> it would feel like just that that </connor>
<joey> nothingness and just the speed you just </joey>
<joey> feel like your gut's just like dude yeah </joey>
<joey> like your whole body just goes up and </joey>
<joey> you're because I dived yeah yeah so I </joey>
<joey> did three jumps and I I wanted to do </joey>
<joey> each one cooler absolutely you know yes </joey>
<joey> I did like a I did a dive the first time </joey>
<joey> and then a running dive the second time </joey>
<connor> then I didn't flip the third time wow I </connor>
<connor> was like can I do tricks and they were </connor>
<connor> like I probably shouldn't but you can </connor>
<connor> and I was like how do I do it </connor>
<connor> and then they were like all right so you </connor>
<connor> got to hold the bungee to your side </connor>
<joey> right and then you can do flips oh okay </joey>
<joey> otherwise the Rope will get tangled yeah </joey>
<joey> so and then also it turns easier so then </joey>
<joey> you can you can do it then you let go </joey>
<joey> and you want to just return back right </joey>
<joey> don't let it slap like slap your face </joey>
<joey> yeah so that was really fun but dude did </joey>
<joey> you do like the did you do like the Ezio </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] like that's right yeah yeah I </connor>
<connor> did like fish stuff I did yeah I did the </connor>
<connor> the [ __ ] swimmer die yeah [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> down oh my god dude the shots even the </connor>
<garnt> GoPro yeah and the 360 camera's so cool </garnt>

<garnt> I've always wanted to go bungee jumping </garnt>
<garnt> and skydiving I've always been like uh </garnt>
<garnt> you know you you reach a age sometimes </garnt>
<joey> because I love roller coasters you reach </joey>
<joey> an age where you're like vertical she's </joey>
<garnt> just ain't doing it for me anymore you </garnt>
<connor> know what I mean I never hit that point </connor>
<connor> I'm still scared you know like skiing </connor>
<connor> snowboarding the hardest slopes doesn't </connor>
<joey> do anything for me I need that Rush yeah </joey>
<joey> see it's weird for me because it's like </joey>
<joey> I've always had this fear of heights for </joey>
<joey> the longest time but in certain </joey>
<joey> situations I'm totally okay with it so I </joey>
<joey> don't think I'll be able to bungee jump </joey>
<connor> I think I'll be too much of a [ __ ] but </connor>
<connor> like you know for journey across Japan </connor>
<connor> we're parasailing and we were up like </connor>
<connor> and we were like no he [ __ ] hated it </connor>
<connor> he was [ __ ] his pants but I think </connor>
<joey> he's seeing him [ __ ] his pants made me </joey>
<joey> really enjoy it yeah you know what I </joey>
<joey> mean we did this one it's like I'm like </joey>
<joey> 150 meters up in the air yeah if I was </joey>
<joey> by myself I would be [ __ ] there'd </joey>
<joey> just be a stream of [ __ ] yeah I was </joey>
<connor> flying down because I'm with someone who </connor>
<garnt> is more scared than me yeah I was like </garnt>
<joey> this is awesome I love it yeah okay just </joey>
<garnt> bring Chris everywhere I'm just like </garnt>
<garnt> yeah I mean he's a little worse I'm sure </garnt>
<garnt> he's gonna talk about this one when he </garnt>
<garnt> comes on yeah like my God trying to get </garnt>
<joey> him to do any of the like wait did he do </joey>
<joey> it no of course not no of course not </joey>
<joey> originally okay so there's three things </joey>
<connor> that you can do at this place it's like </connor>
<connor> you should go it's called gravity park </connor>
<connor> inside time it's [ __ ] awesome you </connor>
<connor> gotta drive there though </connor>
<connor> um so there's a bridge and a zip line so </connor>
<garnt> you you zip line across and you walk off </garnt>
<garnt> the bridge yeah yeah a bit boring for me </garnt>
<joey> the lines like baby it's like a baby </joey>
<joey> zipper yeah it's very small and then </joey>
<joey> there's the swing and the swing I also </joey>
<joey> found scary in the bungee really it's </joey>
<joey> literally a swing you sit there and then </joey>
<joey> a dude just drops you oh I've done the </joey>
<joey> swings bro and then you drop and you go </joey>
<joey> really [ __ ] fast and really close to </joey>
<joey> the ground way closer than the bungee </joey>
<joey> yeah swings and there's this man </joey>
<joey> holy [ __ ] was that terrifying and </joey>
<garnt> originally when we made this video I </garnt>
<garnt> booked for Krista Dix he was like yeah </garnt>
<garnt> I'll do this swing yeah I think he just </garnt>
<garnt> envisioned our swings oh swings I've </garnt>
<garnt> been on a swing before because you can </garnt>
<connor> do a tandem as well yeah we'll do it </connor>
<connor> together yeah and then yeah of course </connor>
<connor> when we got there Chris saw the swing it </connor>
<joey> was like oh well um well actually </joey>
<joey> um uh I don't think I want to do it and </joey>
<joey> I was like what do you mean I paid for </joey>
<joey> it it's like 150 yeah he's like no no no </joey>
<joey> no no no no no I don't want to do it </joey>
<joey> come on and then he was like I try I'll </joey>
<connor> do the zip line and right when he got to </connor>
<connor> the zip line I went first and I'm like </connor>
<connor> where's Chris and I can see him like not </connor>
<connor> getting in the ready position to go I'm </connor>
<joey> just like what come on man well he's </joey>
<joey> like chicken out of that as well no no </joey>
<garnt> he was going to though in the video it's </garnt>
<joey> really good you should watch it yeah um </joey>
<garnt> it's it's Chris is having like a mental </garnt>
<connor> battle I'm sure he'll come on and tell </connor>
<joey> us all about it right uh it was it was </joey>
<joey> interesting though yeah because the same </joey>
<joey> thing happened on joint across Japan we </joey>
<joey> were supposed to because we could only </joey>
<joey> go on pairs on this parasail right right </joey>
<joey> uh but there's only three of us it was </joey>
<garnt> me you know Chris and nasty so one of us </garnt>
<garnt> had to go twice right and the guy was </garnt>
<garnt> like okay but we also have to like think </garnt>
<garnt> about like the weight balance and stuff </garnt>
<garnt> like that yeah and so immediately he </garnt>
<joey> like looked at Chris and was like you're </joey>
<joey> going on twice </joey>
<joey> and he was just like yes of course </joey>
<connor> and then he does those are the first </connor>
<joey> time with me </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] his pants the entire time comes </joey>
<joey> back down he's like I'm not doing this a </joey>
<joey> second time </joey>
<connor> what I've always had was stuff that I'm </connor>
<connor> scared of the moment I've done it once </connor>
<joey> and I found that it's fine yeah I'm like </joey>
<joey> that's great let's do it again yeah </joey>
<joey> right but some people like I guess like </joey>
<joey> Chris or other people I've met it's like </joey>
<connor> they do it and they're like I never want </connor>
<connor> to do that ever again yeah what no I I </connor>
<connor> thought it was safe though like what but </connor>
<connor> that's the thing I I totally get people </connor>
<connor> who do it the first time and maybe they </connor>
<garnt> just like hated it so much they never </garnt>
<garnt> want to do it again likes adrenaline </garnt>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<joey> totally get that but there's a </joey>
<joey> difference between being like I'll do it </joey>
<joey> once and if I like it I won't do it </joey>
<joey> again and yes I'll do it twice it's </joey>
<joey> super easy and like exuding this </joey>
<joey> confidence and it's like and then </joey>
<joey> immediately being like Oh actually never </joey>
<connor> mind I don't want to do it ever again </connor>
<connor> I'm like just make you don't want to do </connor>
<connor> it it's fine like I'll fully admit right </connor>
<connor> here right now I don't want to go bungee </connor>
<connor> jumping like I don't even want to try it </connor>
<connor> because I think I'll just [ __ ] hate </connor>
<connor> it but I'm not gonna like it's not like </connor>
<connor> you're gonna like show false confidence </connor>
<connor> and being like yeah [ __ ] it's because </connor>
<garnt> you haven't done it once yeah </garnt>
<connor> you'll get the taste man I think when </connor>
<connor> you do things once a lot of the time you </connor>
<garnt> realize oh this is not that scary right </garnt>
<garnt> right </garnt>
<joey> I'd never call you like a beta for not </joey>
<joey> wanting to put yourself right doing that </joey>
<garnt> exactly that [ __ ] is scary yeah I mean I </garnt>
<joey> think the thing is with especially like </joey>
<joey> a lot of thrill rides thrill Sports just </joey>
<joey> in general is that I feel like you know </joey>
<connor> as a kid I think you're more up for </connor>
<connor> anything right because you don't have </connor>
<joey> this concept of danger in your mind not </joey>
<joey> as much anyway not as not as much so </joey>
<joey> like I remember you know I tried us I </joey>
<joey> tried our skateboarding and I was like </joey>
<connor> this seems pretty fun everyone everyone </connor>
<connor> seems to love skateboarding I had one </connor>
<connor> bad fall and that's all it took for me </connor>
<connor> to be like I don't want to do the same </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah no I hate this yeah and like </connor>
<connor> similar things I've heard so many </connor>
<connor> similar stories to people who've done </connor>
<garnt> snowboarding skiing as a kid they will </garnt>
<joey> go like [ __ ] Mac 10 or whatever I </joey>
<garnt> don't [ __ ] know and then they have </garnt>
<garnt> like one bad fall and they've just never </garnt>
<connor> recovered from it yeah mentally you know </connor>
<joey> it's that whole mentality of climbing a </joey>
<connor> tree and then you just all it takes is </connor>
<garnt> one fall out of the tree and you're like </garnt>
<connor> I'm never climbing that high up here </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah right and it's the difference </garnt>
<connor> between the kid that learns to never </connor>
<joey> climb that tree again and the kid to go </joey>
<joey> ah that hurt let me try that again yeah </joey>
<connor> I would always do that if I ever [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> up I was just like all right well I </connor>
<joey> could have just said I was that kid </joey>
<joey> where it's like I fell out of the train </joey>
<joey> I'm like I'm never touching a tree ever </joey>
<connor> in my life yeah I could have died there </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] yeah exactly that's why I've never </connor>
<connor> had a broken bone in my body yeah yeah </connor>
<joey> exactly same I have so many bad Falls </joey>
<joey> skiing and snowboarding and I've never </joey>
<connor> broken anything luckily </connor>
<joey> right so it wasn't too bad yeah it </joey>
<joey> depends for me like I've had some bad </joey>
<joey> falls on a on a skateboard and a </joey>
<connor> snowboard and a skateboard like that </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] because you're on concrete yeah </joey>
<garnt> yeah I've got some bad Falls you don't </garnt>
<joey> just get like you get grazes as well </joey>
<joey> which is like the it's I [ __ ] hate </joey>
<joey> unless you don't get Graces on a </joey>
<joey> snowboarder exactly that's why I never </joey>
<joey> wanted to do uh [ __ ] skateboarding it </joey>
<joey> looked so scary yeah oh yeah like I've </joey>
<joey> seen some of the injuries my friends got </joey>
<joey> I was like you know what I'm a throw </joey>
<connor> Seeker but this just doesn't do it or </connor>
<joey> were they padded up uh they probably </joey>
<connor> won't padded up yeah well a few of them </connor>
<connor> are professionals now right I'll do it </connor>
<connor> to this day yeah but like but that's the </connor>
<connor> thing it's like I think there's this </connor>
<connor> like weird thing especially with like </connor>
<connor> skateboarding when you start off where </connor>
<connor> it's like oh [ __ ] I I don't want to be </connor>
<connor> that lame guy with like the knee pads </connor>
<connor> and the elbow pads </connor>
<garnt> like because like all the cool kids all </garnt>
<garnt> the cool skateboarders are just like in </garnt>
<garnt> a shirt and shorts but it's like yeah </garnt>
<garnt> but that's because they're good enough </garnt>
<garnt> to the point now where they're not going </garnt>
<joey> to [ __ ] hurt themselves they know how </joey>
<joey> to fall without injuring themselves they </joey>
<joey> know like how to get out of rough </joey>
<joey> situations and raw Falls right because </joey>
<joey> because they probably started off with </joey>
<joey> the pads like you still see </joey>
<garnt> professionals wearing all the parts if </garnt>
<garnt> Tony Hawk can use pads and helmets then </garnt>
<connor> you can use it yeah exactly okay exactly </connor>
<garnt> I've always wondered you know like </garnt>
<garnt> parkour people yeah yeah how do you </garnt>
<garnt> master the role and not [ __ ] just </garnt>
<garnt> destroying your body you know when they </garnt>
<garnt> roll off like big jumps oh yeah and they </garnt>
<garnt> just like don't get any damage yeah it's </garnt>
<garnt> like do you just practice that indoors a </garnt>
<garnt> bunch on carpet full damage </garnt>
<garnt> they literally like avoid fall damage </garnt>
<connor> and it's with this like this droll [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> that I've seen yeah how the [ __ ] do you </joey>
<joey> do that why are they practicing </joey>
<garnt> gymnasiums right yeah yeah well I think </garnt>
<garnt> that it's uh like a combination of </garnt>
<garnt> practicing on gymnasium and just kind of </garnt>
<connor> like upping your height slowly jumps </connor>
<connor> they hide they jumped on them like even </connor>
<connor> bro even this [ __ ] roll can't pump I </connor>
<garnt> assume they don't jump off a building </garnt>
<garnt> straight away and be like okay either </garnt>
<joey> you uh break your legs or you just don't </joey>
<connor> make the jump when you die I've heard </connor>
<joey> horror stories people like attempting to </joey>
<joey> to do like big jumps and stuff from </joey>
<joey> parkour right away because they're like </joey>
<joey> well this is how you learn </joey>
<joey> I've seen videos of like some Parkour </joey>
<connor> guys where there's like in some </connor>
<joey> countries there's specific gymnasiums </joey>
<joey> four parts oh yeah yeah and so much yeah </joey>
<garnt> yeah I've always wanted to go along you </garnt>
<garnt> want to know the one sport I do not know </garnt>
<joey> how people get into tag huh tag tag </joey>
<joey> extreme tag I've seen that show okay but </joey>
<connor> I can see that though [ __ ] uh is it </connor>
<garnt> longboarding </garnt>
<joey> on a road with cars on it my friend used </joey>
<joey> to do that I'm just like the people who </joey>
<joey> do this must be born without a Fear </joey>
<joey> Factor in their brain they took the </joey>
<joey> amygdala out yeah </joey>
<joey> like you must not feel fear to be able </joey>
<garnt> to [ __ ] do this because Even's just </garnt>
<garnt> seeing GoPro footage I'm like nope this </garnt>
<connor> gives me anxiety yeah yeah because if </connor>
<joey> you lose your balance you're falling </joey>
<garnt> onto calm it's like if a car just comes </garnt>
<joey> exactly right if there's so many points </joey>
<garnt> of danger where you know car could come </garnt>
<garnt> uh you're going as fast as a car and uh </garnt>
<joey> yeah it's kind of like it's like jumping </joey>
<connor> out of a moving car basically yeah </connor>
<joey> and you all you have is a [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> skateboard you go like 70 plus miles an </connor>
<joey> hour </joey>
<joey> you can't no you can't you can break </joey>
<joey> with your body yeah </joey>
<joey> but uh yeah like that's that's one thing </joey>
<joey> where I'm like someone must have been </joey>
<garnt> crazy to invent this sport you know </garnt>
<joey> there are a lot of crazy people out </joey>
<joey> there yeah yeah like you know [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> the concept of like someone like Evil </joey>
<joey> Knievel right it's just like yeah what </joey>
<joey> if I just like took a bike and just like </joey>
<joey> did a 50 [ __ ] meter jump off oh that </joey>
<connor> shit's crazy the people who do the bike </connor>
<joey> like Motocross points yeah like the </joey>
<joey> extreme motor crossing and stuff like </joey>
<joey> that it's like another world it's crazy </joey>
<garnt> it doesn't feel real yeah because like </garnt>
<garnt> you have to you definitely have to be a </garnt>
<garnt> certain type of person a certain type of </garnt>
<garnt> thrill seeker </garnt>
<garnt> um I'm just wondering what kind of what </garnt>
<garnt> what what are the environments that </garnt>
<joey> you're the type of kid right if we go </joey>
<garnt> back to like the falling out of the tree </garnt>
<garnt> analogy people like that are the type of </garnt>
<joey> kids who climb up the tree fall break </joey>
<joey> their arm and they go what if I break </joey>
<joey> another one </joey>
<joey> how many can I do yeah it's like it's </joey>
<connor> like weird jobs you're like how did you </connor>
<connor> get this like you know like deep sea </connor>
<garnt> like cable fixing people oh oh yeah like </garnt>
<garnt> they they [ __ ] they I think you have to </garnt>
<connor> like they you depressurize yeah like a </connor>
<connor> few weeks but you you're like on the </connor>
<connor> floor of the ocean fixing these cables </connor>
<garnt> it's like Twilight Twilight simmers or </garnt>
<connor> swimmers or something something insane </connor>
<connor> there's a really good documentary on </connor>
<connor> Netflix about a bunch of people in </connor>
<connor> Scotland how because they're attached to </connor>
<connor> like an umbilical cord yeah </connor>
<connor> um and I think one of one of the um one </connor>
<connor> of the dudes that Court got stuck oh </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] while they were because the weather </joey>
<joey> was was crazy up top and yeah throwing </joey>
<joey> the boat around pulling this guy around </joey>
<garnt> the floor bed yeah and it's it's crazy </garnt>
<garnt> it's it's like such anxiety yeah and </garnt>
<connor> it's just like this job seems like one </connor>
<connor> why why would you decide to do this like </connor>
<connor> I'm sure the pay is insane yeah but like </connor>
<connor> my God to go to the ocean floor and just </connor>
<garnt> fix oil companies pipes hell no the </garnt>
<garnt> thing is the thing that's awful about </garnt>
<connor> that is that you spend months just go </connor>
<connor> down there oh yeah because because it </connor>
<connor> because it takes so long to depressurize </connor>
<connor> it's </connor>
<connor> it's only financially viable if these </connor>
<connor> divers are just down there for months on </connor>
<connor> end for shifts right so you're just </connor>
<joey> living in a small [ __ ] pressurized </joey>
<joey> cave for months or need to go out to </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] fix cables at the bottom of the </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] ocean I'm like that sounds like </joey>
<joey> the most awful job I can imagine we </joey>
<connor> respect all of you like a huge [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> respect to anyone who does that you guys </garnt>
<joey> are crazy it's like it's like that video </joey>
<connor> of the the guy who I think he works at </connor>
<connor> like a sewerage like facility and he has </connor>
<connor> to like go into the sewage pools to like </connor>
<joey> fix uh like draining issues and [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> like that it's literally just a dude who </joey>
<joey> dives into [ __ ] for a living probably </joey>
<joey> just can't smell it probably not he's </joey>
<connor> just like cuts off his nose it's like </connor>
<connor> it's like jobs where you like where you </connor>
<connor> get exposed to certain things you become </connor>
<connor> an object like chefs who get oil burns </connor>
<connor> on their hands so much that they don't </connor>
<joey> have any feeling left in their fingers </joey>
<joey> yeah right and it's you know there's I </joey>
<connor> think there's a few other ones with like </connor>
<connor> smell where you just get used to it you </connor>
<garnt> just very quickly have to get it the oil </garnt>
<connor> ones make sense because it's kind of </connor>
<connor> like you know when you first pick up a </connor>
<garnt> Guitar you get like calluses eventually </garnt>
<garnt> either your skin hardens you know or </garnt>
<joey> it's like morticians right that like </joey>
<joey> have to deal with dead bodies and you </joey>
<connor> just deal with it you just have to deal </connor>
<connor> with people we're [ __ ] good at </connor>
<garnt> adapting yeah not me other people I I </garnt>
<garnt> think I'm good at sitting here and </garnt>
<connor> talking I think you shouldn't </connor>
<connor> underestimate how adaptable humans are </connor>
<connor> oh no we are yeah just to get used to </connor>
<connor> something that you shouldn't get used to </connor>
<connor> oh God yeah I mean like look at how hot </connor>
<connor> is that </connor>
<joey> how do you get used to that </joey>
<joey> yeah because I remember I saw like a a </joey>
<connor> video about like uh this you know just </connor>
<connor> this mortician who just like goes </connor>
<connor> through his day and just like describes </connor>
<connor> his job and [ __ ] like that on the one on </connor>
<connor> um [ __ ] with his name wired oh there was </connor>
<connor> that one as well everyone [ __ ] loves </connor>
<joey> that yeah that one's that guy's awesome </joey>
<joey> there's a different guy as well yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah there's a different guy and he's </joey>
<joey> just like goes through like daily you </joey>
<joey> know occurrences of a mortician and it's </joey>
<joey> just like yeah so uh today I'm dealing </joey>
<joey> with uh two patients he calls them </joey>
<joey> patience I'm dealing with two patients </joey>
<joey> um that died recently and uh yeah </joey>
<connor> they're basically just doctors oh wait </connor>
<connor> how is it like title doctor or something </connor>
<joey> yeah I think so I don't know well it's </joey>
<connor> kind of like a cross between it's like a </connor>
<connor> cross between a doctor and a makeup </connor>
<connor> artist right because it's like you have </connor>
<connor> to fix the body up obviously yeah but </connor>
<connor> they also have to make the body </connor>
<connor> presentable or a funeral or a coffin </connor>
<connor> it's just like yeah it's just like </connor>
<connor> really cool because like when you think </connor>
<joey> of like mortician you immediately think </joey>
<joey> of like a certain type of person right </joey>
<joey> but then you immediately are just like </joey>
<connor> oh goth kid yeah the goth kids from </connor>
<joey> South Park right it's like but it's like </joey>
<joey> why would you want a job where you do </joey>
<joey> with dead bodies every day but then when </joey>
<joey> you actually like look into it you're </joey>
<joey> just like oh these people are just like </joey>
<connor> every other person yeah I saw one where </connor>
<connor> it was um that one the white dude who </connor>
<connor> mentioned something along the lines of </connor>
<joey> it just makes you appreciate life a lot </joey>
<connor> more yeah because you're working with </connor>
<joey> dead bodies and seeing grieving families </joey>
<joey> a lot and really doing your best to give </joey>
<joey> grieving families a really like </joey>
<joey> appropriate goodbye yeah yeah and in </joey>
<joey> that sense I can understand why you </joey>
<joey> would see it as like okay I like doing </joey>
<joey> this job because I like giving families </joey>
<joey> the opportunity yeah to have the kind of </joey>
<joey> send off they want and giving them that </joey>
<joey> kind of closure morticians are just </joey>
<connor> doctors with no risk exactly you have to </connor>
<joey> close the loop you can't kill your </joey>
<connor> patient if he's already dead </connor>
<connor> yeah I guess yeah I mean I want to thank </connor>
<garnt> those people in the freezer are actually </garnt>
<garnt> alive and they accidentally finish them </garnt>
<garnt> off like cutting them open or something </garnt>
<garnt> who knows who knows that's a horror </garnt>
<garnt> movie you know I'm pretty sure that is a </garnt>
<connor> horror yeah there is a horror movie like </connor>
<connor> that where there's someone who's like </connor>
<garnt> frozen in the morgue thing yeah they're </garnt>
<connor> alive and someone's gonna open them up </connor>
<connor> probably some kind of urban legend no </connor>
<connor> yeah because I saw I saw this tick </connor>
<connor> tocker as well who his job was like a </connor>
<connor> cleaner but his specialty was like </connor>
<connor> cleaning up crime </connor>
<connor> scenesis </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah and I'm just like it's just </joey>
<connor> the way he just talks about cleaning up </connor>
<connor> bits of brains so casually and I'm like </connor>
<connor> man [ __ ] Samuel Jackson didn't </connor>
<garnt> keep his calling Pulp Fiction how how </garnt>

<joey> like watching like a Nile red video </joey>
<connor> unfold behind you you're like Nile not </connor>
<connor> Nile not not now it's not sulfuric acid </connor>
<connor> it's chocolate chip now </connor>
<connor> I don't know it makes you weirdly </connor>
<connor> uncomfortable in a weird way yeah </connor>
<garnt> because sometimes you see the customers </garnt>
<connor> in there and I'm just like it's I would </connor>
<connor> I would be like stop [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> tick-tocking myself I don't give a [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> I want a goddamn sandwich yeah like what </joey>
<garnt> can you make my okay can you imagine can </garnt>
<connor> you imagine these Tick Tock is existing </connor>
<connor> in Japan like like a customer comes in </connor>
<connor> in a Subway or something in Japan and </connor>
<garnt> you're like excuse me may I film a tick </garnt>
<connor> tock while I'm making your Subway I </connor>
<connor> wonder if they ask I I kind of like it </connor>
<connor> though like I like the idea that I do </connor>
<connor> this I'm like can I have a can I have a </connor>
<joey> chicken nugget and a Big Mac meal it's </joey>
<joey> like so I mean this customer came in and </joey>
<joey> asked you for and I'm like yeah because </joey>
<garnt> but the thing is right the thing is you </garnt>
<connor> can clearly see in these tick tocks </connor>
<connor> they're using both hands so the customer </connor>
<connor> comes in and then there must be this guy </connor>
<joey> with a [ __ ] ring with his like phone </joey>
<joey> in front of his face and just like yes </joey>
<joey> he's like yes can I take your order by </joey>
<garnt> the way I'm gonna be filming a tick tock </garnt>
<connor> over your order if that's okay I would </connor>
<joey> like it though I think it'd be safe I'd </joey>
<garnt> love to go to a fast food place and </garnt>
<connor> they're doing it I don't know why I </connor>
<joey> think it's awesome like it's it's like I </joey>
<joey> hope that they have all the permissions </joey>
<joey> to do it so they don't get [ __ ] for it </joey>
<joey> and don't lose their job but yeah I </joey>
<joey> think it's awesome I love this trend of </joey>
<joey> I'm gonna film me doing my job like I </joey>
<joey> feel like every single job is </joey>
<joey> interesting it just it's just about </joey>
<joey> presenting it as interesting oh yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah exactly like there's that dude </joey>
<garnt> who fixes carpets just replaces carpets </garnt>
<garnt> have you seen that guy no dude just like </garnt>
<garnt> I'm not even remotely interested in any </garnt>
<garnt> of this but sometimes I'll just watch </garnt>
<connor> yeah my favorite thing about Tick Tock </connor>
<connor> or this kind of [ __ ] that they do is </connor>
<connor> when they they add something they do do </connor>
<connor> something in the short or The Tick Tock </connor>
<connor> that is just immediately the only thing </connor>
<connor> anyone can focus on and it's has nothing </connor>
<connor> to do with your subject </connor>
<connor> so in this one carpet fixing thing he </connor>
<connor> for some reason he shows b-roll of his </connor>
<connor> fish </connor>
<connor> and it's it's a tiny tiny Fishbowl like </connor>
<connor> the ones you would get at like the </connor>
<connor> dollar store yeah that's efficient just </connor>
<connor> all the comments are like bruh for real </connor>
<connor> you showing us the fish that's being </connor>
<connor> like that's in like a David Blaine skit </connor>
<connor> like like all the comments are just </connor>
<connor> about this thing nobody is talking about </connor>
<connor> him fixing this carpet and there's a </connor>
<connor> bunch of other Tick Tock I can't think </connor>
<connor> of it off my head but you'll watch a </connor>
<joey> video and maybe they'll have like a </joey>
<connor> really big hand or something yeah and </connor>
<joey> all the comments will be like is nobody </joey>
<joey> gonna talk about the hand yeah like I </joey>
<joey> remember this one where this dude shirt </joey>
<joey> is like wedding ring yeah in briefly in </joey>
<connor> a shot and it was on so goddamn tight </connor>
<connor> who's doing something else and all the </connor>
<connor> comments were like this bro about an </connor>
<connor> amputate his finger and he was just </connor>
<joey> literally all that I love that that's </joey>
<connor> yeah that's my favorite part about take </connor>
<connor> time and comments and hence the the </connor>
<garnt> funniness of it yeah what the thing is </garnt>
<garnt> like I think there's a whole sub-genre </garnt>
<connor> of that on Tick Tock where it's just </connor>
<connor> like people doing things narrating about </connor>
<connor> something that's nothing to do with the </connor>
<connor> thing that they're doing oh yeah you </connor>
<connor> know and I think like ironically a time </connor>
<connor> lapse yeah yeah ironically I think what </connor>
<connor> started how this trend started was </connor>
<joey> probably like in the drama Community </joey>
<joey> because like remember like the good old </joey>
<connor> leafy days where it would just be good </connor>
<connor> old yeah the the the good old leafy days </connor>
<joey> where he would just be using like some </joey>
<joey> clips of Cs go surfing yeah and then </joey>
<joey> just talking about dramas like some [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> and I'm like why is the Cs go surfing </connor>
<connor> here what's that got to do with the </connor>
<connor> point of the video it's iconic people </connor>
<connor> but not people still do that people </connor>
<connor> still do that right all they've done is </connor>
<garnt> just replace the CSO go the Cs go </garnt>
<garnt> surfing yeah and then they've replaced </garnt>
<connor> the drama with just anything now yeah my </connor>
<connor> heroic trend is the uh it's like the </connor>
<joey> girls going if you had like two minutes </joey>
<connor> with me what would you do and it's just </connor>
<connor> something completely unrelated I [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> love this have you seen the one with the </joey>
<joey> Geo guesser dude oh yeah yeah you get </joey>
<joey> five minutes with me what would it be </joey>
<connor> this is Angola right here and then we're </connor>
<connor> going to Thailand right now </connor>
<joey> he always answers </joey>
<connor> what answers and then he goes to </connor>
<connor> you [ __ ] love it I just it cracks me </connor>
<joey> up the ones that are like tell me you </joey>
<connor> did this thing without telling me you </connor>
<joey> did this thing and he's like no anyway </joey>
<connor> so we're here in Sweden right now </connor>
<connor> I love this looks like Ecuador all right </connor>
<connor> got it [ __ ] I just yeah I think </connor>
<connor> there's genuinely some really funny tick </connor>
<connor> tocks there there's just so much crazy </connor>
<connor> oh my god dude </connor>
<connor> um [ __ ] I don't even know if I should </connor>
<joey> mention it so I I um </joey>
<connor> found this Tick Tock and </connor>
<connor> um </connor>
<connor> I won't give too many details because I </connor>
<connor> don't want to give it away and I don't </connor>
<connor> want to give them [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> um so I was you know I was none of my </connor>
<connor> own business one of my friends School </connor>
<connor> messages me yeah and he's like bruh look </connor>
<connor> at this I open the tick tock and it's </connor>
<connor> it's it's </connor>
<connor> um </connor>
<joey> it's like a tick tock where there's like </joey>
<joey> a giant age difference right between the </joey>
<joey> couple I think I know what you're </joey>
<joey> talking about and and I'm like oh that's </joey>
<connor> kind of gross it was like 70 and like </connor>
<joey> 20. yeah okay I know I'm exactly what </joey>
<joey> you're talking about and it was like </joey>
<joey> like hey you know me I like all the </joey>
<joey> women you know how it is right age </joey>
<joey> difference you know I don't mean [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> but there's a limit there is a limit to </connor>
<connor> how listen if you're putting the guy in </connor>
<connor> there into a retirement home at 23 you </connor>
<connor> got stuff to worry I mean come on </connor>

<connor> weird timeline yeah I feel like I'm on I </connor>

<joey> no I know exactly how you feel because </joey>
<joey> like it's like when you discover that </joey>
<joey> like this one random person yeah yeah </joey>

<garnt> have skills to work for like </garnt>
<garnt> intelligence agency or something like </garnt>
<connor> that no no it's a different skill set </connor>
<connor> because have you seen how they learn </connor>
<garnt> it's like you learn like oh look out for </garnt>
<garnt> the type of bollards in this country and </garnt>
<garnt> then when you find out the Bollard ah </garnt>
<joey> look you've already lost me yeah is that </joey>
<garnt> what a Bollard is no it's like the like </garnt>
<garnt> the [ __ ] things on the side of the </garnt>
<connor> road that like you know where you just </connor>
<connor> are on the side of the road that like </connor>
<connor> line it sometimes you know like when you </connor>
<connor> land your bike against it or something </connor>
<connor> and sometimes like a pole yeah but like </connor>
<joey> not a big it's a Bollard it's a small </joey>
<joey> kind of stubby one like around like </joey>
<connor> waist yeah yeah yeah oh they're called </connor>
<connor> bollards yeah they're bollards I didn't </connor>
<garnt> know that well you learned something new </garnt>
<connor> every day yeah so you know um like you </connor>
<connor> know let's say every country has very </connor>
<connor> distinct Road patterns and bollards yeah </connor>
<connor> because you're a human being and you're </connor>
<connor> not weird and you don't look for this </connor>
<connor> stuff but obviously you know you can </connor>
<garnt> game it and so while you're looking at </garnt>
<garnt> that you'll notice oh okay so if if </garnt>
<garnt> Africa has these type of bollards and </garnt>
<garnt> Road markings whilst you're studying and </garnt>
<garnt> learning this you'll also just happening </garnt>
<garnt> to look at Africa a lot yeah you know </garnt>
<garnt> you can you can just learn yeah but then </garnt>
<connor> you you inadversely you gain so much </connor>
<connor> knowledge just about like every country </connor>
<joey> you become universally become an expert </joey>
<joey> in like maybe indirectly like the </joey>
<joey> infrastructure the buildings of like </joey>
<joey> every [ __ ] time yeah yeah if he if he </joey>
<joey> can recognize an image within like 0.1 </joey>
<joey> seconds or something he can Garner that </joey>
<garnt> much information that just means to </garnt>
<garnt> Garner that much information in such a </garnt>
<garnt> short amount of time that must be my </garnt>
<garnt> wealth of knowledge that he can be able </garnt>
<connor> to like yeah yeah um but I imagine the </connor>
<connor> computer can do it better though if you </connor>
<connor> took a picture of any place fed into a </connor>
<connor> computer there's I bet it could probably </connor>
<connor> get it more accurate than this well you </connor>
<joey> could probably just like reverse Google </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah I mean you know there's so </connor>
<connor> much images of [ __ ] online you know and </connor>
<connor> you know these geoguesses are like you </connor>
<connor> know if they if the geoguessor isn't in </connor>
<connor> the country which are a lot of countries </connor>
<garnt> oh yeah yeah you just have no knowledge </garnt>
<garnt> of that country yeah you're like Giga </garnt>
<garnt> brained at like Mexico but China comes </garnt>
<garnt> up you're like </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know yeah well it's funny </garnt>
<garnt> because like you I you look at something </garnt>
<connor> like geoguessr and you would never </connor>
<connor> imagine that there would be people with </connor>
<connor> this good at just like knowing and </connor>
<connor> recognizing the world yeah true but turn </connor>
<connor> it into a game oh and people will break </connor>
<connor> the system you know what I mean oh yeah </connor>
<connor> as soon as there's a game and a high </connor>
<garnt> score people you can inadvertently just </garnt>
<garnt> get skills that you would never ever </garnt>
<garnt> think about getting through just like </garnt>
<connor> traditional education systems which is </connor>
<connor> such a good game like yeah like the </connor>
<connor> concept of it is really solid yeah and </connor>
<connor> it's like anyone can you know again if a </connor>
<connor> game is is able to be understood by like </connor>
<connor> my parents within like 10 seconds of </connor>
<joey> explaining it's a fantastic game yeah </joey>
<joey> and it's a fantastic viewing experience </joey>
<joey> as well like watching someone struggle </joey>
<joey> with Geo guesser is fun because you are </joey>
<joey> you have your own thoughts right like </joey>
<joey> you're like oh I think it's here or it's </joey>
<joey> the country of your residence yeah or </joey>
<joey> you're just like oh my God I can't </joey>
<joey> believe it I live here you know every </joey>
<connor> time like [ __ ] Luxembourg comes up </connor>
<connor> you're like [ __ ] you Luxembourg people </connor>
<connor> for having a country that looks the same </connor>
<joey> as every other country around it and </joey>
<joey> then that one luxembourgie in the chat </joey>
<connor> is like how Dave yeah laughs in high GDP </connor>
<connor> yeah no but like what was I gonna say </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] I have a but like I had a thought </connor>
<joey> and then it just like [ __ ] evaporated </joey>
<joey> I definitely do want to play G I guess </joey>
<connor> though dude you should it's so fun it's </connor>
<connor> it's as fun as you think it is like it </connor>
<garnt> oh yeah it's like you're like you you </garnt>
<garnt> watch someone you play it and you're </garnt>
<garnt> like I think I'll have fun playing this </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and yeah and you do because it's a </garnt>
<garnt> fun game yeah because </garnt>
<garnt> could could you like one of the big </garnt>
<garnt> things right Geo guess is another game </garnt>
<garnt> uh language learning I think people have </garnt>
<garnt> tried to gamify language learning you </garnt>
<garnt> see that a lot in duoling yeah right do </garnt>
<garnt> you think there are like some skills </garnt>
<garnt> that just can't be gamified like </garnt>
<garnt> language learning </garnt>
<connor> depends to the on the person I'd say </connor>
<garnt> right I think some people can really </garnt>
<connor> learn super fast that way yeah and other </connor>
<connor> people just will not do anything for </connor>
<joey> them yeah because learning languages is </joey>
<joey> is so hard yeah it's a completely </joey>
<garnt> different side of like your learning um </garnt>
<connor> compared to other stuff like learning </connor>
<connor> physics or learning this it's a whole </connor>
<connor> nother like it's a complete section I </connor>
<joey> think of thought yeah it's a completely </joey>
<joey> different type of skill that I think </joey>
<connor> just exists on multiple levels like you </connor>
<connor> know just just learning vocab and like </connor>
<connor> sentence structure is not the end or be </connor>
<connor> awful language right like you if you </connor>
<connor> don't have an understanding of how that </connor>
<connor> language is used based on the culture </connor>
<joey> that it the language comes from then </joey>
<connor> you're just like then you're no </connor>
<connor> different to a dictionary yeah I mean </connor>
<connor> English has always just been a </connor>
<connor> suggestion it's always been just a tool </connor>
<connor> to get whatever point we want to cross </connor>
<connor> and like everything is broken no no </connor>
<connor> because our languages have like very </connor>
<connor> rigid rules English is literally just </connor>
<connor> made to be [ __ ] construed into </connor>
<connor> whatever we need it to be yeah think </connor>
<connor> about half the show should we say in </connor>
<connor> English it doesn't make any [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> sense yeah like and new words added all </connor>
<connor> the time but also the way that some of </connor>
<connor> the the old words are used are like okay </connor>
<connor> I guess like that that doesn't make much </connor>
<garnt> sense but okay we'll roll with it yeah </garnt>
<garnt> like one thing that blows my mind is </garnt>
<garnt> where a language has a law in that </garnt>
<garnt> language that completely changes the way </garnt>
<garnt> like you think so I believe that like </garnt>
<garnt> there's a language that is using like by </garnt>
<garnt> the Aborigines in like Australia right </garnt>
<garnt> where instead of using directions AKA </garnt>
<joey> you know up down left right and </joey>
<joey> everything oh they refer to it absolute </joey>
<joey> Direction in absolute Direction so by </joey>
<joey> having a language that is just </joey>
<joey> pre-programmed with absolute Direction </joey>
<garnt> like north south east west you have to </garnt>
<garnt> like just have you have to like mentally </garnt>
<joey> have a compass with you all of the time </joey>
<joey> so explain absolute direction from my </joey>
<garnt> understanding it's like you don't have a </garnt>
<garnt> left and right hand you have a East and </garnt>
<garnt> West hand yeah if you're facing North </garnt>
<garnt> yeah exactly but if you're not wasting </garnt>
<garnt> if you're not facing north then you have </garnt>
<garnt> a north and south yeah exactly and it's </garnt>
<joey> like that's just like oh my God like I </joey>
<joey> have to be aware of which way I'm facing </joey>
<joey> in order to tell you that I am holding </joey>
<connor> something in this hand exactly yeah </connor>
<garnt> which absolutely like blows my mind but </garnt>
<connor> that's just a thing also what happens if </connor>
<connor> you just trap them in like a box room or </connor>
<connor> something </connor>
<connor> maybe they'd have a hunch they just have </connor>
<joey> like a magnet in there </joey>
<connor> I I forgot I'm the whole English Point </connor>
<connor> as well you know because grammar is like </connor>
<connor> optional in English a lot of the time </connor>
<connor> yeah it's really not necessary for </connor>
<connor> English to function it doesn't really </connor>
<connor> need any grammar yeah as stupid as it </connor>
<connor> sounds </connor>
<connor> you can get it's all just about getting </connor>
<connor> a point across in English it doesn't </connor>
<garnt> matter how you do it well I I think </garnt>
<garnt> that's true for like most languages </garnt>
<joey> right like grammar is in like well like </joey>
<joey> sentence structure and [ __ ] or yeah you </joey>
<joey> can just break sentences oh yeah of </joey>
<joey> course and it works like in other </joey>
<joey> languages it doesn't work I I call it I </joey>
<joey> call it speaking Google search bar yeah </joey>
<connor> because like the Japanese is so context </connor>
<connor> heavy that that you messing up the </connor>
<connor> structure of a sentence could lose </connor>
<joey> context </joey>
<joey> in some cases but I would also like to </joey>
<connor> think that English does that as well </connor>
<connor> maybe yeah maybe if you said Pineapple </connor>
<joey> eat hungry then you'd be like who well </joey>
<connor> who is it you yeah me and Japanese can </connor>
<connor> be the same way I know that Welsh isn't </connor>
<connor> as flexible to be broken as English is </connor>
<connor> and I at least that's all I know and at </connor>
<connor> least the very little Japanese I do know </connor>
<garnt> it feels that way yeah I mean I think in </garnt>
<garnt> some ways Japanese is like even more </garnt>
<garnt> flexible than English in some ways </garnt>
<joey> um oh yeah because you don't have to </joey>
<connor> stress about who the subject of the </connor>
<garnt> matter is in a lot of ways like in </garnt>
<garnt> English it's like I did something or you </garnt>
<garnt> did something yeah they did something </garnt>
<garnt> yeah but in Japanese you can just say </garnt>
<connor> did something that you can just base </connor>
<joey> based on the context of that sentence </joey>
<joey> you have a pretty good idea of who or </joey>
<garnt> what they're referring to how do you </garnt>
<garnt> know someone is learning Japanese they </garnt>
<joey> use watashiwa yeah you know no one uses </joey>
<joey> no one says watashiwa yeah so you just </joey>
<garnt> say yeah yeah yeah exactly it's it's </garnt>
<garnt> it's very it's very context everywhere </garnt>
<connor> you know because we learn from it in </connor>
<connor> English where I say I am going somewhere </connor>
<connor> instead of just going here yeah it's uh </connor>
<garnt> yeah I mean every language is different </garnt>
<garnt> and a lot of it I mean I </garnt>
<garnt> now that I've Speak two languages and </garnt>
<garnt> you're learning a third they're flexible </garnt>
<garnt> in like different ways you know I feel </garnt>
<garnt> like English has a lot of advantages </garnt>
<garnt> especially when it comes to just </garnt>
<garnt> expressing slang especially I I feel </garnt>
<connor> like you can make a sentence with just </connor>
<connor> words that have never been made and you </connor>
<connor> can or like words that just don't </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] exist yeah and you can get your </garnt>
<connor> point across very easily yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> exactly look at the North my dad uses </connor>
<connor> words and I'm like you just make [ __ ] up </connor>
<connor> yeah but I know what he's saying yeah </connor>
<connor> it's like like what you just like it's </connor>
<connor> just like instead of like </connor>
<connor> um you know I don't know you just makes </connor>
<connor> stuff up all the time it's so </connor>
<joey> frustrating is he making stuff up or is </joey>
<joey> he just saying something that exists </joey>
<connor> that you just don't know no no he's like </connor>
<connor> I can't think of a good example but like </connor>
<connor> everything has to be shortened or </connor>
<garnt> construed differently but like some </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes it just makes sense you know </garnt>
<garnt> because it's the feeling you know like I </garnt>
<connor> remember before did I have that huh does </connor>
<garnt> Ty have that because last doesn't really </garnt>
<joey> have that you can't really </joey>
<connor> we're just changing the words in the con </connor>
<connor> and you still understand the sentence </connor>
<garnt> yeah nowhere nowhere near as much as </garnt>
<garnt> English because I remember like </garnt>
<garnt> I remember when you know people started </garnt>
<garnt> using the word drip and I remember like </garnt>
<connor> the very first time I heard someone use </connor>
<connor> the word drip and not refer to like </connor>
<connor> water or liquid you know remember those </connor>
<connor> days </connor>
<connor> we're like I remember some I remember </connor>
<connor> like damn he got drip and I saw the </connor>
<connor> picture and I immediately understood oh </connor>
<connor> it's because he's talking about clothing </connor>
<connor> and I don't know why that just like </connor>
<connor> clicked in myself immediately but I got </connor>
<joey> it you know I I got it I immediately got </joey>
<joey> damn bussing I immediately got why yeah </joey>
<joey> you know like I never heard that word </joey>
<connor> before but like I understood the the </connor>
<connor> meaning of that word just by the context </connor>
<connor> it was being used in it was like it </connor>
<garnt> wasn't just like me guessing it was like </garnt>
<garnt> for some reason that just makes sense </garnt>
<connor> yeah that's I think that's just one of </connor>
<garnt> the strengths of English is that the </garnt>
<garnt> vernacular is really easy to understand </garnt>
<connor> if if you're uh if you have a native </connor>
<joey> experience yeah like you don't need to </joey>
<joey> be like ingrained in a certain like </joey>
<joey> click to understand that particular time </joey>
<garnt> yeah yeah yeah exactly oh that's </garnt>
<connor> interesting the advantages of English </connor>
<connor> English is very open that's why English </connor>
<joey> is one of the most difficult languages </joey>
<connor> to learn yeah well that's the thing </connor>
<joey> constantly making up new words and we're </joey>
<connor> constantly breaking grammatical I had to </connor>
<connor> explain like copium to a Japanese person </connor>
<connor> and I was like okay like this is a lot </connor>
<joey> yeah like I don't realize how and I like </joey>
<joey> when I explained this it's gonna it's </joey>
<joey> not gonna make it makes you sound stupid </joey>
<joey> it's gonna make me sound dumb but that's </joey>
<joey> just how it is like you we just use </joey>
<connor> words that don't exist and then we drop </connor>
<connor> them but like I don't know why we do it </connor>
<joey> yeah we just do this it's not until you </joey>
<joey> think about it or you have to explain it </joey>
<connor> to someone where English isn't their </connor>
<connor> first language like I remember I had to </connor>
<connor> explain to my Japanese cousin what this </connor>
<connor> was yeah and she was like what is this </connor>
<garnt> and I'm like yeah that's a good [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> question what the hell is that it's like </connor>
<connor> they're air quotes but like how do you </connor>
<joey> explain how do you how you use it </joey>
<joey> specifically oh [ __ ] it's like you know </joey>
<joey> what it is like suspicious and you know </joey>
<joey> when to use it when you don't know how </joey>
<garnt> to explain why that works I can't I know </garnt>
<garnt> how to explain it to someone who speaks </garnt>
<joey> English but yeah okay but how do you </joey>
<garnt> explain it to someone who doesn't know </garnt>
<garnt> the concept of what this is when a word </garnt>
<connor> is sus that's how I would explain it </connor>
<connor> starts with the money and then I was </connor>
<connor> like wait now now I have to explain </connor>
<connor> what's up </connor>
<connor> suspicious yeah it's literally </connor>
<garnt> suspicious </garnt>
<connor> are you trying to make are you trying to </connor>
<connor> make Sasha more of a word than it is </connor>
<joey> this makes more sense because it's just </joey>
<connor> a shortening of the word suspicious </connor>
<connor> right but like if you were trying to </connor>
<connor> explain like to someone uh it's lit Fame </connor>
<garnt> right like you're not gonna say like oh </garnt>
<garnt> oh it's a it's a family that's on fire </garnt>
<garnt> like no that's not what it means it </garnt>
<garnt> means something completely different to </garnt>
<garnt> what it acts like drip right yeah yeah </garnt>
<joey> like how do you explain drip to someone </joey>
<garnt> who's not an English speaker oh I guess </garnt>
<garnt> it's drip is easy to explain the con the </garnt>
<joey> meaning is just someone who dresses </joey>
<joey> why do we use the word drip I don't know </joey>
<garnt> see I don't know why we use it but to me </garnt>
<garnt> it just feels right it makes sense do </garnt>
<connor> you have these words in Japanese that </connor>
<connor> come up with like the flavor of the </connor>
<joey> month words and leave I mean yes but I </joey>
<connor> feel a lot of it is derived from like </connor>
<connor> slang or internet slang that has some </connor>
<joey> you know uh derivation to it that came </joey>
<joey> from like some kind of like meme or </joey>
<joey> whatever like a lot of the words are </joey>
<joey> from like two-chan speak right where </joey>
<joey> it's like there's some posts from </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] the Linguistics that was just </connor>
<joey> like one guy started using it and then </joey>
<joey> someone was like oh yeah that's pretty </joey>
<joey> cool it's like sometimes sometimes in </joey>
<joey> English you just find words like drip </joey>
<joey> where </joey>
<joey> um it's like put on a piece of clothing </joey>
<joey> you've never worn before and it just </joey>
<joey> perfectly fits and you don't know why </joey>
<joey> but it just like it's just like yeah </joey>
<garnt> that works why does that work I don't </garnt>
<joey> know why xiaomi Vu yeah </joey>
<connor> not this [ __ ] again anyway I'm sure </connor>
<garnt> there are some linguists in the uh </garnt>
<connor> Records that can answer our questions </connor>
<connor> yeah but uh maybe some polygots through </connor>
<connor> like 10 languages let us know yeah yeah </connor>
