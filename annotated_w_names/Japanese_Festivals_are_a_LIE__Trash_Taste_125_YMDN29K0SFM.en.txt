<SPEAKER_01> they get here and I'm like actually you </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_04> boys you know I gotta prioritize work </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> sorry guys you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's the greatest that's the great </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thing about trash taste because if if it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was just like your own channel then it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> on you you know you choose your own </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> schedule we're trash teeth we've got a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> team I don't want to let the boys down </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you know and they're like why don't you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> want the rest of the boys I'm like oh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know they're busy as well </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah but uh yeah took the uh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> safety third people out last weekend and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> do you know what I realized </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um after people have started coming in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> where you're not gonna you're not gonna </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> experience this Joey because you already </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are you already can speak Japanese but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because people are starting to come in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they everyone assumes that you're only </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> hunger Josie now because you've lived </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> here no but I mean I you speak a little </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> bit that sounds like a YouTuber like he </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was doing a lot of speaking for me it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> was I was doing a lot of asking a bunch </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of questions when Emily first came here </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> as well I was talking a lot for her yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and on the first few days and she's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> she's like well you're so good at this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like no no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> say one thing yeah I'm guessing like I I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I'm having like conversations </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but obviously any conversation at all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when you don't speak the language seems </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like nuts yeah yeah but when you're you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> know when you when you're with someone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who understands it you're like bro why </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> are you doing like a two-year-old so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what you're telling me is that it was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the first time you actually felt like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you had to be the token translator yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah because because it was the first </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you for the menus that are handwritten </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> can't you yeah but like the problem is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Joey I'm nowhere near even close to your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> level but people are assuming that I am </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> your level so people so people people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> like hanging out with them obviously </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like first thing you do you go to the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> taxi you tell them where to go and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people are like yo what the [ __ ] your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Japanese is so good and I'm like I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> literally just said please stop here sir </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> here is okay please stop here yeah and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then they get like a lot of people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ask me oh how do you say this in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Japanese how'd you say that in Japanese </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and like some of the things I do know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I know for a fact that there there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is like a Japanese way to say it and I'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> doing like the most Brute Force direct </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> translation I can think of of my like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> baby Japanese yeah do you know what it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is though that I have found it's it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> not about like whether you have like an </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> extensive vocab or anything like that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's I feel like confidence oh yeah it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> shows such a long way no because like if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> you confidently without like even a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> shadow of a doubt walk up to a Japanese </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> person and just start speaking in the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> most broken ass Japanese ever like oh me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> hungry food like but if you say it with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> absolute confidence like like a game </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> face and people see that they're just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> like damn </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah I had that happen yeah yeah that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> was not good but it but it's bad right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because like sure it might look cool to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> your Foreigner friends who don't know a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> word of Japanese but then that Japanese </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> person will probably also to feel the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> same way being like Oh damn this guy's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> good at Japanese I'm just going to start </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> speaking at a normal pace and then the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> moment they reciprocate to that you're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> just like I'm like you know like because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> being living in Japan you have certain </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> scripts for certain places yeah you've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> heard it a million times it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> playing a visual novel I wouldn't know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> how that feels but I'm actually just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like you played like a million times you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> know all the dialogue options and The </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Roots yeah exactly well that's kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like learning languages in general you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know that's that's it's just picking up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> patterns yeah you pick up patterns </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> um and if something goes out of that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> pattern then you're kind of like a dear </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> panic because here's the thing right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> normally you know when you're by </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yourself you know sometimes you're just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not in the mood to go challenge yourself </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to go out of your comfort zone or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> something but when you're showing people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> around Japan you got that pressure on of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> course because I look around I'm like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> surely there's someone morning hunger </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Jersey than me no [ __ ] I'm the hunger </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Josie guy here [ __ ] it's me that's got </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> to sort everything out okay I think it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> also worse when you're the one who like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> reluctantly is like yeah I'll show you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> guys around right and so you're already </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> suiting that like yeah yeah confidence </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then when you're actually in the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> spot you're like [ __ ] I have to show </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> them around </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know what to do so so one thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> they were all looking for a place to eat </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so um </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where did you take them uh I took them </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to an or you can eat uh Yakiniku place </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> okay yeah yeah because what I've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> realized I asked Maylin where I should </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> take them and she gave me a bunch of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like recommendations and I was just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't think this would be suitable for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> a group of like 12. yeah right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everything becomes like 500 times harder </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when you have more than six people in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Japan yeah oh easily yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you either have to go an all-you-can-eat </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> place or an Izakaya yeah it's like no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> other choice yeah and I was just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> life hack you were cheering someone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> around Japan they've never been to Japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for if they've been here once go to an </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all you can eat place and that will </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> impress them yeah you know just it's so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's so easy yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Japanese hot pot or you can eat and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's like it's insane I've never even </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> been there before have you not no bro </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> it's so good there's like a there's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a billion of them in Shinjuku yeah I was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> impressed dude it's nuts it's like 40 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bucks no it's not even 40 bucks 40 four </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thousand yen to like 30 something bucks </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah you can and then you get all you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can eat as much food as you want and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then all you want all you can drink for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> two hours it's like eight dollars or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> something or like ten bucks </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it's actually just like what are we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> doing exactly how are these places </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> making money I I I I that's because they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> don't know that's because they don't you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> know they're not used to foreigners I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> think because the big thing sound do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> music exactly because the big thing I've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> noticed especially after taking more </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people out to all you can eat places is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that when Japanese people here all you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> can eat it's all you want to eat when </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you hear like an America when you change </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it to all you can eat yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah yeah what do you take an </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> American or a British person or most </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people in the west to an all you can eat </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> place it is a challenge right it is not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a all you want or you're comfortable to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> eat it is how much can my stomach expand </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> before like how how quickly can I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bankrupt this place to make them feel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like they made them the biggest mistake </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of their life to make something called </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> all you can eat that is true actually </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> like I've been to enough Buffets in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Vegas now to know that like seeing like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> seeing Americans in a buffet is like you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> think like the apocalypse is coming </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> where they're just like I was like are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you about to fast for three days like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> why are you eating so much I don't even </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> enjoy it like yeah I just I get to a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> point where I'm like full and I'll just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> push like 30 beyond that yeah just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because I'm like well </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I may as well and it's like but yeah no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> other situation would I ever order this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> much for you no I would I would have cut </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it off like years ago yeah man so so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like we went to this all week in a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yakaniki place and immediately we sit we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sit down and I haven't I haven't like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> had this mindset in a while but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> immediately they start asking me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> questions right because they start </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> asking me what the rules of the game are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you know like okay hypothetically if we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> over order by hypothetically </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hypothetically speaking if we over order </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> by four plates of food will they charge </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> us for it and I'm like I I don't I don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really know because that's never really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> happens but I mean I'm sure you could </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> play The Foreigner card and so they're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like great that's all we need to know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> they order like a [ __ ] ton of food and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like here's the thing normally this all </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you can eat Yakiniku plays they have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like it's like real coals right so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> normally uh this restaurant have placed </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> enough coals in this barbecue to last </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you for about the two hours right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> normally it's it's like perfectly timed </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so you have enough time to eat the food </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then by the time the two hour ends </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the calls we kind of died out well </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that'll be fine because you're like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you'll be like oh I'll take like one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> more plate or something like that yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> not not with these guys so we we get to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like an hour and a half in and the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> waiter comes over and it's just like oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> last order's in about like five ten </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> minutes would you like to order anything </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> else </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> like it was like me Sydney uh Liberty </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> who's a Content producer you know that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> there's like you know the more Japanese </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Centric table that have that you have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that Common Sense acclimated with the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> culture and then there's the boys on the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> other side the safety third boys they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hear the last orders coming in and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> they're they're like um can we order </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like 10 more plates and also can we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> change the coals and I think it would it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wasn't ordering the 10 more plates yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it was the request to change the calls </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right right because I don't like I don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> think in the history of this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> establishment anyone's asked to change </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the calls 30 minutes before last orders </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are coming in they're like the wage is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like what you you want me to you want me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to change the calls what what I I don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> understand why don't you why do you want </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> to change the calls and so there's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's us there's us the Japanese </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> residence on one side just being like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm so full I'm so full and then there's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the American boys on the other side 15 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> minutes in and they're getting like 10 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> more plates of meat I'm like how the F </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> how are you doing this what the [ __ ] so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> did they did they even like put a dent </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> in that or they [ __ ] finished it they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it like like I said it was a challenge </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it wasn't he like it was it was they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wanted to make a statement right they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wanted to make a statement that this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> establishment was a [ __ ] idiot right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they love breaking news yeah yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> they're like if I'm not bankrupting this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> place then uh then I've done something </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> wrong no wonder all you can eat places </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> don't [ __ ] last in the US yeah I feel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like that's a mindset thing that we get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> like born into like I I the first time I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> went to all you can eat in Japan I I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know you can drink I'm like I gotta I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> gotta I'm taking this I'm taking the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> weights off yeah I'm going in yeah and I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't know why like why do I immediately </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hear a reasonably priced buffet and I'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like instead of making this into a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> normal meal where I'm probably gonna get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my money's worth anyway I'm just gonna </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> try and ruin myself and ruin this such a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> weird psychology isn't it because it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like there's no pressure it's not like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> you're losing money yeah I think also </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like a big thing is just when you're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> obviously they're traveling around when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're just in Holiday mode oh the rules </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know holiday mode the rules are off </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know you're not trying to look after </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> you I'm sure it will be the opposite if </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> we went to the US yo actually there's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Buffets in Vegas look insane I've heard </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> them Fox yeah they're like like Gourmet </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> buffets or something yeah only America </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> would they want to bastardize food there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> man so they're like let's do it yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like when we went to LA I went to so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> many [ __ ] all you can eat Korean </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> barbecues because that's the one [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> thing one [ __ ] thing I miss about La </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which is the Korean barbecue there is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> amazing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um and I you know like luckily or </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> unluckily the rules are a bit more </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> strict there because they have a bit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> more people who are let's say over order </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> so they're like you have to you'd have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to have those rules yeah if you if you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> they're like if you order like one play </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> over we're gonna charge you I've noticed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that actually not a lot of Japanese I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> think I've been to like maybe one place </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where they like charge you if you don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> finish your food that you order extra </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> off but like for the most part yeah I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> think Japanese people are more sensible </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and being like I'll order what I can eat </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah a lot of places where I'll probably </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just like if you're like one plate left </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> over they're like ah all right yeah all </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> right but obviously you know I'm just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> thinking like I'm just thinking of the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> situation that both that rule yeah you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> know like what what what person went to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like an all-you-can-eat Korean barbecue </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's just like oh yeah so you kind of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just left like 40 kilograms of meat on </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and I remember like it's normally right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> obviously Jackie niku writes poles and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> stuff so there's a lot of smoke yes yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> um we go there at like five o'clock at </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just open middle of nowhere inside to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Martin legit middle of nowhere right um </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and we go in and this is pretty big </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> restaurant for where what I thought was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> a big ration for where it was so we walk </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and the staff are immediately like whoa </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> foreign </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> cook the food yep and I noticed that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like the fan isn't on to like suck out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> all the the smoke yeah yeah and so I'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like I'm like oh I'm like should we ask </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> him Chris to turn it on it's like it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> kind of a lot of smoke yeah and the guy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> comes over and we're like hey um could </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_05> and he's like yeah of course just walks </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> away </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> and then and then I it starts to kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> build up yeah and I suddenly look around </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the corner and there's just smoke </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> everywhere in this building okay right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I'm like when are they gonna come </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_00> 12 years yeah there was 12 of us right I </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> place but the yakaniki place I chose was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a brand you know it was a chain </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's uh there's only a few Q yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not Georgian I I forgot what it was but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember phoning up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember finding one of the branches </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was phoning up and asking if they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> had space for 12. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um and they did you know it was it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was all good you know I was like no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> way as he did yeah yeah they did they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> did I was like I was like confidently I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can I can [ __ ] do this all of my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> years in Japan have built up to this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> moment I can do this I like it's I've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've booked tables before I've like I'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> very satisfying yeah yeah very satisfied </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> booking tables </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> um I kind of know the script and I kind </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of know how to go off scripted just in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> case so I asked if they have space for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 12. they go great I ask if we can split </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> into tables just in case because it's a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> big group and they're like that's that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no problem at all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um I asked for the time I asked for 6 30 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and uh they said they don't have a space </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for 6 30. uh can you do space at 8 30 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm like sure that's okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um and then they said something that I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> didn't understand and I was like [ __ ] I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> was like what's so important [ __ ] I was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> doing doing so well and you know you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know how you know how when how does the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> game of Pluto began </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> thus the Sherlock game begins right so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> your kids here's here's what it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> being not exactly you know learning a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> language and knowing some words for not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> knowing the entire context of what's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> being said you recognize some words and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> within that you try to infer what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they're trying to say now normally this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is much easier when you're in person </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> because you've got you know body </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> language you've got hand signals you've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> got more context clues it's ten times </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> harder on the phone right uh because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you've got you got nothing but just you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know your listening skills </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and so what I heard was I heard uh can I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> confirm and I and uh and she said which </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> one and then something I was like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> whichever menu you wanted this or you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> need to be yeah so I was like great it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> must be that one and I was like can I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have the menu That's the middles the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> middle uh the middle menu please </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and she was like and [ __ ] I heard a PO I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> heard a pause </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was like oh no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> oh no not Instagram I was like I have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> chosen the wrong dialogue I'm correct I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> have chosen the wrong dialogue option </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] and she was like uh no no I and she </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> she tries and then here's where like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> goes here's like if I'd chosen the right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> dialogue option it's like great [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> great genius no hunger josu hello yeah I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> choose the wrong dialogue option I've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> opened up another dialogue tree with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> even more complex dialogue options and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've just gotten myself into a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> mess you've opened up the explanation </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you found the Elden ring boss </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> basically so she says uh no no no no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um just uh and and then she she starts </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> going into even more complex like goes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> into detail it goes into detail about it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and I just like I understand even less </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_05> train station right it was like it was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so so we had we we went in and it was it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was Tiny all right I was expecting us to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> be able to like walk around there'd be </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like different events there'd be </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> different shops I was waiting to get </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like my [ __ ] yucky sober get my like </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> none of that none of that right there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> was one stand for shaved ice and that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was the longest queue of this entire </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Festival right right it was even a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> festival at that point or is it a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> glorified </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Street show </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean it kind of was just okay I went </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> to like the Compton of summer festivals </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> basically basically we were me and like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all of us are starting there we spend </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> more time waiting for our yukatas than </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it would have taken to go through </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> everything in this [ __ ] Festival </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> right this this festival and we were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> just waiting in line to get our like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yakisoba and as we're waiting in this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> line because there was like gated off </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and we see like railway tracks and every </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> like 10 10 minutes of the show uh 10 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> minutes or so we'd have this like really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know it wasn't even like atmospheric </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right because every 10 minutes or so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you'd have the train going </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> laughs </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I know and I was just like I got [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> dressed up for this so so why did you go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> to this one another good one uh because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> apparently like all the good ones are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> way like you have to travel like an hour </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> or two outside of the city yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah I saw a big one not too far from </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where I live that was decently way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> bigger than the one you guys sent </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's a couple of big ones I've been </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> to as well but the problem is is that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> it's either way too incredibly packed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah or especially during like the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> covert season they like really limit the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> space true yeah the amount of people so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like the the they sometimes like ticket </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> these places now yeah so it's like you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can't just like rock up to these places </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> anymore yeah so this place was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> incredibly small and also incredibly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> packed oh yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um there was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> how sweaty were you I was oh it was so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] sweaty okay there's poor rentals </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah you must have given them a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] like damp rag bro I'm pretty </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> sure they had to incinerate all of our </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you know I felt so bad right and I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> wasn't even like the most sweaty one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there was like everyone was like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sweating through their [ __ ] colors </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm I'm so glad that they give you like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> space between like your pets because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> holy [ __ ] if if if it was like a t-shirt </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like it would our pits would be would </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have been absolutely [ __ ] stained </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> gross and I was like there was like one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> long line I was hoping this was like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> actually something cool maybe it was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like a mini game or something yeah um </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> like I could see everyone lining up to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> this one [ __ ] queue yeah and I was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like oh cool maybe you know you didn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know what you're lining up for no but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you just joined a line I I I joined the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> line for like five minutes and I thought </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I thought it must have been British </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people when they try and have fun </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it might it must be something cool it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> must be something that was fun yeah that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> was funny I I joined in life and then I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> realized wait all right I realized five </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> minutes in I should probably check what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> this line is for so I get Sydney over </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Sydney wait here in line just in case </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's something cool yeah maybe it's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe it's like one of the shooty games </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> somebody's like the Goldfish thing I go </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> up right and this is by far the longest </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> line where you'd have to wait in line </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for about 30 minutes to get to the front </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] balloon </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> balloon kids can go there and buy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> balloons </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and kids were waiting 30 plus minutes to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> go to this one stall to buy balloons and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that was the highlight of this Festival </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> now that's not even like traditionally </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Japanese you can you can get a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you can do that at Disneyland as well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they sell one dollars </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it wasn't even like a paper balloon like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just like a regular ass like plastic </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> balloon or </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> a lot it's like the stall was like it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> literally touchable so basically so once </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> you like you get like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you know I wanted to go to this last </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> year but I was sick but I think I dodged </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it bullet you kind of did actually so we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we actually we went we went there we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> stayed for like 30 minutes and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> immediately like we were like can we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> leave just 30 minutes yeah because it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was literally there was nothing to do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there there was literally nothing to do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that and uh the only reason we stayed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was because mailing was like an hour </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> late so we're like oh I guess we gotta </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wait for May Lin uh but there was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> one Saving Grace to this Festival </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which is uh it wasn't there well there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was nothing happening at the beginning </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but there was a stage where you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> where music was being played and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> everything like that the dance around it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah where they dance around it is is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> there a name for that can you explain </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what the tradition is like uh yeah so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they're basically at the bigger </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> festivals what they do is uh they build </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this giant really really high stage </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> usually it's like I don't know five ten </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> meters up in the air yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um and then they do this dance usually </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at the end of the festival where they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> light a fire </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> um and then there are stage performers </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> up on stage and then basically everyone </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> around them they're just dancing like in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> a clockwise like kind of circle dance </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah it's probably one of the most </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like common types of festivals like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> there's some [ __ ] wacky festivals out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> there but I'd say that's probably the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> most common one yeah so there was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> something there was there was one at </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> this Festival that we went to and there </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_02> sticks where they do like the glowy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> dance so they had that kind of dance </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they were trying they were trying to get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people to like join along with but they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone just kind of used their [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fans to like join along and it was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the most okay here's how you could tell </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who the Brits in the crowd were okay so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there was like so everyone was like kind </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of like going along with their stance </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> going along with this Idol concert </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um and then I I was like ah this is this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is this is a bit too much for me this is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> very this is this this is not getting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> paid for yeah this ain't it for me and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so I like step back and I look to my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> left and who would I see I see </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I see that only two other Brits in Geeks </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> plus just standing alongside me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we had all thoughts subconsciously </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thought the same thing and we all had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all taken a step back and just was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> no no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [Laughter] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's so funny sometimes you're just in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> the in the vibe and you're like no yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah no no there's a time and place for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> that kind of stuff and just that day was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> not the day meanwhile meanwhile died </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> it's right at the front of the Hugo yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> let's go bubbly bubbly let's go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it was like the most surreal experience </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I had ever seen because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um because you could tell like there </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there was like some fans in the crowd </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that were like hardcore fans you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they knew every dance they knew all of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> the lyrics and they were like spread out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the crowd like they were like like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they were purposely there to like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> indoctrinate people right because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it was like a proper Idol </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> concert and then I turned to May Lin and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like this is my first Japanese </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Festival this is my is this is this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> traditional and she just tells me and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> goes no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I I don't know what's going on and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> remind me again this is all happening on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> a [ __ ] basketball court this is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> happening </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> to give me allow me to paint a better </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> picture of this how many people were at </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this thing would you yeah how big was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> this basketball because basketball </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> courts can't hold more like 100 people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I said three basketball courts yeah so I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thought that's still tiny so you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> when you're in school there was a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> playground I had like a basketball court </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and maybe something else oh no actually </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> like a soccer field yeah the stage was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> actually on the tennis court I think so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> how how many people were at this Summer </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Festival I'd say 300. [ __ ] fair amount </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> for yeah for that size no no it was a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> tiny space and it was absolutely packed </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> to the brim full of nothing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> full of nothing I'm a shaved ice </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> balloons and yeah it was great I went to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> a Summerfest full got a free Idol </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> concerts no I don't think I don't think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you should say you went to a Summer </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Festival because from the sounds of it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you didn't go to a Subway you weren't </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_02> themed Idol concert yeah yeah no no guys </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I went to it like I you know you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> how I got on my mind my money's worth </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> behind I was just like oh wow this must </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> be like a really massive summer vessel </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> frame and seeing that it doesn't extend </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that much perfectly framed it so we were </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like you know frame out the train frame </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_01> foreigners were they were the ones </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wearing the yukatas so it was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everyone else is just normal yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everyone else was dressed normally so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that was that was like the Japanese </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people all dressing in just like normal </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> clothes it's like just like normal </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> clothes then there was the foreigners </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there was a group of us just rocking up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in our uconnis and we were just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] guys we weren't the only ones who </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> actually dressed up for this I guarantee </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> all the Japanese people there were like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> how do we tell them that it's just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> accidentally turned up in a text to an </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> elementary graduate like that's what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> can't do it was that one time where you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you get like the Halloween party invite </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> and you're like I should dress up for </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> this yeah you were the only one who </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> dressed up to this Halloween party </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> that's the experience we had oh my god </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> well no yeah it was uh I I almost </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hearing that story I almost want to take </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you guys to like an actual problem no I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> want to go to a problem yeah yeah let's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> go somewhere like in the middle of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> nowhere oh yeah the ones in the middle </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of nowhere nowhere near Tokyo have you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> guys ever been to like any other like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> types of festivals because I think I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> feel as much as as much fun as those </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> summer festivals are the most fun I've </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> ever I've ever had at festivals are the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> ones that are just [ __ ] bonkers the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> penis one well the penis Festival as </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> well I mean I did a video on that that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> was insane yeah what what is the history </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> behind that Festival I don't [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> know I mean it's like a fertility thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I need it yeah yeah it's the celebrate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fertility and it's basically think of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like think of uh I think the only way I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can describe it right is like so there's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> many of them all over the place uh the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> one that I went so I think was like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> biggest one that they do every year and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it basically starts off with like this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> parade on the streets there were many </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> penis festivals yes yeah yeah in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> different parts of Japan I thought no I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> did I thought I thought when you said </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> many festivals I just thought you meant </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> many Japanese festivals no no there are </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> many penis vessels throughout the year </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> damn they are they praying hard to that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> penis yeah I do they need it they need </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> more they need it this is literally like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> how do we stop this thing thoughts and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> prayers </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> actual we do something yeah so like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> one I went to was the biggest one I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> forgot whereabouts it was uh somewhere </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like closer to Nagoya I think oh no it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wasn't nowhere uh or aichi </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um that one's wild that one was huge uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and the and the penis yeah and like some </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of these like there's basically like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> parade that happens where everyone's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> like lined up on the side of the streets </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then they bring in a bunch of like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> traditional </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um you know penis shaped objects </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and they finish it off with the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> girthiest schlong I've ever seen in my </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> life it's this like wooden schlong I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> want to guess it's maybe about 15 meters </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> long what carried no The Good the girth </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is probably I know many people to carry </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this thing like 40 guys it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] Johnny Sins equivalence there's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> 40 guys carrying Johnny since [ __ ] and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and they and they carry it through the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> the parade uh you know they stole </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> through people I don't know at the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> temple I guess she's got like a storage </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> unit somewhere and then they they walk </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it through the parade you know people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> taking photos whatever and then they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> prop it up in front of the Temple </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so at the end of the festival there's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just this giant 50 meter wooden [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just just like sitting there in front of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the temple and then at the end of the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the one I went to they did this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> tradition I don't know what the the the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> the you know the history behind it is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but it's really dangerous and this is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the only one that they do it at uh they </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what they do is they go up on these like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this giant stage that's built up about </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 5-10 meters tall so kind of like the one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you saw yeah at the Summer Festival </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> except instead of a square one it's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a long rectangle right um and there's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> about </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 10 15 dudes who are standing at the top </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of this thing with a basket full of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Mochi right and I'm not talking about </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the squishy Emoji right I'm talking </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> about oh like the the [ __ ] you put </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> before it's cooked [ __ ] in these plastic </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> bags yeah and what they do is they just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> grab handfuls of this [ __ ] and they just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Chuck it into the crowd </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> and these people are just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> desperately trying to catch these Mochi </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well what's really dangerous about it is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that if you're not careful because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's literal tens of hundreds of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] Mochi pieces yeah flying out and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> these are Big these are like size of my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> fist right kid dies if you if you're not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> careful that thing can smack you in the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] head and it and I got smacked in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the head you've got a deck an old </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> grandma yeah I was I was filming it in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> my video and I got decked in the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> forehead by one I'm just like pow and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> then since then he didn't watch anime </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then place it back trace it back and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> then it was just like and I was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what's anime where am I what but I think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think the craziest one I went to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> though was in nagana was that opinions </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no not the penis one uh the one I went </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> to in Nagano was uh the fire Festival </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> not the fire Festival that's a different </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> one this one happened not fyre internet </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> restoring video yeah I know that one not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> fyre Festival the f-i-r-e festival </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yes also it's extremely dangerous okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> so basically what they do is they build </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> this giant 20 25 meter wooden like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> teepee looking structure right and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> people are gathered all around it and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> then what happens is they set it on fire </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and then there are people in the back </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> who push the crowd towards the fire what </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> why </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know but basically if you're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> standing in the front you are getting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cooked alive and you're trying to fight </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> back all these like people trying to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> basically push you into a fight it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like it's like Mass witch hunting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Korean squid game we had to get people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> who are broke games </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and I was and and mind you right this is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> like there are like hundreds of people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just all gathered around and there's and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when this thing sets a blaze yeah it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> just this massive bonfire so you could </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> be like 20 25 meters away from this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thing and it's hot as [ __ ] yeah I can't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can't imagine what it's like it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> literally fire yeah it's literally fire </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like if there was a house on fire </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and then someone and you were watching </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it and then someone behind you was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> get close that's what it was like it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like no I don't want to get close to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that thing it's hot I they do that for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> some reason I want to say that like yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> no we don't have any weird festivals but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we have that one but we Chase like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> cheese down the hill Oh that one's the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> dumbest Festival of all time that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> dangerous that's like [ __ ] up is that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> the one where they push the wheels of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> cheese now push the wheel of cheese and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people just [ __ ] [ __ ] like flip </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> down the hill to try and get it first </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah so so they have like an ambulance </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on call and any Festival yeah where you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> have an ambulance on call is never a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> good sign oh yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um and so the right it's like the wheel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cheese wheel rolling Festival where you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> just like you they you have a big wheel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of cheese roll it down like a very very </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> steep hill and they have a festival </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where people try to chase the wheel yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> whoever gets whoever touches it wins </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> whoever touches it first wins no is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there any way you can catch up to that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> thing though uh yeah there's like some </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people who are in insane and literally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like throw their bodies yeah they don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> care wow so how people normally go is if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you run Fallout full speed down a hill </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is normally your body can't trip your </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> body can't keep up with the moment right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so either you're going to fall flat on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> your face or you're just going to start </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> rolling or most of the time you're going </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to get some kind of broken bone or some </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> injury because that's what happens when </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> you run full force down a hill isn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> that isn't that like that scene in Bucky </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> where he's like full bolting it down the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> stairs and he's like this is boring and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> he starts yawning but there's probably </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one dude in that Festival who's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that where he's like yeah I don't give a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] though and just all for some cheese </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> the part of me is like I want to at </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> least be there yeah I want to see people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just like eat [ __ ] yeah I think that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> the whole point right yeah I think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's why people love it yeah I don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm pretty sure the local government is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like please can we stop doing the cheese </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> thing and they're like no what's the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what's the tradition behind it though </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like why do they do it oh I don't know I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know it's something that is like the the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> origins are very murky yeah it's not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> like I feel every Festival is like it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> not it's not like this is 100 what </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> happened I feel like I've heard it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> before because there's a Netflix </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> documentary about weird things more of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> the episodes is about it because um yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because I know for a fact that in Japan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> at least the reason why we do festivals </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or Matsuri is I think like there's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> theories that like they used to be used </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for like sacrificial rituals and [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like that and then one day someone was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like let's take the sacrificial part out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and maybe just like dance instead I just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> have a good stop </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> [Laughter] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> supervised </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's the cool sign yeah I watched a Qi </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> thing and it was talking about like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] uh Japanese like celibate monks </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> or something and they were like they </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> would like have to it was wild like what </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> they would do it was like something when </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you were when you were done with your </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> duties to prove that you were loyal to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like the monk HUD you would just trap </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yourself in like a coffin for like 80 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> days and just die oh you were not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> allowed to come out and if you came out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as a sign of weakness they put them in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like a ditch right like a whole </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> something like I can't remember the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> exact thing but it's like what is like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the the dedication yeah to this [ __ ] in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Japan is like next oh yeah because I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> remember I I saw like a similar video </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> recently where they were talking about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this like uh I guess like type of like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> monk uh training that you can do called </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> usheri and basically they do this thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> called the Thousand day walk oh and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> basically what they do is every day you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> walk between I think it's like 30 to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kilometers through the mountains and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> meditate and you do that for a thousand </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> days but it's so hardcore that when you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sign up for this thing they actually </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> give you a small knife where if you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't succeed in it you have to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> literally set puku </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot of them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and I'm just like bro bro like how far </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> down do you have to be to be like I'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> gonna do this I really want to find the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> celebration it's crazy and this and it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> still a thing that they do today that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> insane yeah it's not and there are just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people who do that that's that's they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> literally they literally said so you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> have chosen death yeah it's like we will </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like would you like to be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> enlightened please walk for a thousand </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> days straight </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that's literally like a Hunter x Hunter </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> test you know that yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> if by the end of the Thousand Days you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> don't have Nan like it's not exactly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah like it's not worth it that's part </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> of the hunter exam you know you get your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> hunter's license after this or you die </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you know that's that's literally that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I wouldn't be surprised and some of you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> will die yeah someone ran a little too </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> much on time I was like yeah we can do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> that it was tagashi and I've read about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that and I was like I can put that in a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> hunter </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sounds like a good Arc right there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that's crazy dude what are you checking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> up trying to find this monk thing I've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> definitely heard about that celibacy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> thing though yeah um </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> that's right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> is this the thing that I was talking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> about Jerry okay yeah so it's basically </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you you naturally mummify you yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> that's it they mummify themselves </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> willingly yeah and while they're alive </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and if they're like cave or like they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> don't go through with it they're not </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> worthy but they have to like starve </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> themselves yeah like in a in a like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> coffin yeah for like how many days is it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> or something to stay in there I think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's something crazy and I can't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> remember why yeah I feel very bad that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they stood 80 80 [ __ ] days or </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> something to do this and I can't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> remember why they did it it's like no no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> maintenance it's probably something like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> spiritual no it is cinnamon or something </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah I think I remember on this queue I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> think they're talking about how like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they the I think it was the Japanese </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> government at some point was like Hey </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can you can you just stop stop doing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this please this is really weird and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uncomfortable people don't like this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah people don't want your mind I mean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know you know a lot of people praise </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Japan for being a few cultures that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> actually really hold on to tradition but </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> uh I mean maybe there are some </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> traditions we shouldn't hold on to well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> actually I mean there's a lot of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> tradition they didn't preserve for some </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> of them they're like all right yeah this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> is kind of weird modernize this thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah let's let's not do that yeah penis </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> vessels though the people's fine as [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I want to go through it yeah that that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> just looks like a laugh it's really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> trying to meet up in Japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> sorry and I know and I know like in my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> video we also found a temple that was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> dedicated to the women as well I was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> gonna say I was I I was hoping it would </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> be yeah we found a vagina Temple oh okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> just say vagina okay I didn't know if I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> was allowed to say vagina we went to a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> vagina </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> all right fine we went to a vagina </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Temple it was awesome did you enter </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> through like a a you know something like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> a fleshy yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> going in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [Music] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> no but what was cool was that like um it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> wasn't like you know physically like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> that but like it was uh symbolically the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the whole idea was that when you come </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> out of the temple it's like you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> rebirthing so you cleanse yourself in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the temple and then you come out of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> vagina entrance and it's like oh it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like you're being reborn and I'm like I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> thought that was pretty [ __ ] cool but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it would have been cooler if it was a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> physical like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the physical parallelism one you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> wouldn't want that uh yeah no one wants </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that or needs that I I just I just I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just think about that and I'm like yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so like the the idea of reborn that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> sounds like a cool spiritual kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Awakening in idea walking out of a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> vagina and saying you're like reborn </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I don't know the imagery just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the imagery just doesn't match with the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> idea to me yeah of course </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I love how uh in Japan it's like you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know they have these really super </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> sexualized things but then they're very </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hush-hush about sex and other kind of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> topics oh yeah it's like weird it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> uh it's like oh we'll have a giant </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Festival celebrating penises yeah but we </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> don't like gays it's not gay it's not </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> gay things yeah that's but that's what I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> was wondering I was just like when I was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> standing there at the penis festival and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I saw a little homerotic 40 dudes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> carrying this giant [ __ ] I don't even </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think the Mardi Gras does this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> has anyone ever like questioned how </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> slightly homoerotic this is and like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Japan's making progress slowly with it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of course of course yeah I mean I think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just because it's it's not that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> they I'd say that they it's not that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they don't despise gay people right no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no they just have an old system and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Japan is very slow to change yeah but </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> most people don't give a [ __ ] oh no of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> course forget about that sure of course </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you go to any of these sex stores </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> bro yeah you know I don't give a [ __ ] oh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah if anything they're in the future </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> or something yeah yeah exactly a bit too </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> much they're a bit too far I went to uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean by the time this is out it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> pretty darn I went to uh uh go to sex </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> store </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um because Ludwig wanted me to get him </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the idea of the video is that he gets me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> a box of 500 with the stuff from America </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> that got America themed yeah and he </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> wants a Japanese themed box or right 500 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> of the Japanese stuff I've done some </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> cool stuff you know uh but you know I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> had to go to the sex store I was like I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> gotta give that because I'm thinking </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> content I want to give him content what </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> is better than content than half the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> stuff in this goddamn stores yeah but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the problem is how do I get stuff that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he can show on a live stream yeah and I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> found stuff well it was just weird </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> enough </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no that's that's like vanilla from all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the stuff I found there was this one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> like vanilla I'm thinking stream needs </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> again I found the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I found these things I'd never seen </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> these before I I know they've only </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> existed before but this is a this is a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> new thing to me it was it was branded in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as face hole TM and it was just Anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> characters but there wasn't a flashlight </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was just an anime character and you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> you do the thing to its face </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> way so it's like it's like a it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> shaped like a mouth or something it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> shaped like a body and then you it like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> it like curves like this like a natural </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know body you know you had to head </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> on the side there's like a 3D like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> diagram cross-section of what it looks </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like on the inside yeah and I guess you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just have to put your mouth in it and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then go all the way down the thing it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> was [ __ ] wait so where is like is </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_06> episode is it is it is it weird that and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I've always found this weird and I know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I've pointed out many times because I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> feel Japan is the only one that is so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> open to that kind of [ __ ] but at the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> same time it's just like no we don't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> want to talk about it right because it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> like because it because I find it weird </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> that you can go to any Don Quijote and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's just like an open section for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Daniel like it's not even behind a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> curtain I feel like it's it's uh what's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the word where you're kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> constricted uh like Society here is very </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> um what's the word when you're held back </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a little bit um oppressed yeah a little </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bit right like the the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> people have to really hold back their </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> personalities a lot in Japan yeah and I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> feel like that results in them just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> getting [ __ ] wild you have to hold </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> back yeah when they when they get to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like let loose and do their thing it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> feels like you know if you're gonna make </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> me work like 50 goddamn hours a week and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> make me work on like weekends the least </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can do is just do whatever the [ __ ] I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> want and if I want to have a good Jack </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> offset if I if I want to they're gonna </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> hold they're gonna hold back a different </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> thing is I want to do some weird ass </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] that I I have participated in the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> society and done what you've asked to me </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I'm doing it yeah I mean and so I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> feel like that's that kind of just that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> letting loose is where it comes from a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> little bit oh no definitely well I think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's also the big reason why like a lot </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> of you know that side of the industries </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for example like you know like the dojin </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> side of things that's why we get some of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> like the weirdest like what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> type of ideas because it's like you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah because in a daily life you're not </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> releasing it as often so it builds up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and builds up yeah or even discussing it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and so it builds into and tones into </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> something that's just like how the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> do you think about that yeah right so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah at least see the people not talking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> about it at all not wanting to engage </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with it or going just insane and being </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> not insane but like going wild with them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah because like you know people people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> still have thoughts you know people yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> if there's no if you can't Bonk that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> away then uh what are you supposed to do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know it's uh I mean there's a lot of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> things in Japan like even you know going </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> off topic going back to the fire </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> festival thing that you were talking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about full circle baby full circle yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just like it comes back yeah it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> seems like I've I thought Japan was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> really on top of it with health and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> safety but it seems like to me it feels </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like some things you have to go through </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so many red tapes oh yeah just just to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> get anything done but there are some </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> things in health and safety in Japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that is just a [ __ ] free-frow and you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> just kind of mush it up as you go along </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I feel a lot of those types of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> things where the Japan is kind of just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> like OHS what's that it's usually linked </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to stuff that's just like well it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> tradition yeah so you know people have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> been doing it for hundreds or thousands </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of years and uh you know we're still </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> around as a society so yeah sure it's a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> little dangerous but like you know it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> all in it's all for culture it's all a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> tradition they don't they I mean you can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> sue in Japan but people don't Sue as </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> much yeah not in the UK especially the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> US people people love love a good soup I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> think I think people get lawyers before </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they get health insurance in America I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> mean Japan you leave a bad Google review </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and that's like worse yeah right but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like it's like it's like that's a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> business Destroyer yeah like you don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> have to [ __ ] I'm not I feel like there's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> not that much of a concern for that like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah if people get food poisoning here </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> they often don't like try and get you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> know uh some um yeah we'll try to take </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> some recuperates yeah uh recoup any cost </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> or whatever from yeah the restaurant or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> something that's true like food health </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and safety here is actually very relaxed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah and it's very much just built on we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just we trust that everyone is doing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> what they say they're doing yeah I think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I think the the Japanese mentality of it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> is oh I got food poisoning at this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> restaurant that's not on the fault of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the restaurant that's on the fault of me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> who couldn't you know properly maybe I'd </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like to think because because a lot of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like this is us well I mean my Japanese </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> side understands that because it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it's very much this mentality of I don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> want to inconvenience other people yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like my problems are my own and I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't want to make it and I don't want </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to drag people who may perhaps be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> innocent about it yeah right so it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like I totally understand why you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> they wouldn't like you know there isn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like a Karen that just comes down so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like how dare you food poison me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> sometimes you get a bad batch as well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like that that could be out of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> restaurant's control exactly yeah a lot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> of the time it is due to this not </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> cooking it up or storing it properly but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> you know it does happen and I can </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> understand that why you'd be like it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just like I'm sick I'll be done I'll be </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> fine in the next day nothing you don't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> need to make a big fuss about it yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> exactly but you know there's a lot more </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of a you know culture for that but also </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know I mean again the old uh old </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> traditions uh combined with the fact </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I think people are generally more </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sensible yeah yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> or rule we have in the UK or the US is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> because somebody [ __ ] up yeah like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> somebody was stupid enough and did said </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like what if what if I bungee jump </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> without a car safety what if I run down </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a hill with a ball of cheese yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> exactly yeah this is why first of all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hello this is why we can't have nice </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> things yeah doing bungee jumping into </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> hours so fine you got to do it yeah I </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_05> you hear these horror stories of people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> doing it in like countries where you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> like they don't have a great reputation </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> for health and safety yeah yeah you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they'll be like yeah I went to this tiny </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> island in the middle of nowhere and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there was a dude who just had the bungee </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and that was it yeah it's like I was </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_00> monthly job I'm sure do you act a bungee </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> jump and I got the taste for it dude </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you got the taste of gravity that one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that one second where you where you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> jumping and you don't feel anything yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that that's a rush dude what do you mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because you mean when you hit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um before you hit the terminal terminal </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> velocity </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was gonna I was gonna go that fast </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah I was gonna say like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> you obviously have the bungee jump </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> attached to you yeah uh but it's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> dudes who throw it right yeah so for the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> first second or so it is literally just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> you falling yeah before the bungee kicks </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> in and it starts to you know stretch and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> slow down that first second was just you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> jumping is nuts and it's it feels insane </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah because you jump and it's like holy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] this is what it was would look like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if I jumped off a cliff yeah this is how </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it would feel like just that that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> nothingness and just the speed you just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> feel like your gut's just like dude yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like your whole body just goes up and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're because I dived yeah yeah so I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> did three jumps and I I wanted to do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> each one cooler absolutely you know yes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I did like a I did a dive the first time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then a running dive the second time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> then I didn't flip the third time wow I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was like can I do tricks and they were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like I probably shouldn't but you can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and I was like how do I do it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and then they were like all right so you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> got to hold the bungee to your side </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> right and then you can do flips oh okay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> otherwise the Rope will get tangled yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so and then also it turns easier so then </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you can you can do it then you let go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you want to just return back right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> don't let it slap like slap your face </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah so that was really fun but dude did </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you do like the did you do like the Ezio </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] like that's right yeah yeah I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> did like fish stuff I did yeah I did the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> the [ __ ] swimmer die yeah [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> down oh my god dude the shots even the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> GoPro yeah and the 360 camera's so cool </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh yeah it's awesome yeah I mean like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I've always wanted to go bungee jumping </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and skydiving I've always been like uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know you you reach a age sometimes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because I love roller coasters you reach </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> an age where you're like vertical she's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> just ain't doing it for me anymore you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> know what I mean I never hit that point </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm still scared you know like skiing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> snowboarding the hardest slopes doesn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> do anything for me I need that Rush yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> see it's weird for me because it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I've always had this fear of heights for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the longest time but in certain </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> situations I'm totally okay with it so I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't think I'll be able to bungee jump </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I think I'll be too much of a [ __ ] but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like you know for journey across Japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we're parasailing and we were up like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and we were like no he [ __ ] hated it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> he was [ __ ] his pants but I think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> he's seeing him [ __ ] his pants made me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really enjoy it yeah you know what I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mean we did this one it's like I'm like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 150 meters up in the air yeah if I was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> by myself I would be [ __ ] there'd </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just be a stream of [ __ ] yeah I was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> flying down because I'm with someone who </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> is more scared than me yeah I was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> this is awesome I love it yeah okay just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> bring Chris everywhere I'm just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah I mean he's a little worse I'm sure </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he's gonna talk about this one when he </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> comes on yeah like my God trying to get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> him to do any of the like wait did he do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it no of course not no of course not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> originally okay so there's three things </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> that you can do at this place it's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you should go it's called gravity park </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> inside time it's [ __ ] awesome you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> gotta drive there though </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um so there's a bridge and a zip line so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> you you zip line across and you walk off </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the bridge yeah yeah a bit boring for me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> the lines like baby it's like a baby </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> zipper yeah it's very small and then </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's the swing and the swing I also </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> found scary in the bungee really it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> literally a swing you sit there and then </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a dude just drops you oh I've done the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> swings bro and then you drop and you go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> really [ __ ] fast and really close to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the ground way closer than the bungee </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah swings and there's this man </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> holy [ __ ] was that terrifying and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> originally when we made this video I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> booked for Krista Dix he was like yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll do this swing yeah I think he just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> envisioned our swings oh swings I've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> been on a swing before because you can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> do a tandem as well yeah we'll do it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> together yeah and then yeah of course </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when we got there Chris saw the swing it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> was like oh well um well actually </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um uh I don't think I want to do it and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like what do you mean I paid for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it it's like 150 yeah he's like no no no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no no no no no I don't want to do it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> come on and then he was like I try I'll </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> do the zip line and right when he got to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the zip line I went first and I'm like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where's Chris and I can see him like not </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> getting in the ready position to go I'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> just like what come on man well he's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like chicken out of that as well no no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> he was going to though in the video it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> really good you should watch it yeah um </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> it's it's Chris is having like a mental </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> battle I'm sure he'll come on and tell </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> us all about it right uh it was it was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> interesting though yeah because the same </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> thing happened on joint across Japan we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> were supposed to because we could only </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> go on pairs on this parasail right right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> uh but there's only three of us it was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> me you know Chris and nasty so one of us </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> had to go twice right and the guy was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like okay but we also have to like think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about like the weight balance and stuff </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like that yeah and so immediately he </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like looked at Chris and was like you're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> going on twice </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and he was just like yes of course </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and then he does those are the first </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> time with me </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] his pants the entire time comes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> back down he's like I'm not doing this a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> second time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> what I've always had was stuff that I'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> scared of the moment I've done it once </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> and I found that it's fine yeah I'm like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's great let's do it again yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right but some people like I guess like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Chris or other people I've met it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> they do it and they're like I never want </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to do that ever again yeah what no I I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thought it was safe though like what but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's the thing I I totally get people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who do it the first time and maybe they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> just like hated it so much they never </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> want to do it again likes adrenaline </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> totally get that but there's a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> difference between being like I'll do it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> once and if I like it I won't do it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> again and yes I'll do it twice it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> super easy and like exuding this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> confidence and it's like and then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> immediately being like Oh actually never </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> mind I don't want to do it ever again </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like just make you don't want to do </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it it's fine like I'll fully admit right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> here right now I don't want to go bungee </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> jumping like I don't even want to try it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> because I think I'll just [ __ ] hate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it but I'm not gonna like it's not like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> you're gonna like show false confidence </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and being like yeah [ __ ] it's because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you haven't done it once yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you'll get the taste man I think when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you do things once a lot of the time you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> realize oh this is not that scary right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I'd never call you like a beta for not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wanting to put yourself right doing that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> exactly that [ __ ] is scary yeah I mean I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> think the thing is with especially like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> a lot of thrill rides thrill Sports just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in general is that I feel like you know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> as a kid I think you're more up for </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> anything right because you don't have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> this concept of danger in your mind not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as much anyway not as not as much so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like I remember you know I tried us I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> tried our skateboarding and I was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> this seems pretty fun everyone everyone </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> seems to love skateboarding I had one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> bad fall and that's all it took for me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to be like I don't want to do the same </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah yeah no I hate this yeah and like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> similar things I've heard so many </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> similar stories to people who've done </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> snowboarding skiing as a kid they will </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> go like [ __ ] Mac 10 or whatever I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> don't [ __ ] know and then they have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like one bad fall and they've just never </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> recovered from it yeah mentally you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> it's that whole mentality of climbing a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> tree and then you just all it takes is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> one fall out of the tree and you're like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm never climbing that high up here </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah right and it's the difference </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> between the kid that learns to never </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> climb that tree again and the kid to go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> ah that hurt let me try that again yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I would always do that if I ever [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> up I was just like all right well I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> could have just said I was that kid </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where it's like I fell out of the train </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like I'm never touching a tree ever </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> in my life yeah I could have died there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] yeah exactly that's why I've never </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> had a broken bone in my body yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> exactly same I have so many bad Falls </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> skiing and snowboarding and I've never </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> broken anything luckily </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> right so it wasn't too bad yeah it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> depends for me like I've had some bad </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> falls on a on a skateboard and a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> snowboard and a skateboard like that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] because you're on concrete yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah I've got some bad Falls you don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> just get like you get grazes as well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is like the it's I [ __ ] hate </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> unless you don't get Graces on a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> snowboarder exactly that's why I never </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> wanted to do uh [ __ ] skateboarding it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> looked so scary yeah oh yeah like I've </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> seen some of the injuries my friends got </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like you know what I'm a throw </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Seeker but this just doesn't do it or </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> were they padded up uh they probably </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> won't padded up yeah well a few of them </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> are professionals now right I'll do it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to this day yeah but like but that's the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thing it's like I think there's this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like weird thing especially with like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> skateboarding when you start off where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like oh [ __ ] I I don't want to be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that lame guy with like the knee pads </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the elbow pads </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like because like all the cool kids all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the cool skateboarders are just like in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a shirt and shorts but it's like yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but that's because they're good enough </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to the point now where they're not going </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> to [ __ ] hurt themselves they know how </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to fall without injuring themselves they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know like how to get out of rough </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> situations and raw Falls right because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because they probably started off with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the pads like you still see </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> professionals wearing all the parts if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Tony Hawk can use pads and helmets then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you can use it yeah exactly okay exactly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I've always wondered you know like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> parkour people yeah yeah how do you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> master the role and not [ __ ] just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> destroying your body you know when they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> roll off like big jumps oh yeah and they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just like don't get any damage yeah it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like do you just practice that indoors a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bunch on carpet full damage </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they literally like avoid fall damage </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's with this like this droll [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> that I've seen yeah how the [ __ ] do you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> do that why are they practicing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> gymnasiums right yeah yeah well I think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that it's uh like a combination of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> practicing on gymnasium and just kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like upping your height slowly jumps </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they hide they jumped on them like even </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bro even this [ __ ] roll can't pump I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> assume they don't jump off a building </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> straight away and be like okay either </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> you uh break your legs or you just don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> make the jump when you die I've heard </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> horror stories people like attempting to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to do like big jumps and stuff from </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> parkour right away because they're like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> well this is how you learn </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've seen videos of like some Parkour </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> guys where there's like in some </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> countries there's specific gymnasiums </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> four parts oh yeah yeah and so much yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah I've always wanted to go along you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> want to know the one sport I do not know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> how people get into tag huh tag tag </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> extreme tag I've seen that show okay but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I can see that though [ __ ] uh is it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> longboarding </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> on a road with cars on it my friend used </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to do that I'm just like the people who </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> do this must be born without a Fear </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Factor in their brain they took the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> amygdala out yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like you must not feel fear to be able </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> to [ __ ] do this because Even's just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> seeing GoPro footage I'm like nope this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> gives me anxiety yeah yeah because if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> you lose your balance you're falling </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> onto calm it's like if a car just comes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> exactly right if there's so many points </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> of danger where you know car could come </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uh you're going as fast as a car and uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah it's kind of like it's like jumping </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> out of a moving car basically yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> and you all you have is a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> skateboard you go like 70 plus miles an </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> hour </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you can't no you can't you can break </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with your body yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but uh yeah like that's that's one thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> where I'm like someone must have been </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> crazy to invent this sport you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> there are a lot of crazy people out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there yeah yeah like you know [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the concept of like someone like Evil </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Knievel right it's just like yeah what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if I just like took a bike and just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> did a 50 [ __ ] meter jump off oh that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> shit's crazy the people who do the bike </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like Motocross points yeah like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> extreme motor crossing and stuff like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that it's like another world it's crazy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it doesn't feel real yeah because like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you have to you definitely have to be a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> certain type of person a certain type of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thrill seeker </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um I'm just wondering what kind of what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what what are the environments that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> you're the type of kid right if we go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> back to like the falling out of the tree </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> analogy people like that are the type of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> kids who climb up the tree fall break </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> their arm and they go what if I break </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> another one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how many can I do yeah it's like it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like weird jobs you're like how did you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> get this like you know like deep sea </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like cable fixing people oh oh yeah like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they they [ __ ] they I think you have to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like they you depressurize yeah like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> few weeks but you you're like on the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> floor of the ocean fixing these cables </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like Twilight Twilight simmers or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> swimmers or something something insane </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's a really good documentary on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Netflix about a bunch of people in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Scotland how because they're attached to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like an umbilical cord yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um and I think one of one of the um one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of the dudes that Court got stuck oh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] while they were because the weather </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> was was crazy up top and yeah throwing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the boat around pulling this guy around </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> the floor bed yeah and it's it's crazy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's it's like such anxiety yeah and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> it's just like this job seems like one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> why why would you decide to do this like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm sure the pay is insane yeah but like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> my God to go to the ocean floor and just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> fix oil companies pipes hell no the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thing is the thing that's awful about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that is that you spend months just go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> down there oh yeah because because it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it takes so long to depressurize </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's only financially viable if these </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> divers are just down there for months on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> end for shifts right so you're just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> living in a small [ __ ] pressurized </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cave for months or need to go out to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] fix cables at the bottom of the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] ocean I'm like that sounds like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the most awful job I can imagine we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> respect all of you like a huge [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> respect to anyone who does that you guys </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> are crazy it's like it's like that video </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> of the the guy who I think he works at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a sewerage like facility and he has </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to like go into the sewage pools to like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> fix uh like draining issues and [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like that it's literally just a dude who </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> dives into [ __ ] for a living probably </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just can't smell it probably not he's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> just like cuts off his nose it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like jobs where you like where you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> get exposed to certain things you become </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> an object like chefs who get oil burns </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on their hands so much that they don't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> have any feeling left in their fingers </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah right and it's you know there's I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> think there's a few other ones with like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> smell where you just get used to it you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> just very quickly have to get it the oil </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> ones make sense because it's kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like you know when you first pick up a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Guitar you get like calluses eventually </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> either your skin hardens you know or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like morticians right that like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> have to deal with dead bodies and you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> just deal with it you just have to deal </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with people we're [ __ ] good at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> adapting yeah not me other people I I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think I'm good at sitting here and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> talking I think you shouldn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> underestimate how adaptable humans are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh no we are yeah just to get used to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something that you shouldn't get used to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh God yeah I mean like look at how hot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> how do you get used to that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah because I remember I saw like a a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> video about like uh this you know just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this mortician who just like goes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> through his day and just like describes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> his job and [ __ ] like that on the one on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um [ __ ] with his name wired oh there was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that one as well everyone [ __ ] loves </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that yeah that one's that guy's awesome </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's a different guy as well yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah there's a different guy and he's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just like goes through like daily you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know occurrences of a mortician and it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just like yeah so uh today I'm dealing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with uh two patients he calls them </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> patience I'm dealing with two patients </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> um that died recently and uh yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> they're basically just doctors oh wait </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how is it like title doctor or something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah I think so I don't know well it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> kind of like a cross between it's like a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> cross between a doctor and a makeup </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> artist right because it's like you have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to fix the body up obviously yeah but </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they also have to make the body </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> presentable or a funeral or a coffin </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's just like yeah it's just like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> really cool because like when you think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> of like mortician you immediately think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of like a certain type of person right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but then you immediately are just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> oh goth kid yeah the goth kids from </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> South Park right it's like but it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> why would you want a job where you do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with dead bodies every day but then when </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you actually like look into it you're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just like oh these people are just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> every other person yeah I saw one where </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it was um that one the white dude who </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> mentioned something along the lines of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> it just makes you appreciate life a lot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> more yeah because you're working with </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> dead bodies and seeing grieving families </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> a lot and really doing your best to give </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> grieving families a really like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> appropriate goodbye yeah yeah and in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that sense I can understand why you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> would see it as like okay I like doing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this job because I like giving families </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the opportunity yeah to have the kind of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> send off they want and giving them that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> kind of closure morticians are just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> doctors with no risk exactly you have to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> close the loop you can't kill your </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> patient if he's already dead </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah I guess yeah I mean I want to thank </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> those people in the freezer are actually </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> alive and they accidentally finish them </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> off like cutting them open or something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who knows who knows that's a horror </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> movie you know I'm pretty sure that is a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> horror yeah there is a horror movie like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> that where there's someone who's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> frozen in the morgue thing yeah they're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> alive and someone's gonna open them up </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_05> literally him but just a reskin </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> it's crazy right I know exactly yeah and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just like which subway is this being </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_01> think owns the subway oh he owns his </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> family owns the shop oh okay so that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like big pranks it's like you're double </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> dipping in revenue streams yeah I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> respect it but if you just straight up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> like an employee yeah you got the GoPro </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_01> customer that came in and this stuff </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like hey hey hey hey we got an order </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> because sometimes you imagine being the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> customer you just starts monologuing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> like watching like a Nile red video </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> unfold behind you you're like Nile not </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Nile not not now it's not sulfuric acid </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's chocolate chip now </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know it makes you weirdly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uncomfortable in a weird way yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> because sometimes you see the customers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> in there and I'm just like it's I would </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I would be like stop [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> tick-tocking myself I don't give a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I want a goddamn sandwich yeah like what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> can you make my okay can you imagine can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> you imagine these Tick Tock is existing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in Japan like like a customer comes in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> in a Subway or something in Japan and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you're like excuse me may I film a tick </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> tock while I'm making your Subway I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wonder if they ask I I kind of like it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> though like I like the idea that I do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this I'm like can I have a can I have a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> chicken nugget and a Big Mac meal it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like so I mean this customer came in and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> asked you for and I'm like yeah because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> but the thing is right the thing is you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> can clearly see in these tick tocks </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they're using both hands so the customer </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> comes in and then there must be this guy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> with a [ __ ] ring with his like phone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in front of his face and just like yes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> he's like yes can I take your order by </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> the way I'm gonna be filming a tick tock </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> over your order if that's okay I would </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like it though I think it'd be safe I'd </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> love to go to a fast food place and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> they're doing it I don't know why I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> think it's awesome like it's it's like I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hope that they have all the permissions </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to do it so they don't get [ __ ] for it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and don't lose their job but yeah I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think it's awesome I love this trend of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm gonna film me doing my job like I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> feel like every single job is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> interesting it just it's just about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> presenting it as interesting oh yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah exactly like there's that dude </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> who fixes carpets just replaces carpets </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have you seen that guy no dude just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm not even remotely interested in any </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of this but sometimes I'll just watch </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah my favorite thing about Tick Tock </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or this kind of [ __ ] that they do is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when they they add something they do do </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> something in the short or The Tick Tock </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that is just immediately the only thing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> anyone can focus on and it's has nothing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> to do with your subject </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> so in this one carpet fixing thing he </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for some reason he shows b-roll of his </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> fish </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's it's a tiny tiny Fishbowl like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the ones you would get at like the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> dollar store yeah that's efficient just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> all the comments are like bruh for real </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you showing us the fish that's being </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like that's in like a David Blaine skit </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like like all the comments are just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> about this thing nobody is talking about </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> him fixing this carpet and there's a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> bunch of other Tick Tock I can't think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of it off my head but you'll watch a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> video and maybe they'll have like a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> really big hand or something yeah and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> all the comments will be like is nobody </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> gonna talk about the hand yeah like I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> remember this one where this dude shirt </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is like wedding ring yeah in briefly in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> a shot and it was on so goddamn tight </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who's doing something else and all the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> comments were like this bro about an </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> amputate his finger and he was just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> literally all that I love that that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah that's my favorite part about take </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> time and comments and hence the the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> funniness of it yeah what the thing is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like I think there's a whole sub-genre </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> of that on Tick Tock where it's just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like people doing things narrating about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something that's nothing to do with the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thing that they're doing oh yeah you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> know and I think like ironically a time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> lapse yeah yeah ironically I think what </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> started how this trend started was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> probably like in the drama Community </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because like remember like the good old </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> leafy days where it would just be good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> old yeah the the the good old leafy days </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> where he would just be using like some </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> clips of Cs go surfing yeah and then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just talking about dramas like some [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm like why is the Cs go surfing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> here what's that got to do with the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> point of the video it's iconic people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but not people still do that people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> still do that right all they've done is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> just replace the CSO go the Cs go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> surfing yeah and then they've replaced </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the drama with just anything now yeah my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> heroic trend is the uh it's like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> girls going if you had like two minutes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> with me what would you do and it's just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> something completely unrelated I [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> love this have you seen the one with the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Geo guesser dude oh yeah yeah you get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> five minutes with me what would it be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> this is Angola right here and then we're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> going to Thailand right now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> he always answers </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> what answers and then he goes to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you [ __ ] love it I just it cracks me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> up the ones that are like tell me you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> did this thing without telling me you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> did this thing and he's like no anyway </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> so we're here in Sweden right now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I love this looks like Ecuador all right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> got it [ __ ] I just yeah I think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> there's genuinely some really funny tick </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> tocks there there's just so much crazy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> oh my god dude </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_02> have skills to work for like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> intelligence agency or something like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that no no it's a different skill set </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because have you seen how they learn </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like you learn like oh look out for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the type of bollards in this country and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> then when you find out the Bollard ah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> look you've already lost me yeah is that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> what a Bollard is no it's like the like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the [ __ ] things on the side of the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> road that like you know where you just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> are on the side of the road that like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> line it sometimes you know like when you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> land your bike against it or something </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and sometimes like a pole yeah but like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> not a big it's a Bollard it's a small </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> kind of stubby one like around like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> waist yeah yeah yeah oh they're called </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bollards yeah they're bollards I didn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> know that well you learned something new </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> every day yeah so you know um like you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know let's say every country has very </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> distinct Road patterns and bollards yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because you're a human being and you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not weird and you don't look for this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> stuff but obviously you know you can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> game it and so while you're looking at </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you'll notice oh okay so if if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Africa has these type of bollards and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Road markings whilst you're studying and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> learning this you'll also just happening </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to look at Africa a lot yeah you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can you can just learn yeah but then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you you inadversely you gain so much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> knowledge just about like every country </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you become universally become an expert </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in like maybe indirectly like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> infrastructure the buildings of like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> every [ __ ] time yeah yeah if he if he </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> can recognize an image within like 0.1 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> seconds or something he can Garner that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> much information that just means to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Garner that much information in such a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> short amount of time that must be my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wealth of knowledge that he can be able </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> to like yeah yeah um but I imagine the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> computer can do it better though if you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> took a picture of any place fed into a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> computer there's I bet it could probably </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> get it more accurate than this well you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> could probably just like reverse Google </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah I mean you know there's so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> much images of [ __ ] online you know and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know these geoguesses are like you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> know if they if the geoguessor isn't in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the country which are a lot of countries </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> oh yeah yeah you just have no knowledge </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of that country yeah you're like Giga </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> brained at like Mexico but China comes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> up you're like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know yeah well it's funny </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because like you I you look at something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> like geoguessr and you would never </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> imagine that there would be people with </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this good at just like knowing and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> recognizing the world yeah true but turn </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it into a game oh and people will break </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the system you know what I mean oh yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> as soon as there's a game and a high </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> score people you can inadvertently just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> get skills that you would never ever </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think about getting through just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> traditional education systems which is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> such a good game like yeah like the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> concept of it is really solid yeah and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like anyone can you know again if a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> game is is able to be understood by like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> my parents within like 10 seconds of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> explaining it's a fantastic game yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's a fantastic viewing experience </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as well like watching someone struggle </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with Geo guesser is fun because you are </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> you have your own thoughts right like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're like oh I think it's here or it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the country of your residence yeah or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're just like oh my God I can't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> believe it I live here you know every </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> time like [ __ ] Luxembourg comes up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're like [ __ ] you Luxembourg people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for having a country that looks the same </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> as every other country around it and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then that one luxembourgie in the chat </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> is like how Dave yeah laughs in high GDP </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah no but like what was I gonna say </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] I have a but like I had a thought </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and then it just like [ __ ] evaporated </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I definitely do want to play G I guess </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> though dude you should it's so fun it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's as fun as you think it is like it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> oh yeah it's like you're like you you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> watch someone you play it and you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like I think I'll have fun playing this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah and yeah and you do because it's a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fun game yeah because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> could could you like one of the big </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> things right Geo guess is another game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uh language learning I think people have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> tried to gamify language learning you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> see that a lot in duoling yeah right do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you think there are like some skills </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that just can't be gamified like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> language learning </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> depends to the on the person I'd say </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> right I think some people can really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> learn super fast that way yeah and other </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> people just will not do anything for </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> them yeah because learning languages is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is so hard yeah it's a completely </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> different side of like your learning um </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> compared to other stuff like learning </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> physics or learning this it's a whole </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> nother like it's a complete section I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> think of thought yeah it's a completely </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> different type of skill that I think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> just exists on multiple levels like you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know just just learning vocab and like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sentence structure is not the end or be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> awful language right like you if you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> don't have an understanding of how that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> language is used based on the culture </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> that it the language comes from then </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> you're just like then you're no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> different to a dictionary yeah I mean </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> English has always just been a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> suggestion it's always been just a tool </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to get whatever point we want to cross </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and like everything is broken no no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because our languages have like very </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> rigid rules English is literally just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> made to be [ __ ] construed into </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> whatever we need it to be yeah think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> about half the show should we say in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> English it doesn't make any [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sense yeah like and new words added all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the time but also the way that some of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the the old words are used are like okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I guess like that that doesn't make much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> sense but okay we'll roll with it yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like one thing that blows my mind is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where a language has a law in that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> language that completely changes the way </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like you think so I believe that like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's a language that is using like by </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the Aborigines in like Australia right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where instead of using directions AKA </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you know up down left right and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everything oh they refer to it absolute </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Direction in absolute Direction so by </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> having a language that is just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> pre-programmed with absolute Direction </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like north south east west you have to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like just have you have to like mentally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> have a compass with you all of the time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so explain absolute direction from my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> understanding it's like you don't have a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> left and right hand you have a East and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> West hand yeah if you're facing North </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah exactly but if you're not wasting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you're not facing north then you have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a north and south yeah exactly and it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like that's just like oh my God like I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> have to be aware of which way I'm facing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in order to tell you that I am holding </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> something in this hand exactly yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> which absolutely like blows my mind but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> that's just a thing also what happens if </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you just trap them in like a box room or </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> something </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe they'd have a hunch they just have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like a magnet in there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I I forgot I'm the whole English Point </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> as well you know because grammar is like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> optional in English a lot of the time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah it's really not necessary for </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> English to function it doesn't really </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> need any grammar yeah as stupid as it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> sounds </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can get it's all just about getting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a point across in English it doesn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> matter how you do it well I I think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's true for like most languages </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> right like grammar is in like well like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sentence structure and [ __ ] or yeah you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> can just break sentences oh yeah of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> course and it works like in other </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> languages it doesn't work I I call it I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> call it speaking Google search bar yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> because like the Japanese is so context </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> heavy that that you messing up the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> structure of a sentence could lose </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> context </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in some cases but I would also like to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> think that English does that as well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe yeah maybe if you said Pineapple </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> eat hungry then you'd be like who well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> who is it you yeah me and Japanese can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> be the same way I know that Welsh isn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as flexible to be broken as English is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I at least that's all I know and at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> least the very little Japanese I do know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it feels that way yeah I mean I think in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> some ways Japanese is like even more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> flexible than English in some ways </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> um oh yeah because you don't have to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> stress about who the subject of the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> matter is in a lot of ways like in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> English it's like I did something or you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> did something yeah they did something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah but in Japanese you can just say </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> did something that you can just base </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> based on the context of that sentence </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you have a pretty good idea of who or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> what they're referring to how do you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know someone is learning Japanese they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> use watashiwa yeah you know no one uses </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> no one says watashiwa yeah so you just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> say yeah yeah yeah exactly it's it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's very it's very context everywhere </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> you know because we learn from it in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> English where I say I am going somewhere </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> instead of just going here yeah it's uh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah I mean every language is different </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and a lot of it I mean I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> now that I've Speak two languages and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're learning a third they're flexible </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in like different ways you know I feel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like English has a lot of advantages </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> especially when it comes to just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> expressing slang especially I I feel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like you can make a sentence with just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> words that have never been made and you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> can or like words that just don't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] exist yeah and you can get your </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> point across very easily yeah yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> exactly look at the North my dad uses </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> words and I'm like you just make [ __ ] up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah but I know what he's saying yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like like what you just like it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> just like instead of like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um you know I don't know you just makes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> stuff up all the time it's so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> frustrating is he making stuff up or is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> he just saying something that exists </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> that you just don't know no no he's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't think of a good example but like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everything has to be shortened or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> construed differently but like some </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sometimes it just makes sense you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because it's the feeling you know like I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> remember before did I have that huh does </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Ty have that because last doesn't really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> have that you can't really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> we're just changing the words in the con </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you still understand the sentence </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah nowhere nowhere near as much as </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> English because I remember like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember when you know people started </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> using the word drip and I remember like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> the very first time I heard someone use </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the word drip and not refer to like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> water or liquid you know remember those </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> days </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we're like I remember some I remember </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like damn he got drip and I saw the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> picture and I immediately understood oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's because he's talking about clothing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I don't know why that just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> clicked in myself immediately but I got </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it you know I I got it I immediately got </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> damn bussing I immediately got why yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know like I never heard that word </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> before but like I understood the the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> meaning of that word just by the context </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> it was being used in it was like it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> wasn't just like me guessing it was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for some reason that just makes sense </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah that's I think that's just one of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the strengths of English is that the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> vernacular is really easy to understand </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> if if you're uh if you have a native </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> experience yeah like you don't need to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> be like ingrained in a certain like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> click to understand that particular time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah yeah exactly oh that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> interesting the advantages of English </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> English is very open that's why English </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> is one of the most difficult languages </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> to learn yeah well that's the thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> constantly making up new words and we're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> constantly breaking grammatical I had to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> explain like copium to a Japanese person </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was like okay like this is a lot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah like I don't realize how and I like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when I explained this it's gonna it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> not gonna make it makes you sound stupid </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> it's gonna make me sound dumb but that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> just how it is like you we just use </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> words that don't exist and then we drop </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> them but like I don't know why we do it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah we just do this it's not until you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> think about it or you have to explain it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> to someone where English isn't their </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> first language like I remember I had to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> explain to my Japanese cousin what this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was yeah and she was like what is this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm like yeah that's a good [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> question what the hell is that it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're air quotes but like how do you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> explain how do you how you use it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> specifically oh [ __ ] it's like you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what it is like suspicious and you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when to use it when you don't know how </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> to explain why that works I can't I know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how to explain it to someone who speaks </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> English but yeah okay but how do you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> explain it to someone who doesn't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the concept of what this is when a word </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> is sus that's how I would explain it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> starts with the money and then I was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like wait now now I have to explain </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what's up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> suspicious yeah it's literally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> suspicious </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> are you trying to make are you trying to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> make Sasha more of a word than it is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> this makes more sense because it's just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> a shortening of the word suspicious </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right but like if you were trying to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> explain like to someone uh it's lit Fame </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> right like you're not gonna say like oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh it's a it's a family that's on fire </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like no that's not what it means it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> means something completely different to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what it acts like drip right yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like how do you explain drip to someone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> who's not an English speaker oh I guess </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's drip is easy to explain the con the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> meaning is just someone who dresses </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> why do we use the word drip I don't know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> see I don't know why we use it but to me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it just feels right it makes sense do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you have these words in Japanese that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> come up with like the flavor of the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> month words and leave I mean yes but I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> feel a lot of it is derived from like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> slang or internet slang that has some </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you know uh derivation to it that came </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from like some kind of like meme or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> whatever like a lot of the words are </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from like two-chan speak right where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like there's some posts from </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] the Linguistics that was just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like one guy started using it and then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> someone was like oh yeah that's pretty </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cool it's like sometimes sometimes in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> English you just find words like drip </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um it's like put on a piece of clothing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> you've never worn before and it just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> perfectly fits and you don't know why </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> but it just like it's just like yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> that works why does that work I don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> know why xiaomi Vu yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> not this [ __ ] again anyway I'm sure </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> there are some linguists in the uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Records that can answer our questions </SPEAKER_05>
