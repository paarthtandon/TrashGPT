<garnt> - Boneless or bone? </garnt>
<garnt> - Bone. </garnt>
<garnt> (playful music) </garnt>
<connor> - You're not eating the fucking bone marrow. </connor>
<connor> You're not cracking the bone... </connor>
<connor> You're not eating the bone! </connor>
<garnt> - The bone does do shit! </garnt>
<garnt> It does! </garnt>
<garnt> Oh my fucking God. </garnt>
<connor> (relaxed music) </connor>
<connor> - Welcome back. </connor>
<connor> - Welcome back. </connor>
<garnt> - Welcome. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> Welcome to this episode of Trash-- </garnt>
<garnt> - Are you from the future? </garnt>
<connor> - Silence! I'm doing the intro. </connor>
<connor> Welcome to this episode of Trash Taste. </connor>
<connor> I'm with the boys, </connor>
<joey> Joey and Garnt, </joey>
<connor> and I'm Connor, or Monkey as people call me. </connor>
<joey> - (laughing) Are you okay? </joey>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<connor> - Connor has suffered from </connor>
<joey> a major cramp in his neck about 20 seconds ago. </joey>
<garnt> - My life flashed before my eyes, like 10 minutes ago. </garnt>
<garnt> I thought that was it. </garnt>
<garnt> My neck was gone. </garnt>
<connor> - We were about to start recording </connor>
<garnt> and then Connor had a cramp in his neck </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm just like, "Man, </garnt>
<garnt> can you get any more, like, </garnt>
<connor> boomer than you already are? </connor>
<connor> Is your body already feeling it? </connor>
<connor> And you getting your, like, nurse already, man?" </connor>
<connor> - Maybe I'm dying already. </connor>
<connor> Fuck, bro. </connor>
<connor> - I mean actually like, </connor>
<connor> I have recently started to stretch every day </connor>
<garnt> after work, like just, just at home, </garnt>
<garnt> like, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> I would go home and just do like really simple, </garnt>
<garnt> like 10 to 15 minute, like, stretch exercises. </garnt>
<garnt> - How did it start? </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, it started because </garnt>
<connor> I found myself sitting at my desk all day </connor>
<connor> or sitting, you know, on a set like this all day </connor>
<connor> and then I would get up and go, </connor>
<joey> "Oh! that's a sharp pain in my lower back, </joey>
<connor> that's not normal!" </connor>
<connor> - I want to make fun of you, but, you know, </connor>
<joey> I can't make fun of you if you're taking care of </joey>
<joey> yourself. </joey>
<joey> - Exactly. </joey>
<joey> And you can't make fun of a friend </joey>
<joey> when you had a massive cramp (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - But as a friend I want to call you a boomer </joey>
<connor> and ask you when you had your diaper changed. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, right? Like, it's scary, like, </joey>
<connor> I think, like, I think to myself, "Nah, </connor>
<connor> I'm not, I'm not that, at that stage yet" </connor>
<connor> But then I realize next month I'm 27, I'm like, </connor>
<connor> "You know what? I'm kind of getting to that stage. </connor>
<garnt> I should probably start while I'm ahead, </garnt>
<garnt> to just like fix my shit </garnt>
<joey> before it gets too messed up" </joey>
<garnt> - Honestly, I feel like a lot of people, </garnt>
<garnt> especially when you're just in your fucking twenties, </garnt>
<garnt> you just don't give a shit about this. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, why would you? </garnt>
<garnt> You never feel any effects on your body. </garnt>
<joey> - You do shit that your body was not built to do. </joey>
<garnt> - And you don't realize this, but like, </garnt>
<garnt> you don't realize this until you get, like, </garnt>
<connor> that kind of time, period of your life </connor>
<connor> comes to an end, that you just realize, </connor>
<connor> "Man, that's a, that's a really short </connor>
<connor> time period of my life, and I've just got </connor>
<connor> the rest of my life now having to live with this problem </connor>
<connor> because I just didn't fucking take care of it" </connor>
<connor> So yeah. Take care of your body. </connor>
<connor> Like, if there's one thing that I've definitely paid </connor>
<connor> attention to, especially, like, </connor>
<connor> it doesn't matter if you're a YouTuber </connor>
<connor> or you're just at an office job, </connor>
<connor> somewhere where you're sitting at a desk </connor>
<connor> for long periods of time, please, </connor>
<connor> please, </connor>
<connor> Google "ergonomics" </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> It's really fucking important, </connor>
<connor> and it's a really boring word, </connor>
<connor> but, my God, like. </connor>
<garnt> - Ergonomics. </garnt>
<garnt> (Grant laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - Like every time I set up a new desk now, </garnt>
<garnt> I have to like, make sure it's just </garnt>
<garnt> ergonomically correct. </garnt>
<garnt> Because I didn't realize this until, </garnt>
<garnt> not even when I was a YouTuber, </garnt>
<garnt> but like, like, a year of working an office job </garnt>
<garnt> and just my, my screen was just slightly off </garnt>
<garnt> and, like, it was slightly off centered. </garnt>
<garnt> I had to like tilt my neck, just, just, </garnt>
<garnt> just to look at it, like, you know, it's, it's, </garnt>
<garnt> it's something that I didn't really care about </garnt>
<garnt> until, like, a year came past and then my neck </garnt>
<garnt> really fucking sucks now. </garnt>
<connor> - You sound like a villain in an anime, </connor>
<connor> "Me, when I have to tilt my neck </connor>
<connor> 1% less than I'd like" </connor>
<connor> (Joey screams) </connor>
<connor> "You all die now" </connor>
<joey> - This is a North Star shit. </joey>
<joey> It's like, "You've made me tilt my neck 1Â° more </joey>
<connor> than I'd have liked to, you know what this means" </connor>
<joey> - Every day it increases by another degree. </joey>
<connor> - "It's retaliation. </connor>
<connor> I will bend your back one degree every day" </connor>
<joey> - No, but that's the thing, right? </joey>
<joey> It's like, </joey>
<joey> I've also realized very quickly, </joey>
<joey> since we have the standing desks. </joey>
<connor> Because for the longest time I felt like </connor>
<garnt> standing desks was just like, you know, like, </garnt>
<connor> it was like a fad, I was like, come on, like, </connor>
<connor> this is just like a new thing that's happening, </connor>
<connor> it's like, "Oh, people are health conscious, whatever" </connor>
<joey> But the moment I started using them I'm like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, okay, this actually makes </joey>
<joey> so much of a difference" </joey>
<connor> - Because I just, I just heard the noise it makes. </connor>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> - They go "brrr" </joey>
<connor> - But it's, but it's so, I realized very quickly, </connor>
<connor> especially between working here in the office </connor>
<connor> and working at home, </connor>
<connor> where I don't have a standing desk, currently. </connor>
<connor> I mean, I bought a standing desk recently, </connor>
<connor> because I realized actually how much-- </connor>
<connor> - Joey discovers standing. </connor>
<connor> I literally did! I was like, </connor>
<connor> well, actually off the using it, </connor>
<garnt> I realized why this is such a big thing, </garnt>
<garnt> and why so many YouTubers are getting it, </garnt>
<joey> because it actually makes so much of a difference. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, like, I'd never, it's so weird, 'cause, </garnt>
<garnt> especially when you're in, like, university, right? </garnt>
<garnt> You hear about these things that adults do </garnt>
<garnt> to increase productivity. (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm just like, "Just work better. </garnt>
<joey> It's just work harder" </joey>
<joey> And then like, I don't know when it happened, </joey>
<joey> but then like I just noticed that </joey>
<joey> my productivity just dropped because of this thing </joey>
<joey> that I never really thought about. </joey>
<joey> Like, having a standing desk, for some reason, </joey>
<joey> it just helps your productivity </joey>
<connor> when you're standing and you just need </connor>
<garnt> a change in posture or change in whatever. </garnt>
<joey> - Exactly. </joey>
<connor> - I'm feel I'm lying to myself, </connor>
<connor> when I feel like it makes me more productive. </connor>
<connor> I feel like I just wanted to spend money </connor>
<connor> and be like, "Look, it's productive! </connor>
<connor> Look, look, guys, look!" </connor>
<garnt> - "Look my desk move!" </garnt>
<garnt> - "I'm productive now" </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, no, I'm not, I'm lazy, that's all. </garnt>
<connor> Or at least my definition of lazy. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. I mean, I cannot work. </connor>
<connor> I mean, I remember for the longest time </connor>
<joey> I just worked from my bedroom, </joey>
<joey> and I'm just like, "I don't know how I did that" </joey>
<joey> - I did that for two years long, </joey>
<garnt> and I don't know how I did that. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm jealous of people who can work in coffee shops. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, I can work in coffee shops. </connor>
<connor> - To me it's like sensory overload. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, I can't do that. </connor>
<connor> - There's just too much stuff going on. </connor>
<connor> - I love working in coffee shops. </connor>
<joey> There's people doing things that isn't me </joey>
<connor> and it's, it's intense. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. I can't do it. </joey>
<joey> I remember I tried once to edit a video </joey>
<joey> at a coffee shop and I just felt way too, like, </joey>
<connor> self-conscious, because I'm </connor>
<connor> in the back of my head, I'm thinking like </connor>
<connor> "These people must think I'm so weird looking, </connor>
<connor> editing a video of myself" </connor>
<connor> - I can't treat this place like my work station. </connor>
<connor> - It's too much stuff out. </connor>
<garnt> - It's not, it's not my fucking area, it's like, </garnt>
<connor> I can't rip a massive fart if I'd like to. </connor>
<garnt> - Sometimes you just need to get out </garnt>
<garnt> of the space that you've seen for like, </garnt>
<connor> every day of your life-- </connor>
<connor> - So touching grass. </connor>
<connor> - Huh? - Touching grass. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, so, so you, yeah, </connor>
<connor> you're basically touching grass, </connor>
<garnt> except you're just drinking coffee </garnt>
<connor> with a bunch of strangers </connor>
<garnt> who you're never going to see again. </garnt>
<connor> - How do you not just constantly keep buying coffee? </connor>
<garnt> - That's... </garnt>
<connor> You don't, I just keep buying coffee. </connor>
<garnt> - I think that's the whole reason </garnt>
<garnt> why people work in coffee shops. </garnt>
<connor> - How much coffee do you drink anyway, Connor? </connor>
<connor> Your Nespresso machine is fucking dying. </connor>
<garnt> - So I can buy the upgrade. </garnt>
<connor> (Joey coughs) </connor>
<connor> - "No more, please!" (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> - I would find myself fired at like each </connor>
<connor> fucking Starbucks, </connor>
<connor> if I got the menu at the back of my hand, </connor>
<connor> I'll be like a tour guide, </connor>
<connor> who would come to Starbucks with me I'll be like, </connor>
<connor> "No, don't get that" </connor>
<connor> It's just, I just, I know I spent like, </connor>
<garnt> $50 a day on coffee if I go to Starbucks </garnt>
<connor> and work there. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't know, 'cause like I I've, I don't drink-- </garnt>
<connor> I do drink coffee-- </connor>
<connor> - See? I do. I do a lot. </connor>
<connor> - But you drink it so fucking fast, </connor>
<connor> I dunno how, like-- </connor>
<connor> - I think you drink it extraordinarily slow. </connor>
<garnt> - I think I drink-- </garnt>
<connor> - It's like he's making love to the fucking coffee. </connor>
<joey> - I think he drinks it at a normal pace. </joey>
<connor> - No, you drink at a normal pace. </connor>
<garnt> - I drink fast but he drinks at a normal pace. </garnt>
<garnt> - I feel like you're getting-- </garnt>
<joey> - We're like the three wolfs here. </joey>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </garnt>
<garnt> - No, it's a fucking, no wolfs, fuck, ah... </garnt>
<connor> - Three pigs? - Three pigs. </connor>
<connor> - Three Musketeers? </connor>
<garnt> - Three wolfs! (laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - Totally different story, eh? </connor>
<connor> Completely off. </connor>
<connor> Wolfs building their houses. </connor>
<garnt> - And the big, bad pig came out. </garnt>
<joey> - Like, I'm saying it's, </joey>
<joey> it's most economically efficient to drink your coffee </joey>
<joey> and just eat your food slowly, right? </joey>
<garnt> Cause you have more time to enjoy it, because, </garnt>
<garnt> because like what happens when you finish your coffee? </garnt>
<garnt> Then you just feel like you have an empty, </garnt>
<garnt> you feel like you have a hole, </garnt>
<connor> because you're just like-- </connor>
<connor> - You're assuming my happiness </connor>
<connor> and my enjoyment of the meal is tied at my speed </connor>
<connor> or the amount of time it exists on the table. </connor>
<connor> It doesn't fucking matter. </connor>
<connor> I'm just going to eat it. </connor>
<connor> That's what, that's what I like. </connor>
<connor> When I stopped eating it, the joy is gone. </connor>
<connor> I don't savor the joy, the slower I take it. </connor>
<joey> That's absurd. </joey>
<joey> - What are you a fucking speed runner? </joey>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) - No, no! </connor>
<joey> But, like, I don't get enjoyment out of being, </joey>
<connor> having one bite and thinking </connor>
<connor> "Damn, that's a good bite" </connor>
<garnt> - Sometimes you've got to enjoy, </garnt>
<connor> sometimes you gotta savor the bite. </connor>
<garnt> - You don't savor the bite? </garnt>
<garnt> - Sometimes I do. </garnt>
<garnt> But when it's Starbucks, it's, it's like, </garnt>
<garnt> it's like being like </garnt>
<connor> "I'm savoring a wipe of my ass cheek" </connor>
<connor> I've had so many Starbucks, I'm not going to savor it, </connor>
<connor> it's a fucking Starbucks. </connor>
<garnt> - I think that's why you fucking drink </garnt>
<connor> eight coffees a day or whatever, </connor>
<garnt> your Nespresso machine is fucking battered </garnt>
<garnt> war veteran at this point, </garnt>
<garnt> like you just got back from WW2, man. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, I never knew it was possible </joey>
<connor> for coffee machines to have Nam flashbacks. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> Until I saw yours. </connor>
<connor> - I'm getting the value out of it, okay? </connor>
<connor> - Time you turn on the bottom, it's like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh no, oh no, not again!" </connor>
<connor> - I'm getting my mileage out of that machine. </connor>
<connor> Whether you like it or not. (Joey and Garnt laugh) </connor>
<connor> I love an espresso. </connor>
<joey> I can't help it. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, we know, we know. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I just love it, man. </joey>
<connor> I love the taste of dirt in my mouth. </connor>
<joey> - Do you not, like, find yourself </joey>
<joey> just being like "Maybe it's too many coffees"? </joey>
<connor> - No (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Why? </connor>
<connor> - I don't know, why would I? </connor>
<connor> - I dunno late, okay, so, you obviously like </connor>
<connor> the taste of coffee, yeah? </connor>
<joey> - I love the taste of coffee. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, so why not just drink decaf? </joey>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<joey> - I know this is a controversial thing to ask, </joey>
<joey> but I have to make sure, I have to make sure. </joey>
<connor> - It's just, you know, </connor>
<connor> half of the-- </connor>
<joey> - If the caffeine doesn't work for you, </joey>
<connor> what's different? </connor>
<connor> - It it does work, but it's numbed. </connor>
<connor> But the kick that you get when you drink it is the same. </connor>
<garnt> - You sound like a drug addict (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm actually on a corner side here </garnt>
<garnt> because, I, not regard in coffee, but like, </garnt>
<connor> for example, I like the taste of beer and wine </connor>
<connor> ever had non-alcoholic beer and wine? </connor>
<connor> - Oh, it's fucking awful. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's horrible, it's horrible. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like the coffee, what makes it so great </garnt>
<joey> is that the first sip in the morning, </joey>
<joey> is just beautiful. </joey>
<joey> Like it's such a kick-- </joey>
<connor> - I agree, I agree. </connor>
<connor> - And I keep getting that every single cup. </connor>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> So I keep coming back. </joey>
<joey> - Every 10 minutes is another morning. </joey>
<garnt> It's a never-ending morning. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, because going back to, like, </garnt>
<garnt> being able to work in a coffee shop, don't like, </garnt>
<connor> I find it so hard to just work by myself </connor>
<connor> in my room sometimes. </connor>
<connor> Like, I just like feeling-- </connor>
<garnt> - I get distracted. </garnt>
<connor> - By yourself? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I get distracted by my own thoughts sometimes. </connor>
<connor> I dunno, sometimes I just like having </connor>
<connor> an atmosphere where just, it's just people </connor>
<garnt> doing stuff and people doing shit, </garnt>
<garnt> which is why like, I love working in the office </garnt>
<garnt> now when there's people here-- </garnt>
<connor> - I like that too, 'cause we're all working though. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly, right? </joey>
<joey> - When we're at the coffee shop, I feel like, </joey>
<joey> you know, I'm, I'm kind of it's, </joey>
<connor> it's like that one guy who won't stop </connor>
<connor> talking about transformers at the party. </connor>
<connor> I feel like I've just brought something </connor>
<connor> to an area where-- (Joey and Garnt laugh) </connor>
<connor> - What kind of parties are you going to? </connor>
<connor> - Let me tell you. </connor>
<connor> I feel like I'm intruding on the atmosphere </connor>
<connor> of the location, even though </connor>
<connor> I know I don't give a shit </connor>
<connor> when someone is working in a Starbucks, </connor>
<connor> but I feel like I'm doing something weird </connor>
<connor> when I'm working at a Starbucks. </connor>
<joey> - Well, I've, I've always been that person that </joey>
<joey> even during school, </joey>
<joey> I could never study on my own. </joey>
<joey> I had to study with other people, </joey>
<joey> otherwise I just wouldn't focus. </joey>
<joey> - I used to be, but then I swapped. </joey>
<connor> I don't know why. - Really? </connor>
<garnt> - I flip-flop between the two, I can do either, </garnt>
<garnt> but if I do one for too long, then I just, I need, </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes you've got to change up your routine, right? </garnt>
<connor> - Right, because if you did like a full day </connor>
<garnt> of studying with your friends, </garnt>
<garnt> you only really only did like three hours of studying. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, but that's three hours more </connor>
<joey> than doing it on my own. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, but then, so I feel like I do 12 hours </joey>
<garnt> with my friends where six of it are </garnt>
<garnt> "Hey, have you seen this funny YouTube video?" </garnt>
<joey> - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. (Joey and Garnt laugh) </joey>
<connor> And then three hours of actually studying. </connor>
<joey> - Oh yeah. - If I do it on my own, </joey>
<connor> it's like four hours of solid studying. </connor>
<joey> - See, I can't do that. </joey>
<connor> Because, even when I'm at home in my office and I'm like, </connor>
<connor> "Okay, I have to get shit done". </connor>
<connor> I can't just sit down and work for three hours straight. </connor>
<connor> - It depends how, how severe the stuff is </connor>
<connor> that I need to get done. </connor>
<joey> - I never find myself in that situation. </joey>
<connor> - When the stuff I need to get done is like, </connor>
<joey> "It needs to get done today" </joey>
<joey> I'll get it done today. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah. Of course. </joey>
<connor> - If it's something where it's like-- </connor>
<connor> - What if it's like, "Ah, you know, </connor>
<connor> this video is coming in like a week" </connor>
<connor> - Deadline's not coming on </connor>
<joey> I might go play some Apex. - Yeah, it'll be done, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Might fuck around. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I just think there is just </connor>
<connor> too many distractions on my work computer, </connor>
<connor> unfortunately. </connor>
<connor> - A laptop doesn't have those distractions? </connor>
<connor> - No, because, okay. </connor>
<connor> When it's like exercising at home </connor>
<garnt> versus exercising at the gym, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Because in theory-- </garnt>
<garnt> - No, I don't know about that. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no, no, no. </garnt>
<garnt> I think it is, 'cause - No, no, no. </garnt>
<connor> - In theory, in theory, if you exercise at home, </connor>
<connor> it's a lot more efficient, right? </connor>
<connor> If, if you just buy a home gym, </connor>
<garnt> you can just exercise at home. </garnt>
<garnt> You can fucking buy, Wii Fit you should, </garnt>
<garnt> you should like lose weight. </garnt>
<joey> - No, I disagree. Losing weight speed run. </joey>
<joey> But like, when you go to the gym, </joey>
<joey> everyone around you </joey>
<connor> is there for a purpose </connor>
<connor> or it's just doing something. </connor>
<connor> - So sounds like you want an office. </connor>
<connor> Sound like you want to go to an office. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, well, sometimes-- </garnt>
<connor> (group chatter) </connor>
<garnt> - You still working at coffee shop now? </garnt>
<garnt> Or is it here only? </garnt>
<garnt> - I still work at a coffee shop sometimes. </garnt>
<connor> - I just think that that comparison is comparable. </connor>
<connor> I, 'cause you know, a gym, </connor>
<connor> your home has more of the correct equipment </connor>
<connor> that you need to work. </connor>
<connor> You have the cameras, </connor>
<connor> you have the mics, you have, as a YouTuber, </connor>
<connor> you have everything that you would need for a desktop. </connor>
<joey> - You have the ergonomics. </joey>
<joey> Starbucks doesn't have the ergonomics. </joey>
<joey> - And you know, I've seen similar stuff </joey>
<joey> sometimes as a busy man, </joey>
<garnt> you can't get the ideal chair, </garnt>
<connor> you got to sit in one of those shitty stools. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, not if you go </connor>
<connor> first thing in the morning. </connor>
<garnt> That's the way you go in, where you're going. </garnt>
<garnt> You can't just-- </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, so I could get clock in before everyone else? </garnt>
<garnt> (crosstalk) </garnt>
<garnt> - This is how, you know, I've worked in a coffee shop. </garnt>
<garnt> I know the peak optimal time </garnt>
<connor> to go to Starbucks to get the seat that I want. </connor>
<garnt> And the seat that I want is like right in the corner, </garnt>
<garnt> it's got a power outlet as well, </garnt>
<garnt> so you can just work there all day </garnt>
<joey> and it's just perfect. </joey>
<garnt> You have enough of an atmosphere where you don't get </garnt>
<joey> distracted by the people around you, </joey>
<garnt> but it's what are you still get the nice, </garnt>
<joey> - I can just Garnt lining up first thing </joey>
<connor> in the morning, 6:00 AM. </connor>
<connor> They're like, damn this guy must really want </connor>
<joey> his coffee. </joey>
<joey> - Him and everyone else in the business suits </joey>
<connor> with their Mac books, waiting for their frappes </connor>
<garnt> so they can start working. </garnt>
<garnt> - Honestly, you can't go during lunchtime </garnt>
<garnt> or anytime past 4:00 PM here, </garnt>
<garnt> because then it's just too much, too many people. </garnt>
<garnt> But anytime outside of that, you get free choice. </garnt>
<connor> - I've never been to the Starbucks here and it hasn't been </connor>
<garnt> busy as far. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah me neither. - Okay, but </garnt>
<garnt> if your job, for example, if, </garnt>
<garnt> the kind of content he did, </garnt>
<garnt> didn't always require a camera, right. </garnt>
<garnt> Or, you know, </garnt>
<joey> sometimes a lot of the videos you do is just pure research, </joey>
<joey> right? When you're researching things to buy and you know, </joey>
<joey> stuff like that, I feel like you can do that, </joey>
<joey> kind of work in a coffee shop and have a change of an </joey>
<connor> environment. </connor>
<connor> - But I can also do that at home. </connor>
<garnt> - That you could do that. </garnt>
<garnt> What I'm arguing is that, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> if you need something to be more productive, </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like a change in environment </garnt>
<connor> really does fucking help. </connor>
<connor> - No, no of course. </connor>
<garnt> - I get so frustrated because you know, </garnt>
<connor> I'm using the laptop and I'm like, fuck </connor>
<garnt> I wish I had my keyboard. </garnt>
<garnt> I wish I had my mouse. You know, </garnt>
<garnt> I start getting frustrated. </garnt>
<garnt> That's not as fast is how it is at home. </garnt>
<garnt> I can do it way faster. </garnt>
<garnt> - I see. I'm like, to me </garnt>
<garnt> I get what you mean. But then some, </garnt>
<garnt> because I'm too used to working at home sometimes like the </garnt>
<garnt> smallest thing can just distract me. It's just like, if, </garnt>
<garnt> it's not perfectly optimized or perfectly optimally, </garnt>
<garnt> if something's not optimal, then it would just </garnt>
<garnt> distract me. </garnt>
<connor> - Yes. - I also don't want to </connor>
<connor> wear a mask when I'm working. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, true. - I just want to be home. </joey>
<joey> - This day and age it's a little more of a pain in the ass. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I just don't want to work with them, </joey>
<joey> like on a laptop for a last few hours, </joey>
<joey> when I have a mask on I'm like I can go home and work and </joey>
<joey> breathe and go. </joey>
<connor> (heavy breathing) </connor>
<connor> To my air vent or my window. - And go (choking sounds) </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughing) </connor>
<connor> - You can just sneeze. </connor>
<connor> You know, also going back to the gym comparison, you know, </connor>
<connor> again, I was just going to say </connor>
<connor> the gym has all the equipment you'd want your home is never </connor>
<connor> going to be as a stacked as the gym, </connor>
<joey> - Unless you have a private gym in your house </joey>
<connor> - Even then, right? </connor>
<joey> You won't get the cringy playlist. </joey>
<connor> All of these things add, you know, the water machine, </connor>
<garnt> - (laughing) The cringy playlist. </garnt>
<connor> - You know, the Justin Bieber Baby </connor>
<connor> that comes on occasionally. </connor>
<garnt> - What Starbucks are you going to? </garnt>
<connor> - No, no, no, the gym. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh! The gym. </garnt>
<connor> - I enjoy the Pitbull that comes on, on repeat. Evanescence. </connor>
<connor> - That's when you know it's o'clock. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. They would play the same songs. </connor>
<connor> I loved it. I don't know why, but also, you know, you get, </connor>
<connor> you are, there's just so much more at the gym. </connor>
<connor> There's so many more facilities and the all, </connor>
<connor> and the coffee shop doesn't have any facilities. </connor>
<connor> You're downgrading. Where as the gym. </connor>
<connor> You'll you know, </connor>
<connor> the argument to go to a gym is that you can unequivocally </connor>
<connor> get an upgrade in equipment and you also get the </connor>
<connor> environment. </connor>
<connor> So I think that comparison full short, </connor>
<connor> sadly gone change my mind. </connor>
<garnt> - Well, the thing is right, </garnt>
<connor> because I feel like atmosphere is important and it's not all </connor>
<garnt> about equipment, right? </garnt>
<connor> - I agree. </connor>
<connor> - If the equipment was all that mattered, </connor>
<connor> especially when it's working, </connor>
<garnt> then everyone would need fucking </garnt>
<garnt> three screens and a gamer PC to </garnt>
<garnt> make videos, to make YouTube. And we know, we know. </garnt>
<garnt> - Frankly I think they do. </garnt>
<garnt> - We know. But that's not the case. </garnt>
<connor> - As somebody who used to make his videos on a $300 laptop, </connor>
<connor> I can tell you, I need the PC. </connor>
<connor> I need it. 12 hour render times I find a mistake. </connor>
<garnt> Fuck no, man. </garnt>
<connor> You can't do that to yourself. </connor>
<connor> - I'm not saying you need to, </connor>
<garnt> you can do everything in the coffee shop, but I'm saying, </garnt>
<garnt> if you need a change in environment, get out of your house </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes. Touch some grass. I swear to God, </garnt>
<garnt> it would help you. It'll help you productivity. </garnt>
<garnt> It'll help bottom line. You're telling me, </garnt>
<garnt> are you telling me that that Apex logo in the corner, </garnt>
<connor> doesn't fucking taunt you </connor>
<connor> every time we have like five minutes and you just like, man, </connor>
<garnt> maybe I could play a game. </garnt>
<garnt> Do you think can play Apex in Starbucks? </garnt>
<garnt> - No. - You can't. </garnt>
<garnt> - That would be a true power move. </garnt>
<garnt> - Also, I'm not a slave to work, sometimes </garnt>
<connor> I can slack off for an hour and play Apex. </connor>
<connor> There's nothing wrong with that. </connor>
<connor> It's a break. </connor>
<connor> - Privilege. </connor>
<connor> - I want to, also when you want to </connor>
<connor> take a toilet, you know, sometimes you got to worry about, </connor>
<garnt> oh my bag, my stuff's here. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't want to pack it all up </garnt>
<garnt> - Well you don't have to worry, it's Japan. </garnt>
<connor> - I know, I know. </connor>
<connor> - Any other country, I'd be like, yeah, but </connor>
<garnt> I've got to decide. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. But it's a bit different when we go to the toilet, </connor>
<connor> when you go to the toilet, </connor>
<connor> 'cause you take an hour when you're at the toilet. </connor>
<connor> And I feel like you're tempting fate </connor>
<connor> you're really pushing </connor>
<connor> Japan's limits on what will be stolen. </connor>
<connor> It probably won't be. </connor>
<connor> But now I am five minutes I'm in and out. It's fine. </connor>
<connor> No problem. No big deal. </connor>
<connor> But also I also like being able to fully immerse myself in </connor>
<connor> the toilet experience. </connor>
<connor> And I feel like I can't do that in a public toilet. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<joey> I can't. </joey>
<connor> - Wait, wait, wait, wait. </connor>
<connor> - I can't enjoy. - I've never been speechless </connor>
<connor> on the podcast. - I can't enjoy a </connor>
<connor> shit in public. </connor>
<garnt> - What is my retort to that? </garnt>
<garnt> - I can't enjoy it. </garnt>
<connor> - Fully immersive experience. </connor>
<connor> - I want to go to the toilet comfortably. </connor>
<connor> - The toilet experience. </connor>
<garnt> - I agree with you in terms of shits, right? </garnt>
<joey> My god, we're fucking talking about shits again. </joey>
<garnt> I cannot number two in public because I need my own private </garnt>
<garnt> space. </garnt>
<connor> (laughter) </connor>
<connor> - You can't go to the toilet in public? </connor>
<connor> - Number two. </connor>
<garnt> - Why? </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like a last resort, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - What? What? Why? </garnt>
<garnt> - Because, I want my own private space, right? </garnt>
<joey> - What are you doing? </joey>
<joey> Are you shitting on the walls? </joey>
<garnt> - He's making art. </garnt>
<garnt> - What're you doing? </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, okay, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't want a time limit to how long I need to sit on the </garnt>
<connor> toilet. </connor>
<garnt> - Fuck them, make them wait. I don't give a shit. </garnt>
<garnt> When I wait for someone I understand, sometimes </garnt>
<connor> you have to take the time you take I'll complain about it. </connor>
<connor> Someone takes 10 minutes to shit. </connor>
<connor> But I don't give a fuck. </connor>
<connor> You can take 10 minutes to take a shit. </connor>
<joey> - Well he doesn't want to be complained at. </joey>
<connor> That's the point. </connor>
<joey> - I'm gonna complain at him. </joey>
<garnt> I'm gonna mutter under my breath when I sit down. </garnt>
<garnt> Fuck no. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't want to feel pressured, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> I hate it when I feel like someone's waiting. </garnt>
<connor> - Just don't feel pressured. </connor>
<garnt> - Just don't don't feel pressured. </garnt>
<garnt> - You can't, it's not a see-through door. </garnt>
<joey> You can't see the fucking line. </joey>
<joey> You're shitting, you're in your own bubble. </joey>
<joey> - Don't rush the artist when he's making his art, all right? </joey>
<connor> - We've all been there. We've all been there. </connor>
<connor> - No I don't. </connor>
<connor> - You're fucking desperate for the toilet. </connor>
<connor> And you're fucking searching for any public toilet you can. </connor>
<connor> Maybe you're in a Starbucks. </connor>
<connor> Maybe you're in a train station, right? </connor>
<joey> And you go to the toilet and there's just this one guy who's </joey>
<joey> just taking three millennia to shit. </joey>
<joey> - Is that you every time? </joey>
<joey> - It's fucking him every single time. </joey>
<connor> - I don't want to be that guy that's why I'm not doing it. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, there's Garnt again. </connor>
<garnt> - I want to have a comfortable experience. </garnt>
<connor> And I understand that comes at. </connor>
<connor> Might take a little more time than I'd like. </connor>
<joey> I understand that comes with the fact that someone else is </joey>
<joey> going to want a comfortable experience </joey>
<joey> and I'm gonna have to wait. I don't give a shit. </joey>
<joey> Literally. I don't. </joey>
<connor> I will wait to give that shit. </connor>
<connor> I will wait the five minutes, the 10 minutes. </connor>
<connor> Whatever it be. Yeah, I'll be like, ah fucksake, </connor>
<connor> why you taking so long? </connor>
<connor> But you know, at the end of the day, </connor>
<connor> I don't give a shit. </connor>
<garnt> - You have some very, I mean. </garnt>
<garnt> - What a big man, he is. </garnt>
<garnt> - What a big man. </garnt>
<garnt> You have some really fucking weird toilet </garnt>
<garnt> habits that... </garnt>
<joey> Before we start recording, kind of, </joey>
<connor> it kind of goes into the toilet, Joey. </connor>
<connor> Right? And he goes, do you sit down when you pee? </connor>
<garnt> And I'm just like. </garnt>
<garnt> What? </garnt>
<garnt> - I mix and match, I do both. </garnt>
<garnt> - Do you have a penis? Isn't that? </garnt>
<garnt> Isn't the whole point of being a man? </garnt>
<garnt> Is so you can get your God-given right to pee </garnt>
<garnt> standing up and you choose to sit down. </garnt>
<joey> - I sometimes sit down when I pee. </joey>
<connor> - No! Oh my god! </connor>
<connor> - Bro, I got big ass cheeks. </connor>
<connor> Sometimes it's just... </connor>
<garnt> - The fucking bidet's have rotted your guys' minds. </garnt>
<joey> - No, no, no. </joey>
<garnt> - Is this what happens? </garnt>
<garnt> - Hear me out. </garnt>
<connor> The reason why I sometimes sit down to pee is because when </connor>
<garnt> you're standing up. </garnt>
<garnt> - You can't check your phone. </garnt>
<garnt> - For one, you can't check your phone. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's literally 5 seconds, 10 seconds. </garnt>
<garnt> - I got that. </garnt>
<garnt> No, but like for me, </garnt>
<garnt> what it is is that sometimes I sit down to pee because </garnt>
<joey> sometimes I don't want to fucking clean my mess. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, true. </connor>
<joey> - You might sometimes, sometimes you might miss. </joey>
<joey> - When you pee in a toilet, </joey>
<joey> you can't guarantee no splash back. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah exactly. </joey>
<connor> - We're talking about - </connor>
<connor> - As someone who cleans the toilets in his own house. </connor>
<joey> I don't wanna clean that shit. </joey>
<connor> - When you're wearing shorts and you pee. Right? </connor>
<connor> If there's a 30 centimeter difference between where </connor>
<joey> your peepee is and where your and the toilet, </joey>
<garnt> there's going to be splash backs. </garnt>
<joey> If you wear a shorts, you'll feel it on your legs. </joey>
<connor> - Exactly! </connor>
<garnt> - So when you're going into a toilet and there's a urinal </garnt>
<garnt> there, do you just sometimes go to the... </garnt>
<connor> - Public? </connor>
<garnt> - The public, toilet. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah if it's a public toilet, 'cause some of the time </connor>
<connor> you want to sit down. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. Sometimes I've been walking around for so long. </joey>
<connor> (crosstalk) </connor>
<garnt> - And god forbid! There are no benches in Japan. </garnt>
<joey> - The next best thing is a toilet. </joey>
<garnt> - This is the most unoptimized way to go to the toilet ever. </garnt>
<garnt> Like the, you should be against this. </garnt>
<garnt> You're literally spending more energy to sit down, pee than </garnt>
<joey> it is. </joey>
<joey> - Two birds, one stone. </joey>
<connor> - What, what?! What are you talking about?! </connor>
<joey> - He gets to pee and he gets to sit down. </joey>
<joey> - I, pee, I don't immediately get back up. </joey>
<connor> I'm on my phone for like five minutes. I'm just scrolling. </connor>
<connor> This is some of the best phone time I get all - </connor>
<joey> - Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! </joey>
<joey> - Wait, and you're </joey>
<joey> criticizing him for taking an hour to shit. </joey>
<connor> - You take five minutes to pee?! </connor>
<connor> - No, no, not actually five minutes. But, </connor>
<connor> I play my phone a little bit. </connor>
<joey> Play some angry birds, </joey>
<joey> you know, some Cut the Rope, you know the classics. </joey>
<joey> - Doodle Jump. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - You know how it is. </joey>
<joey> No, you actually genuinely take 30 minutes to shit. </joey>
<joey> I don't think that's normal. </joey>
<connor> You genuinely. I have never. </connor>
<connor> - We get to the point in this office where I </connor>
<joey> legitimately go, where's Garnt? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, we go where's Garnt and we realized </joey>
<joey> he's been gone for 30 minutes. </joey>
<connor> - Did he go to the shops or something? </connor>
<garnt> No, he's taking a shit. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay. But I'm actually, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm not just sitting there for no reason, okay. </garnt>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<connor> - What part of this is </connor>
<connor> can you explain which aspect takes 30 minutes? </connor>
<joey> I'm genuinely curious. </joey>
<joey> - Are you performing alchemy in there? </joey>
<joey> Like why is it taking so long? </joey>
<garnt> - I don't know sometimes, </garnt>
<connor> I just feel uncomfortable if I don't feel completely empty. </connor>
<connor> (spits) </connor>
<connor> I need to feel completely empty before I feel </connor>
<garnt> comfortable stopping the process, right. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - That was the fucking stupidest shit. </connor>
<connor> - What are you talking about? </connor>
<connor> - Sometimes, you're just not going to empty out, man. </connor>
<joey> You just got to get on with your day. </joey>
<joey> - You're literally going to be sitting there all day. </joey>
<garnt> - Just go back in. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm completely fine with that, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> - Have you not considered take- </garnt>
<garnt> You don't have a limit to how many shits you can take </garnt>
<garnt> a day, you know? </garnt>
<joey> Like you can, if you take a shit, you get up and you go, oh. </joey>
<joey> - Just come back later. </joey>
<joey> - About an hour later you're like, oh, </joey>
<joey> I'm bit full again. You can go back. </joey>
<connor> - Unlike video games, you can pause. You can come back. </connor>
<joey> - Why do you have to be like, </joey>
<garnt> this is the shit only I can take for the day. </garnt>
<garnt> I got to empty out when I can. </garnt>
<garnt> - You're not a dog. </garnt>
<connor> - You've nerfed yourself. </connor>
<connor> - How've I nerfed myself? </connor>
<connor> - I have that feeling right where I'm not fully empty. </connor>
<joey> I'm like, yeah, Shogun eye, get on with the day. </joey>
<joey> And I'll come back later and finish the job. </joey>
<connor> - I take like two to three shits a day on average. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, me too me too. </connor>
<joey> - Just because, </joey>
<joey> I know like I'm just in and out. </joey>
<joey> If I'm still full it's all right. I'll be back in an hour. </joey>
<connor> - You can tell within like two pushes if it's coming or not, </connor>
<connor> You do not need to wait. </connor>
<garnt> - You don't strain that shit. </garnt>
<garnt> - You're depriving a good fucking experience. </garnt>
<connor> - Bro, you're ass muscle is probably the strongest </connor>
<garnt> fucking thing in existence. </garnt>
<connor> The amount you've probably worked that thing out </connor>
<connor> is probably insane. </connor>
<connor> You could probably crush someone's </connor>
<connor> head with your anus, man. </connor>
<garnt> Jesus Christ. </garnt>
<garnt> - You know, I'ma fucking say it. </garnt>
<joey> Sometimes the shits are the highlights the day. </joey>
<garnt> Sometimes you just need a fucking escape from your world. </garnt>
<joey> - Are your okay? </joey>
<garnt> Are your days okay? </garnt>
<garnt> - My days are fucking good, man. </garnt>
<garnt> After a good shit, are you kidding me? </garnt>
<garnt> Sometimes you just need to escape from your man-cave. </garnt>
<garnt> You just need to go on your Twitter. </garnt>
<connor> - I just imagined that he's just eight hours </connor>
<connor> in the Starbucks. </connor>
<connor> Fucking vein bursting in his head. </connor>
<connor> I gotta go and shit, but I gotta go home. </connor>
<connor> I can't do it here. It's going to take one hour. </connor>
<joey> - There's just a black hole forming in his asshole. </joey>
<garnt> - Like I will do anything to hold it so I can, </garnt>
<garnt> get back home and just get in my comfortable space. </garnt>
<garnt> Right. </garnt>
<garnt> You have. Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> Okay. Some of the best ideas, </garnt>
<garnt> I swear to God. </garnt>
<garnt> Human civilization would be 50% less </garnt>
<garnt> civilized, if people didn't have a space </garnt>
<garnt> to shit in comfortably, </garnt>
<garnt> I swear to God, some of the best ideas come on the toilet. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm not fucking crazy. </garnt>
<connor> - Okay, go on, listen, if you spend the majority </connor>
<connor> of your day the toilet, yes. </connor>
<garnt> Most of your ideas are going to be on the toilet. </garnt>
<connor> So that's where that's coming from, I think. </connor>
<connor> - All I'm saying is the toilet is just a comfortable place </connor>
<connor> with zero distractions. </connor>
<garnt> You're just free with your own thoughts and the only place </garnt>
<garnt> that really, the only place. </garnt>
<connor> - Sounds like you voluntarily put yourself in prison for </connor>
<connor> 30 hours a day. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. Also it's... </connor>
<connor> How much more chaotic is your other explosions happening in </connor>
<connor> your room? Like what? </connor>
<joey> How much more relaxing could it be </joey>
<joey> compared to your own room? </joey>
<garnt> - I'm sorry. </garnt>
<garnt> There's two spots that you just can't take away from me. </garnt>
<joey> My fucking toilet where I shit. </joey>
<joey> And my shower where I can take 40 minutes showers as well. </joey>
<garnt> - 40 minutes showers! </garnt>
<garnt> - This man's morning routine, </garnt>
<connor> you know how you have this influencers who are like, </connor>
<connor> I get up at 5:00 AM. </connor>
<connor> I'm going to do all the shit. </connor>
<connor> Garnt's like, I get up at 5:00 AM, I take a shower. </connor>
<connor> 7:00 AM I take a shit. </connor>
<connor> 9:00 AM I'm ready to work. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> That's literally his start to his day. </connor>
<garnt> - Honestly, after that 40 minutes you have </garnt>
<garnt> the most productive hour of your life, man. </garnt>
<garnt> I swear to fucking God. </garnt>
<garnt> - 40 minute showers. </garnt>
<connor> Dude, Africa would be a first world country </connor>
<joey> if you didn't take showers that long. Jesus Christ. </joey>

<connor> Back to the show. </connor>
<connor> - So there's one thing in Japan </connor>
<connor> as well that I fucking despise. </connor>
<connor> I know I can't have this hazard. </connor>
<connor> So there's this thing that you could buy and I've never seen </connor>
<connor> it in the UK. </connor>
<connor> I don't know if it's a thing elsewhere in Japan. </connor>
<connor> You can buy, like these are cushioned toilet seats. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You can buy cushions to go on your toilet. </connor>
<joey> And it's probably the most vial thing I've ever experienced </joey>
<connor> And Garnt and Sydney fucking bought one. </connor>
<garnt> - Okay. Don't group me in there. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, explain yourself! </garnt>
<garnt> - No! </garnt>
<garnt> I'm not explaining myself because you know, sometimes when </garnt>
<garnt> you go to a house, right? </garnt>
<garnt> And you can tell who the single people are. </garnt>
<connor> And you can tell who the people who are either it's a </connor>
<connor> women's room or it's like, a couple. </connor>
<joey> I don't know any guy in the world who would actually buy a </joey>
<garnt> fluffy thing to place on their toilet. </garnt>
<connor> - It's like a fluffy carpet </connor>
<connor> on your toilet seat. </connor>
<connor> Where you put your sweaty butt cheeks on </connor>
<connor> a hot summer's day. </connor>
<connor> And I was just like, what? </connor>
<connor> I've gotta sit on this? </connor>
<connor> Garnt's cheeks, he's been there 40 minutes. </connor>
<joey> - Well I mean, you know, </joey>
<connor> with the amount of fucking hours he's </connor>
<connor> sitting on a hard surface. </connor>
<joey> He probably needs to fucking cushion his ass. </joey>
<connor> - You could probably replicate Garnt </connor>
<connor> from the DNA in that carpet on the toilet. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> - Make a clone of Garnt. </connor>
<connor> To me it's so disgusting. </connor>
<joey> I don't know why. </joey>
<joey> - I don't want fabrics near a toilet bowl. </joey>
<connor> - It's worryingly close to the butthole. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't like it either. </garnt>
<connor> - Is there a reason why it was purchased? </connor>
<garnt> - (sighs) I don't... </garnt>
<garnt> - Did you know? </garnt>
<garnt> - Honestly. </garnt>
<connor> - Did you push back at all? Were you like no Sydney? </connor>
<garnt> - Honestly, I woke up one day I went to the toilet </garnt>
<garnt> and I was like, Sydney, what the fuck is this thing </garnt>
<garnt> living on our toilet seat? </garnt>
<garnt> And I tried to get it off, but it's glued on. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - No! </garnt>
<garnt> It's so bad! I hate it so much. </garnt>
<garnt> Sure, in the winter. </garnt>
<garnt> Maybe I can understand the purpose of it. </garnt>
<connor> You don't want a cold toilet seat. I get it. </connor>
<connor> It's not that good, but it is the most - </connor>
<joey> - Heated toilet seats were invented for a reason. </joey>
<joey> - It is most disgusting thing in summer. </joey>
<joey> To have to sit on it. </joey>
<joey> It also, you know, </joey>
<connor> when it's not even my toilet and I go to Garnt's house and </connor>
<connor> when he's gone to the toilet, I'm like </connor>
<connor> fuck, fuck! </connor>
<connor> And this feels like, you know, </connor>
<connor> when they designed the homeless benches to be so </connor>
<connor> you can't sleep on them. </connor>
<connor> It felt like it was like a toilet seat designed so no </connor>
<connor> one would be insane enough to shit on it. </connor>
<joey> Why would you want to rub the carpet </joey>
<joey> that Garnt's put his ass cheeks on? </joey>
<connor> Into your ass cheeks! </connor>
<garnt> So disgusting, of course Japan with carpet or something like </garnt>
<garnt> that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, of course. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, it's one of those. </garnt>
<connor> - No, gross. </connor>
<connor> - You don't need it. </connor>
<connor> - I know when I go to your house next, </connor>
<connor> it's going to be gone. </connor>
<connor> Sorry to call you out Sydney. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean there are - </garnt>
<joey> - Or out of spite, she's going to put </joey>
<joey> another one on top of it. </joey>
<joey> So it's extra thick. </joey>
<garnt> - Double decker. </garnt>
<joey> - Double that shit. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, there are just certain items, </joey>
<garnt> which you would never just, </garnt>
<joey> there were certain items I would </joey>
<joey> find that you would just never </joey>
<garnt> see in a guy's place or just the guy, </garnt>
<garnt> like a bachelor pad, for example. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't trust any guy who buys candles, right? </garnt>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - I buy candles. </garnt>
<connor> - Do you buy candles? Do you actually? </connor>
<connor> Scented candles? </connor>
<connor> - I love candles. </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God. </connor>
<garnt> - What's wrong, I love candles, man. </garnt>
<connor> They're great stress relievers. </connor>
<connor> - I mean they're great. </connor>
<connor> - How so? Wait, wait. </connor>
<connor> You buy candles cause you like baths, right? </connor>
<connor> - I love baths. </connor>
<garnt> - Okay, that's the reason. That's the fucking reason. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't, I'd say I take a shower, </connor>
<connor> just a shower without a bath combo </connor>
<garnt> Maybe once a month. </garnt>
<garnt> - Really? </garnt>
<garnt> - I just bath every day. </garnt>
<garnt> - Damn. </garnt>
<garnt> - So how often, do you use your candles? </garnt>
<joey> - My candles. Well... </joey>
<connor> Right now, obviously 'cause been moving </connor>
<connor> haven't really even using them. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I'd say normally. I used to light it like twice a week. </connor>
<joey> - Twice a week? </joey>
<connor> - Twice a week? </connor>
<connor> - Do you have one for each room or..? </connor>
<connor> - No, just my office. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, just your office, okay. </joey>
<connor> - I don't really want it near my bed. </connor>
<connor> I don't trust it. It might just spill. </connor>
<garnt> - I like having a nice scent in my room, </garnt>
<garnt> but there's just something about candles and just having an </garnt>
<joey> open flame somewhere in your room. </joey>
<joey> That just makes me really uncomfortable. </joey>
<joey> - Dude, fucking Aki puts all 8 fucking candles </joey>
<garnt> throughout the house. </garnt>
<garnt> Everywhere I look is a fire hazard. </garnt>
<garnt> - I know, I know. Right? </garnt>
<connor> - I'm just (panting) </connor>
<garnt> - I never put a candle in a room that I'm not in. </garnt>
<joey> I would never do that. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I'd never light a candle when I'm not in the room. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I get scared shitless when I'm working all day. </joey>
<connor> And then I go to those. </connor>
<connor> - We live in Japan. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, go to the beach. </connor>
<connor> - The earthquake could shake these. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, right. </connor>
<connor> - And then I go the bedroom. </connor>
<connor> And there's like 3 candles lit up and I'm like, </connor>
<joey> what do you want this room to smell like? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. When you, when you go to bed. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. It's fair. </connor>
<connor> But not when you're not in the bedroom, it's just dangerous. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, it smells good. </connor>
<joey> Don't get me wrong. But it's like, one is enough. </joey>
<garnt> - When did you start buying candles? </garnt>
<garnt> - Don't know, I got really into it. </garnt>
<connor> And I used to go on like a candle subreddits for candle </connor>
<garnt> recommendations. </garnt>
<connor> - Wait, wait, what? </connor>
<connor> I swear. </connor>
<connor> This has happened in the time period that I started to know </connor>
<connor> you 'cause I've been to your place and I've never seen </connor>
<connor> a candle. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I got </garnt>
<garnt> really into it in London. </garnt>
<connor> I had like four candles in my bedroom. It's a. </connor>
<garnt> - Was it fucking Xena that got you into it? </garnt>
<connor> - No, no, I was the candle guy. </connor>
<garnt> - You were the candle guy? </garnt>
<connor> - It was all me. </connor>
<connor> I bought one candle at a store one day and I thought this is </connor>
<connor> good, but it could smell better. </connor>
<connor> And then I looked for a scent that I thought would be </connor>
<connor> better. And I found one I liked. </connor>
<connor> And I started learning what gives a good, a good scent. </connor>
<connor> You know, a lot of them don't really do good scents. </connor>
<connor> You know, </connor>
<connor> when you sniff it and like floral ones and like grassy type </connor>
<connor> smells, they don't fucking do anything. </connor>
<connor> Like when you, when you burn that shit, </connor>
<connor> it's not going to last. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - There's a few that like the really strong, </connor>
<connor> fruit ones, like cherry and stuff that will stay </connor>
<connor> in your room for like a week. </connor>
<garnt> - I just want to know okay, </garnt>
<garnt> so you got into candles for the scents, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Why not buy one of those something that's not a candle? </garnt>
<connor> - So I do try the - </connor>
<garnt> - Like the air freshener. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, there's air fresheners. </garnt>
<garnt> - They don't do shit. Air fresheners suck. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yes they do. </garnt>
<garnt> - No they don't, they don't do anything. </garnt>
<garnt> - They do, some, a lot of them do a better job. </garnt>
<garnt> - When you've had the Chad candle, </garnt>
<garnt> you can't go back to the beta air freshener. </garnt>
<connor> Yeah, incense is a good. </connor>
<connor> - I fucking love, okay. </connor>
<connor> I fuck with incense. </connor>
<connor> - Of course you do. </connor>
<joey> You're a fucking monk! </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Wait, wait, wait. </connor>
<connor> What's the... </connor>
<connor> Sorry, I forgot the different. </connor>
<garnt> Incense are the ones you burn, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's like the stick that - </garnt>
<connor> - What are the water, the oil soaking ones? </connor>
<connor> What are they? </connor>
<joey> Oh, they're both incense. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, they're both incense. </joey>
<connor> They're different types of incense. </connor>
<connor> - So the burning ones are good as well. Okay </connor>
<connor> I like those. </connor>
<connor> - The burning ones are good for, if you need an instant hit. </connor>
<garnt> If you just need to make the fucking. </garnt>
<connor> Shut the fuck up, Ashley. </connor>
<connor> - Scent! </connor>
<garnt> - No, you're totally right. </garnt>
<garnt> The incense sticks when you burn them are </garnt>
<garnt> much better for like an instant, </garnt>
<garnt> you want to cleanse the room, </garnt>
<connor> you want a nice clean scent. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, and you say smoke. It's not smoky. </connor>
<connor> It's got a nice charred scent to it that really helps. </connor>
<connor> It's very relaxing. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. It's very relaxing. </connor>
<connor> I can see why, you know, </connor>
<garnt> every fucking massage place has one. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. I like the, I find that the oil ones are very good </connor>
<connor> if you want to have a 24 hour one for </connor>
<connor> like maybe two weeks, tops. </connor>
<garnt> - I think the oil ones are the best. </garnt>
<connor> And I feel like a lot of guys don't really consider scents. </connor>
<connor> - I have one put in every room. </connor>
<connor> - The only reason I did was because I started dating </connor>
<garnt> someone. And then I'm just like, mm, this is </garnt>
<garnt> actually smells, actually make the room feel good. </garnt>
<garnt> Who fucking knew, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - I have one in my living room, bedroom and office. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah. Cause I wanna have, I wanna have every room center. </garnt>
<garnt> - But I'm just like, why, why use candles? </garnt>
<joey> And when you have the oil sticks or the incense? </joey>
<garnt> - Because candles are aesthetic. </garnt>
<connor> - Candles or more of a, you know, </connor>
<joey> if you really want to feel like you're relaxing the flame </joey>
<joey> along with like a fireplace it's it's, </joey>
<garnt> it's a safe fireplace. Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - Not in Japan. </joey>
<connor> You can't get a fireplace in Japan. </connor>
<joey> - So the next best thing is a candle. </joey>
<connor> - And candles don't make, you know? </connor>
<connor> - I'm stressed as fuck </connor>
<connor> when I see a can an open flame next to the carpet, </connor>
<garnt> are you kidding me? Like in Japan, if earthquake in years, </garnt>
<garnt> buh-bye so. </garnt>
<connor> - Trim the wick to the right size. </connor>
<garnt> Make sure it's not burning too aggressively. </garnt>
<garnt> Make it burn slowly. </garnt>
<garnt> - What the fuck are you talking about? </garnt>
<garnt> - I had like specific scissors for trimming wicks. </garnt>
<garnt> - Are you serious? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, cause I used to buy big candles, never trimmed them. </connor>
<garnt> - How am I just finding out about this? </garnt>
<garnt> - I just like candles in it. It's nothing. </garnt>
<joey> It's not a big deal. I just, </joey>
<joey> - For a guy it's a big deal. </joey>
<joey> So occasionally I'd buy, like there was a Yankee candles. </joey>
<connor> That's like the that's like, I've just gotten into candles, </connor>
<connor> candles, these are basic candles. </connor>
<joey> You know what I mean? This is a baby's first. </joey>
<joey> - Are you really about to gatekeep candles? </joey>
<garnt> - I was, honestly. </garnt>
<garnt> - He's a candle connoisseur. </garnt>
<garnt> - The Yankee candles that you get, </garnt>
<garnt> a very artificial scents and you get like, </garnt>
<garnt> you can get like big ones and you get like a good value for </garnt>
<garnt> money. But the problem is, is that because they're so big, </garnt>
<garnt> like this fucking big, </garnt>
<connor> After like one week or two days of using it, the. </connor>
<connor> (mumbles) tunnels down, that's a candle term by the way, </connor>
<connor> tunneling, you wouldn't understand if you went into it, </connor>
<connor> like so it goes right down and you have to like, </connor>
<garnt> but depending on how you burn it, </garnt>
<garnt> you can't just keep burning it. </garnt>
<garnt> Otherwise it will just dig down. So you have to like, </garnt>
<connor> you have to be smart. </connor>
<garnt> - Do you buy like custom made candles? </garnt>
<connor> - I really like them. When you go to, </connor>
<connor> there was some candle stores in London that is really nice </connor>
<connor> candles, really expensive. </connor>
<connor> But man, the scents are so nice. </connor>
<connor> And you would get like really nice spreading scents a lot. </connor>
<connor> Like I said, like, </connor>
<connor> I'd say half of the candles out there like that, </connor>
<connor> you can get an Amazon. Don't do anything. </connor>
<connor> They just burn and then you're like, I can't smell shit. </connor>
<joey> Right? Like the scent should be strong, </joey>
<connor> but not last too long. </connor>
<garnt> - No, I'm part of the incense master race. </garnt>
<connor> - Both have their place. </connor>
<connor> - Nothing to me can beat an incense. </connor>
<garnt> And to me, candles are just like the middle child. </garnt>
<connor> - I wonder why </connor>
<connor> Garnt's in the dictionary like incense, I like these two. </connor>
<connor> - This is one of the most surprising tangents </connor>
<connor> we've ever gone on Trash Taste. </connor>
<connor> - I swear I mentioned I like candles before. </connor>
<joey> - No, you've never, you've never, </joey>
<joey> that's why we're freaking out. </joey>
<garnt> - Neither on Trash Taste or in real life. </garnt>
<connor> - This is real life. </connor>
<connor> - So it's great. You know, you can, I'm </connor>
<joey> easy to buy gifts for. </joey>
<joey> You can just buy me a nice candle. </joey>
<connor> - I wish I fucking knew knew that I just got a nice candle. </connor>
<joey> - Cause every time I'm like, "shit well </joey>
<joey> he has everything Jojo related. </joey>
<connor> I literally can't get him anything anymore." </connor>
<garnt> But now I know you like candles. </garnt>
<joey> I'll just give you a fucking candle. </joey>
<joey> - Give me an expensive camera. </joey>
<garnt> - But now you have to get a candle that impresses him. </garnt>
<joey> - Great. </joey>
<garnt> - Don't get me. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't like candles that are like carved into shapes. </garnt>
<garnt> That's a load of nonsense. </garnt>
<garnt> You're just tacking on value to get me a good candle. </garnt>
<connor> You know what I mean? Like I just, yeah. </connor>
<connor> I mean, that's a, there's a lot of nice candles out there. </connor>
<connor> Shout out to the local candlemakers in your area. </connor>
<connor> If there is one, they probably make good candles. </connor>
<garnt> - What do you guys think of like scented soaps, </garnt>
<connor> like homemade soap. </connor>
<connor> - Oh gosh, I know you're going to say. </connor>
<connor> - I'm only mentioning this is because like Sydney, </connor>
<connor> Sydney recently really got into meeting, </connor>
<connor> making custom made soaps and you know, they honestly, </connor>
<joey> honestly, I'm, kind of sold, I like the smell. </joey>
<joey> They look good. They look aesthetic. </joey>
<joey> The only problem with like custom made and scented soaps is </joey>
<joey> that they look great when you just get them. </joey>
<joey> When they're like starts to melt. </joey>
<joey> When it's like a square block, it looks so aesthetic. </joey>
<joey> It looks great. </joey>
<joey> And then you use it for like two weeks and like falling out </joey>
<connor> of him. </connor>
<connor> Like she puts like fresh flowers in it and </connor>
<connor> it looks fucking amazing until the flowers start </connor>
<garnt> falling off and falling in the sink. </garnt>
<connor> - I really liked the, like the hard soap </connor>
<joey> but I don't know when I started preferring it to like, </joey>
<joey> the pump soaps. </joey>
<joey> - The hand soap? </joey>
<garnt> - Hand soap and body. </garnt>
<garnt> I like the bricks. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't know. I don't like the body soaps. </connor>
<connor> - You don't? </connor>
<connor> - No, no, no. </connor>
<garnt> - I feel like it really gets on your body. </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like it really deep cleans you as opposed to like the </garnt>
<connor> like liquid soaps you get. </connor>
<garnt> - It depends. </garnt>
<garnt> - What I love about liquid soaps is that </garnt>
<garnt> it feels like it just coats your body. </garnt>
<garnt> - I agree.. </garnt>
<connor> But like the hand soap really gets in there and you can get </connor>
<connor> some real nice scents. </connor>
<garnt> - It just feels rough. </garnt>
<garnt> It feels rough. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, that's what I like. </garnt>
<connor> It feels like it's really fucking cleaning my skin. </connor>
<garnt> - And I feel like I'm, </garnt>
<garnt> I've never thought that that deep choice just sitting here </garnt>
<joey> being dumb, a wash my body. </joey>
<connor> Yes. </connor>
<connor> - You can get like soaps with like a lamb going off on one </connor>
<connor> today. </connor>
<connor> You can get like soaps with stuff in them that has like </connor>
<connor> little, a course material. </connor>
<connor> So that even when it's like, you're going away, </connor>
<joey> it feels quite cool. </joey>
<joey> - I do like the kind of charcoal soaps. </joey>
<joey> - Yes, sir. </joey>
<joey> It's kinda like, </joey>
<joey> it's kinda like scratchy against your skin feels like really </joey>
<joey> gets in your skin. </joey>
<connor> So you don't feel like you're losing grip as well. </connor>
<connor> So you can just kinda like go ham. </connor>
<connor> - I like those. </connor>
<connor> Because after you wash it off, you kind of feel. </connor>
<connor> Like a cold man. </connor>
<connor> - It feels so good. </connor>
<connor> - And it's like, oh that's what a clean skin feels like. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - The reason I prefer liquid body soap at least, </garnt>
<garnt> is because just cause I feel like the scents </garnt>
<garnt> stick for longer. </garnt>
<garnt> Like I feel and smell fresh. </garnt>
<connor> - Perhaps you would like the classic dove body soap. </connor>
<connor> - You can't go wrong with that. </connor>
<garnt> - Great, man. </garnt>
<garnt> I just lather that stuff on. </garnt>
<garnt> In the onsense in Japan </garnt>
<connor> there's like no limit to how many pumps you can do for of </connor>
<connor> like the shampoo and body wash. </connor>
<connor> And man I take full advantage of that. </connor>
<garnt> - Well, normally it's like you, </garnt>
<garnt> you do one clean over, right? In the fucking onsense </garnt>
<connor> it's like at least three. </connor>
<connor> - I'm like, it'll be like, </connor>
<connor> I'll be like how much conditioner do I want? </connor>
<connor> I'm like, don't stop, more. </connor>
<connor> I'll do like 10 pumps of conditioner. I won't stop. </connor>
<connor> You know sometimes conditioner, it doesn't </connor>
<connor> feel like it gets in your hair. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> I never used condition a normally I don't really feel like </connor>
<connor> it's necessary now, </connor>
<connor> but in the onset I'm like every single like patch of hair </connor>
<connor> that's allowed kick, </connor>
<connor> it gets conditioned and the body wash I'm like pump, </connor>
<connor> pump nothing. </connor>
<connor> Pump. </connor>
<joey> - You literally turn into a Yeti in the onsense. </joey>
<connor> - I want to be fully soaped up. </connor>
<joey> - Of course, man. </joey>
<joey> - I'm like, I'm paying for it. </joey>
<joey> It's part of the experience. </joey>
<joey> They just see me like slipping cause I'm so soapy, </joey>
<connor> I'm trying to get on there. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh, I love it. </garnt>
<garnt> On the topic of cleaning products or at least there's, </garnt>
<garnt> there's like one thing in Thailand, </garnt>
<garnt> which my mom always buys and I can't stand it at all. </garnt>
<connor> And I don't know why she always buys it. Like, </connor>
<connor> I feel like with toothpaste, </connor>
<connor> it's just universally known that there should be like a bit </connor>
<connor> alkaline and it's like maybe minty you know, </connor>
<connor> most of the time it's minty in Thailand, </connor>
<connor> they sell salt flavored toothpaste with like real, </connor>
<connor> like with salt cubes in the toothpaste. </connor>
<connor> And it's the most apparent piece of like, why I like it. </connor>
<connor> The most horrible I've ever tasted and ever used at all. </connor>
<joey> - What, what. </joey>
<connor> - Why, why would you put something that </connor>
<connor> dries your mouth out? </connor>
<connor> - I'm so confused about. </connor>
<garnt> - Thailand. I don't know if it's only Thailand. </garnt>
<garnt> I just know it's like readily available, </garnt>
<garnt> like fucking everywhere in Thailand </garnt>
<garnt> and my mom always fucking buys it. </garnt>
<connor> - And I just imagine in the factory like, </connor>
<garnt> okay so we're going make toothpaste </garnt>
<joey> now put the salt in, what? </joey>
<joey> - Whoops. </joey>
<joey> - Toothpaste's one of those things where </joey>
<connor> I firmly believe you have to get a branded </connor>
<connor> toothpaste every time. </connor>
<connor> You know when you go to hotels </connor>
<connor> and you have that like toothpaste, like the tiny white. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And it just tastes like you've </connor>
<connor> just put foam on your teeth. </connor>
<connor> You're like, I don't feel like my teeth got clean. </connor>
<joey> Give me some Aquafresh or something. </joey>
<joey> I don't know why. I don't know if this is great branding, </joey>
<joey> but I feel like it's just one of those products that I'm </joey>
<joey> like, I need to get branded. </joey>
<joey> - I'm the same. </joey>
<connor> I definitely need something that I want like a brand that I </connor>
<connor> know as well. That I'm like, I've used that before. </connor>
<joey> I've seen that in commercials. </joey>
<connor> - Give me some Aquafresh, give me some Colgate or something. </connor>
<connor> Something, something that feels like it's doing something. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. Because sometimes, especially in the hotel ones, </connor>
<joey> they give you like that fucking tiny little white one. </joey>
<joey> - Right, the white one. </joey>
<joey> - And it's meant to last you two brushes. </joey>
<joey> Could you do one in the evening and one in the morning. </joey>
<joey> That shit barely lasts one. </joey>
<joey> - Why do dentists tell you to use like a little bit? </joey>
<joey> I want to go in on my teeth. </joey>
<joey> - They're only supposed to use like a pea. </joey>
<joey> - Right? Yeah. </joey>
<joey> When I do that, I'm like, I didn't do anything. </joey>
<connor> - Do you guys floss? </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<garnt> - No. </garnt>
<garnt> - Is this an American thing? </garnt>
<connor> - Mainly. North American. </connor>
<connor> - Because I don't know a single person </connor>
<connor> in my life who flosses. </connor>
<garnt> I think it's something that the dentist always tells you to </garnt>
<garnt> do, but I don't think I've done. </garnt>
<connor> - Dentists in the UK don't tell you to floss </connor>
<connor> unless you ask them, should I floss? </connor>
<connor> And upon which they'll say yes, </connor>
<connor> but they won't tell you to floss. </connor>
<garnt> - I'm contractually obliged to say yes. </garnt>
<connor> - So yeah. It's one of those things that America, </connor>
<joey> North America just does. </joey>
<connor> - Honestly. It's a lot of work. </connor>
<joey> Like I just want to get in there, brush my teeth. </joey>
<joey> Yeah. It looks clean. </joey>
<connor> - Haha, British isn't it? Brush your teeth, </connor>
<joey> you've got terrible teeth. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> That's what Americans say when you </connor>
<connor> tell them you don't floss, </connor>
<connor> but it's literally just outside of America doesn't do it. </connor>
<connor> I don't know anyone in Europe who flosses. It's not common. </connor>
<connor> You don't really see it in stores either. </connor>
<connor> You have to look for it. It's kind of a specialized item. </connor>
<joey> It's not just on the shelves. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But some people do it. I know some people who do, </connor>
<connor> but it's very much of your own discretion to do it. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - It's not something that's taught to you to do. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> This is like a random tangent throw out. </connor>
<connor> Like since we're on like the topic of scents </connor>
<connor> and incense and stuff like that, </connor>
<connor> how'd you guys feel about massages because I don't, </connor>
<joey> I don't know if it's because I'm Thai and when I think </joey>
<joey> massage, I think Thai massage, </joey>
<joey> I can't fucking stand massages. </joey>
<joey> - Really? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - You don't like it? </joey>
<joey> - Sometimes I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> sometimes you get a massage and I'm just like, </joey>
<garnt> why did I pay someone? </garnt>
<garnt> Like, why didn't I just pay someone to beat the shit </garnt>
<garnt> out of me for an hour? Like. </garnt>
<connor> - I feel like I'm not old enough to enjoy them. </connor>
<joey> I feel like I haven't got. </joey>
<joey> - In 10 years time. I'll really love it. </joey>
<joey> - I feel like I'm still at that age where I'm just worrying </joey>
<joey> about every single aspect of the massage when I'm there. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, what if I tickle my feet? </joey>
<joey> - What if I discover a new kink? </joey>
<garnt> - What if I fart while they're massaging, </garnt>
<connor> What if they think my body is ugly, you know, </connor>
<connor> all these things are very, you know, </connor>
<connor> cause I had one where I had to like, you know, </connor>
<joey> we have to take off your shirt and stuff. I'm like, oh gosh, </joey>
<joey> but you have to, right. </joey>
<joey> - Sometimes you have to be nude, right? </joey>
<connor> - Yes. </connor>
<connor> - Some massage places. </connor>
<connor> - I'm just not at that age where I can appreciate it yet. </connor>
<connor> - Also to me it's like, I don't know, my, </connor>
<connor> my body isn't like sore enough that someone massaging me </connor>
<joey> feels good. </joey>
<connor> - It feels good. </connor>
<connor> But it doesn't feel like worth the like a hundred bucks. </connor>
<garnt> - Right? Exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, I like, I hear stories because like, </garnt>
<connor> and this has happened to me as well, </connor>
<garnt> where you go for massage and like, </garnt>
<connor> it's so fucking hard that like tears start coming out. </connor>
<connor> People wear that like a badge of honor. Like, oh man, </connor>
<connor> I went to this massage and it hurt so much </connor>
<garnt> I started crying and I'm just like, yo, </garnt>
<garnt> you paid for this. </garnt>
<connor> - Why would you pay someone to like tear your ligament? </connor>
<connor> That just doesn't make sense to me again. Like I feel, </connor>
<connor> you know, when it gets to like my thirties and forties, </connor>
<connor> when, you know, </connor>
<connor> naturally your body is going to start to deteriorate where </connor>
<connor> it's going to start to get sore. </connor>
<connor> That's I feel the point where I'll be like, </connor>
<connor> I go for a massage. But as of right now, it's like, </connor>
<joey> if my body's sore, I'll just do a couple stretches. </joey>
<connor> - I just feel like, </connor>
<connor> you know, when I go to these massage things, I'm like, </connor>
<connor> even though I'm sure they're trained, I'm like, </connor>
<garnt> I feel like you're just... </garnt>
<garnt> - You're just beating the out of me? </garnt>
<garnt> - Like you're just beating the shit out of me. </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like you're not really doing anything. </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like, you know, I want to question the, </garnt>
<connor> the training authority who gave you the approval. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. Like, like honestly, like, especially like, </garnt>
<garnt> I dunno how people can go to massages for like two, </garnt>
<garnt> three hours. </garnt>
<connor> - I feel like you need to know someone who knows the </connor>
<garnt> best parlor. Cause I've had it in hotels before. </garnt>
<garnt> - Hotel massages are the worse. </garnt>
<garnt> - I just thought like, this is just weird. </garnt>
<garnt> I just didn't like this. I felt like, </garnt>
<joey> I felt like someone called you up, </joey>
<joey> you reluctantly showed up and now you're just beating the </joey>
<connor> shit out of me. </connor>
<connor> I feel like you had no appointments scheduled today. </connor>
<connor> I'm the asshole who scheduled one appointment today. </connor>
<connor> And you came in on your day off and now you're beating the </connor>
<connor> shit out of me for it. </connor>
<connor> And I'm not saying you have to enjoy it. </connor>
<connor> I don't want you to enjoy it. But I also, </connor>
<connor> I don't want you to hate me for getting a massage. </connor>
<joey> You know, I paid money. </joey>
<joey> I don't want to feel like I'm getting hissed at. </joey>
<joey> - How do you guys feel about saunas? </joey>
<connor> - I fucking love saunas bro. </connor>
<joey> - I am a weak little baby when it comes to saunas. </joey>
<connor> My God. Like every time, </connor>
<connor> every time we go to a nonsense and we sit there like a </connor>
<garnt> minute passes, I'm like, I'm done. </garnt>
<connor> - Everyone does saunas wrong. </connor>
<connor> No one goes in the water before they go in the sauna. </connor>
<connor> You have to go in the cold water before you go in. </connor>
<garnt> - I just think I'm very sensitive or not sensitive. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like my. </garnt>
<connor> - No one enjoys going in the cold water. It's awful. </connor>
<connor> - No, no, I'm not. </connor>
<connor> I'm not talking about cold water. I'm talking about heat. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. If you go in there after just going in the onset, </connor>
<connor> when your body's already at like 37, 38 degrees </connor>
<connor> fully heated up. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> It's going to be hell, go in the cold water, </connor>
<connor> then go in and you'll be able to do it. </connor>
<garnt> - No, because I just think, well, </garnt>
<garnt> I just feel like, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> whenever we go to the onsen, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm always the one who goes into the, even the water, </garnt>
<garnt> the least just because like, I, </garnt>
<garnt> I can't sit or I can't like my tolerance to being in hot </garnt>
<garnt> places or like sitting in a hot place for like a long time. </garnt>
<garnt> It's just fucking shit. </garnt>
<garnt> - Did you go in the cold water Garnt? </garnt>
<garnt> - What does that matter? </garnt>
<connor> - Did you go in the cold water? </connor>
<garnt> This is important. </garnt>
<connor> - Okay. </connor>
<connor> - Did you go in the cold water? </connor>
<connor> - No, I didn't. </connor>
<connor> - There you go. </connor>
<joey> - You go in the cold water before you jump </joey>
<connor> in the onsen? </connor>
<connor> - Before the sauna. </connor>
<joey> - Aren't you supposed to go in after the sauna? </joey>
<connor> - After, then go back in. </connor>
<joey> - Ah, but like that. </joey>
<garnt> But like sometimes, sometimes you're going to an onsen. </garnt>
<connor> It's just like way too hot. I don't know, like. </connor>
<connor> - That's why you jump in the cold water. </connor>
<connor> - To me, to me that it's, to me, </connor>
<garnt> it's meant to be a relaxing experience and I shouldn't need </garnt>
<garnt> to like, like do a compromise to have a relaxing experience. </garnt>
<joey> You know. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah like I don't want to give myself pain </joey>
<garnt> on the opposite end of the spectrum to be comfortable. </garnt>
<joey> And you know, I'm not, </joey>
<garnt> I'm not paying to give myself an ice bucket challenge. </garnt>
<garnt> You know, you fucking do that for charity, man. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. Sorry. </connor>
<connor> I was Googling. I was like, I swear there's like </connor>
<connor> health benefits to going in the cold sauna after, </connor>
<joey> especially when you heat your body up, </joey>
<joey> it's like amazing health benefits. </joey>
<joey> - I know like saunas have health benefits. </joey>
<joey> - When you get out of that cold water after going in </joey>
<connor> the sauna as well, </connor>
<connor> God damn does your body feel good? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I'm sure. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's like, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> that's like saying that there's a health benefit, </garnt>
<connor> which I'm sure there is to taking a cold shower in the </connor>
<connor> morning, but I'm pretty sure I don't want a cold shower, </connor>
<connor> And I'm pretty sure only psychopaths </connor>
<garnt> might go through with that. </garnt>
<garnt> Or they're like trained in fucking the Navy seals. </garnt>
<garnt> - Next time you go the onsen, </garnt>
<joey> please go jump in the cold water after. </joey>
<joey> I swear to God, you'll feel amazing. </joey>
<connor> - After the sauna? </connor>
<joey> - After and before. </joey>
<connor> - I'll go in, I've gone in after the sauna, </connor>
<connor> because that's what you're supposed to do. </connor>
<connor> And it feels fucking great. </connor>
<connor> - Going before as well before, </connor>
<garnt> because then you go into the sauna and it's heating your </garnt>
<garnt> body up. It feels very nice. </garnt>
<garnt> - I just don't enjoy saunas. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's cause in Japan, </garnt>
<garnt> they sock right in every time I went in Europe, it was like, </garnt>
<garnt> you're in the sauna, TM with the boys, you know, </garnt>
<joey> you chat and you laugh and you have a good time in the </joey>
<joey> sauna, you talk. </joey>
<joey> In Japan it's like... </joey>
<joey> - You're not allowed to talk in the sauna. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. It's like a, an interrogation room. </joey>
<joey> No one talks. It's just what everyone's just sitting there. </joey>
<joey> And it's like really awkward. </joey>
<connor> And I feel like sauna is where the comradery should come out </connor>
<connor> with you and the boys, man. </connor>
<connor> You'd just been out skiing. </connor>
<connor> Just been out in the snow, whatever. </connor>
<connor> I don't know what the fuck you've been doing? </connor>
<connor> But yeah, you talk in the sauna, you laugh. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah that's us in the onset though. </connor>
<joey> - You can do that in the onsen with less pain. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, but that's how you get through the sauna </joey>
<connor> as well by talking with the boys. </connor>
<connor> - Get through the sauna. </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<joey> Because if you think about being in the sauna, </joey>
<joey> you can't stay in the sauna, </joey>
<connor> if you've never been in the sauna, I mean, </connor>
<connor> you can't really relate to this, but yeah. </connor>
<connor> It's a very hot room, just a hot room. </connor>
<garnt> - So what about saunas versus steam rooms? </garnt>
<connor> - I prefer saunas.. </connor>
<connor> - What's the difference? </connor>
<garnt> - A sauna is like dry. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like 90 degrees. </garnt>
<garnt> - The steam room is just like Japanese </garnt>
<connor> summer simulator basically. </connor>
<joey> - Oh fuck that. </joey>
<garnt> - Saunas are way common. </garnt>
<garnt> But steam rooms are similar, </garnt>
<garnt> - Steam room sounds horrible. </garnt>
<connor> - It's not that bad actually. </connor>
<connor> - But I hate the humidity. </connor>
<connor> - Well it's to get you sweating. </connor>
<garnt> - I prefer steam rooms because it feels like it takes </garnt>
<connor> longer before I sweat in the sauna. </connor>
<connor> It feels good to sweat basically. </connor>
<garnt> That's that's why you sit in the sauna steam room and just </garnt>
<garnt> like it makes that process a bit faster. </garnt>
<garnt> So I have to stay in there for shorter, </garnt>
<connor> a shorter amount of time. </connor>
<connor> - I just feel like </connor>
<connor> I get like a real relaxing sensation </connor>
<connor> that I just can't get anywhere else. </connor>
<connor> Other than the sauna cold water combo, </connor>
<connor> nothing like it relaxes me. </connor>
<garnt> - Have you tried taking a 40 minute shit? </garnt>
<connor> - I thought you were gonna say Xanax or something. </connor>
<connor> (laughter) </connor>
<garnt> - Melatonin. </garnt>
<connor> - It's so nice. If you're scared of it, </connor>
<connor> just to do one leg in at a time, </connor>
<joey> just slowly get in there and yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I feel like you can't do the one leg at a time. </joey>
<joey> You just gotta jump in. </joey>
<joey> - Be careful though. </joey>
<joey> You can go into shock from doing it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that's what I'm scared of. </joey>
<joey> - You just have to, that's why you shouldn't. </joey>
<joey> Sometimes you shouldn't jump into depends on what you are </joey>
<joey> and how easily you get lightheaded. </joey>
<joey> I think I nearly went into shock one time I did it. </joey>
<connor> - Jeez. </connor>
<connor> I jumped in and my heart was like, and I was like, </connor>
<joey> I just like calmed down, I had to like calm my body down. </joey>
<joey> Cause I felt like I was gonna go into shock. </joey>
<joey> - It's terrible. </joey>
<connor> - Cause your chest goes super tight if you do too fast. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. I mean, you're basically experiencing hypothermia. </joey>
<joey> - You're going from 90 degree room to 20 degree water, </joey>
<joey> but like some motors, your body instantly. </joey>
<connor> So it needs to be careful, but it is really fun. </connor>
<garnt> Just be careful. </garnt>
<connor> - Not a shock, but (mumbles). </connor>
<connor> - Some of the best things in life are, you know, </connor>
<connor> very worrying. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. I mean, it's, that's a quote. </garnt>
<connor> I mean, </connor>
<garnt> like I remember like there's this fucking </garnt>
<garnt> waded onsen. I remember us going there. </garnt>
<connor> - We need to go before it closes. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> It might be closed by the time this comes out. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. Like there are some things which </connor>
<garnt> I'm convinced is just... </garnt>
<connor> - We should talk about the onsen, </connor>
<connor> actually before we go into the onsen, </connor>
<connor> the Awada onsen that's being shut down in Japan. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Should we talk about that now? </connor>
<connor> - So yeah, unfortunately Awada onsen </connor>
<connor> is probably the best onsen in Tokyo. </connor>
<garnt> - The first onsen we went to. </garnt>
<garnt> - The most touristy at least. </garnt>
<connor> - The first one that Jerry took us to is closing down. </connor>
<connor> It's not because it's not good enough customers, </connor>
<connor> not because of COVID, </connor>
<connor> but because of this weird Japanese law where you can't </connor>
<joey> lease land more than a certain amount, </joey>
<garnt> - Because they were literally renting the land </garnt>
<connor> and now it's expired. </connor>
<connor> - It's insane. </connor>
<connor> Right. It's just amazing, beautiful onsen in Tokyo bay </connor>
<connor> Right. </connor>
<garnt> - Like it's right opposite the fucking Gun dam as well. </garnt>
<connor> So it's the perfect day trip because yeah, </connor>
<connor> because you go, there you go view the Gun dam, </connor>
<connor> then you see a giant Mecca and it's absolutely incredible. </connor>
<garnt> And then you just go chill in the onsen with the boys, </garnt>
<connor> right? </connor>
<garnt> - This onsen is unlike any other. </garnt>
<connor> There's like a whole summer festival area that is </connor>
<garnt> permanently there where you can like do a bunch of summer </garnt>
<garnt> activities. </garnt>
<garnt> There's restaurants in the onsen and once you get </garnt>
<garnt> through it, you can scan it with like </garnt>
<connor> this kinda like watch thing. It's a rubber band. </connor>
<connor> You can get beer, you can get a full meal. </connor>
<connor> That's delicious. You can go. </connor>
<connor> It's amazing to show many different baths, an outside </connor>
<connor> bath as well, a sauna as well. </connor>
<connor> And like there's a salt bath. </connor>
<connor> It's honestly one of the most amazing onsens. </connor>
<connor> - There's like a little outside garden area. </connor>
<garnt> - You can spend all day there because you like, </garnt>
<connor> have you talked about like the middle area where it's just </connor>
<connor> basically summer festival, </connor>
<connor> the summer festival where you do everything that you've seen </connor>
<joey> in every summer festival anime, </joey>
<joey> literally you don't even have to go on the bonds to tell </joey>
<garnt> yourself there's there's like an arcade there there's </garnt>
<connor> - Like good ice cream, the hot mill cold mill </connor>
<connor> You can have a full meal. Like it was amazing. </connor>
<connor> And it's a shame that it's shutting down. </connor>
<garnt> Cause I don't really know any onsen that's </garnt>
<garnt> like that. </garnt>
<joey> Especially in Tokyo. </joey>
<garnt> - Cause it's shutting down this year? </garnt>
<joey> - It's announced September. Yeah. </joey>
<connor> I think so. I want to go one last time. </connor>
<joey> - I think by the time this is airing, </joey>
<connor> it's probably gone. </connor>
<joey> - Shit, is it probably gone by the time? </joey>
<garnt> - It might be close, I think it might be like a week </garnt>
<garnt> or two away, but yeah, </garnt>
<garnt> it's an amazing onsen and I'm very sad to see it go. </garnt>
<connor> - September 5th. </connor>
<garnt> So what were you saying? Sorry. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah so talking about the onsen area there. </garnt>
<garnt> So there's this area we've just picked it up right, </garnt>
<garnt> but there is this area, in an onsen right where it's like, </garnt>
<garnt> it's like a little stream that you can walk through. </garnt>
<garnt> That's meant to massage your feet. </garnt>
<garnt> There's massaging your feet. </garnt>
<garnt> And then there's just walking on pebbles, </garnt>
<garnt> like being in like one of, </garnt>
<garnt> some of the most pain in your life. Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> And calling that a relaxing experience. Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> What about that is relaxing? </joey>
<connor> - I can't take a single step in that stream. </connor>
<connor> So it's like lots of little like goblins </connor>
<joey> and just doing this on the bottom of your feet, every step. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, this is not, this is not relaxing. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> So they have this little stream right? </garnt>
<garnt> It's like people walk on it and it's kind of like an </garnt>
<garnt> endurance test, right? </garnt>
<connor> It's not like you, you know when fucking like monks, </connor>
<connor> like test then jurors by walking on coals. </connor>
<connor> That's what it felt like. </connor>
<connor> - It is quite bad. </connor>
<connor> - Because you have like, </connor>
<connor> you have like little pebbles that are just molded </connor>
<connor> into the grounds that just stick out. And it's just like, </connor>
<connor> you're meant to walk on it and it's meant to massage </connor>
<connor> your feet. Right. </connor>
<garnt> And it hurts so much and the stream goes on forever. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like 200 meters long. </garnt>
<garnt> It's not that long, but it's pretty long. </garnt>
<joey> - It's pretty long. </joey>
<joey> But then at the end of the stream, </joey>
<joey> there's this little like service you can do where you can </joey>
<joey> get these tiny fish to eat the dead skin off your feet. </joey>
<joey> - This is common in a lot of countries. </joey>
<garnt> Right. Some people just do this a lot. </garnt>
<connor> Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Thailand has them as well, but it was actually like, </connor>
<connor> so I tried it for the first time with you guys. </connor>
<connor> And I still, </connor>
<garnt> I think I still might have the video of us trying it for the </garnt>
<garnt> first time. </garnt>
<joey> - If we have it, we'll play it. </joey>
<garnt> - It's so rare in life that you try something and you feel </garnt>
<garnt> a sensation that you've never felt before in your life. </garnt>
<garnt> And that was me like feeling like the hundreds, </garnt>
<connor> hundreds of little fish, just eating the dead skin. </connor>
<connor> I was just like having hundreds of like mini electric shocks </connor>
<connor> on your feet. And I remember when I first felt it, </connor>
<connor> it felt like the most uncomfortable thing I'd ever felt </connor>
<connor> before. Cause I'm just like, what is this sensation? </connor>
<garnt> I've never felt this before ever. </garnt>
<garnt> - There's a service actually that </garnt>
<connor> I found in Okinawa the last time I went because there was </connor>
<connor> another one in like a mole in Okinawa, you know, </connor>
<connor> they had the little fish, so I did it </connor>
<connor> Cause I think it feels really fucking nice. </connor>
<connor> And then the guy was like, oh, there's a, </connor>
<garnt> if you go down the road, there's a service we can get, </garnt>
<garnt> you can do that with your whole body. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't want to do that. </garnt>
<garnt> - You can literally submerge your entire body </garnt>
<garnt> all the way up to your neck and just stand there. </garnt>
<connor> And the fish will just eat your whole body. </connor>
<garnt> - Did you do it? </garnt>
<garnt> . No, I didn't, </garnt>
<joey> I wasn't doing it. But I was like, I kind of wanna watch. </joey>
<garnt> - There are certain areas of my body that I'm just like, </garnt>
<joey> I don't want fish coming anywhere near this man, eating </joey>
<joey> the skin off this part, no, thank you. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I'm sure. </joey>
<joey> Like, you know, </joey>
<connor> maybe we probably wear pants and stuff like that so that, </connor>
<connor> you know, your privates are kind of covered up, but still. </connor>
<garnt> - I would hope so. </garnt>
<garnt> - Could you imagine like a little fish just like </garnt>
<joey> getting like under your arms and on your back and shit. </joey>
<joey> - The nipple man. </joey>
<connor> It's like probably like one of those nipple connectors. </connor>
<connor> - You probably have to wear like nipple pads </connor>
<connor> or something. </connor>
<connor> - Wear a bra. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah wear a bra or something, I don't know. </garnt>
<connor> - They'll like sneak in through probably. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, probably. </connor>
<joey> - Have you guys ever had like a spa day or like gone to like </joey>
<joey> spas willingly by yourself? </joey>
<joey> - I haven't gone by myself. </joey>
<joey> - By yourself? Have you been by yourself? </joey>
<joey> - I mean, sometimes you go to a hotel </joey>
<joey> and like Sydney just goes for like a spa day </joey>
<garnt> and I'm just like, you know what? </garnt>
<garnt> I don't really like spa days because that's like, </garnt>
<garnt> that's like three hours of my life, </garnt>
<garnt> that I could be doing relaxing, doing something else. </garnt>
<connor> - Self care Garnt, self care. </connor>
<garnt> - Is it self-care though? </garnt>
<connor> - How much more of a benefit does it do? </connor>
<joey> Like health wise you're ranking. </joey>
<connor> Or is it just like a mental thing? </connor>
<joey> - Stress is a big killer, right? So. </joey>
<joey> - That's what I mean, is it purely a mental thing? </joey>
<joey> - It's a mental de-stress, </joey>
<connor> but like having your body like beaten up or massaged </connor>
<garnt> - That's not relaxing for me. </garnt>
<connor> - Some people it's very relaxing to have that. </connor>
<connor> - I tried it once actually, </connor>
<connor> when we was staying at a hotel with hockey and now he's </connor>
<connor> like, come on, just try it, just try it once. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, all right, fine. </connor>
<connor> I'll try once. I wasn't, it was like three hour course. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, fucks sakes that's </connor>
<connor> three hours of my life gone. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, all right, you know what? </connor>
<joey> I wouldn't do that again. But that was relaxing. </joey>
<connor> - So that was my blood pressure until I see the price, </connor>
<joey> how much, 400 bucks? Fuck. </joey>
<joey> - The stress comes rising up. </joey>
<joey> Another reason why I don't like doing spa days. </joey>
<garnt> - Well ours came with the deal. </garnt>
<garnt> Oh. So it was like, oh, it's free. </garnt>
<garnt> Fuck yeah I'll do it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Fair enough. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - It's good. But like if I had to pay 400 bucks for it, no. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> I could never dedicate more than an hour to something to </garnt>
<garnt> doing something that's meant to be, I guess, relaxing. </garnt>
<joey> - And I didn't even experience like two-thirds of it. </joey>
<joey> Cause I was asleep. </joey>
<connor> I literally woke up. </connor>
<joey> I literally fell asleep while they were giving me a massage </joey>
<connor> and then two hours later they were like, all right, </connor>
<connor> you're done. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, oh good. </connor>
<joey> That was a great experience. </joey>
<joey> - I did fall asleep at a massage once actually. </joey>
<joey> I just don't remember anything that happened. </joey>
<joey> - Well clearly, you were asleep. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, you were asleep. </joey>
<garnt> - I just felt like I wasted money cause I just, </garnt>
<garnt> I fell asleep and woke back up. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. But like, I mean, that's kind of the point, right? </garnt>
<connor> Either you fall asleep or you get beaten the shit out of </connor>
<connor> and apparently you feel better afterwards. </connor>
<garnt> - I feel like I don't want to fall asleep. I was like, </garnt>
<connor> I don't remember anything. Was it worth it? </connor>
<connor> I dunno. I don't really feel more relaxed. </connor>
<joey> I just slapped in middle of the deck. </joey>
<garnt> - You could have done that in your hotel bed, right? </garnt>
<joey> - Honestly, honestly. </joey>
<joey> That's what I prefer to do. </joey>
<joey> I prefer just browsing my phone because the thing </joey>
<garnt> about spa days is that you're kind of forced to do nothing. </garnt>
<connor> - What do you want to do on vacation? </connor>
<connor> What do you want to do? </connor>
<connor> What's your ideal vacay? </connor>
<connor> I think we've said this before, right? </connor>
<joey> But I just don't want to do anything. </joey>
<joey> I just want to sit in my room. </joey>
<joey> I like that a lot of the time. </joey>
<joey> I want days where I explore, </joey>
<joey> but I also want days where I just sit in the room and do </joey>
<joey> nothing. </joey>
<connor> I appreciate the rooms facilities and just relax. </connor>
<joey> - My ultimate thing is to just walk around town </joey>
<joey> and just find good things to eat. </joey>
<joey> - Honestly, it's like the best vacation. </joey>
<garnt> I don't have a good meal to look forward to on vacation. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh, vacation ate like four meals, five meals a day. </connor>
<garnt> I just turned into an absolute glutton, </garnt>
<joey> like ice cream after every meal. Don't mind if I do. </joey>
<joey> - And then my idea for it is like, yes, I'm eating a lot, </joey>
<connor> but I'll walk it off. </connor>
<connor> - I'm like yes I'm eating a lot, and I like it. </connor>
<garnt> Like it's vacation. I will. </garnt>
<connor> - Like I remember in the camping trip that we went on, </connor>
<joey> I remember like the first night. So the first, </joey>
<joey> the first time we went to, we went camping. </joey>
<joey> It was typhoon. Right? </joey>
<joey> Like we got there. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, we really tried to camp, right? </joey>
<joey> We were just like, wait, wait. </joey>
<joey> We're like fuck it, a little bit of rain never hurt anyone. </joey>
<joey> We'll try. </joey>
<joey> We get there, it's fucking typhooning. </joey>
<joey> It's like a full on monsoon, the campsites flooded. </joey>
<joey> - The tree is like 90 degrees. </joey>
<garnt> - And Naby wearing his jury camp shirt. Just goes, </garnt>
<garnt> guys, I don't think we can do it. </garnt>
<connor> - I wish it was a special so that we could film it in the </connor>
<connor> comments, be like, nah, man, </connor>
<connor> just get your fucking ax out </connor>
<garnt> and start putting the tent down. </garnt>
<connor> You could have done it, mate stop being bitches. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. So we find this camp to go to and you know, </garnt>
<connor> it was a decent enough little camp. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> How can you complain, it had an onsen and everything, </connor>
<connor> until the point that we needed to figure out </connor>
<connor> what we were going to eat. </connor>
<connor> And I'm just like, cool, I'm on holiday. </connor>
<garnt> We're going to, we're going to find out, we're gonna, </garnt>
<garnt> we're gonna find a restaurant. Right guys. </garnt>
<garnt> But unfortunately we didn't have lunch. Right. </garnt>
<garnt> So it was like, it was like, </garnt>
<garnt> this was like this awkward time period of. </garnt>
<connor> - That's how you can tell you were raised in cities only, </connor>
<connor> but you just didn't have to worry about where you were </connor>
<garnt> eating. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. Cause we got there. </garnt>
<garnt> It was like an awkward time because none of us had had lunch </garnt>
<garnt> and it was like about three, about three o'clock. </garnt>
<garnt> Right. So it was too late for lunch, </garnt>
<garnt> but too early for dinner. So we were just like, </garnt>
<garnt> let's get a little snack at the comedy, right. </garnt>
<connor> And so we, we walk, </connor>
<connor> we walk 15 minutes to like the nearest comedy is like, </connor>
<connor> maybe it was 10 minutes and we were just like, oh, </connor>
<connor> let's buy some drinks and just buy some snacks. And, </connor>
<connor> and I remember thinking, cool, </connor>
<connor> this is just going to be a quick lunch. It's a, you know, </connor>
<connor> we're just going to get some snacks and then we'll go to the </connor>
<connor> restaurant later. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> Right. And then I remember, I remember on our way back. </connor>
<connor> Right. We were just, I was just remember, </connor>
<connor> the guys had gotten like a full on meal and stuff like that. </connor>
<garnt> And I was like, oh, we're going out to the restaurant again. </garnt>
<garnt> Right. We're going to find a restaurant for dinner. </garnt>
<garnt> Right. And it was just that pad, </garnt>
<garnt> may meme asking mannequin where, </garnt>
<garnt> when we get back to and hotel, </garnt>
<garnt> when everyone starts eating and everyone's like full and I'm </garnt>
<garnt> just like, we're going to go out again for dinner. </garnt>
<garnt> Right guys. </garnt>
<joey> - And then it finally hit Garnt. </joey>
<joey> When you heard just the crack of the beer can open. </joey>
<garnt> He's like, all right we're not. </garnt>
<joey> - Like I was ready to, like, </joey>
<garnt> it was a great time with the boys and everything. </garnt>
<garnt> But I was ready to rate that trip zero out of 10. </garnt>
<connor> - I feel like this is vastly. Someone did not prepare, well, </connor>
<joey> this should have been a conversation that happened. </joey>
<connor> They were like, are we having dinner or not? </connor>
<connor> Are we doing it now? </connor>
<joey> Are we getting Campini because this feels like </joey>
<joey> someone fucked up. </joey>
<joey> - Someone definitely fucked up. </joey>
<joey> - But you know, the moment we, it was like, you know, </joey>
<connor> 1:00 PM, I'm like, all right, now I have to </connor>
<connor> think about dinner, but what are we doing? </connor>
<garnt> - Look I had a great fucking camping trip </garnt>
<garnt> but I won't forget, day one of my holiday </garnt>
<garnt> I had (mumbles) for dinner, </garnt>
<garnt> (mumbles) for dinner on my holiday. </garnt>
<joey> - And we fell asleep at like 8:00 PM. </joey>
<garnt> - Correction, correction, Joey fell asleep at 8:00 PM. </garnt>
<joey> - Because I got shit faced. </joey>
<garnt> I had like seven beers in the span of an hour. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm like, I'm on holiday, whatever. </garnt>
<joey> - He cracks open the beer and I'm ready for dinner. </joey>
<joey> And I see Joey's feet and I'm just like, </joey>
<garnt> what the fuck is going on? </garnt>
<garnt> Joe, we're going for dinner, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Joey's just having a snooze right there. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah because Aki legitimately thought </joey>
<joey> I had died because I just fell asleep at eight. </joey>
<joey> And it's like, why is he not responding to my text? </joey>
<connor> - Right, I'm on vacation, don't text me. </connor>
<joey> - That was a great first day. </joey>
<garnt> - It was a great first day. Had a good talk with the boys. </garnt>
<garnt> But my God there's a hole in my life </garnt>
<garnt> that I will never forget. </garnt>
<joey> - But the problem is as well that like all </joey>
<joey> of the restaurants were also closed because it was, </joey>
<joey> I think it was a public holiday when we went. </joey>
<joey> So like all the restaurants, at like 4:00 PM. </joey>
<joey> all the restaurants are closed and I'm like, well fuck. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah well you can't count on a restaurant. </connor>
<joey> There's never any restaurants. </joey>
<joey> - Well now we know. </joey>
<joey> - You have to be very lucky. </joey>
<joey> - Now we know for next time. </joey>
<connor> - Did you get a Tesco meal deal? </connor>
<connor> Maybe one day in advance or, you know, make your own food. </connor>
<joey> So. </joey>
<connor> - I just gotta book a family Mart. </connor>
<connor> - Camping in like England should assume </connor>
<connor> that you make your own foods like that's a given. </connor>
<connor> - No, we were going to do that. </connor>
<joey> Until it started fucking typhooning. </joey>
<connor> - In the car man, you gotta do what you can. </connor>
<joey> You can just start firing a car. No, one's gonna notice </joey>
<joey> that's their problem, man. </joey>
<joey> You got insurance on the car. </joey>
<joey> - If it's a bit smoky, don't worry about it. </joey>
<joey> If I want to smoke some meats in my car, </joey>
<connor> I'm smoking some meats, </connor>
<connor> especially if it's a rental car, that's not my car. </connor>
<connor> - But yes, don't smoke meats in a car, that is a joke. </connor>
<garnt> You shouldn't smoke in the car. </garnt>
<connor> Yeah. And Abby showed us. </connor>
<connor> Oh shit, why did I do that? </connor>
<garnt> - So there's something about going out to the UK and </garnt>
<garnt> Australia, right? </garnt>
<garnt> I think we've talked about this briefly before, </garnt>
<garnt> but it's the first time I've ever had a culture clash </garnt>
<garnt> or a culture shock, I should say. </garnt>
<garnt> It's always related to, like, </garnt>
<connor> whenever you go on a trip with some people from another </connor>
<connor> country and you got to decide how much alcohol are you going </connor>
<connor> to buy? </connor>
<connor> Because for us, it's like you get such </connor>
<connor> a weird spectrum depending on who you </connor>
<joey> go with. You just never know. </joey>
<joey> But for some reason, with Brits and Australian, </joey>
<joey> it's always like, </joey>
<garnt> you always have like an agreed amounts that everyone, </garnt>
<garnt> everyone should, like, we should buy more. </garnt>
<connor> Right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - The way you do it in the UK is, what is a reasonable </connor>
<connor> amount of beers you would drink in a day and add 50% more. </connor>
<connor> And then that's your portion of the beers. </connor>
<connor> You know, </connor>
<connor> maybe someone drinks a little more than they expected. </connor>
<connor> Maybe you'd think more than expected. If not, </connor>
<garnt> you have more for tomorrow that will never go to waste, </garnt>
<garnt> so buy more. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<garnt> Cause like the first time, </garnt>
<garnt> the first time this ever happened to me when I was just like </garnt>
<connor> shocked. Right? </connor>
<garnt> Well it's cause like, you know, I understand when, </garnt>
<connor> you know, some people don't want to drink alcohol. </connor>
<connor> That's completely fine. Right. </connor>
<connor> That's I'm just like cool. </connor>
<connor> But the first time he actually surprised me was I was, </connor>
<joey> it was my first American convention and we were going to </joey>
<connor> hang out at a friend's place. Right. </connor>
<connor> It was just a group of us and it was me and one other </connor>
<connor> person. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, we should get some beers for back home. </connor>
<connor> And I'm just, and he's just like, great, good idea. </connor>
<connor> I need a beer. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> So we go to the fridge. Right. </connor>
<connor> And I go in and I take out a six pack of beer as you do. </connor>
<connor> Right. Of course you do. </connor>
<connor> If you're going to take some beer back for home, of course, </connor>
<joey> then you take a six pack of get some extra. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> And he follows me, walks in, </joey>
<joey> grabs a single can of beer. </joey>
<joey> And then I just look at it. </joey>
<joey> I just look at him and I just go what's that? </joey>
<joey> He goes, that's my drink for the night. </joey>
<joey> I was like. </joey>
<connor> - Are we drinking? Or are we drinking? </connor>
<connor> - I thought we were going to drink alcohol. And he was like, </connor>
<connor> you drinking or are we sitting here? He was like, yeah, </connor>
<connor> we are, we were drinking. </connor>
<garnt> I was like, how long is it going to last you? </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, oh no, this, this is my drink for the night. </garnt>
<joey> - When I say I could go for a beer, </joey>
<garnt> I don't mean a single beer. </garnt>
<garnt> - I was just like, yeah, we were going to go for a beer. </garnt>
<garnt> Right. Who stops at a single beer? </garnt>
<joey> - Do I need to be more specific? </joey>
<garnt> I could go for a six pack of beer. </garnt>
<connor> - And I remember the second time this happened to me was the </connor>
<connor> camping trip, actually. </connor>
<connor> Do you remember when we... </connor>
<connor> so in camping you have one opportunity to buy everything you </connor>
<joey> need for the night. Right? </joey>
<joey> So that shopping trip, </joey>
<joey> you got to think about the entire stay that you're there. </joey>
<joey> Right. Cause you're not gonna have another, </joey>
<joey> another opportunity. Cause we weren't, </joey>
<joey> we weren't exactly in the city, you know? </joey>
<joey> And the shops now are only open for a certain set amount. </joey>
<joey> - And it's like 40 minutes away. </joey>
<joey> - So we're getting the food and everyone agrees, oh, </joey>
<joey> do we have enough food? Oh, </joey>
<joey> maybe you should get some more food. And like </joey>
<joey> we fill up this shopping cart for the food, right. </joey>
<connor> And then the alcohol discussion comes along, right. </connor>
<connor> And it's me, Joey and Luke who's from Northern Ireland. </connor>
<connor> So, you know, we were just like, let's get, </connor>
<connor> let's get a crate of beer. </connor>
<joey> - Of course. </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> And how many people were on the trip? Again? </joey>
<connor> - There were like six of us. </connor>
<connor> - There was six of us. </connor>
<connor> So like a single crate of beer in my mind, </connor>
<garnt> a single crate of beer to last six people. </garnt>
<connor> - How many beers were in this crate? </connor>
<connor> - 24. </connor>
<connor> - 24, okay. </connor>
<garnt> - So it's a 24 pack of beer, now a 24 pack of beer to me </garnt>
<garnt> for six people is like, </garnt>
<garnt> it's not enough beers to last the entire day potentially. </garnt>
<garnt> And like the nights. </garnt>
<connor> - If we're camping, we're probably day drinking. </connor>
<joey> - Exactly, that's like on average four cans of beer </joey>
<connor> per person, that's not going to last. </connor>
<connor> - At least 330 mils as well? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah like the standard cans. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah that's too small, far too small. </garnt>
<connor> - Right? </connor>
<connor> - That's two pints each. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah exactly. </connor>
<connor> - That's not going to be enough. </connor>
<connor> - I grabbed a single pack of like, </connor>
<connor> a pack of beer with the assumption that, okay, </connor>
<connor> this is where we start. Right. </connor>
<connor> And I remember, </connor>
<connor> I remember I was going to put it on the shopping cart and </connor>
<connor> cause we all agreed that we were going to drink this trip, </connor>
<connor> by the way, it was something that we all agreed to. </connor>
<connor> And I remember I bumped into Eto, right. </connor>
<garnt> And he sees the pack of beer and he's like, oh, </garnt>
<garnt> we'll go for a hard night, are we? </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know what the fuck this is. </garnt>
<connor> - This is the minimum. </connor>
<garnt> - This is what, this is the start. </garnt>
<garnt> This is the start. </garnt>
<garnt> I remember going to the shopping cart and I remember putting </garnt>
<garnt> the pack of beer on there and I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> so I'm getting more now. So we were getting more right guys? </garnt>
<garnt> Everyone's like, oh no, I don't know. </garnt>
<joey> - I remember when he said that I did like the Family Guy, </joey>
<joey> like slow head, turn off. </joey>
<joey> So after that, I'm just like, </joey>
<garnt> I take Joey and Luke to a corner and we're like emergency </garnt>
<joey> meeting guys, emergency meeting. </joey>
<garnt> I don't think we've got enough alcohol with us. </garnt>
<connor> So we're like, well, </connor>
<connor> we kind of don't want to look like alcoholics, </connor>
<connor> like in front of our mates. </connor>
<connor> So let's not buy another pack of beer, whatever. </connor>
<joey> Let's just, let's just buy some spirits, wine. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> Yeah. Let's get like some boxes. </connor>
<joey> Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - If you're with a crowd or you're like, ah, </joey>
<joey> I don't want to scare them. I'll just get a spirit. </joey>
<connor> The bottle doesn't scare them, </connor>
<connor> when they see like the mountains of beer cans </connor>
<connor> they're like, oh God. Oh God. </connor>
<connor> - It's a hard night. </connor>
<connor> - And you know, when in reality it's probably </connor>
<joey> one bottle of Smirnoff, or half a bottle. </joey>
<joey> - What party animals we are. </joey>
<joey> - How long did the 24 crate last you? </joey>
<joey> - Like three hours. </joey>
<connor> - Did you run out? </connor>
<garnt> - If we didn't buy another one. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> We ended up buying another one. </joey>
<joey> - And it was mostly me, Joey and Luke. </joey>
<connor> - I'd say between three people, </connor>
<joey> maybe a 24 pack is good enough for a full night drinking, </joey>
<connor> starting early, eating and drinking all night. </connor>
<garnt> - And what I've realized is that how you need to like, </garnt>
<connor> decide on like the alcohol amounts. </connor>
<connor> Whenever you hang out with someone new, it's just like, </connor>
<garnt> there's an alcohol amount for Brits and Aussies and you </garnt>
<garnt> know, anyone from the UK. </garnt>
<garnt> And then, </garnt>
<garnt> and then there is just everyone else with the exception of </garnt>
<garnt> like, unless there is an exception, right. </garnt>
<connor> - I always bring way more than I need, </connor>
<connor> just because someone's gonna drink way more than they said </connor>
<connor> they were going to drink. It always happens. </connor>
<joey> - And there's nothing worse than it being like, you know, </joey>
<connor> 9:00 PM, like you're in front of the fire. </connor>
<joey> And then someone goes, "Hey, can I get another beer?" </joey>
<garnt> And there's no beer. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah cause like a lot of people... </garnt>
<joey> - There's no worst feeling. </joey>
<joey> - Like to me that's just second nature. </joey>
<garnt> Cause like, I think you need to buy more alcohol </garnt>
<garnt> than is needed because nobody likes running out of alcohol </garnt>
<garnt> when you want to drink more, </garnt>
<garnt> it's like the worst, God I sound like an alcoholic. </garnt>
<connor> - Also, you want to be the bro who provides for the team. </connor>
<connor> You know, oh you run out of beers, </connor>
<connor> you brought your own? Bro, I got a few, </connor>
<garnt> come grab, go grab one bro. </garnt>
<connor> - Don't worry about it. And I've just, </connor>
<connor> I've just kind of realized, </connor>
<connor> hanging out with people with different cultures. </connor>
<connor> Like that's the weird part because normally everyone </connor>
<garnt> keeps asking for more and then you got to a point </garnt>
<garnt> you maybe run out and some people are just completely fine </garnt>
<garnt> with that. </garnt>
<joey> - When I am at like peak tipsy, I'm in the buffer zone. </joey>
<joey> I do not wanna run out of beer. </joey>
<joey> If I get fully sold before I sleep, </joey>
<connor> I'm going to sleep like shit. </connor>
<connor> I need this. </connor>
<connor> - I need this buzz to keep going. </connor>
<connor> - I need this buzz until I fall asleep. </connor>
<connor> Otherwise I'm fucked. </connor>
<connor> I feel like shit. I wake up in the morning feeling awful. </connor>
<joey> Help me out, man, </joey>
<joey> I'm going to down a bottle of water or two, </joey>
<joey> before I go to bed, I'm gonna feel great. </joey>
<joey> Don't worry about it. </joey>
<garnt> - Exactly. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. I mean, that's the alcoholics anonymous. </joey>
<joey> - That's just how it is when you're, </joey>
<joey> when you're from Britain or Australia, </joey>
<connor> I think Americans don't understand how ingrained </connor>
<joey> it is in the culture. </joey>
<joey> - And I feel it further accentuates </joey>
<connor> when you're on a camping trip. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know what it is about sitting around a fire where </connor>
<joey> you're just like, "man I need some alcohol." </joey>
<connor> - Camping is, you know, there's a reason why, </connor>
<connor> it's considered one of those manly activities. </connor>
<connor> And because manly activities are normally judged by </connor>
<connor> either how intensively they are, </connor>
<connor> how intensive they are physically or how much beer you can </connor>
<connor> drink during that activity. </connor>
<connor> Fishing is considered a very manly sport because </connor>
<connor> you can drink beer the whole time while you're doing it. </connor>
<garnt> - Do you know why? </garnt>
<garnt> I'm gonna say it. How the can you enjoy these activities </garnt>
<garnt> if you're not drinking. </garnt>
<garnt> - Hanging out with your friends camping, to most people </garnt>
<joey> hanging out with your friends, cooking shit food, </joey>
<joey> getting drunk, very fun, awesome. </joey>
<joey> Cause cooking bacon to a char and then giving </joey>
<garnt> it to your mates and being like bon apple teeth. </garnt>
<garnt> Like that's amazing when you have a beer. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, I've never heard that before. </garnt>
<garnt> - Bon apple teeth. </garnt>
<connor> - It's a subreddit. </connor>
<connor> It's bon apple tea, apple tea. </connor>
<garnt> - I thought you just made a genuine mistake. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no. Bone apple tea. </garnt>
<joey> I actually forget the original, because I say the meme more, </joey>
<connor> what is the original Bon Appetit? </connor>
<joey> I always say the meme one. </joey>
<garnt> So I can't obviously burn apple tea. </garnt>
<garnt> - You've never heard this? </garnt>
<garnt> It's literally a subreddit where people like have like a, </garnt>
<garnt> it's like a spelling mistakes. You'll be like </garnt>
<connor> my autistic guitar or something, instead of acoustic. </connor>
<connor> It'll be those kind of spelling mistakes. </connor>
<joey> It's very funny. </joey>
<joey> You should watch it. </joey>
<joey> - Bone apple teeth. </joey>
<joey> - But yeah. I mean, </joey>
<connor> you'll eat like terrible food that you cooked, </connor>
<connor> but you cooked it with the boys. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like you think about fishing as an activity, right? </garnt>
<connor> And on paper. </connor>
<connor> - Man it's awful. </connor>
<garnt> - It's awful. Everything that goes wrong could go wrong. </garnt>
<garnt> You know, your hands are getting slimy. </garnt>
<connor> When you get the fish, maybe you'll get a fish. </connor>
<joey> - Worst case scenario, you sit there for eight hours </joey>
<connor> and nothing happened. </connor>
<connor> - You spent like an hour setting up a rod </connor>
<joey> cause you don't know how to fish. </joey>
<joey> Maybe you're with the expert. He can teach you, </joey>
<joey> but you tangled the line. Oh, it's a fucking nightmare. </joey>
<joey> Everything goes wrong. What bait do I bring? </joey>
<joey> I don't know. What kind of hook do I bring? </joey>
<connor> I don't know. I hate it. </connor>
<connor> Tying the knot on the hook is such a pain in the ass. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - God, you got to get the net out when you get a fish. </connor>
<joey> - But then, when the glorious beer can comes out... </joey>
<joey> - That's when it gets good. </joey>
<connor> - Well, that's why you buy... </connor>
<connor> You have to buy the chair that has the beer holder. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> I did that for the camping trip because I know eventually </joey>
<joey> one of these days we're going to go fishing. </joey>
<garnt> I'm already prepared. </garnt>
<garnt> - Don't pretend like you planned this. </garnt>
<joey> I know like, okay. </joey>
<joey> So for the camping trip, </joey>
<garnt> Joey brought this fucking like massive foldout chair. </garnt>
<connor> - Wasn't it like a hundred dollars? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Jesus Christ Joey. </garnt>
<connor> You don't need that, you're not sunbathing. </connor>
<connor> - I am now. </connor>
<garnt> - It wasn't one of those ones where you could </garnt>
<garnt> like easily fold up and like pack into a small pack. </garnt>
<garnt> Like it was like fucking rectangular. </garnt>
<joey> - Like I thought, because I thought most of </joey>
<joey> the chairs that I've bought that like that, </joey>
<joey> I thought it was the ones where you could fold like four </joey>
<joey> ways into a tube. But then when it appeared, I was like, </joey>
<connor> why is it only folded in half? </connor>
<connor> And I realized, oh, </connor>
<connor> it's because there's two giant metal rods that are like </connor>
<connor> keeping the entire thing together. That just won't bend. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. And I lifted it up and I'm like, </connor>
<connor> why does this thing weigh 20 kilograms? </connor>
<connor> It was like, it was something out of... </connor>
<connor> - Like a Greek God of this capture. </connor>
<connor> Bring me another grape. </connor>
<joey> - Honestly, the chair itself was like king chair. </joey>
<garnt> - It wasn't a chair. </garnt>
<joey> Every time I got up to like go get wood or go to </joey>
<joey> the toilet, someone was always like, </joey>
<joey> "I'm sitting in the King's chair." </joey>
<garnt> - Honestly, it wasn't a camping chair. </garnt>
<garnt> It was a throne. </garnt>
<garnt> Right. But like, don't pretend like you did that on purpose, </garnt>
<garnt> but you did that by complete accident because it was </garnt>
<garnt> a fucking bitch to get in the car because </garnt>
<joey> we were going camping and the car was like... </joey>
<joey> - It barely fit in the boot, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - It was barely fitting. </garnt>
<joey> - It was heavier than my bag full of all </joey>
<joey> of my clothes and shit. </joey>
<connor> - Well, you took one seat and took away two. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<connor> - Fantastic. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, Joe had a great time sitting down </connor>
<connor> at the detriment of us driving there and </connor>
<joey> having like less space to like sit but. </joey>
<joey> - Worth it. </joey>
<garnt> - What the fuck is that? </garnt>
<joey> - It has like a foldable, like a table on the side. </joey>
<joey> - It was like a colonial imperialist mass </joey>
<joey> go into your new land. </joey>
<connor> - It was like the game of Thrones shit, dude. </connor>
<garnt> I felt so powerful. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh man. But yeah, like, like food, like fishing. </connor>
<connor> I don't know how you can enjoy without alcohol, </connor>
<connor> because most of it is just nothing. </connor>
<connor> You're just sitting there. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> You're just waiting and it's a weird. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So you bring that Nintendo DS or </connor>
<connor> you just get drunk and talk. There's only two options. </connor>
<connor> There's the switch now. </connor>
<connor> - Nintendo DS. </connor>
<connor> - Just play some smash bros while you're </connor>
<joey> waiting for the fish, right? </joey>
<joey> - I mean, that's what you can do, man. </joey>
<connor> You dig that pole in the ground and start drinking until you </connor>
<connor> think you've caught a fish, which you drank to realize. </connor>
<connor> - We still need to go fishing. </connor>
<connor> - I'd like to go camping and do it properly. </connor>
<garnt> But it seems like in Japan, </garnt>
<connor> there's not many good camping sites. They all seem very, </connor>
<connor> very controlled. Very close together. </connor>
<connor> Just seems like a nightmare. </connor>
<joey> - Would you rather go fishing like off the bank or would you </joey>
<joey> rather be in a boat. </joey>
<connor> - Pretty off the bank and just sitting in the show, </connor>
<garnt> off the bank in the boat, </garnt>
<connor> you have to be very active with what you're doing. </connor>
<connor> - I prefer the boat. I don't know. </connor>
<connor> - You gotta be in a row boat, not like a big boat. </connor>
<connor> - I want like a yacht. </connor>
<connor> - Why the fuck would I want to be in that bro? </connor>
<connor> Simulating I'm like a broke fisherman? </connor>
<joey> - In Garnt's head, boat equals yacht. </joey>
<connor> - Garn'ts like, "I want to be on the Louis Vuitton SS 3." </connor>
<joey> - The Louis Vuitton SS 3. </joey>
<connor> - That's the name of the boat. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah I don't want to be in a rowboat </connor>
<garnt> and I don't think Connor wants to be on a rowboat </garnt>
<connor> with me either. </connor>
<connor> - He'll fucking find a way to tip it. </connor>
<connor> Garnt will fucking tip the boat. </connor>
<garnt> - No, we've been on a rowboat together. </garnt>
<garnt> I remember when we got to Kyoto, </garnt>
<connor> I just can't row for shit. </connor>
<connor> - And then Garnt also just turns into like daddy </connor>
<connor> long legs in this fucking thing right. </connor>
<connor> He can't just stand up properly and he was having great </connor>
<connor> difficulty. He's going to tip the boat. </connor>
<connor> He's going to tip the boat any second now. </connor>
<joey> - I want to see that. </joey>
<connor> - He stood up and he was just like, </connor>
<garnt> I was like God, please God, please, please. </garnt>
<garnt> He was terrible at rowing. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. I don't know what I was doing wrong. </garnt>
<garnt> I dunno. </garnt>
<connor> - I think he just kept putting it in and </connor>
<connor> then just pulling it out. You didn't just like row. </connor>
<garnt> - Ah, I'm just kind of like, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like I'm like, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> I quagmire or something where, where you have, </garnt>
<connor> he has like one arm stronger than the other. </connor>
<connor> I just keep rowing, we were going around in circles. </connor>
<joey> What were you doing? You do it with both, pull in both. </joey>
<joey> - We know which one God's fabbing on me. </joey>
<connor> - Oh my God. </connor>
<joey> - Rowing boats sucks though. </joey>
<joey> - I really, I enjoy it. </joey>
<connor> - Not, not when the conditions that we were doing. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, we were doing it in a Japanese summer. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yeah, no nevermind. </garnt>
<garnt> - By the time I left my back was like, </garnt>
<joey> my shirt was a different color. </joey>
<joey> - The fall is really, really nice. </joey>
<joey> - I was doing manual labor in the summer. </joey>
<connor> I don't even do manual labor normally, </connor>
<connor> let alone in the summer. </connor>
<connor> - And we were hung over as well. </connor>
<joey> - I'd probably hate it too if that was the case. </joey>
<joey> - Honestly, doing anything outside in Japanese summers </joey>
<joey> is just like, nope. Nope. </joey>
<garnt> Let's just, let's do an indoor activity. </garnt>
<garnt> - The weekly reminder, the Japanese summer sucks. </garnt>
<garnt> - We're going to keep complaining about it until it's over. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> Right? Yep. </connor>
<connor> - I love winter. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. I dunno, man. </joey>
<joey> I just don't understand people who </joey>
<joey> just like this heat and this humidity. </joey>
<joey> - Psychopaths man, psychopaths. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, God, I felt so bad for the fucking Olympians. </garnt>
<garnt> Right? Like we talked about this, but Jesus Christ. </garnt>
<joey> - It was terrible. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. Changing the topic though, like I've, </joey>
<joey> I feel like I've lived in Japan for long enough </joey>
<connor> now that my opinions on certain things have changed some </connor>
<connor> things, which I touched on, </connor>
<garnt> which I initially thought were amazing now. </garnt>
<garnt> Like I don't think are as good as British, </garnt>
<joey> Wagyu beef. </joey>
<connor> Okay. Remember the first time I tried Wagyu beef, </connor>
<connor> - It's so overpraised. </connor>
<joey> - I'm just like, oh my God, this is the fucking </joey>
<joey> Rolls Royce of of beef. </joey>
<joey> It's the fucking Ferrari of beef. </joey>
<joey> And then you live here for a year and you have equal, </joey>
<garnt> you have easy access to it. And I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> I just kinda want a normal rib eye now. </garnt>
<connor> - Genuinely normal steak is better. </connor>
<connor> Cause why don't you just fatty? And again, </connor>
<connor> I liked that you liked that, </connor>
<connor> but if you want like a really nice tender cut of meat, </connor>
<connor> it's just so good. </connor>
<joey> - Wagyu is good maybe like, you know, </joey>
<connor> once or twice a year. I think if you really want to </connor>
<connor> like treat yourself. </connor>
<joey> - I'm sure if Chris was here, he'd be like, no, no, no. </joey>
<connor> I know the best places. </connor>
<joey> - You're just going to the wrong places. </joey>
<joey> - When I went to Curacao, right, with Chris, </joey>
<joey> there was this stand and we were kind of hungry. </joey>
<connor> And the stand said there was Wagyu beef on a stick, </connor>
<connor> for like a thousand yen. </connor>
<connor> I was like, no way is that Wagyu, no fucking way. </connor>
<connor> And they had this meat out on the counter, </connor>
<connor> like this example meat. And I was like, all right, fine. </connor>
<connor> We'll get it. We'll try it. </connor>
<connor> We'll try it. </connor>
<connor> And so they have this example of what the meat looks like, </connor>
<connor> it's like the fake kind. </connor>
<connor> And so we order it, </connor>
<connor> we pay the man and he pulls out some meat from a cooler, </connor>
<connor> but it's definitely not Wagyu. </connor>
<connor> It's literally like the shittest cut of a beef. </connor>
<connor> You can imagine literally impossible to chew. </connor>
<connor> A dog would have trouble chewing this thing. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, crazy. </connor>
<connor> I can't believe you thought this was going to be real. </connor>
<connor> There's no way we would get Wagyu steak on a stick for </connor>
<joey> 1000 yen outside of the, for the cure, </joey>
<joey> Mizzou data or whatever. It was like at a tourist trap. </joey>
<joey> Are you serious, Chris? </joey>
<joey> I couldn't believe that he fell for it. </joey>
<connor> And then he convinced me to actually try it. </connor>
<connor> What a waste of a thousand yen. </connor>
<connor> We took like two bites and we were like, </connor>
<connor> "we can't eat this, this is shit." </connor>
<joey> We threw it away. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, cause like I feel I had the better experience. </joey>
<connor> Cause like on Jen, across Japan, </connor>
<connor> we had that exact same thing in Takamatsu and it was the, </connor>
<connor> Hedugyu beef, which is like, it's like a higher brand. </connor>
<joey> That one was actually delicious. </joey>
<joey> - It's cause you aren't in Kyoto, which is basically </joey>
<connor> it's turned into kind of a tourist gamble. </connor>
<connor> It's kind of, you can get some good stuff there, </connor>
<connor> but it's so over tourist. So I don't know. </connor>
<joey> - You gotta, you gotta go to like the back streets </joey>
<joey> of Kyoto to get the good shit, definitely. </joey>
<connor> - Not in front of the god damn temple to get Wagyu beef. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause I feel like Wagyu beef is something that you should </garnt>
<garnt> try as like a, as like a, a rare thing. </garnt>
<connor> Right? </connor>
<connor> Because what I didn't expect was how easy it would be to </connor>
<connor> access it and you can buy it in the supermarket, like, </connor>
<connor> like it fucking blew my mind. </connor>
<connor> The first time I saw Wagyu beef in the supermarket where the </connor>
<joey> only other time I'd ever seen Wagyu beef is like at like </joey>
<connor> fucking high-end restaurants where you'd be paying hundreds </connor>
<connor> and hundreds of dollars for few cubes of Wagyu beef. </connor>
<connor> And I remember before coming to Japan, I only tried it once. </connor>
<connor> And that was because I was like, </connor>
<connor> I had like a well-off friends who treated, </connor>
<connor> treated us to treated us to dinner once at a high end </connor>
<connor> restaurant. And I'm just like, oh my God, </connor>
<connor> this is fucking incredible. </connor>
<connor> And now I understand why they only give you </connor>
<garnt> a few cubes of Wagyu beef in like high restaurant. Right. </garnt>
<connor> It's way too fatty, it's like eating pure butter. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> Right. And I realized this when I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> I think it was like, </connor>
<connor> I think it like hacked my mind to be like, okay, </connor>
<connor> why don't you? Beef is always good. </connor>
<garnt> It's I can't get bored of Wagyu beef. This is, this is the, </garnt>
<garnt> this is a five beef. Right. </garnt>
<garnt> But now I see Wagyu beef and I'm just like, can I, </garnt>
<garnt> can I just get a normal cut. </garnt>
<connor> - Of steak pleasing as are the normal cuts of steak here? </connor>
<garnt> Aren't that good? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. They're not, they're not. </garnt>
<joey> - Unless you pay like a good amount for it. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> Yeah. And the best things here, like a lot of those. </joey>
<garnt> So you get some really good steaks, </garnt>
<garnt> but a lot of them are imported and they're really expensive. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah. Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> You know, you're paying an absolute premium for. </connor>
<joey> - It's like, I feel Wagyu beef is a lot like, you know, </joey>
<connor> getting like the super fatty tuna, like sushi, right? </connor>
<connor> It's like, you can't eat that shit all the time. </connor>
<joey> It's it's because you eat it every now and then that is </joey>
<joey> good. </joey>
<joey> - I think, I don't know how, </joey>
<joey> I don't know if Japan did this intentionally or not, </joey>
<joey> but it's definitely a branding thing. </joey>
<garnt> Like Wagyu beef is very good branding. Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know how, because it's all over the place in Japan. </garnt>
<connor> You don't know what's Wagyu and what's </connor>
<joey> constituted as wonky. It's like, it's not, </joey>
<joey> it's like if we prefecture has its own Wagyu and they'll </joey>
<connor> argue that the other one is shit and theirs the best. </connor>
<joey> - Thing I feel. </joey>
<joey> That's the biggest misconception with Wagyu, </joey>
<garnt> when people think Wagyu beef, they think like gray, </garnt>
<connor> like the best. Right. </connor>
<connor> But like Wagyu beef literally just means beef made in Japan. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. There's like, </connor>
<joey> there's like low tier Wagyu as well as high tier Wagyu. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. And I thought, I don't know who, </connor>
<joey> if Japan did this on purpose, I don't know if like, </joey>
<joey> it honestly. </joey>
<joey> - Might be the foreign chefs. </joey>
<connor> - That could have been foreign chefs being like, </connor>
<joey> there's the best stuff, man. </joey>
<joey> I don't know. </joey>
<connor> - Wagyu just sounds cool. </connor>
<connor> - When did it, when did it become a thing? </connor>
<connor> When did Wagyu beef become like well-known in like outside </connor>
<garnt> of Japan and become like this kind of idolized beef? </garnt>
<garnt> Because I feel like that's how Wagyu is command such high </garnt>
<connor> prices, </connor>
<connor> especially outside of Japan is because of the branding. </connor>
<connor> Like it's the same way, you know? </connor>
<connor> I don't think, you know, when you eat, </connor>
<connor> what's the really fatty meat cold, you get a flaw Gras. </connor>
<garnt> How the they've managed to charge so much for that. </garnt>
<connor> - Is also just eating pure fat. </connor>
<connor> - I eat it on my five. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. I feel like, I feel, </connor>
<connor> I feel like a bit sick sometimes because I was like, oh, </connor>
<joey> it's very fatty. And it's very, very fatty. </joey>
<garnt> And it kind of Wagyu kind of feels the same off. </garnt>
<connor> - Convince us that flogger. </connor>
<connor> I was like a luxury item and that we should pay out of our </connor>
<connor> pockets, insane amounts for it. </connor>
<joey> When it barely tastes, it's a. </joey>
<joey> - Trek to make. That's. </joey>
<connor> - Why you say that. But then like, you know, we, </connor>
<connor> we like killed caviar to the point where we made them so </connor>
<connor> extinct that we made them valuable. </connor>
<garnt> Like caviar was never going to be valuable again, </garnt>
<garnt> like the only value of caviar comes from the fact that it's </garnt>
<garnt> so rare, like. </garnt>
<garnt> - Similar with lobsters, right. </garnt>
<garnt> We've we've. </garnt>
<connor> - Made it, we've made it like lots of. </connor>
<connor> - And lobsters used to be the cheap meat that, you know, </connor>
<connor> that the working class people used to write. </connor>
<connor> And then I'm not sure why it increased in price. I don't, </connor>
<joey> I don't know if like the corporations, like, </joey>
<joey> because the working class officially has been over-fished </joey>
<connor> wasn't over official. Did they artificially Price? </connor>
<joey> And it's a really interesting story and I wish I remembered </joey>
<joey> the detail of it, but like I know I, </joey>
<garnt> all I know is like lobsters was a really cheap meat until </garnt>
<garnt> one day. It just wasn't there. </garnt>
<garnt> Right. </garnt>
<connor> - Just to share though the price, you know, </connor>
<connor> doesn't really correlate with good tasting food. I mean, </connor>
<connor> you know, like who to shout out whales all the time, </connor>
<connor> but you know, there was some really fresh, local produce. </connor>
<connor> It was so cheap and that was a mixing and I still haven't </connor>
<connor> had better stuff anywhere else from like, you know, from, </connor>
<connor> from there. And you know, I, I don't want the four Gras. </connor>
<connor> I just want a nice, </connor>
<connor> beautiful cut of meat fresh from the day. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. And it's yeah, like Wagyu beef. </connor>
<connor> I feel like when I first moved to Japan, </connor>
<connor> I could not understand why every steak, </connor>
<garnt> like they marketed it as like imported from Australia. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> why would you import beef when you have Wagyu here? </garnt>
<connor> And like now living here for all like a, </connor>
<connor> like almost two years, I'm like, I get it. </connor>
<garnt> I want to Australian steaks and Angus, beef's a. </garnt>
<joey> - Very luxury thing. Like there's a lot of import, </joey>
<garnt> a lot of beef from like Ireland and stuff to here island </garnt>
<connor> exports, a lot of meat to Japan. </connor>
<connor> Cause like. </connor>
<garnt> - If you're bored of Wagyu beef, </garnt>
<garnt> then just the normal cuts of beef here just aren't as good </garnt>
<connor> - And like, </connor>
<connor> you can play around into Loma with the seasonings on a </connor>
<joey> normal kind of. </joey>
<connor> - I'm still with a load of those kinds of foods, </connor>
<connor> like Wagyu and like flog around and stuff like that. </connor>
<connor> It's all just like a namesake. Right. </connor>
<connor> It's just like, you know, </connor>
<connor> I don't think anyone realistically every, </connor>
<connor> every week is like, where's my full group. </connor>
<connor> So like, you know, it's, it's like, puffer fish right. </connor>
<connor> Like FUBU is also another thing where it's like, </connor>
<connor> you waited just to say you ate it. </connor>
<connor> But like, no one is like actually going to be like, oh, </connor>
<connor> FUBU is the best tasting thing of the whole spoilers. </connor>
<connor> It's not, it, it literally tastes like nothing. </connor>
<connor> Like I've had it a couple of times and I'm just like. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, just put your life in danger. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I'm like, this is cool. </garnt>
<joey> I guess I can say that I ate puffer fish, but it's like. </joey>
<joey> - I just wish I was like a dog, bro. </joey>
<joey> You can give them the same meal every single day and they </joey>
<joey> get hyped as fuck for it. </joey>
<joey> Is it time for the same meal again? Yo, </joey>
<connor> you gotta be kidding. Tesco. </connor>
<joey> I think it's so hard for the same meal. Every time he, </joey>
<connor> while I have the same meal twice in a row and I'm like, </connor>
<connor> I'm living like a piston. </connor>
<joey> I had Carrie two days in a row. </joey>
<joey> I feel disgusting. </joey>
<joey> I don't know. It's just like a thing that we, </joey>
<joey> we did to ourselves as humans was that once a point in time </joey>
<connor> where we were just happy to have the same meal over and over </connor>
<connor> again, if we done this. </connor>
<garnt> - We probably were even as a kid. Right. </garnt>
<connor> I remember what I could just eat Thai food every day. </connor>
<garnt> She never get, never get bored of it. </garnt>
<connor> - Hey again, my man, let's go put some salt on there. </connor>
<connor> Oh yeah. Let's go. </connor>
<garnt> - And then like I tried, </garnt>
<garnt> I tried like Japanese food for the first time. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just like. </garnt>
<garnt> I want to try this again and try Mexican food for the first </garnt>
<connor> time in like. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, my need a variation in tastes has skyrocketed. </connor>
<connor> Since Japan, they could support me. </connor>
<connor> Cause now I used to be content, </connor>
<connor> just eating like fried chicken, like four times a week. </connor>
<garnt> And I'd be like, this is fantastic. </garnt>
<garnt> - The second thing I think is overrated in Japan. </garnt>
<connor> - Japanese stuff out of them. They do fire chicken. </connor>
<connor> Very good here. I think it's definitely chicken. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. I was going to say, man, </garnt>
<garnt> I like Americans think they have mastered fried chicken. </garnt>
<connor> I'm like, no, the best fried chicken I've had is from Korea, </connor>
<connor> Korean fried chicken best in the world. </connor>
<garnt> - I said, they season it. </garnt>
<garnt> They don't go too overboard because you got way too much </garnt>
<garnt> seasoning in Korea. You just get like a beautiful, </garnt>
<connor> different variations of seasoning. Young, young. </connor>
<connor> - Chicken is like. </connor>
<joey> - And it's all just that. It's just, </joey>
<joey> it's the perfect texture as well where it's just like a </joey>
<joey> little bit crispy. It's it's it's you? </joey>
<garnt> Can't like, it's the perfect. </garnt>
<garnt> It's the perfect. </garnt>
<joey> - Little bit crispy. And like the meat's not too wet, </joey>
<garnt> but also. </garnt>
<joey> - It's all dry. I dry. </joey>
<garnt> It's just the perfect combination of everything you'd want. </garnt>
<connor> - It's the fried chicken. </connor>
<connor> So not to doggone like fried chicken culture in London is </connor>
<garnt> amazing. We have such good fried chicken in London. </garnt>
<garnt> I really disagree. </garnt>
<garnt> That's why the whole channel. That's why there was a whole, </garnt>
<connor> there was a whole channel at one point dedicated to </connor>
<garnt> reviewing fried chicken in London. It's so very. </garnt>
<garnt> - Bro, way too greasy, man. </garnt>
<garnt> I know. </garnt>
<garnt> - You're going to the wrong plate. You're going to. </garnt>
<joey> - Sound like Chris right now. </joey>
<joey> He's going to the wrong place. </joey>
<garnt> - Because London is so bad. </garnt>
<garnt> - We were so close to having a podcast where we agree on. </garnt>
<connor> - Chicken and lunch. </connor>
<connor> Fried chicken. </connor>
<connor> - In London is only amazing after you shit faced. </connor>
<garnt> Let's say people who say it's like people who defend kebabs </garnt>
<joey> and I'm just like, would you ever think about sober? </joey>
<connor> You probably have. </connor>
<connor> - You probably had a local fried chicken shop. </connor>
<connor> The one underneath me was amazing. The way they see some, </connor>
<garnt> the chicken. </garnt>
<connor> They did barbecue wings and I've never had barbecue wings as </connor>
<connor> good as this in my life. They, they were so cheap too. </connor>
<connor> I don't know what they put in it pretty like old God awful </connor>
<connor> chemicals. But that was amazing. </connor>
<connor> I've never had barbecue wings that it was good as that. </connor>
<connor> And it was like, </connor>
<connor> it was like one pound for like eight warring. </connor>
<joey> It worryingly cheap, but it was amazing. </joey>
<joey> So that was chicken probably even wasn't I don't know what </joey>
<connor> it was, but it was the best wings I'd had. </connor>
<garnt> - Jeez. I mean, like to me, </garnt>
<garnt> the best fried chicken I've had in the UK is KFC. Like. </garnt>
<connor> - Okay, okay. </connor>
<connor> It's I'm not gonna say it's the best because it is very good </connor>
<joey> in the, in the UK. </joey>
<connor> They make very. </connor>
<connor> - It is very good. </connor>
<connor> Unlike every fried chicken I've had in London or every </connor>
<garnt> chippy or whatever is, it feels like a, </garnt>
<garnt> it feels like a downgrade to KFC to me. </garnt>
<joey> I feel like you guys do chicken pretty well though. </joey>
<connor> - I'm seeing the UK is by far the best KFC I've ever had in </connor>
<joey> Japan at socks in America. It's war crimes elsewhere. </joey>
<joey> I assume it's just not as good as Australia. </joey>
<joey> It's a little bit, </joey>
<joey> I'm sure there's someone from some country that's like, </joey>
<connor> yeah, but in, in, in this country it's better shut up. </connor>
<connor> I haven't been there. So how would I know that? </connor>
<joey> Yeah, we don't. </joey>
<joey> - We don't try KFC in every country. You go to unfold. </joey>
<connor> - Boneless or bone. </connor>
<garnt> - Bone, boneless. </garnt>
<connor> - Boneless. I'm a bone. </connor>
<garnt> This kind of guy, man. </garnt>
<joey> I'm a. </joey>
<joey> - To get that bone out of there. If I can't eat it, </joey>
<joey> get it out of my face. </joey>
<connor> - Sometimes I just don't want to go through the process of </connor>
<joey> being like a animal and tearing this </joey>
<joey> Tunnel with this. </joey>
<joey> - You are full of. </joey>
<connor> Are you talking about if I gave you two plates, </connor>
<garnt> one of them came from a bone chicken. </garnt>
<garnt> One of them came from boneless chicken. </garnt>
<garnt> You would not be able to tell a difference. </garnt>
<garnt> I would guarantee you not be able to. </garnt>
<joey> Now the moisture, the moisture is there. </joey>
<connor> It's, it's more natural flavor. </connor>
<connor> It tastes, the texture is better. </connor>
<garnt> Everything is better on a bone in chicken. </garnt>
<garnt> - Get the venous pumping steroids. </garnt>
<garnt> - Into these chicken. The only thing that is, </garnt>
<garnt> that is a detriment is the fact that is a bone chicken, </garnt>
<connor> but that's a whole, </connor>
<garnt> I will happily pay the price for a better tasting chicken. </garnt>
<connor> - And then like when you get to the ends, </connor>
<connor> this does not want to come off the bone. You have to like, </connor>
<joey> be like a feal animal to get this thing off the bone. </joey>
<joey> Just break my teeth. I. </joey>
<garnt> - Was worth it for the better. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because you can eat more way more chicken, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> Cause boneless chicken is just chicken breast. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. It's amazing though. </garnt>
<connor> It's not, it's not always chicken. </connor>
<connor> Breast bone chicken is yeah, </connor>
<connor> it is always chicken breasts and the meat. </connor>
<connor> - Tastes the same on the wings. You know what? </connor>
<garnt> - I don't think the breasts is the best part of the chicken. </garnt>
<connor> I think it is. I think. </connor>
<connor> - It is. Do you know what I like? </connor>
<connor> - I like moisture with. </connor>
<connor> - My meat and you can get a more breast. The breast is. </connor>
<garnt> - Moist. </garnt>
<garnt> - Are you kidding me? </garnt>
<garnt> - You can get a moisture. You can't get the moist breast. </garnt>
<connor> Right? </connor>
<garnt> A lot of the times you, </garnt>
<garnt> you cook a chicken breast and it can do your cooking. </garnt>
<connor> It your. </connor>
<garnt> - No, my mans, </garnt>
<garnt> my men's never did a bad job on the chicken man. </garnt>
<garnt> It was always fresh, but like, like sauce, container. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like I've had enough chicken breasts and rat out random </garnt>
<joey> chippies and random places where just the breasts is too </joey>
<garnt> dry. You can never get under the wrong chippy. </garnt>
<connor> - No, you can never get London. </connor>
<connor> I would never get at Chapin was chicken. </connor>
<garnt> They don't do boneless chicken. Well enough outside of. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's what I'm saying. Right? </garnt>
<garnt> Because, </garnt>
<connor> because you need to cook chicken breasts rights in order for </connor>
<connor> it to be done. Right. </connor>
<garnt> But you don't have to pay that. It's not even better. </garnt>
<garnt> Not. </garnt>
<connor> - Korean places here. And they have boneless and boned. </connor>
<connor> Always boneless, always because this is just better. </connor>
<connor> You also get more of it. Cause they don't, </connor>
<connor> they don't turn stack. Go to Nando's. </connor>
<connor> - What'd you get what'd you get? </connor>
<garnt> - I got like half a chicken. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. Why? </garnt>
<garnt> Why don't you get the boneless? The boneless, </garnt>
<garnt> the boneless one. </garnt>
<garnt> When you go to Nando's. </garnt>
<garnt> - Ah, they don't do the boneless. </garnt>
<joey> Just they do. I didn't even know they did that. </joey>
<connor> I would've got the book. </connor>
<joey> He knows. So he's going to get the boy. </joey>
<connor> No, no, actually I joke I don't get the hot chicken. </connor>
<connor> I get the butterfly burger, which has no bones. </connor>
<connor> Cause I want to deal with bone. That. </connor>
<garnt> - Is definitely drier than the half sheet. That's. </garnt>
<connor> - Why you pile on the source baby. Oh no. </connor>
<garnt> They're if they cook you're right though. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause he doesn't eat. </garnt>
<garnt> - Nando source is the only source. </garnt>
<connor> - Well I'm just like Chris Nando's Nando's man. </connor>
<garnt> It's a 50 50 gamble on whether it's gonna be juicy or not. </garnt>
<garnt> It's up to the rest of the breast. </garnt>
<garnt> - Is always. The breasts. </garnt>
<connor> - It's totally up to the chef man and how he cooks it. Okay. </connor>
<garnt> - You don't need to play it. </garnt>
<garnt> You don't need to pay you that gamble. </garnt>
<garnt> If you just get the half a chicken off the bone because you </garnt>
<garnt> know what, it's always juicy. </garnt>
<connor> - It's good. But I don't. </connor>
<connor> The butterfly chicken burger is just fine as well. </connor>
<connor> This is the same thing. And then you can just toss it up. </connor>
<garnt> It could be. </garnt>
<garnt> - Better. It could be better. </garnt>
<connor> - It's just, I just think, </connor>
<connor> I think the Nando's chicken is comfort food. </connor>
<connor> It's not the best. </connor>
<connor> - I don't, I don't expect five star barn was chicken. </connor>
<connor> Chicken is right. </connor>
<garnt> Michelin star restaurant and order fried chicken. </garnt>
<garnt> - I've had, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> I've been to Michelin star restaurants and I've had times </garnt>
<joey> where I just want the fried chicken more like it's just so </joey>
<joey> much better to me. I love a good fried chicken, my son, </joey>
<joey> right. </joey>
<garnt> In America. </garnt>
<connor> But I feel like there's a very American side of me. </connor>
<garnt> - Look, there's, </garnt>
<garnt> there's a reason why soup is made from bones of animals. </garnt>
<garnt> Right? And that's because the bones contain flavor. </garnt>
<connor> You're not eating the. I wanted to eat soup. </connor>
<garnt> I'll eat soup. </garnt>
<connor> - If you're not eating the bone marrow gone, you know, </connor>
<connor> cracking the. </connor>
<connor> I don't go to the restroom with you. Like honey, </connor>
<connor> you get at your bones. I'm going to eat that bone marrow, </connor>
<connor> bro. Crack it open. </connor>
<garnt> You know, like you're not, you're not even a bone. </garnt>
<garnt> This bone does. </garnt>
<connor> - Do. It does. </connor>
<garnt> Oh my God. I'm. </garnt>
<connor> - Sure out of fast food restaurant, </connor>
<garnt> it doesn't do with the bone on it. I'm sure it does. </garnt>
<garnt> If they marinate with the bone in, yes, </garnt>
<garnt> the bone will have an effect help. </garnt>
<garnt> But when you're at fast food, </garnt>
<connor> they literally got that chicken in the van 20 minutes ago. </connor>
<connor> And it's on your plate. </connor>
<connor> There's no time to have the bone plane affect you. </connor>
<connor> You're just getting boned. </connor>
<connor> - That was. </connor>
<joey> - I rest my case. </joey>
<joey> I'm sure. </joey>
<garnt> - It does make a difference, but I'm not, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm not even going to know that argument. </garnt>
<garnt> It makes I'm not even going to pretend to start. </garnt>
<joey> I'm not going to start to pretend that I think I know the </joey>
<joey> difference. I don't do you have tastebuds Joey, </joey>
<joey> do you have taste to tell the difference and you do have a </joey>
<garnt> tongue. </garnt>
<joey> - I'm sure a man, man, who doesn't like source, </joey>
<joey> I don't trust a God. </joey>
<joey> - I have tastebuds and you know what? I taste chicken. </joey>
<garnt> I don't give a. </garnt>
<joey> If it's from the bone or it tastes like cheese, </joey>
<garnt> all chicken tastes the same. Jerry, all meat stays the same. </garnt>
<joey> It's just beef. It tastes the same. </joey>
<garnt> It comes from the same animal. All beef tastes the same. </garnt>
<garnt> Every cut of beef is the same. All chicken tastes the same. </garnt>
<joey> All chicken tastes the same. </joey>
<connor> - There's parts of the chicken in terms of like the skin and </connor>
<connor> the, you know, </connor>
<connor> cause the wing is just an extension of the breast in terms </connor>
<connor> of how the meat is the meat, the meat. </connor>
<connor> - I'm about to leave. I didn't say that. </connor>
<garnt> I don't take responsibility for that statement. </garnt>
<joey> - The wing, </joey>
<garnt> the meat part of it tastes exactly the same as the breast. </garnt>
<garnt> That's why they can make boneless wings and call it wings. </garnt>
<garnt> It doesn't taste any different. </garnt>
<garnt> The only problem is with the bone is that you get like veins </garnt>
<garnt> and. And then it's like, I don't want that. </garnt>
<joey> Who wants the vein? Who's like. </joey>
<joey> - Is boneless wings. </joey>
<joey> - The boneless wings, right? </joey>
<joey> Go to Buffalo, wild wings. </joey>
<joey> You at any of the pieces, </joey>
<joey> all it is is just chicken breast car. </joey>
<joey> Did you know that to make it look like? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> To make it because like I've never gotten boneless wings. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause I'm like, what the? </garnt>
<garnt> This we've. </garnt>
<connor> - Never tried it. </connor>
<garnt> - To never tried. I've tried to boneless chicken. </garnt>
<garnt> You should have never ordered it. </garnt>
<garnt> I've never tried boneless wings, but I've had like. </garnt>
<connor> - Boneless chicken. Isn't all chicken boneless. </connor>
<connor> When you get into like a restaurant. </connor>
<joey> - You get wings. </joey>
<connor> - But when you get wings, boneless wings, every time. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> It's off the bone. </garnt>
<garnt> Chicken is always tastes better off the bone. </garnt>
<garnt> It's less healthy for you. </garnt>
<garnt> The reason why people promote breasts it's because it's the </garnt>
<garnt> leanest meat, right? </garnt>
<garnt> That doesn't necessarily mean it tastes better. </garnt>
<connor> - The wing meat. </connor>
<connor> Like the actual meat that you're eating tastes no different </connor>
<garnt> from the breast. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's the moisture content. And it's it's you, </garnt>
<garnt> it's the bone flavor that seeps the chicken. Somebody, </garnt>
<connor> it just, it tastes. </connor>
<connor> - Better unless we're at a gourmet restaurant. I would, </connor>
<connor> I would say that's invalid because you know these, </connor>
<connor> these fast food restaurants, you know, and the, </connor>
<connor> the place where you're eating wings from 90% of the time, </connor>
<connor> isn't going to have the bone play any effect. </connor>
<joey> - Buffalo, wild wings see a barn was chicken door. </joey>
<garnt> What the is this? </garnt>
<connor> Okay, you have a KFC bargain bucket or KFC marking. </connor>
<connor> Do you have preferences of which one? </connor>
<connor> Which piece you take because every piece tastes different. </connor>
<connor> And if, and if every piece of KFC chicken tastes different, </connor>
<connor> depending on the part of the chicken. </connor>
<connor> - The different seasons that you get a different ratio of </connor>
<connor> skin, the surface skin to like meat with the, </connor>
<connor> with the wings, with the drums, </connor>
<connor> you have the optimal skin to meat ratio. </connor>
<connor> So you get more skin. So it tastes better. </connor>
<connor> Whereas the big, the big like flat piece where I don't know, </connor>
<connor> what's it called? What's it called? </connor>
<connor> The big flat piece. </connor>
<connor> What is it called? You know, there's two pieces. </connor>
<connor> There's the wing. And then there's the other piece. </connor>
<joey> That's kind of like a big piece like this. </joey>
<connor> You can just get more meat. </connor>
<connor> Have. </connor>
<connor> - It's worse. The worst, the wordless skin. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. </connor>
<connor> It tastes worse because it's just purely meat. Right? </connor>
<connor> I don't want it overing on it. I don't want. </connor>
<garnt> - No, you're, </garnt>
<garnt> you're confusing it because you're having more skin, </garnt>
<connor> which is where all the flavor is with KFC. </connor>
<connor> That's why you think it tastes better because you're getting </connor>
<connor> more bite of a skin. </connor>
<connor> How are you not seeing this? </connor>
<connor> How are you failing to understand this con? </connor>
<joey> - I literally don't give a. When it comes to KFC. </joey>
<garnt> It's fresh. It's all chicken to me. </garnt>
<joey> Bone or no bone. </joey>
<connor> - This whole chicken. Like I love boneless wings. </connor>
<joey> I love fried chicken burgers. I love the chicken select. </joey>
<joey> So the chicken tenders Danny's a amazing contenders are </joey>
<joey> better than nugs and wings with bones in them. </joey>
<garnt> - Nugs are like the part of the chicken </garnt>
<connor> that nobody else eats. </connor>
<garnt> Right? They've repackaged it. </garnt>
<connor> But like, do you know why? </connor>
<connor> It's the worst tasting part of the chicken. </connor>
<connor> - Boneless. Boneless is better than bones. </connor>
<garnt> - Are. You are so wrong on site. </garnt>
<garnt> No. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm not, man. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just. </garnt>
<garnt> - Trying to think. </garnt>
<garnt> Freedom of speech was a mistake until I heard until I just </garnt>
<garnt> heard you speak. You're a clown man. </garnt>
<connor> Like, why are you making it more difficult to eat this? </connor>
<connor> And you're making more mess. </connor>
<garnt> - The reason flat earth is exists. </garnt>
<garnt> Like this is, this is like. </garnt>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<connor> - Boneless nuggets are like chicken extract. </connor>
<connor> It's hardly a chicken paste. You know? </connor>
<connor> It's like a, </connor>
<joey> it's like a polished starring with chicken tastes and </joey>
<joey> chicken tenders are good. Chicken tenders, </joey>
<joey> chicken tenders are all. </joey>
<connor> Think we're all in agreement. Chicken tender is a good. </connor>
<garnt> Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. I mean off the bone. </connor>
<connor> Chicken is always the best. </connor>
<garnt> That's that? That is taken off the. </garnt>
<joey> - Off the bone and then fried and then present. </joey>
<connor> - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, because, </connor>
<garnt> because you're taking the tastiest part of chicken, </garnt>
<joey> chicken off the bone is literally Barlass chicken with one </joey>
<joey> extra step, </joey>
<connor> the breast is the worst tasting part of the chicken. It is. </connor>
<connor> - If you taste the chicken. </connor>
<connor> - It's the most healthy have you got chicken feet? Okay. </connor>
<garnt> Well that's okay. Well, It's the most, </garnt>
<connor> it's the worst tasting part of the chicken. </connor>
<joey> That's like actually, you know, having a Scot meat, </joey>
<connor> white meat, meat on it, right? </connor>
<garnt> It's it's the most healthiest for you, you know, it's it's, </garnt>
<joey> you know, if you want to eat a healthy meal, </joey>
<joey> you should eat the leanest part of the chicken, </joey>
<joey> which doesn't necessarily mean it tastes the best. </joey>
<joey> And the fact that you think that all chicken tastes the </joey>
<garnt> same, no matter what part of the chicken is from. </garnt>
<connor> - The main part of it. Like the breast the wing, </connor>
<garnt> it's all comes in the house, prepared. </garnt>
<connor> It doesn't, you know, it's entirely to do with that. </connor>
<connor> And how much water has been injected into it. Like. </connor>
<garnt> - If, if, if you prepare each part of the chicken, the same, </garnt>
<connor> which is exactly what fried chicken is than the worst pacing </connor>
<connor> than, than it tastes the same, then it doesn't taste the, I, </connor>
<garnt> again, </garnt>
<garnt> I guarantee I can take two different fried chicken from two </garnt>
<joey> different parts and put it in front of you, blindfold you, </joey>
<garnt> you will not be able to hold them because press, </garnt>
<joey> especially in fried chicken. </joey>
<connor> - I think you'll just, you know, you're confusing. </connor>
<garnt> The feral instinct of tearing it off as a, </garnt>
<connor> as a supplement for flavor. </connor>
<connor> I think that's what's going on here. </connor>
<connor> Cause there's no way, you know, </connor>
<connor> when you rip the skin off and you would eat it, </connor>
<connor> it tastes the same. Why? </connor>
<garnt> - Why don't they just sell breasts then? Why? </garnt>
<connor> Why? Because they can taste. </connor>
<garnt> - The same. They do. </garnt>
<connor> It's called boneless wings. </connor>
<connor> - No, I mean, I mean, why, why, why, </connor>
<garnt> why market wings in that case? Because the market thigh. </garnt>
<garnt> - What'd you mean thighs? Cause thanks are like, </garnt>
<connor> what are they? I mean like more cartilage they're cheaper, </connor>
<garnt> right? Like they normally just like, </garnt>
<connor> they have more like in them, more muscle and stuff. </connor>
<connor> The cartilage of chicken. It's like a muscle. </connor>
<garnt> - I'm not talking about collar. I'm talking about thighs. </garnt>
<connor> - Thighs and cartilage. I just said, oh, </connor>
<garnt> your thighs have more like cartilage in them. </garnt>
<garnt> They're like the like muscles and it's five. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's a different part of the meat that tastes a bit </garnt>
<garnt> different. So the breast, no. </garnt>
<connor> - The thighs have more muscle in them. It's a five, the. </connor>
<garnt> - Breast has more muscle in it. </garnt>
<garnt> We literally talked about this. </garnt>
<garnt> The breast is the lean part of the chicken. </garnt>
<garnt> That's the part where the most muscle, no, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just going to hang back. </garnt>
<connor> - You know, when you bite into a meat, right. </connor>
<garnt> When you've put five loads, </garnt>
<connor> like fibers and that you gotta like, oh. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> - No, I really don't. </connor>
<connor> - When you go to the supermarket, </connor>
<joey> you cut up chicken thigh compared to chicken breast. </joey>
<joey> The breast is like nothing in it. </joey>
<joey> It's your pure meat. Right? </joey>
<joey> The thigh is just like, it's got like, </joey>
<connor> like strands of muscle in it and it's way tougher. </connor>
<connor> It's cause it's a thigh. It's got muscle. </connor>
<joey> - I don't think, I don't think we've ever. </joey>
<joey> - Been this silent. </joey>
<garnt> - Cook, the chicken thigh and a chicken breast. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm like, I can't argue that. </garnt>
<garnt> Do you know what? Like, if you can argue with an idiot, </garnt>
<joey> they'll just take you down to their level and beat with </joey>
<joey> experience, man. </joey>
<joey> How can I argue? Argue Romans so many levels. </joey>
<joey> Like a thigh doesn't have the most amount of muscle because </joey>
<garnt> it's not the lean meat. Right? </garnt>
<garnt> It's the breast, the breast is pure muscle. </garnt>
<garnt> It's pure muscle it's wave. What do you think? </garnt>
<garnt> Or would like all the meat is muscle, right? </garnt>
<garnt> But the breasts, </garnt>
<garnt> the reason the breast has the most muscle is because it </garnt>
<garnt> doesn't come with the bone. You are just, </garnt>
<connor> you have a pure slab of pure chicken muscle. </connor>
<connor> - What are you saying? Oh my. </connor>
<garnt> - God. </garnt>
<connor> - The breast isn't just one big muscle. </connor>
<garnt> - What do you think meat is? </garnt>
<connor> - It's a layer of different things. </connor>
<connor> There's like fatty layers and stuff as well. </connor>
<connor> It's a whole combination of all just pure muscle. Yes it is. </connor>
<connor> No, it is no, no, no. </connor>
<garnt> Cause it's like fibers and stuff that connects all the </garnt>
<garnt> muscle. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's a muscle. </garnt>
<garnt> - I got to Google this. I got to consult Google. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm like losing my mind. </connor>
<garnt> I'm actually losing my mind. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. It's this, this has just turned into. </joey>
<joey> - Are you, are you all entertained? </joey>
<garnt> I am. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm loving. I'm just sitting back. </garnt>
<garnt> Just watching you guys lose it over literal pieces of. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm losing brain cells, man. </garnt>
<garnt> Like that's like, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know how many brain cells has just died in that. </garnt>
<joey> - I can't believe you're getting heated over poultry. </joey>
<joey> It's just hilarious. </joey>
<connor> - I misunderstood what I was saying. I Googled it. </connor>
<connor> I misunderstood tendons and muscles and I confuse the two. </connor>
<joey> - It's all right, man. </joey>
<connor> It's all right to admit when you're wrong. It's all good. </connor>
<connor> It's all good. </connor>
<connor> You're the bigger man. You're the bigger man. </connor>
<connor> Don't. </connor>
<connor> - Worry, man. </connor>
<connor> I'll admit when I'm wrong, I fucked up. </connor>
<connor> - You know, this episode started really, you know, </connor>
<connor> this episode started really calmly talking about candles, </connor>
<connor> incense, you know, </connor>
<connor> de-stressing and ended up being one of the most stress in </connor>
<joey> juicy. </joey>
<connor> - Why couldn't we have started on this? </connor>
<connor> - I'm saying because the muscle is used more often than the </connor>
<connor> breath. </connor>
<joey> - It's not only became the most stress-inducing argument, </joey>
<joey> but also at the same time, </joey>
<joey> I think it became Googling it again. </joey>
<joey> I think it became one of the most stupid arguments we've </joey>
<joey> ever had on Trash Taste. </joey>
<garnt> - The breast meat is the most lean is because that's the </garnt>
<garnt> muscle that's the most used. No. </garnt>
<connor> - It's the least used. </connor>
<joey> - Audio. Only listeners. </joey>
<joey> You might want to watch tune into the YouTube. </joey>
<connor> I'm assuming melting down over. </connor>
<joey> - Poultry only on Trash Taste. </joey>
<joey> You know what? </joey>
<joey> I didn't think we could get more heated than the pizza crust </joey>
<connor> argument. </connor>
<connor> I just, I would, I just love like peering over. </connor>
<connor> - The thigh is a, </connor>
<connor> is considered a darker meat because it's used way more. </connor>
<connor> When they're walking all the time, </connor>
<connor> they don't using their breast all the time. </connor>
<connor> - Well, what's lean meats. </connor>
<connor> - Then lean meat, I think is what it's used less. </connor>
<connor> Is it? I think I thought. </connor>
<garnt> - That was because it was used. </garnt>
<connor> - The most. So here's what Google says. </connor>
<connor> Apparently I Googled why's thigh, </connor>
<connor> dark meat and it says the more myoglobin, the darker, </connor>
<connor> the meat and the richer, the nutrients, </connor>
<connor> Michael and provides muscle with oxygen required for </connor>
<connor> exercise and movement. Since chickens are flightless birds, </connor>
<connor> they use their legs and thighs to get around making first </connor>
<connor> thoughts darker than the breast or wings, </connor>
<garnt> because you're not you're using. How would you, how, </garnt>
<garnt> how would you think that the breast is used more than the </garnt>
<garnt> thigh? How does that make any sense? </garnt>
<garnt> Do you use your breast more than your thigh, Garnt? </garnt>
<garnt> I was wrong on the muscle part? Yes. </garnt>
<garnt> But how could you think that the breast is used by? </garnt>
<garnt> - I be breathing. </garnt>
<connor> - Idiots. </connor>
<connor> - You're still wrong. </connor>
<connor> - Wrong. </connor>
<connor> - We equaled the playing field, but you're still wrong. </connor>
<garnt> You're still wrong. </garnt>
<connor> - We're both idiots. And welcome to Trash Taste. </connor>
<joey> - Well, when the trash is two idiots arguing over chicken, </joey>
<garnt> I feel like I feel like 30 minutes wasn't enough. </garnt>
<connor> - I just want to know how you thought the chicken walked in </connor>
<connor> your fight. </connor>
<garnt> - I just want to know how you thought the breast had less </garnt>
<garnt> muscle. </garnt>
<connor> - I just did a brain fog. That's my. </connor>
<joey> - Chicken shimmy. When they walk. </joey>
<connor> - I just hear the like a December music. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh my, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> I just, I just thought leaned me. </garnt>
<connor> It just had more muscle use. That's what I thought. </connor>
<garnt> I thought when I hear the word lean meat, </garnt>
<garnt> it means it's got less fatty content. So I just. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh, this one's lean. </connor>
<connor> Right? They have some muscles, but not that much. </connor>
<connor> Right. And kind of have like, no, it's not worked out me. </connor>
<joey> Right. It's kinda like not fat meat, but not very, </joey>
<joey> or like thought like I think, right. </joey>
<joey> Am I crazy here? </joey>
<joey> You say someone's lean when they look like skinny, but yeah, </joey>
<connor> they got a little bit going on. Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. Because there's, there's only the muscle content. </garnt>
<connor> They're like. </connor>
<garnt> - They're not muscular though. There's no fat. </garnt>
<connor> There's no fat content. </connor>
<garnt> - There's no fat content bro. </garnt>
<connor> - Right. You've got lean. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. So, I assumed that because it was leaned meats, </garnt>
<garnt> then it would have less fat contents. </garnt>
<garnt> Therefore it was the one that was used the most. Right. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. I guess by that logic, it'd be like, </connor>
<connor> if I didn't do anything and didn't, and didn't have any fat, </connor>
<garnt> I would be muscular, but I'm not using my muscles. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because I'm still like confused because the more. </garnt>
<connor> - You use a muscle, the more, the more muscular it becomes, </connor>
<connor> the more nutrients that demand. </connor>
<garnt> - So how does the breast have the most meat </garnt>
<connor> and muscle when it then? </connor>
<connor> - So when you're working out, right, </connor>
<connor> the muscle fibers become a lot more intense and I believe </connor>
<connor> they go through like they're in the meat a lot more. Right. </connor>
<connor> I think if I'm correct in saying that that's cause that's </connor>
<connor> what makes like when you, when you go to space, right? </connor>
<connor> Your muscles get that the muscle fibers are so weak because </connor>
<connor> they haven't been used. So then when they, </connor>
<connor> I believe when they're being used are a lot more intense. </connor>
<connor> And that's why when you have the thigh, </connor>
<connor> it's it bites back a lot more. </connor>
<connor> It's tougher to eat because the muscle fibers are so much </connor>
<connor> stronger. That's what I, how I interpreted it. </connor>
<garnt> Right, right. </garnt>
<garnt> Again, I misunderstood. </garnt>
<garnt> And that's why lean me, </garnt>
<connor> because the breast isn't really using the breast marks. </connor>
<connor> So there's not much muscle fiber to plant that. Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - I don't even know where to take this conversation anymore. </joey>
<garnt> I'm just like, I'm just like, I, I don't. </garnt>
<joey> - Think this episode can peak anymore. </joey>
<connor> - I feel like. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, we just got to go downhill from here. </connor>
<joey> So you know what? Let's just play. </joey>
<garnt> - Patrons. This might be a shorter episode than usual, </garnt>
<garnt> but I don't, I don't, </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like any other topic we can take from this, </garnt>
<joey> it's gonna, it's going to be good. </joey>
<connor> Let's just, let's. </connor>
<connor> - Just end while we're high. </connor>
<connor> But let's just say while we're at the high, just </connor>
<joey> Was just like Sunday afternoon over here. </joey>
<connor> - Watching you. It's just like, ah, </connor>
<connor> I just like how we had such a civil podcast having such a </connor>
<connor> simple podcast. </connor>
<connor> And I literally remember the moment when he was just like, </connor>
<garnt> I didn't say it on purpose, but I just said I disagreed. </garnt>
<garnt> I just like I didn't do that on purpose. </garnt>
<garnt> I know that's the mean by series. He didn't do that. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was like modern day times. You know, </garnt>
<connor> when things get too peaceful, war is bound to come. </connor>
<connor> - Exactly. </connor>
<joey> We went from an aroma therapy to two men was veins popping </joey>
<joey> out on their forehead. Overall. </joey>
<connor> - You think candles are good. </connor>
<connor> Well that's how world war one starts. </connor>
<joey> - All right. Well then he has all the patrons. </joey>
<joey> Hey, let us know in the comments, </joey>
<connor> which part of the chicken you prefer? I'm sure that was. </connor>
<connor> - Boneless. Skinless gang. </connor>
<connor> No, no, not all chicken tastes the same. </connor>
<connor> All the chicken tastes, same bone chicken tastes better. </connor>
<garnt> - We are going to do something that we've never done before. </garnt>
<garnt> And that, and I'm doing this without asking for permission. </garnt>
<joey> We're going to do a poll on Twitter the day after this goes </joey>
<connor> out, you guys have one day to vote on boneless or bone. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> But Hey, in the meantime, you can go over to a patron, </joey>
