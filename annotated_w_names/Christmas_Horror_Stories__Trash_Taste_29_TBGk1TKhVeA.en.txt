<joey> what are some like uh like specific </joey>
<joey> dishes that you had up there that you </joey>
<joey> would recommend to people who want to go </joey>
<connor> to hokkaido </connor>
<connor> anything with milk in it it's just like </connor>
<connor> yeah is does it meet the hype </connor>
<connor> yes i've heard so much about hokkaido </connor>
<garnt> milk and what is what is so good about </garnt>
<joey> the milk there </joey>
<joey> it's like the breed of cow i don't know </joey>
<joey> man it's just rich it's real rich </joey>
<joey> it's like full cream right yeah and i </joey>
<joey> had like a milk ice cream i don't know </joey>
<connor> me like </connor>
<connor> milk ice cream but it was just like </connor>
<garnt> intense milk hit you yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i saw you posted a picture of like beer </garnt>
<connor> ice cream as well </connor>
<connor> oh yeah yeah yeah just just to prove </connor>
<garnt> that japan does every flavor of soft </garnt>
<garnt> serve i don't know why you'd ever want </garnt>
<garnt> beer ice cream yeah there was like ice </garnt>
<connor> cream that was just </connor>
<connor> beer and i was like i mean sure i'll try </connor>
<connor> it i like both these things individually </connor>
<joey> even alcoholics are like </joey>
<connor> i can't imagine a beer flavored anything </connor>
<connor> it's aside from </connor>
<joey> beer and it tastes like a ski ice cream </joey>
<connor> yeah what's that what's the weirdest </connor>
<joey> flavor of ice cream you've had </joey>
<connor> rum rate i'm sure i don't know how dare </connor>
<connor> you </connor>
<connor> probably </connor>
<connor> they do that [ __ ] here with food they're </connor>
<connor> like i don't care about the boundaries </connor>
<garnt> i like both these things let's make it </garnt>
<garnt> into food that's that's like the </garnt>
<garnt> equivalent of [ __ ] what's what some </garnt>
<connor> americans do which like buying of </connor>
<connor> mcflurry and then just dipping it with </connor>
<connor> fries okay which just </connor>
<connor> blows my mind okay but actually i kind </connor>
<connor> of like that no no </connor>
<joey> no no what it's pretty good i went to i </joey>
<connor> i </connor>
<joey> did [ __ ] aki took me to a steak and </joey>
<joey> shake once which is where like </joey>
<joey> the optimal place of where you do that </joey>
<joey> and i just saw like six americans </joey>
<joey> dipping their fries </joey>
<joey> into their shakes i'm just like i can't </joey>
<garnt> i can't be here i have to leave we're </garnt>
<garnt> living in a first world country dude why </garnt>
<connor> why why are you eating like this </connor>
<connor> honestly like i don't do it often but it </connor>
<connor> tastes pretty good when i've done it you </connor>
<joey> know </joey>
<joey> i don't get it it's like oh it's like a </joey>
<joey> nice it's it's the synergy of the </joey>
<connor> saltiness i see the fries and i don't </connor>
<connor> understand why it works it just does </connor>
<connor> right it doesn't also steak and shakes </connor>
<connor> like the most depressing place in </connor>
<connor> america </connor>
<connor> like i i went to one at like midnight </connor>
<joey> because i was like yeah maybe it's </joey>
<connor> because you went at midnight </connor>
<connor> there was a dollar fifty burgers yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah jesus christ </joey>
<joey> i don't know you've never you've never </joey>
<joey> been to a white castle before that's </joey>
<garnt> that's true </garnt>
<garnt> i have never been to a white castle </garnt>
<garnt> before is is it does it meet the hype </garnt>
<joey> white color what the hype of what what i </joey>
<joey> don't know because i i i only know white </joey>
<connor> castles </connor>
<connor> that one movie right uh what was it how </connor>
<joey> would harold kunma or something oh yeah </joey>
<garnt> and so white castle doesn't sell burgers </garnt>
<joey> they sell sliders </joey>
<garnt> okay right so it's like the tiny yeah </garnt>
<garnt> what's what's the difference between a </garnt>
<garnt> burger and a slice like a mini burger </garnt>
<garnt> slider is just like a mini burger </garnt>
<garnt> apparently right i don't know where it </garnt>
<connor> comes from but basically they sell </connor>
<connor> sliders instead of burgers right but </connor>
<connor> like normally right like when you buy a </connor>
<connor> slider it's like you know </connor>
<connor> you go to some american restaurants and </connor>
<connor> i like me like you know like like my uh </connor>
<connor> chicken parmesan sliders like that </connor>
<connor> shit's bomb </connor>
<connor> don't say it like that parmesan </connor>
<connor> oh what do you </connor>
<connor> that hurts me hearing that all right go </connor>
<connor> ahead anyway that chicken like my </connor>
<connor> favorites are like chicken parmesan </connor>
<connor> sliders all right so it's like the </connor>
<connor> chicken parmesan then you put like like </connor>
<connor> some lettuce in it </connor>
<connor> it's [ __ ] nice but white castle </connor>
<connor> sliders is literally just </connor>
<connor> two soggy buns and like the thinnest </connor>
<connor> patty </connor>
<connor> in existence it's like paper thin </connor>
<connor> patties and it's like oh </connor>
<connor> that's like you can get like a pat like </connor>
<connor> a six pack of six packs of slime </connor>
<connor> it's like a six it is it's like they </connor>
<connor> they box it like a six pack of sliders </connor>
<connor> for like four dollars or something i'm </connor>
<joey> just like </joey>
<connor> this is this is true depression all i </connor>
<connor> know is that everyone i know who goes </connor>
<connor> there has like the shits afterwards </connor>
<connor> oh yeah yeah just like like to me that's </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> how on earth we've got to the point </connor>
<connor> where that's just an acceptable outcome </connor>
<joey> how is it how is it that like americans </joey>
<joey> have gauged like the the tastiness of </joey>
<connor> a fast food joint by how much this </connor>
<connor> stomach is just destroyed the next day </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> you know what people are like oh yeah </connor>
<joey> it's not a good chili's meal unless i'm </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] myself constantly the next day </garnt>
<garnt> i feel the same with indian though </garnt>
<connor> like i i i have to destroy the toilets </connor>
<connor> sure after a good indian soil </connor>
<garnt> but at the same time i can only do it </garnt>
<joey> like at most once everything </joey>
<connor> like a burger shouldn't do that yeah </connor>
<joey> indian i've always accepted that indian </joey>
<joey> does that yeah because of the spices </joey>
<connor> it's just like bread and meat what is </connor>
<garnt> happening like what what what when </garnt>
<joey> it's the oil yeah okay you know also the </joey>
<connor> most egregious thing that i hate they do </connor>
<connor> is that they put the grease on top of </connor>
<connor> the burgers yeah that's disgusting yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah who did this and who who likes it </connor>
<connor> because </connor>
<connor> i remember going to steak and shake and </connor>
<connor> they did this to my burger and i was </connor>
<connor> like well i don't want this anymore why </connor>
<connor> would you do this it's like you took the </connor>
<connor> worst part of the meat which is the part </connor>
<connor> that makes you feel sick </connor>
<garnt> have you put it on top why i remember </garnt>
<garnt> when i was staying at uh </garnt>
<garnt> sydney's like family's house in </garnt>
<garnt> wisconsin </garnt>
<garnt> and they got like a takeaway pizza joint </garnt>
<garnt> one day yeah and one of the big selling </garnt>
<garnt> points of this like takeaway pizza joint </garnt>
<garnt> is they had like garlic bread </garnt>
<garnt> and the selling point was that if you </garnt>
<garnt> put like a wet </garnt>
<garnt> a paper towel on the garlic bread it </garnt>
<garnt> would literally soak it </garnt>
<garnt> in oil and they were hyping this up to </garnt>
<garnt> be like </garnt>
<garnt> yo if you put the if there's so much oil </garnt>
<garnt> on this that if you put </garnt>
<garnt> the wet paper down it will soak it and </garnt>
<garnt> it'll become completely wet and i'm i'm </garnt>
<garnt> just thinking </garnt>
<garnt> how is this a selling point why why </garnt>
<connor> would i want to eat this </connor>
<joey> that's like that simpsons episode when </joey>
<connor> like homer's trying to get like so </connor>
<connor> fat that he gets like the disability </connor>
<connor> like thing </connor>
<connor> and dr nick's like grab the burger rub </connor>
<joey> it against the piece of paper </joey>
<garnt> if it goes see-through you can eat it </garnt>
<garnt> like i thought it was like a joke i </garnt>
<garnt> thought it was satire no </garnt>
<garnt> they literally like marketed it as this </garnt>
<connor> garlic bread is so </connor>
<connor> oily that you can literally soak up an </connor>
<connor> entire paper towel </connor>
<connor> and i just think about it and i'm just </connor>
<connor> like i hold it in my hands and it was </connor>
<garnt> literally dripping and i took one part </garnt>
<garnt> and one bite was enough for me that's </garnt>
<connor> like the pure survival food because the </connor>
<connor> sheer amount of oil could like power a </connor>
<joey> lamp </joey>
<joey> have you ever heard of this american bow </joey>
<connor> joint called the heart yeah yeah of </connor>
<connor> course of course yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah yeah they're [ __ ] i was </connor>
<connor> watching a video yesterday of this guy </connor>
<connor> who ate the the biggest one there which </connor>
<connor> is called the quadruple bypass burger </connor>
<connor> right and it's literally think of a big </connor>
<garnt> mac but snapchat i've seen </garnt>
<connor> big macs on top of one another yeah and </connor>
<garnt> it was like i already thought that it </garnt>
<garnt> was like 20 000 calories as well yeah </garnt>
<garnt> this guy like demolishes it in five </garnt>
<garnt> minutes i don't know how the [ __ ] he did </garnt>
<garnt> it </garnt>
<joey> but the part that got me was he was like </joey>
<joey> all right we're getting to the bun now </joey>
<connor> uh the bun by the way is soaked in lard </connor>
<joey> i'm like you oh you shouldn't you </joey>
<connor> shouldn't so no no </connor>
<joey> a piece of bread should not be soaked in </joey>
<garnt> anything </garnt>
<garnt> no nothing should be soaked in pure </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] fat </joey>
<joey> yeah oh yeah also the the fries were </joey>
<joey> oiled in pure lard as well </joey>
<connor> that's disgusting like i i just get a </connor>
<joey> shake on top of that </joey>
<connor> i don't understand the appeal of that </connor>
<joey> that's just ridiculous it just sounds </joey>
<joey> gross it looked gross it looked like </joey>
<joey> something out of the alien movies like </joey>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> i didn't want to put that in my stomach </connor>
<garnt> why do people hate their bodies like </garnt>
<garnt> there's only like some let's say </garnt>
<garnt> cuisines you can only enjoy when you </garnt>
<connor> want to like </connor>
<connor> destroy your body and that's probably at </connor>
<connor> like 3 a.m </connor>
<connor> yeah after like out of five guys yeah </connor>
<connor> out of five guys </connor>
<connor> or like i i can never eat a kebab sober </connor>
<connor> like something has got something has </connor>
<connor> gone wrong with me like something has </connor>
<garnt> gone wrong with my life if i'm eating a </garnt>
<garnt> kebab i'm not </garnt>
<garnt> and i'm completely sorry no you know i'm </garnt>
<joey> hella depressed when i'm eating a kebab </joey>
<garnt> for lunch </garnt>
<connor> all right i love a lot like a great like </connor>
<connor> burger with a bit of grease on it yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah and not even drunk me would pass </connor>
<connor> yeah right and the heart attack grill to </connor>
<connor> me is just like </connor>
<joey> there is no reason why i would want to </joey>
<connor> come here other than to feel healthy </connor>
<joey> like like and just look yeah because any </joey>
<joey> meal you have after </joey>
<connor> going to the heart of that group you see </connor>
<connor> the other patrons </connor>
<connor> and you're like oh i'm doing pretty good </connor>
<connor> for myself hey like damn okay maybe i </connor>
<joey> haven't changed yeah because i think the </joey>
<joey> the selling point of the heart attack </joey>
<joey> girl is that oh first of all like when </joey>
<joey> you walk in they put on like a hospital </joey>
<joey> gown on you </joey>
<joey> and they sit you in a wheelchair to like </joey>
<joey> wheel you in and </joey>
<joey> here's the kicker if you weigh over 300 </joey>
<joey> pounds you get the meal for free </joey>
<connor> i feel like it should be the opposite </connor>
<connor> you should be like if it's like taxing </connor>
<connor> the bridge right if you're already fat </connor>
<joey> well you should be you should be </joey>
<joey> charging at least yeah </joey>
<connor> to force you to maintain this egregious </connor>
<garnt> weight </garnt>
<garnt> you know i feel like the concept of a </garnt>
<garnt> heart attack grill is just kind of like </garnt>
<connor> if you you hear it and you're like </connor>
<joey> this is like fiction right this is this </joey>
<connor> is from like some dystopian society this </connor>
<joey> is from like some george orwell </joey>
<joey> yeah you know right like this is how </joey>
<garnt> this is this this is how they fatten you </garnt>
<connor> up before they dispose of yeah exactly </connor>
<connor> watch these like 500 pound like </connor>
<joey> live videos oh 600 pounds yeah whatever </joey>
<connor> you watch it and you realize like most </connor>
<connor> of these people just have like trauma </connor>
<connor> like at what point do we like start </connor>
<connor> being like okay maybe it's not trauma if </connor>
<connor> he's walking into the heart attack grill </connor>
<connor> maybe that's a maybe like that's on him </connor>
<connor> you know what i mean like i think that's </connor>
<connor> going </connor>
<connor> it's like a beyond a point of like </connor>
<connor> comfort food and there's gotta be like </connor>
<connor> all right this is just his fault like </connor>
<connor> this is you know what i mean </connor>
<connor> because because these shows these videos </connor>
<connor> with like these 600 pound people do a </connor>
<connor> really [ __ ] good job </connor>
<connor> and making you feel sorry for them and </connor>
<connor> be like yo man okay yeah like his parent </connor>
<joey> died at like five yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah eating disorder for some reason for </joey>
<connor> some reason at the age of five his mom </connor>
<connor> was taking him to the heart attack grill </connor>
<connor> and that's the only way that she can </connor>
<connor> remember him and it's like </connor>
<connor> okay i get it i get it i sympathize with </connor>
<connor> you </connor>
<connor> but should you yeah it's like what if my </connor>
<connor> parents were like well they've just left </connor>
<connor> me crack it's all i've had since the age </connor>
<connor> of ten would they be like </connor>
<connor> would i be like doing crack but like </connor>
<connor> it's just comfort it's comfort food </connor>
<connor> food to me it's like there's a clear </connor>
<connor> limit to the point where you've got to </connor>
<connor> be like all right well </connor>
<connor> maybe i should stop feeling sorry for </connor>
<joey> you yeah that that's just </joey>
<joey> oh no i i never watched those shows to </joey>
<connor> like feel sorry </connor>
<connor> because i i've noticed i i watch them </connor>
<connor> and they they do a really good job </connor>
<connor> making you think damn like i guess </connor>
<joey> yeah they set up me that's the thing </joey>
<garnt> they set up the they set it up as a sob </garnt>
<garnt> story yeah but what you're seeing and </garnt>
<joey> what you're hearing is like the complete </joey>
<garnt> two different things because i think </garnt>
<connor> that you know </connor>
<connor> somebody was a little chubbier not not </connor>
<connor> nowhere near that level </connor>
<connor> like i get it i get how you can gain </connor>
<connor> weight but there's like a limit of where </connor>
<connor> i think that it would go beyond anything </connor>
<connor> cause some of these they're eating like </connor>
<connor> i don't know like [ __ ] 15 hot dogs in </connor>
<joey> the morning </joey>
<connor> with like cheese and chili on it i'm </connor>
<connor> like yeah i think i would draw the line </connor>
<connor> i think that's right </connor>
<joey> yeah well that's the thing right it's </joey>
<joey> like the thing that surprises me more is </joey>
<joey> is not the fact that </joey>
<connor> this you know they like complaining </connor>
<connor> about having all this weight problems </connor>
<connor> and then they </connor>
<connor> proceed to eat a whole [ __ ] box of </connor>
<connor> chilis right yeah but it's also just the </connor>
<joey> egregious amount of food that they can </joey>
<joey> somehow stomach i'm like </joey>
<garnt> yeah it's just looking at it makes my </garnt>
<garnt> stomach just doesn't make sense to me </garnt>
<garnt> and </garnt>
<garnt> i i feel like you must like you must </garnt>
<garnt> have just grown up with this and because </garnt>
<garnt> every time i go to america i always like </garnt>
<garnt> the food portions in there we've talked </garnt>
<joey> about this before i'm massive man yeah </joey>
<joey> i'm like i'm forced to like have to have </joey>
<joey> these massive food portions and like the </joey>
<joey> first week </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] great yeah after after a week of </joey>
<joey> staying in america </joey>
<joey> i'm like is there a salad and i asked </joey>
<joey> for the salad and what comes </joey>
<connor> and what comes out it's a [ __ ] forest </connor>
<garnt> you know what i mean </garnt>
<joey> like they're saying a [ __ ] salad it's </joey>
<joey> like six heads of lettuce </joey>
<garnt> the amount of dressing is like the same </garnt>
<connor> as the meal because it's like 1600 </connor>
<garnt> calories one of my [ __ ] rabbits i'm </garnt>
<garnt> like did you deforest the entire amazon </garnt>
<garnt> rainforest just to put on my plate like </garnt>
<garnt> this this is the </garnt>
<garnt> kind of like food portions we're talking </garnt>
<connor> about here it sucks man because it's </connor>
<connor> such </connor>
<connor> it's so unfair because we like if you </connor>
<joey> get fat in japan i feel like that's on </joey>
<joey> you yeah yeah like but if you get fat in </joey>
<joey> america it's like </joey>
<joey> well everything was set up against yeah </joey>
<joey> like welcome to the system </joey>
<garnt> everything was set up to make you fat </garnt>
<joey> yeah yeah so it's like how the [ __ ] it </joey>
<connor> like it's not fair </connor>
<garnt> which is why i like because like my my </garnt>
<connor> diet in america is awful obviously </connor>
<connor> because of the food </connor>
<connor> but like also like i get to the point </connor>
<connor> where i want to </connor>
<connor> have something but something but </connor>
<joey> something not greasy </joey>
<joey> and especially like in the midwest where </joey>
<joey> it's like you know where it's like the </joey>
<joey> countryside there's a lot less choice </joey>
<joey> and a lot of </joey>
<joey> healthy choices up as well so you're </joey>
<connor> kind of forced to be </connor>
<connor> like hey you can have you you kind of </connor>
<connor> have to cook for yourself and if you </connor>
<connor> can't cook for yourself then you're </connor>
<connor> pretty much </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] you know that's why it's so much </connor>
<garnt> harder to eat healthier over there </garnt>
<garnt> than it is say say in like japan yeah </garnt>
<connor> but but even then in america i remember </connor>
<connor> i i went to the uh to walmart and i was </connor>
<connor> like okay let's get some healthy food </connor>
<connor> and it was really hard to find like the </connor>
<connor> actual like </connor>
<connor> stuff yeah the actual healthy like stuff </connor>
<connor> and then i i go to the next aisle </connor>
<connor> there's a whole aisle </connor>
<connor> this blew my mind of hot dogs a whole </connor>
<connor> isle of hot dogs not sausages </connor>
<connor> hot dogs and i was like this is insane i </connor>
<connor> thought there was only one type of hot </connor>
<connor> dog </connor>
<connor> i didn't realize that hot dogs were any </connor>
<connor> different from each other because they </connor>
<connor> all taste the same </connor>
<connor> hot dogs never taste any different do </connor>
<connor> you ever notice it when you go to your </connor>
<connor> friend's barbecue or whatever </connor>
<connor> and they give you a hot dog have you </connor>
<connor> ever been like wow this tastes different </connor>
<connor> from my hot dog </connor>
<joey> no no it's always like i put mustard on </joey>
<connor> it but yeah that's how you differentiate </connor>
<connor> it they all taste a [ __ ] sense i mean </connor>
<connor> it's all the different like </connor>
<connor> brands yeah and somehow they had like 10 </connor>
<connor> rows </connor>
<connor> on a whole aisle of hot dogs i was i was </connor>
<connor> blown away i was like this is insane </connor>
<garnt> i mean i think like like there is </garnt>
<connor> difference in like sometimes it's like </connor>
<connor> filled with cheese and sometimes </connor>
<connor> don't do that i don't like that really </connor>
<joey> no i like that </joey>
<garnt> no no no no no because because this is i </garnt>
<garnt> like it because this is because </garnt>
<garnt> because this is american cheese we're </garnt>
<connor> talking about yeah that's not real </connor>
<connor> cheese </connor>
<connor> if it was if it was filled with actual </connor>
<joey> like real cheese then yeah i'd be a </joey>
<connor> little more i'm pissed off that they've </connor>
<joey> managed to infiltrate </joey>
<joey> japan somehow this is whenever you get </joey>
<joey> anything with cheese on top of it here </joey>
<garnt> it's such a gamble whether it's </garnt>
<connor> americans like </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] [ __ ] americans see this is </joey>
<connor> the advantage of not putting </connor>
<connor> condiments in everything i can actually </connor>
<connor> i can actually taste the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> difference between a normal hot dog and </connor>
<joey> a cheese hot dog and like </joey>
<joey> yes because that is an important life </joey>
<garnt> skill isn't it </garnt>
<joey> yes i i know i can't differentiate </joey>
<garnt> between 10 different brands </garnt>
<garnt> that's why if you just put condiments on </garnt>
<garnt> it all the time then it just tastes like </garnt>
<garnt> the condiments right you don't </garnt>
<garnt> you don't get to taste the sausages in a </garnt>
<joey> different way do you think we're like </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] drowning out </joey>
<garnt> hot dogs and sauce honestly it looks </garnt>
<connor> kind of looks like it a lot of the times </connor>
<connor> this is christ i just if i gave you five </connor>
<connor> brands of generic hot dogs would you be </connor>
<connor> able to tell the difference between any </connor>
<connor> of them because i wouldn't be able to </connor>
<connor> uh that just sounds like a trash chase </connor>
<garnt> special anime i mean i'm not that big of </garnt>
<connor> a fan of hot dogs but </connor>
<joey> i mean i can what is like a food that </joey>
<joey> you could like if we gave you like </joey>
<joey> different types of it </joey>
<joey> that you'd be able to differentiate </joey>
<joey> not tap water i can i can differentiate </joey>
<connor> between tap water and like </connor>
<connor> normal water but not like everyone can </connor>
<connor> not say like </connor>
<connor> voss water i i don't understand why what </connor>
<connor> the </connor>
<connor> never heard of [ __ ] water it's like it's </connor>
<connor> like the really really posh water that </connor>
<joey> comes in a glass bottle </joey>
<joey> um you can see it on screen now and it's </joey>
<joey> only like the really high class hotels </joey>
<joey> and i've like i've sampled one before </joey>
<garnt> i remember because it was like i was </garnt>
<garnt> really really thirsty and it was the </garnt>
<garnt> only </garnt>
<garnt> it was it was the only water available </garnt>
<garnt> and um it just tastes like </garnt>
<connor> there is no difference between the </connor>
<connor> bottled water brands i'm convinced </connor>
<connor> and then when you watch how they half of </connor>
<connor> them [ __ ] get their water half of it </connor>
<connor> comes from the same [ __ ] place which </connor>
<connor> is just </connor>
<connor> the normal taps that all the people are </connor>
<joey> using in the area oh dude you know </joey>
<connor> what's the one type of person that i'll </connor>
<connor> never be friends with </connor>
<connor> when someone will take a sip of water </connor>
<connor> and being like oh this is hard water can </connor>
<connor> i get some soft water please </connor>
<connor> that i knew people like that i know </connor>
<joey> people like that in california </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] hate you i knew someone who </connor>
<connor> could only drink uh </connor>
<joey> a brand of humber which brand it was </joey>
<connor> made with avionics they literally </connor>
<connor> refused to use any other water and if </connor>
<connor> they used </connor>
<connor> boiled water like in like cup noodles </connor>
<connor> had to be boiled </connor>
<connor> evion can you believe this yo but i </connor>
<connor> don't i don't know man i i i don't like </connor>
<connor> tap water like i i i </connor>
<connor> i i have gone through a phase where i'm </connor>
<connor> getting laundry </connor>
<connor> on youtube and then this is what happens </connor>
<joey> man he's like only everyone for me </joey>
<joey> well i mean because is tap water </joey>
<garnt> drinkable in the uk yeah yeah it's </garnt>
<garnt> drinkable in the uk right where i live </garnt>
<garnt> i've grown up where everywhere i've </garnt>
<garnt> lived in my life tap water has </garnt>
<garnt> sucked and i've heard about this </garnt>
<garnt> mythical good tap water that people </garnt>
<joey> talk about sometimes conor's one of </joey>
<joey> those people comes australia bro we have </joey>
<connor> great tap water i i've i've always had </connor>
<connor> like shitty taps it depends because like </connor>
<connor> if you get it from a choir to me this </connor>
<connor> this clearly tastes like tap water </connor>
<connor> because like if i can taste </connor>
<connor> the sink in tap water then then it's </connor>
<connor> it's like </connor>
<connor> inferior water for me i don't want to </connor>
<connor> taste i don't want to taste something </connor>
<connor> metallic i don't want to </connor>
<connor> sometimes i i get the hard water thing </connor>
<connor> because sometimes i drink tap water and </connor>
<connor> i'm like i feel more dehy </connor>
<connor> i feel even more dehydrated than </connor>
<connor> when when i first drank this water this </connor>

<garnt> inside thank you to raid for sponsoring </garnt>
<garnt> this video </garnt>
<garnt> i i feel like the the best time to </garnt>
<garnt> like really judge how good water is is </garnt>
<garnt> when you're hungover </garnt>
<garnt> because when i'm hungover there are </garnt>
<garnt> definitely different levels </garnt>
<garnt> i feel different levels of hydration </garnt>
<garnt> when i'm hungover because i need </garnt>
<garnt> i when you're feeling like [ __ ] and you </garnt>
<garnt> just want to feel hydrated again </garnt>
<garnt> that's when like i i i will stick by the </garnt>
<garnt> bottled water </garnt>
<garnt> every time over tap water i mean i'll </garnt>
<connor> take tap water </connor>
<connor> i just drink a liter a liter of whatever </connor>
<joey> is near me oh dude like if if i'm </joey>
<joey> like if depending on how hungover i am </joey>
<connor> i'll [ __ ] drink a liter of toilet </connor>
<connor> water like any anything to just get yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah no that's what i'm saying that's </joey>
<connor> what i'm saying </connor>
<connor> right it's like it's like you ever like </connor>
<connor> turn your bidet on and go </connor>
<connor> i have seen a japanese youtuber do that </connor>
<connor> before oh </connor>
<connor> god and the world wasn't it didn't go it </connor>
<connor> didn't go out well </connor>
<connor> but yeah i don't know i guess maybe it's </connor>
<connor> because at least in sydney like out </connor>
<connor> it's like bottled water is almost </connor>
<connor> non-existent in sydney because </connor>
<connor> legitimately the tap water is just as </connor>
<connor> good as the bottled water </connor>
<connor> right and also bottled water in </connor>
<connor> australia is [ __ ] expensive it's like </connor>
<joey> you a bottle like that big is like </joey>
<connor> four dollars i only buy bottled water </connor>
<connor> because i'm out and i </connor>
<connor> can't just find a tap to drink well i </connor>
<joey> mean here right </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah no here like because you know </joey>
<connor> bottled water is cheap right it's like a </connor>
<connor> hundred yen </connor>
<joey> so that it's a little bit more </joey>
<joey> affordable but in australia it's if </joey>
<joey> someone was like yeah i'm just gonna go </joey>
<joey> to the woolies and buy a four-door </joey>
<connor> bottle of water what about water </connor>
<garnt> fountains do you drink from water </garnt>
<garnt> fountains </garnt>
<garnt> i mean i drink from water fountains when </garnt>
<joey> i </joey>
<joey> i feel like a lot of this has come up </joey>
<connor> from my upbringing because in thailand </connor>
<connor> you can't drink </connor>
<joey> tap water so i've i've just gotten used </joey>
<joey> to being like always blind </joey>
<connor> but like i i do genuinely think the </connor>
<connor> taste of tap water tastes like [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> where i am </connor>
<connor> right like i can taste the chalk where i </connor>
<connor> in japan </connor>
<connor> no in brighton in brighton i'm in japan </connor>
<connor> it just tastes metallic </connor>
<garnt> it tastes really metallic and i'm not a </garnt>
<connor> fan of the metallic taste i i mean i </connor>
<connor> it was nice in wales and it was kind of </connor>
<garnt> meh in london and </garnt>
<garnt> here i felt it but in london it [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> sucks yeah london i don't know but then </garnt>
<garnt> like london are you getting that like </garnt>
<garnt> cholera [ __ ] dude </garnt>
<connor> i don't trust the water in london </connor>
<connor> i mean wales is nice the quarry was </connor>
<garnt> right next to me as well no i feel like </garnt>
<garnt> because </garnt>
<garnt> i i don't know how it is in other </garnt>
<garnt> countries but everywhere i've been to </garnt>
<connor> where it's like a big city </connor>
<connor> normally i don't tap water tastes like </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] countryside </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah like if okay if you're in </connor>
<connor> hotel right and you're </connor>
<connor> and you're really thirsty do you go for </connor>
<garnt> the bathroom water </garnt>
<garnt> or do you go for the do you go for like </garnt>
<garnt> the fridge </garnt>
<connor> mini bar water well you pay for it yeah </connor>
<connor> no [ __ ] way am i paying for that one </connor>
<joey> no no i'm not paying for that no </joey>
<joey> i'm going straight to the tower no way </joey>
<garnt> no because </garnt>
<connor> that's the worst tasting water the hotel </connor>
<garnt> bathroom water is like the worst </garnt>
<connor> now dude that's where i draw the line </connor>
<connor> that's where i draw the [ __ ] line i'm </connor>
<connor> never paying for water in a hotel </connor>
<joey> are you [ __ ] kidding me that's </joey>
<connor> ridiculous it's like yeah i feel like a </connor>
<connor> hotel is the one place that should not </connor>
<joey> be allowed to charge for walls </joey>
<joey> like i mean you're already charging up </joey>
<joey> the ass to stay in though </joey>
<joey> i'm paying for a basic necessity which </joey>
<joey> is just like being somewhere and you're </joey>
<joey> gonna charge me for water </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] off yeah in a way i mean for me i i </joey>
<joey> genuinely can't taste the [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> difference anyway so if i'm like shout </connor>
<connor> out to the hotels that give you bottled </connor>
<garnt> water for free </garnt>
<garnt> yeah shout out to the you are the real </garnt>
<garnt> g's yeah so i don't have to [ __ ] go </garnt>
<connor> through your voss water and not like </connor>
<connor> just one bottle they give you like four </connor>
<connor> and they're like go ham man like we fill </connor>
<joey> them all every day the best is like when </joey>
<garnt> you come back from a day out and the </garnt>
<joey> bottles are like bad yeah yeah </joey>
<garnt> yeah that's the good [ __ ] on the topic </garnt>
<garnt> of food so with it being christmas right </garnt>
<garnt> now and everyone's just had </garnt>
<garnt> their christmas meals and everything </garnt>
<garnt> like that what uh </garnt>
<connor> what are your what are your preferences </connor>
<connor> in your christmas meals </connor>
<connor> because i i'll be honest like so so last </connor>
<connor> year we all celebrated christmas </connor>
<connor> together </connor>
<connor> and we had a hot pot and yeah about the </connor>
<connor> traditional </connor>
<connor> it was it was a great [ __ ] hot pot </connor>
<garnt> but i ain't gonna lie </garnt>
<garnt> it just it just just felt like something </garnt>
<connor> was missing yeah it's not that's not the </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] turkey and whatever chicken </connor>
<connor> okay i i will say this i think turvie's </connor>
<joey> turkey's overrated as [ __ ] man </joey>
<joey> i don't i don't understand the hype </joey>
<joey> behind turkey turkey </joey>
<joey> i i think turkey is just like an </joey>
<garnt> inferior chicken it is it is right </garnt>
<garnt> like imagine chicken but just drier with </garnt>
<garnt> less taste that's just turkey like i </garnt>
<garnt> don't understand </garnt>
<joey> why all the holidays you know what it is </joey>
<joey> it's someone who just got a turkey and </joey>
<joey> just went into photoshop and did this </joey>
<joey> it's like everything is thinner it's </joey>
<connor> just bigger i think if you have like a </connor>
<connor> real nice turkey like that's been like </connor>
<connor> seasoned well </connor>
<garnt> you it's i think it could be no because </garnt>
<garnt> like the problem with turkey is that if </garnt>
<garnt> even if it's seasoned well right </garnt>
<garnt> you get you get the outer part and </garnt>
<garnt> that's nice and seasoned but then you </garnt>
<garnt> get to the inner [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> triangle that's why you gotta cook it </connor>
<connor> you're going to cut it in a way where </connor>
<connor> you get like the skin and the meat in </connor>
<joey> the same bite but you can do that with </joey>
<joey> chicken </joey>
<connor> yeah but with less price yeah yeah but i </connor>
<connor> feel like you can make a turkey like </connor>
<joey> skin taste better than chicken </joey>
<joey> i don't know it depends welling agrees </joey>
<joey> and you know maybe yeah but melanie's </joey>
<joey> american </joey>
<joey> okay so if you don't like turkey then do </joey>
<connor> you like any other meats because </connor>
<connor> sometimes my family used to do like </connor>
<joey> duck or ham oh my my dad would make like </joey>
<joey> a roast ham yeah like </joey>
<connor> i thought rice pork right i think </connor>
<connor> genuinely like pork is the best for like </connor>
<connor> christmas i know it's turkey's the </connor>
<joey> traditional and chickens like the backup </joey>
<joey> but i think we never did turkey at home </joey>
<joey> really i think a good [ __ ] ham is </joey>
<connor> just like </connor>
<joey> you can't beat that [ __ ] yeah wait </joey>
<garnt> define what you mean by ham do you mean </garnt>
<joey> like roast </joey>
<joey> pork or like we we did like uh we did </joey>
<joey> like a lego hand </joey>
<garnt> you could do either like because i don't </garnt>
<garnt> really like ham </garnt>
<connor> like like roast ham because i don't like </connor>
<connor> anything this is [ __ ] meant like </connor>
<connor> anything </connor>
<garnt> i know like what's wrong with that like </garnt>
<connor> kind of like a gammon steak </connor>
<connor> kind of like that yeah it could be </connor>
<connor> because i i'm like </connor>
<connor> i'm like not a fan of gammon that's just </connor>
<connor> like the inferior part </connor>
<connor> it's amazing it's literally it is </connor>
<connor> literally the opposite it is literally </connor>
<connor> the more expensive bacon </connor>
<joey> like that's literally what gammon is </joey>
<joey> i've never heard what is a gammon </joey>
<connor> gammon's like a way more like a meatiest </connor>
<connor> uh cut of the the pig oh that's normally </connor>
<connor> more expensive than because bacon is the </connor>
<connor> cheapest part of the pizza right right </connor>
<connor> right and it's [ __ ] and gammon's like </connor>
<garnt> the actual bacon's the best part of the </garnt>
<connor> pig </connor>
<connor> thank you very much you've been [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> brainwashed gone like you think that </connor>
<connor> bacon stuff that's how are you gonna </connor>
<connor> argue argue </connor>
<connor> that bacon is not the best part of the </connor>
<garnt> pit it's the most overrated part of the </garnt>
<joey> pig </joey>
<connor> bacon bacon used to be like the [ __ ] i </connor>
<garnt> literally know </garnt>
<garnt> i literally know vegetarians who have </garnt>
<garnt> been converted to meat eaters because of </garnt>
<connor> bacon </connor>
<connor> i think it's just it's the meme right </connor>
<connor> everyone says bacon is like the best </connor>
<garnt> food right it's because americans put </garnt>
<garnt> bacon with everything </garnt>
<garnt> it's because the smell of bacon there </garnt>
<garnt> there is nothing that can like match </garnt>
<connor> this i </connor>
<connor> just think bacon is like it's it's not </connor>
<connor> that great like it just kind of tastes </connor>
<joey> okay just give me like a nice piece of </joey>
<connor> pork especially the american bacon [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> you </connor>
<garnt> talking about american bacon is american </garnt>
<garnt> bacon is the best bacon it's [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> awful it's the best bacon like stop </joey>
<garnt> clapping man </garnt>
<joey> british back bacon is like the worst </joey>
<connor> bacon it's the best way to have bacon </connor>
<joey> like no i just don't have bacon because </joey>
<connor> right normal bacon is like 50 to 70 like </connor>
<connor> the american one like fat it's more fat </connor>
<garnt> than yeah that i'm not saying it's </garnt>
<garnt> healthy </garnt>
<connor> but i'm saying it tastes [ __ ] bad it </connor>
<connor> doesn't taste good like fat inherently </connor>
<garnt> just tastes like [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> the meat is the best part no no no no no </garnt>
<joey> there's no reason why it's more </joey>
<connor> expensive one thing the one thing i </connor>
<connor> don't like about bacon is that it is </connor>
<connor> way too overpowering especially when you </connor>
<connor> put it with other things like </connor>
<connor> if you have like a if you have like say </connor>
<connor> like you put bacon on a burger for </connor>
<connor> instance </connor>
<connor> a lot of people love that [ __ ] right </connor>
<connor> yeah but for me when bacon is on a </connor>
<connor> burger all i taste is the [ __ ] bacon </connor>
<connor> like i'd rather just ha i rather just </connor>
<connor> replace everything with bacon it'll </connor>
<joey> taste the same it's like it's like the </joey>
<garnt> nicest </garnt>
<garnt> that you need </garnt>
<garnt> i like making my burger because i don't </garnt>
<garnt> need any ketchup or mayo or [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> whatever my burger </connor>
<connor> you don't know sauce whatsoever on your </connor>
<connor> burger no you're [ __ ] clown </connor>
<connor> actually like that's probably why he </connor>
<joey> likes turkeys as well because it's like </joey>
<connor> the driest [ __ ] bird </connor>
<connor> it is like water this water that yeah </connor>
<connor> i want my bacon to be all fat just give </connor>
<joey> me the [ __ ] give me the driest </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] burger </joey>
<connor> and non tap literally streaky bacon </connor>
<joey> is like more and beyond the better bacon </joey>
<connor> what the [ __ ] is street </connor>
<connor> streaky bacon is the american bacon so </connor>
<garnt> like i didn't know how </garnt>
<connor> like because whenever americans british </connor>
<connor> bacon is similar to </connor>
<garnt> a canadian that's the way they say </garnt>
<garnt> what's it yeah to america </garnt>
<joey> british bacon is just like half so so </joey>
<joey> british bacon is more like it's like 80 </joey>
<joey> to 90 percent bacon right </joey>
<joey> there's like 10 fat on the edge yeah </joey>
<joey> it's like a thicker right yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<connor> and like as a kid i i would hate british </connor>
<connor> bacon because i would just like </connor>
<connor> i would just like eat the bacon pass </connor>
<connor> first and then like </connor>
<connor> save all the fatty part for later </connor>
<connor> because that was the best tasting </connor>
<connor> fat on its own and you're actually </connor>
<connor> disgusting because it wasn't even safe </connor>
<connor> it wasn't the fat part it was the fat </connor>
<connor> with like the little piece of meat in </connor>
<garnt> there and then i realized that </garnt>
<garnt> american bacon is just all that see </garnt>
<garnt> american bacon is just like the best </garnt>
<garnt> part of the bacon </garnt>
<connor> because actually like we actually had a </connor>
<connor> podcast where you were arguing about </connor>
<connor> food and then you sit here and tell me </connor>
<connor> you just want to eat fat </connor>
<connor> like you just want fat and i should give </connor>
<joey> a </joey>
<connor> and this man doesn't eat the crust on a </connor>
<connor> pizza right it's like it's like the </connor>
<joey> fatty part of a bacon is literally the </joey>
<joey> equivalent of how you've labeled a crust </joey>
<garnt> on a pizza no it's the [ __ ] opposite </garnt>
<garnt> because the crust and the pizza tastes </garnt>
<garnt> like nothing </garnt>
<garnt> and the the most tastiest part of the </garnt>
<garnt> bacon is the fatty part </garnt>
<connor> that's why americans have figured out </connor>
<connor> the the best tasting part of the bacon </connor>
<connor> because they've just taken the streaky </connor>
<connor> bacon </connor>
<connor> which is the the most tastiest part and </connor>
<connor> they put it all in one </connor>
<joey> put it all in one </joey>
<connor> because if it's just if it's just the </connor>
<connor> bacon part like i've talked about this </connor>
<connor> the bacon part </connor>
<connor> is just to me like pork is just vanilla </connor>
<garnt> vanilla beef we've talked about this and </garnt>
<garnt> like the only part that's better </garnt>
<garnt> is the fatty part of the pores like pork </garnt>
<garnt> belly pork belly tastes [ __ ] great </garnt>
<joey> and that's mostly fat </joey>
<joey> you got to eat okay okay i admit pork </joey>
<joey> belly's [ __ ] bomb yeah yeah that's </joey>
<connor> because it's like this </connor>
<connor> is cooked differently yeah yeah and it's </connor>
<connor> also not a very like cheap part yeah </connor>
<joey> bacon is enhanced </joey>
<garnt> that's an expensive part of the pork </garnt>
<connor> it's no it's because of the fat </connor>
<connor> it's because it's because of the fatty </connor>
<connor> content that's what gives it the flavor </connor>
<garnt> yeah but if you just eat the pork </garnt>
<garnt> but pork by itself i think it's a shelly </garnt>
<connor> flavor with more meat added yeah so you </connor>
<garnt> get chunks where you get a bit like half </garnt>
<garnt> meat </garnt>
<garnt> and half fat right but that's like an </garnt>
<garnt> actual like richness to it because it's </garnt>
<connor> chunky it's like an actual like black i </connor>
<connor> just don't [ __ ] with the taste of bacon </connor>
<connor> and normally pork belly is </connor>
<connor> not like on its own it's normally </connor>
<joey> included it's like in a broth or </joey>
<connor> something where it's like bacon it's </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<joey> you can have it with other things but </joey>
<connor> again it just overpowers everything no </connor>
<connor> one makes a [ __ ] broth out of bacon </connor>
<connor> like that's just disgusting because it's </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] someone in america is like um </joey>
<connor> excuse me </connor>
<garnt> someone's try that out please when we </garnt>
<garnt> spoke about the food episode and we got </garnt>
<connor> really heated </connor>
<connor> like day or two after joe was like you </connor>
<connor> know what i can't i think you're right </connor>
<connor> about paul </connor>
<joey> yeah no i i thought about it because in </joey>
<connor> the food episode i agreed with gone and </connor>
<connor> said like our beef is like the best </connor>
<joey> but then i thought i'm like no wait you </joey>
<connor> can't cut so much with pork konkatsu </connor>
<connor> all you can do with beef is have a steak </connor>
<connor> it's so [ __ ] yeah like maybe you can </connor>
<connor> make a burger at the be </connor>
<connor> it's literally so limited pork you could </connor>
<connor> every single amazing dish you can think </connor>
<connor> about that normally has meat </connor>
<joey> is normally i'm talking about i'm gonna </joey>
<joey> finish jump over to the other side of </joey>
<connor> the fans here and say portland </connor>
<connor> and the fact that the fact that you </connor>
<connor> because the fact that you say that you </connor>
<connor> like streaky bacon over like actual meat </connor>
<connor> just says the reason why you can't </connor>
<connor> appreciate pork just </connor>
<connor> i rest my case your pork just tastes </connor>
<connor> like well done </connor>
<connor> well done beef and as we all as we all </connor>
<connor> know </connor>
<connor> nobody nobody [ __ ] likes well done </connor>
<connor> beef this man did this guys </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] texture did he make did this man </garnt>
<garnt> just say that </garnt>
<connor> i'm getting a call right now it's from </connor>
<connor> the circus they want it they want to </connor>
<joey> know your address bro like what the </joey>
<connor> what what you're not a clown you're the </connor>
<joey> entire circus it tastes nothing like </joey>
<garnt> beef what are you on about because the </garnt>
<garnt> good the [ __ ] best part of beef </garnt>
<garnt> is like the moisture and like it's </garnt>
<joey> next next you'll be saying oh duck is </joey>
<connor> just a fatty chicken </connor>
<connor> that's all it is man it's like it's the </connor>
<connor> same thing right </connor>
<connor> how can you say that that's they're not </connor>
<connor> even remotely similar my god </connor>
<connor> i've never ever even the consistency of </connor>
<connor> the bite is totally different too </connor>
<joey> every chef who was watching this episode </joey>
<connor> just had a stroke anyone who was in your </connor>
<connor> corner probably realizes how much of a </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] clown you are </connor>
<connor> nah nah i'm i'm i'm sticky in my corner </connor>
<connor> beef is superior to pork this </connor>
<connor> except for is bacon is the most superior </connor>
<connor> part </connor>
<connor> out here i will [ __ ] with bacon every </connor>
<connor> day of my life god's out here literally </connor>
<connor> arguing he's [ __ ] like kiddie meal </connor>
<connor> preferences and food pretending he's at </connor>
<connor> the gourmet table like get out of here </connor>
<connor> man come on get the [ __ ] out of here oh </connor>
<joey> my god </joey>
<connor> yeah everybody go anyway go back to </connor>
<garnt> christmas meals they're going back to </garnt>
<garnt> christmas meals </garnt>
<connor> um i used to [ __ ] hate christmas </connor>
<connor> meals because my my parents used to make </connor>
<connor> they honestly they probably still do </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] awful gravy it's like jelly </garnt>
<connor> ew yeah i feel like christmas meals </connor>
<garnt> live and die by the quality of gravy </garnt>
<connor> it's true because </connor>
<connor> i i used to eat all of the components on </connor>
<connor> their own yeah because i i refuse to eat </connor>
<connor> my parents gravy and the whole family </connor>
<connor> was like what's wrong connor why are you </connor>
<joey> doing it </joey>
<joey> it tastes good what do you mean i'm like </joey>
<joey> no the kfc gravy although not great </joey>
<joey> tastes better than this [ __ ] it's the </joey>
<joey> consistency anything that's jelly i </joey>
<connor> don't like </connor>
<joey> okay there's there's like a perfect </joey>
<connor> noodle right because if it's too jelly </connor>
<connor> it's it's basically like a solid it </connor>
<connor> should be </connor>
<connor> nothing more depressing than watery </connor>
<connor> gravy you know right you when you pour </connor>
<connor> that [ __ ] in if it splashes it's </connor>
<connor> it's too yeah like it needs to like mold </connor>
<connor> but not be like jelly like yeah </connor>
<joey> i'm calling you out mom i get a question </joey>
<joey> there for you guys do you guys like </joey>

<garnt> i have exactly the same </garnt>
<garnt> opinions about easter egg chocolates i </garnt>

<connor> gonna be a kid again because i had one </connor>
<connor> in like three years </connor>
<joey> yeah and i ate it and i'm like wow this </joey>
<joey> is just [ __ ] like this is [ __ ] and so i </joey>
<joey> just ate it all in one go i </joey>
<joey> i put them all out on like december 5th </joey>
<joey> i grabbed them all out put them in my </joey>
<joey> hands </joey>
<joey> you guys have the ones where you're like </joey>
<joey> you kind of like it like cracks out like </joey>
<connor> a medicine </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah yeah yeah but it's okay </connor>
<connor> getting back to easter chocolate right </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> i think it's cause you're a kid because </connor>
<connor> i you know when you're a kid right did </connor>
<connor> they have these in australia where they </connor>
<connor> had </connor>
<connor> so in the uk they have the standard like </connor>
<connor> one dollar two dollar yeah </connor>
<connor> eggs right maybe you get a chocolate bar </connor>
<connor> as well yeah right </connor>
<joey> but when you're a kid you'd always see </joey>
<joey> the big egg right i'm talking like </joey>
<joey> like 30 40 egg that was like giant </joey>
<connor> and i feel like the magic is lost when </connor>
<connor> you know you can buy it </connor>
<connor> because i my parents my parents were </connor>
<connor> never gonna buy me </connor>
<connor> the thirty dollar they would never buy </connor>
<connor> me more than one x i'm like yeah you </connor>
<connor> don't need more than that </connor>
<connor> that's ridiculous like and so when i was </connor>
<connor> like two years ago i bought the big egg </connor>
<connor> right but it was reduced </connor>
<connor> for like 10 bucks yeah and i had i think </connor>
<connor> it was going to be [ __ ] like god tier </connor>
<connor> experience </connor>
<garnt> came with its own shitty mug and two </garnt>
<garnt> chocolate bars it was just [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> shitty chocolate </garnt>
<garnt> it was just it was awful i was like wow </garnt>
<garnt> i'm the opposite and then i realized </garnt>
<connor> when i put all this chocolate down it </connor>
<connor> was like 300 grams of chocolate </connor>
<connor> and i could have bought like inside hole </connor>
<joey> alright </joey>
<connor> for them to put it in a [ __ ] mold and </connor>
<connor> just [ __ ] sear it together you </connor>
<garnt> kidding me because the thing is </garnt>
<garnt> logically my mind knows this but every </garnt>
<garnt> time it's </garnt>
<garnt> easter like even as an adult like now </garnt>
<garnt> that i am an </garnt>
<garnt> adult i just buy one i eat it on the </garnt>
<garnt> same day which </garnt>
<garnt> which is what something i could never do </garnt>
<garnt> before and then like the next day i i'm </garnt>
<garnt> in my local tescos or something i'm like </garnt>
<garnt> i go for another easter egg i can do it </garnt>
<garnt> and the thing is </garnt>
<garnt> crack another one and the thing is i </garnt>
<garnt> always buy like the cadburys ones so </garnt>
<garnt> they always have like the the chocolate </garnt>
<garnt> so it's always like cadbury's buttons or </garnt>
<garnt> something and i know </garnt>
<garnt> like i can taste that it's exactly the </garnt>
<garnt> same chocolate i don't know something </garnt>
<garnt> about it's </garnt>
<garnt> something about easter eggs it's just </garnt>
<garnt> like the right thickness it's just </garnt>
<garnt> it's just something about eating an </garnt>
<garnt> easter egg that just makes you feel like </garnt>
<joey> a king </joey>
<joey> i i actually prefer the ones that were </joey>
<joey> like shaped out like a rabbit </joey>
<connor> yeah those are pretty good yeah those </connor>
<connor> are good </connor>
<connor> ones those ones like thick as well yeah </connor>
<garnt> something </garnt>
<garnt> maybe it's not just easter eggs </garnt>
<garnt> something about eating hollow chocolates </garnt>
<garnt> that just </garnt>
<garnt> like just hit different in my mind i </garnt>
<garnt> don't know </garnt>
<garnt> i don't know why i don't know about that </garnt>
<garnt> one she i don't i don't know what is </garnt>
<garnt> wrong with my psychology to be like </garnt>
<garnt> chocolate bar get that [ __ ] away </garnt>
<garnt> hollow chocolate oh okay let me let me </garnt>
<connor> nibble on this </connor>
<connor> i'm i'm curious is there uh the do you </connor>
<connor> have a worst or best christmas present </connor>
<joey> you've ever received </joey>
<joey> oh god the the best one i received i i </joey>
<joey> feel like </joey>
<joey> the younger you were the better your </joey>
<connor> christmas presents 100 </connor>
<connor> dude back when i could like just get </connor>
<connor> like a bunch of shitty toys that lasted </connor>
<joey> ten minutes </joey>
<joey> like what the probably best christmas </joey>
<garnt> gift i ever got was i got a game boy </garnt>
<garnt> advance </garnt>
<garnt> oh [ __ ] yeah when i was like five and i </garnt>
<garnt> played like the shitty like kirby port </garnt>
<garnt> that was like the snes game which i </garnt>
<joey> found out ages ago it was like five </joey>
<joey> dollar game </joey>
<joey> this is amazing father thank you yeah </joey>
<connor> probably the best present i've </connor>
<connor> ever got was an n64 and i i think it was </connor>
<connor> more the experience around it because </connor>
<connor> uh so i was at my cousin's house and i </connor>
<joey> opened it </joey>
<joey> like remember when game consoles were </joey>
<connor> like the gods here of </connor>
<connor> anything you could yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah you know your parents loved you </joey>
<connor> when they got you a game person right </connor>
<joey> it's like i feel truly loved because </joey>
<connor> thank you mother and father i remember </connor>
<connor> my parents got me when i was i don't </connor>
<connor> know </connor>
<joey> i don't know when that came out you know </joey>
<connor> when the wii was like impossible to get </connor>
<joey> yeah or something yeah </joey>
<joey> and it was just impossible to get well </joey>
<joey> they were like all sold out in the uk </joey>
<connor> but my dad worked in germany for like </connor>
<connor> most of my life </connor>
<connor> so when he came back for christmas he </connor>
<connor> brought me it and i was like oh my holy </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] how did you get a wii </connor>
<connor> and then as we went to plug in on </connor>
<connor> christmas day yeah couldn't [ __ ] plug </connor>
<connor> it in because he had the german </connor>
<connor> block and then because like my dad </connor>
<connor> obviously just forgot to buy one right </connor>
<connor> and i </connor>
<connor> remember booting it up and it being like </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> the thing like controller warning </connor>
<connor> i was like </connor>
<connor> [Music] </connor>
<connor> or something i'm like what is this dad </connor>
<connor> dad that helped me and my dad can't </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] speak german so he was like i </connor>
<connor> don't know son what are we doing i don't </connor>
<connor> know </connor>
<connor> like i [ __ ] had wii sports but like </connor>
<garnt> and there's some other sports i had some </garnt>
<garnt> game and the title was </garnt>
<connor> german i remember i was like so [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> confused as a kid i was like what the </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> is this i think i got the wii for </joey>
<joey> christmas as well actually now i think </joey>
<connor> about it [ __ ] was born man yeah </connor>
<connor> but you know what ended up happening </connor>
<connor> because it was when we sports was like </connor>
<connor> insane </connor>
<connor> the the the day we got up working which </connor>
<connor> was next day we we sport i couldn't </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] play it because all my [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> like older relatives are playing like we </connor>
<connor> bowling drunk </connor>
<connor> when am i gonna play zelda what the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> this is my gift what the [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> and yeah god god no because i just </garnt>
<garnt> remember my </garnt>
<garnt> my like one of my best memories of the </garnt>
<garnt> n64 was just the first time i boost up </garnt>
<garnt> goldeneye with my cousins and it was i </garnt>
<garnt> think that was my first proper like </garnt>
<garnt> multiplayer experience because like whoa </garnt>
<connor> four people can play at the same time </connor>
<connor> and we can play together and at that </connor>
<connor> time like that was [ __ ] mind-blowing </connor>
<connor> because the best four-player game back </connor>
<connor> then was probably like [ __ ] bomberman </connor>
<connor> or something like that mario party maybe </connor>
<joey> no because mario party wasn't out there </joey>
<joey> was it no yeah because the first one was </joey>
<connor> on n64 yeah yeah it's just one's on your </connor>
<connor> phone </connor>
<connor> um i remember we stayed up till like 4 </connor>
<garnt> 00 a.m which back when i was a kid was </garnt>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> always </joey>
<garnt> those endorphins are firing off oh yeah </garnt>
<connor> oh my god dude i don't really get that </connor>
<garnt> anymore </garnt>
<garnt> because you can afford everything now </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i guess so right it's like doing a </garnt>
<connor> pint of cocaine </connor>
<connor> like seeing the ps like seeing the ps5 </connor>
<connor> i'm like i know if i get it i'll play </connor>
<connor> like demon souls and be like yeah i mean </connor>
<connor> sure like yeah yeah because the jump </connor>
<connor> isn't that significant </connor>
<connor> ps4 games can load twenty percent faster </connor>
<connor> now yeah </connor>
<connor> epic man oh wow really exciting yeah </connor>
<garnt> like like going from like a snes to an </garnt>
<connor> n64 it's like </connor>
<connor> whoa you [ __ ] kidding me i can walk </connor>
<garnt> in any direction </garnt>
<garnt> what up is forward </garnt>
<connor> what is this analog stick the cancer </connor>
<connor> that is the [ __ ] n64 controller i </connor>
<connor> love it look at i look at that thing now </connor>
<joey> i look at that thing now and i'm just </joey>
<joey> like how did anyone think this was a </joey>
<connor> good idea </connor>
<connor> i love picking it up still i'm being </connor>
<connor> like god damn you ugly son of a [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> i i i feel it again and i put my thumb </garnt>
<garnt> on like the analog stick and i'm just </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> how is it this [ __ ] hard like this is </garnt>
<garnt> designed to give blistered how did this </garnt>
<joey> pass the ergonomics test </joey>
<joey> yeah the moment i like put the thing </joey>
<joey> like put my thumb on the joystick my </joey>
<joey> palm just starts to hurt i'm just like </joey>
<joey> the memories of blistered palms doing </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] this on my </connor>
<connor> party too yeah you could get gloves from </connor>
<joey> uh nintendo yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah because they lost a lawsuit yeah </joey>
<connor> because of that mario party won because </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah calm injuries yes oh yeah yeah my </connor>
<connor> my destroyed </connor>
<garnt> the first day on the job they just took </garnt>
<garnt> like an ergonomics book and just set on </garnt>
<garnt> fire </garnt>
<garnt> okay we're designing the n64 controller </garnt>
<connor> now guys is it fun </connor>
<connor> put it in man i remember as well that </connor>
<connor> same christmas when we got the wii </connor>
<connor> my older brother got like uh not the </connor>
<connor> death star what's the other big </connor>
<joey> battleship in star wars the one that's </joey>
<joey> like a [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> like that oh the the yeah something like </joey>
<joey> that </joey>
<connor> and then he built it all and for some </connor>
<connor> reason had the amazing idea to put it </connor>
<connor> near the tv in front of where we were </connor>
<connor> with the wii and yeah i'm sure you can </connor>
<connor> imagine what happened </connor>
<connor> oh yeah he [ __ ] hit the roof someone </connor>
<connor> did the bowling through it slammed the </connor>
<connor> roof smashed down and destroyed this </connor>
<connor> thing did he spend like eight hours </connor>
<connor> building </connor>
<connor> it was so funny i'll never forget that </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] watching watching my dad playing </joey>
<connor> wii sports is probably the funniest </connor>
<connor> thing i've ever seen in my life because </connor>
<connor> boomers get so into it oh dude like he </connor>
<connor> was so </connor>
<connor> into [ __ ] wii boxing as well it's </connor>
<connor> like of all </connor>
<connor> of all the ones it was the [ __ ] joke </connor>
<joey> and oh my god just watching my dad just </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] doing this for like two hours </joey>
<connor> it's just oh </connor>
<connor> so funny man i remember one christmas i </connor>
<connor> don't know how old i was </connor>
<connor> so i was in sunday school mm-hmm and i </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] hated sunday school because why </connor>
<connor> why the [ __ ] would i want to go to like </connor>
<connor> i i to as well when you're like eight </connor>
<connor> i didn't understand why i cared about </connor>
<connor> why i should care about </connor>
<connor> jesus and [ __ ] right to me i was like </connor>
<connor> who is this guy and why do i care </connor>
<garnt> right yeah or or who is this guy who's </garnt>
<garnt> man </garnt>
<garnt> who's the big j man that everyone keeps </garnt>
<connor> talking about man and so </connor>
<connor> i i remember this i [ __ ] hated it my </connor>
<connor> parents for some reason </connor>
<connor> because my parents right they i not to </connor>
<connor> out my parents here right but </connor>
<connor> they they wanted they said they were </connor>
<connor> religious my parents are [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> they just wanted to be real yeah it's </connor>
<connor> literally like i feel like the white </connor>
<connor> suburban family it's like we're yeah </connor>
<connor> we believe in jesus yeah we love j-man </connor>
<connor> yeah we love him man we're all </connor>
<connor> you know my you know whatever and i'm </connor>
<connor> like we don't [ __ ] release you're </connor>
<connor> just like </connor>
<connor> you know i actually yes my mom and dad </connor>
<connor> was last time when they went to church </connor>
<connor> and it's like </connor>
<connor> how many decades 1972 right so they put </connor>
<connor> me they had the genius idea to put all </connor>
<connor> of me and my brothers in sunday school </connor>
<connor> and my older brother he never complains </connor>
<connor> about stuff he just gets on with it </connor>
<connor> right right and </connor>
<garnt> me you know me i like to complain okay </garnt>
<garnt> before before we get into your story </garnt>
<connor> okay what is sunday school oh do you </connor>
<joey> don't know okay true </joey>
<joey> it's like a church school right so yeah </joey>
<connor> it's like i mean it's in america as well </connor>
<connor> i think it's more popular in america but </connor>
<connor> in the </connor>
<connor> uk as well it's normally like christian </connor>
<connor> stuff or catholic or whatever what'd you </connor>
<garnt> learn in sunday school i've </garnt>
<connor> because i've never been to san diego </connor>
<connor> jesus i i just know </connor>
<connor> about sunday school so i think i was too </connor>
<connor> young to do like the super religious </connor>
<connor> stuff </connor>
<connor> so 90 of the time they just spoke about </connor>
<connor> like religious they would tell stories </connor>
<connor> and i'm being like who the [ __ ] cares </connor>
<connor> and also i remember coloring in so many </connor>
<connor> pictures </connor>
<connor> so many [ __ ] pictures and i remember </connor>
<connor> when did you have like a jesus coloring </connor>
<connor> book yeah we had like a jesus coloring </connor>
<connor> page and i [ __ ] hated it because i </connor>
<connor> was like </connor>
<connor> i was like who is this guy why do i care </connor>
<connor> why am i coloring this guy </connor>
<connor> this is the fifth time we've colored in </connor>
<connor> his birth do we really need to keep </connor>
<connor> coloring </connor>
<connor> i do remember being like and also one </connor>
<connor> time and it was </connor>
<connor> you know i'd watch tv shows you know </connor>
<connor> american cartoons and they had like the </connor>
<connor> paddling balls </connor>
<connor> and i have this very very vivid memory </connor>
<connor> yeah one time one of the kids bringing </connor>
<connor> in the paddling balls and it was like </connor>
<connor> the coolest [ __ ] thing yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah and they immediately took it away </connor>
<joey> from him and i was like no </joey>
<joey> i want to play with the paddling ball </joey>
<joey> why did i take away from him i don't </joey>
<joey> know because it's jesus time </joey>
<joey> no one interrupts jesus and they made us </joey>
<connor> do like a play at christmas when i was </connor>
<joey> like eight or nine </joey>
<joey> oh well of like the birth of jesus yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah i </joey>
<connor> and i remember being like mom you're one </connor>
<connor> of the wise men yeah i was one of the </connor>
<garnt> wiser </garnt>
<garnt> oh man you got you got a you got a big </garnt>
<connor> role i was the snowman </connor>
<connor> but i think it was because that was </connor>
<connor> literally what i did </connor>
<connor> i i i literally just did this on stage </connor>
<connor> my mom still has pictures being like </connor>
<garnt> great performance </garnt>
<garnt> great performance i think i was one of </garnt>
<garnt> the wise men only because </garnt>
<connor> i there wasn't enough kids to fill the </connor>
<connor> other world </connor>
<connor> because there wasn't enough kids in this </connor>
<connor> school i i hated it i remember and then </connor>
<connor> also i was like why do i have to have my </connor>
<connor> mom </connor>
<connor> he's got gold i want gold that's </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] and i didn't know how to say </connor>
<connor> murr at the time when i was a kid </connor>
<connor> gold i know gold mother come on give me </connor>
<connor> it </connor>
<connor> and i remember we had to do this shitty </connor>
<connor> play and i was like i hate this so much </connor>
<connor> i hit it </connor>
<connor> and so for one christmas i asked my mom </connor>
<joey> i was like she was like what do you want </joey>
<joey> for christmas </joey>
<connor> i did i slipped her in the eyes and i </connor>
<connor> was like i don't care about gifts just </connor>
<connor> please don't make me go to sunday school </connor>
<connor> i i want my sundays back mom i'm going </connor>
<connor> to school five days a week </connor>
<connor> and then another day after turn up and </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] color pictures of jesus </connor>
<joey> are you kidding me i hate this [ __ ] and </joey>
<joey> i think honestly that's the reason why i </joey>
<connor> just care for like zero religion now </connor>
<joey> right because they pushed it so heavily </joey>
<connor> on me and i'm like this is [ __ ] it's all </connor>
<connor> a bunch of nonsense yeah yeah yeah we're </connor>
<connor> reading book stories about this dude who </connor>
<connor> i don't give a [ __ ] about like there's </connor>
<joey> no concept </joey>
<joey> so you went to you went to a catholic </joey>
<connor> school as well no it wasn't it wasn't a </connor>
<connor> catholic school but they did make us </connor>
<joey> pray </joey>
<joey> three times a day wait so what what so </joey>
<connor> in wales like a lot of schools should </connor>
<connor> make you pray </connor>
<connor> oh because it's just like a religious </connor>
<joey> culture even if it's like an atheist </joey>
<connor> like school </connor>
<connor> there's no atheist school it's just like </connor>
<connor> it's a school and a lot of them have </connor>
<garnt> like it's just a school yeah in my </garnt>
<connor> uh secondary school and my primary </connor>
<connor> school i think you pray three times a </connor>
<connor> day </connor>
<connor> oh wow but the thing is right that you </connor>
<connor> realize </connor>
<connor> maybe like in high school you're like oh </connor>
<connor> they can't they won't they don't tell </connor>
<connor> you off </connor>
<connor> if you don't pray because they can't </connor>
<connor> right because it's a religious thing but </connor>
<connor> it's a school </connor>
<joey> it's still like a school rule well no </joey>
<connor> it's like a school suggestion it's like </connor>
<connor> a cult right because </connor>
<connor> when you get in this thing right you go </connor>
<connor> to school and then everyone suddenly </connor>
<connor> bows their head and starts [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> speaking in tongues right they're like </connor>
<connor> oh [ __ ] okay i should probably join in </connor>
<connor> on this </connor>
<connor> left out but then you realize after all </connor>
<connor> oh </connor>
<connor> they're not going to do anything if i </connor>
<connor> don't pray and just stand there and look </connor>
<connor> around and be like what's going on you </connor>
<connor> see </connor>
<connor> all the other kids and so i would i </connor>
<connor> would just refuse to do it eventually </connor>
<connor> because i'm like i'm not praying </connor>
<connor> even this nonsense all right i don't </connor>
<connor> understand why they made us do it </connor>
<joey> because we weren't a religious that's </joey>
<joey> the thing it's like i i find that a bit </joey>
<joey> weird because it would make sense if you </joey>
<joey> went to like a christian school or </joey>
<connor> catholic school </connor>
<connor> it might have been like i it wasn't </connor>
<connor> officially a christian school but i </connor>
<connor> think a lot of the schools in wales were </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<garnt> christian or something i i think just a </garnt>
<connor> lot of schools in england are like that </connor>
<connor> yeah anyway because uh i like i don't </connor>
<connor> think i went to a catholic or religious </connor>
<connor> but we still had to like we still did </connor>
<connor> religious things around christmas time </connor>
<connor> and i know i had no idea what the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> was going on yeah [ __ ] because like i i </connor>
<connor> come from a buddhist family </connor>
<connor> so like we'd have events in the church </connor>
<connor> and stuff like this </connor>
<connor> i'm like what this is this isn't the </connor>
<connor> temple what is this </connor>
<connor> god we've just like sing like welsh </connor>
<garnt> hymns and they're like the [ __ ] worst </garnt>
<garnt> thing i i had to sing hymns as well i </garnt>
<garnt> had </garnt>
<garnt> no idea what they were what they were no </garnt>
<connor> there was one and like it was called </connor>
<connor> like dwarven men </connor>
<connor> [Music] </connor>
<connor> so every time they would like because </connor>
<connor> there was a sheet of twelve hymns and </connor>
<connor> they would never do </connor>
<connor> draw never men because everyone would </connor>
<connor> always like </connor>
<connor> look at each other and giggle and </connor>
<connor> because like the chorus was just </connor>
<connor> shouting like </connor>
<connor> like loudly daughter men like </connor>
<connor> they would never pick it because </connor>
<connor> everyone would just start screaming [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> on my head </connor>
<connor> in welsh because they found it because </connor>
<connor> they're all [ __ ] kids </connor>
<connor> and every time they'd pick it it was </connor>
<joey> like a [ __ ] event because every all </joey>
<joey> the kids it was the one time where all </joey>
<joey> the kids who didn't really sing and go </joey>
<connor> in and </connor>
<joey> would start would proudly say like boys </joey>
<connor> in queue right </connor>
<joey> yeah that's weird because like i went to </joey>
<joey> my high school was like a catholic </joey>
<connor> school </connor>
<connor> even though i'm not catholic personally </connor>
<connor> but like we didn't even have to do like </connor>
<connor> the whole like praying thing like we </connor>
<connor> would have to do you know maybe like a </connor>
<connor> like a like an end of uh end of term </connor>
<garnt> mass or like a beginning of term masses </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah that's like </garnt>
<joey> bring on the new year but yeah we never </joey>
<connor> had to do anything i i did it was one of </connor>
<connor> those things that when you left you're </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<garnt> that was weird wasn't it that was that </garnt>
<garnt> was weird that they made us pray </garnt>
<garnt> we would like pray before every meal and </garnt>
<garnt> stuff like that yeah like that's a bit </garnt>
<garnt> weird </garnt>
<garnt> yeah it is weird what's up with that </garnt>
<garnt> whales man come on and eventually my </garnt>
<garnt> parents did </garnt>
<garnt> grab my christmas wish and oh really oh </garnt>
<joey> really got you out of there because i </joey>
<garnt> literally </garnt>
<garnt> at what age at what age [ __ ] it was </garnt>
<connor> before i started secondary school so it </connor>
<connor> must have been </connor>
<joey> how long were you in there for uh i </joey>
<joey> think like two or three years please </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] sound like a prison </connor>
<garnt> i don't know what you're in there how </garnt>
<connor> are you in oh i literally readjusted </connor>
<connor> this society now </connor>
<connor> the amount of times i was like mom i i </connor>
<connor> cannot i know you think that's just me </connor>
<connor> being a [ __ ] kid but i [ __ ] hate </connor>
<connor> this </connor>
<garnt> please please take me out of this </garnt>
<garnt> honestly as a kid </garnt>
<garnt> like anything religious was just the </garnt>
<garnt> most boring thing for me like i remember </garnt>
<garnt> whenever my mom would take me to temples </garnt>
<connor> and everything to go like pray and like </connor>
<connor> talk to the monk and everything and </connor>
<connor> like i i just wanted to go home and play </connor>
<connor> in 64. honestly yeah yeah like i'm just </connor>
<connor> like this </connor>
<connor> what's fun to do here there is literally </connor>
<connor> nothing fun to do here </connor>
<connor> in this religious place this is why like </connor>
<connor> when you see like those uh </connor>
<connor> families who like their kids just get </connor>
<connor> like indoctrinated into the </connor>
<connor> indoctrination of something like </connor>
<connor> raised into the i think it's </connor>
<connor> indoctrinated in doctor i think so </connor>
<garnt> like they call like they're super </garnt>
<garnt> religious people right because i </garnt>
<connor> remember even when i was like eight and </connor>
<connor> i would hear these things like </connor>
<connor> he turned wine into water and i remember </connor>
<connor> being like it's all like diddy though </connor>
<connor> i've never seen anyone do that um </connor>
<connor> actually </connor>
<connor> same thing with santa claus like my </connor>
<connor> parents would try and tell me at like </connor>
<connor> age 10 that santa was real i'm like i'm </connor>
<connor> not having any of that come on </connor>
<garnt> come on reindeers i can fly come on </garnt>
<garnt> that's the question at what age did you </garnt>
<garnt> figure out that spoilers alert uh santa </garnt>
<connor> isn't real </connor>
<connor> oh dude i i've like went on like a like </connor>
<connor> an </connor>
<joey> operation at like midnight to like find </joey>
<joey> out </joey>
<joey> like the stealth music to prove to them </joey>
<connor> that i knew </connor>
<connor> what they were doing and i found out i i </connor>
<joey> found out accidentally </joey>
<connor> because i think i was maybe like 10 or </connor>
<connor> 11 </connor>
<connor> and it was christmas night and i was </connor>
<connor> like [ __ ] i really need to pee i drank </connor>
<connor> too much </connor>
<connor> whatever and i got up in the middle of </connor>
<connor> the night my dad was like </connor>
<joey> this next to the tree and he just caught </joey>
<joey> me right handed and he's like </joey>
<garnt> all right son it's time you found out </garnt>
<garnt> it's time it's time it's time you knew </garnt>
<connor> the truth you got me kid </connor>
<connor> i i think i i know where because you </connor>
<connor> know i i </connor>
<connor> i did like a thorough sweep of the house </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<joey> but you know a few days before i'm like </joey>
<joey> yeah there'll be presents here if you </joey>
<garnt> know </garnt>
<joey> yeah my theory is correct my hypothesis </joey>
<connor> couldn't find any presence in the house </connor>
<connor> and i was like </connor>
<connor> they must be hidden in the garage so i </connor>
<connor> was like all right i'll wait i'll wait </connor>
<connor> till </connor>
<connor> till midnight and on christmas until </connor>
<connor> they bring them in and uh </connor>
<connor> as a i slept right it was like covert </connor>
<garnt> ops just pretending to sleep </garnt>
<connor> my parents came in to check while </connor>
<garnt> sleeping yeah and i i wasn't </garnt>
<garnt> all right so i don't remember the exact </garnt>
<garnt> age i found out like santa wasn't real </garnt>
<garnt> but i remember as a kid i was like the </garnt>
<garnt> smartest dumb kid in existence because i </garnt>
<garnt> i </garnt>
<connor> i was i would like be figuring out all </connor>
<connor> these like logistics of how santa </connor>
<connor> could be able to send these presents </connor>
<connor> around because there would be there </connor>
<connor> would be years </connor>
<connor> where you know i wouldn't be at home so </connor>
<connor> i'd be like </connor>
<connor> how's santa gonna figure out i ain't </connor>
<connor> hungry </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so so so so </connor>
<connor> like we'd be saying at my cousin's house </connor>
<connor> right and the presents would still be </connor>
<connor> there even though we were staying at my </connor>
<connor> cousin's house no matter where we were </connor>
<connor> every year </connor>
<connor> and for some reason it just didn't click </connor>
<connor> to me as a kid </connor>
<connor> that santa wasn't real but but like </connor>
<connor> instead of just </connor>
<connor> realizing that santa wasn't real i was </connor>
<connor> in my head i was like </connor>
<connor> i was like yo so this is how santa knew </connor>
<connor> i was staying here so we went to our </connor>
<connor> house </connor>
<connor> didn't see i was there saw like the note </connor>
<connor> that i left </connor>
<connor> somewhere or saw like the phone call </connor>
<connor> that i had with my cousin </connor>
<connor> that we were coming around to his house </connor>
<connor> right so that's how santa knew that i </connor>
<connor> was staying around my cousin's house </connor>
<connor> and i explained this to my parents at </connor>
<connor> the time my parents were just like </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah you you figured it out you got </garnt>
<joey> it you figured it out you've just </joey>
<connor> started he's smiling yeah you have like </connor>
<connor> the white ball with like the pins on it </connor>
<connor> does he operate my time zones like how </connor>
<joey> does how does it work </joey>
<joey> yeah oh [ __ ] hell i think i just </joey>
<connor> remember being like damn none of this </connor>
<connor> jesus stuff seemed to have happened </connor>
<connor> when i was 10 i was like i don't know if </connor>
<connor> this center starts real because not none </connor>
<connor> of this other shit's happening i want i </connor>
<joey> can't try wine </joey>
<joey> did you ever do like that i think it's </joey>
<connor> just like an american thing but did you </connor>
<garnt> ever leave like the the cookies </garnt>
<connor> oh yeah we did milk really yeah we </connor>
<connor> didn't do that yeah i didn't do that </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> i think so my dad just wanted food i saw </connor>
<connor> this brilliant uh reddit post stuff like </connor>
<connor> of like a dad being like so my son's </connor>
<joey> left uh </joey>
<joey> cookies and milk uh on on his bedside </joey>
<joey> table but </joey>
<joey> how do i tell him that santa is lactose </joey>
<joey> intolerant </joey>
<joey> like do i just drink the milk and take </joey>
<joey> the shits for my son well do i leave it </joey>
<joey> there and break his heart </joey>
<connor> i remember one time my dad was like no </connor>
<connor> no no connor santa likes beer </connor>
<joey> i'm definitely doing that to my child oh </joey>
<connor> my god </connor>
<connor> so he legit poured beer for himself and </connor>
<connor> then she drank it obviously you </connor>
<joey> bought a cold one for himself i'm just </joey>
<joey> going to be to my side i'm like did you </joey>
<joey> know that santa </joey>
<connor> loves gina santa likes a an espresso </connor>
<joey> martini </joey>
<joey> leave a gin and tonic and maybe a cheese </joey>
<joey> your platter will do i mean santa will </joey>
<connor> definitely eat the double of course </connor>
<garnt> double shot santa doesn't like cookies </garnt>
<joey> like brownies but like the special </joey>
<joey> yeah the special brownies give santa the </joey>
<joey> special kind of special brownies that </joey>
<garnt> that'll do </garnt>
<connor> because he knows that we'd believe it </connor>
<connor> like i i i believed that it wasn't real </connor>
<connor> but i also was like maybe a little bit </connor>
<connor> there's a chance that someone's drinking </connor>
<joey> this </joey>
<joey> well i mean santa is a grown adult you </joey>
<connor> know he might he's working hard </connor>
<connor> driving and drinking but i mean </connor>
<garnt> that's okay so like </garnt>
<connor> question to you guys do you normally </connor>
<connor> have like a normal like what's yours </connor>
<connor> what's your christmas day like what's </connor>
<garnt> your typical christmas day </garnt>
<garnt> like do you have any schedules do you </garnt>
<connor> have any like </connor>
<connor> used uh used to have uh you know you'd </connor>
<connor> open presents first thing which is </connor>
<connor> always the best part yeah pretty much </connor>
<connor> goes downhill from there </connor>
<connor> um do you remember the age where you </connor>
<connor> just couldn't sleep before christmas </connor>
<connor> and then as a teenager you're just like </connor>
<garnt> dude like i've </garnt>
<connor> well but i don't care about this you </connor>
<connor> know you realize uh when you were like i </connor>
<connor> don't know </connor>
<garnt> did you always used to pick a lot of </garnt>
<garnt> things and you would get some of them or </garnt>
<garnt> did you get everything that you picked </garnt>
<garnt> i would get some of them because my </garnt>
<connor> parents would also be like listen connor </connor>
<connor> santa's got a budget and i was like </connor>
<connor> really </connor>
<connor> so then i had to like look for the </connor>
<connor> product within the budget right right </connor>
<connor> and then i never connected the dots you </connor>
<connor> know from age like eight or whatever but </connor>
<garnt> i would i would go through like </garnt>
<garnt> we had a thing called like argos yeah </garnt>
<garnt> argos </garnt>
<garnt> what's that it's like a they had like a </garnt>
<connor> giant like [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> gigantic booklet imagine the most </connor>
<connor> depressing store you can think of you go </connor>
<connor> you go into this store right yeah and </connor>
<connor> it's not a store it's just a store of </connor>
<joey> catalogues </joey>
<joey> so imagine like amazon imagine if amazon </joey>
<garnt> imagine the amazon warehouse but it </garnt>
<connor> would have like an amazon irl yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah you would go and you could book it </connor>
<connor> online or back then you had to go to the </connor>
<garnt> store and </garnt>
<joey> take off the boxes you wanted yeah </joey>
<garnt> according to like the catalogue that's </garnt>
<joey> depressing </joey>
<connor> yeah it was but you know because the </connor>
<connor> cats as a kid though this [ __ ] was </connor>
<connor> magical because it had like everything </connor>
<connor> in it yeah so you would go through and </connor>
<connor> and you know adult now you realize this </connor>
<connor> was just [ __ ] overpriced </connor>
<connor> but you know back then there was no </connor>
<connor> amazon so you're like fitting it in the </connor>
<garnt> budget </garnt>
<garnt> yeah because how you go through it is </garnt>
<garnt> because back back in the day you didn't </garnt>
<connor> have like </connor>
<connor> you didn't really have the internet so </connor>
<connor> you'd have to order off this catalog so </connor>
<connor> you're going to this </connor>
<connor> arg or store and there was this catalog </connor>
<connor> that was like as thick as a brick you </connor>
<connor> could [ __ ] murder someone with this </connor>
<connor> with this catalog right so your phone </connor>
<connor> you'd go in and you'd flip to like the </connor>
<connor> index </connor>
<connor> so you could go usually </connor>
<connor> [Music] </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah yeah yeah and and so you flip </connor>
<connor> through the index and go through like </connor>
<connor> the game sections and the toy sections </connor>
<garnt> which was like which which was the only </garnt>
<garnt> sections you really looked at all right </garnt>
<garnt> um and then you it was just like free </garnt>
<connor> pickings basically i never i never had </connor>
<connor> anything and then basically like </connor>
<connor> you know when i turned up christmas </connor>
<connor> morning there would be a few surprises </connor>
<connor> but most of the stuff that i wanted </connor>
<connor> would be there </connor>
<connor> except that one time like i said in the </connor>
<connor> cow said [ __ ] dad bought me </connor>
<connor> qriket tickets clearly </connor>
<connor> clearly expressed my disdain for cricket </connor>
<connor> but i thought i thought this is going to </connor>
<joey> change </joey>
<joey> genuinely like other than the game boy </joey>
<joey> advance i genuinely don't remember what </joey>
<joey> else i got as a as </joey>
<joey> for like from santa one christmas i just </joey>
<connor> got like all yu-gi-oh </connor>
<connor> like i got like a [ __ ] jewel arm </connor>
<connor> thing and i got like oh you got one of </connor>
<connor> those </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah i got one all my friends have </joey>
<connor> got one as well jealous we would turn up </connor>
<joey> to school and we would play yukio but </joey>
<joey> then they just stopped playing after </joey>
<joey> they realized </joey>
<connor> i guess santa didn't have the budget for </connor>
<joey> that for me </joey>
<connor> i feel like i asked for one year but i </connor>
<connor> just didn't get it i mean i feel like i </connor>
<connor> was like </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] this look she doesn't need that </connor>
<joey> yeah it's like i think he just got me </joey>
<connor> like a bunch of booster packs </connor>
<connor> here's the graveyard and the fold-out </connor>
<connor> thing in the back of the booster pack </connor>
<garnt> yeah he'll be all right i remember for </garnt>
<garnt> me it was always video games i never </garnt>
<connor> asked for anything but video games and </connor>
<connor> that was because </connor>
<connor> as a kid there were only two times in </connor>
<connor> the year when i could get new video </connor>
<connor> games right </connor>
<garnt> and one of them was my birthday and the </garnt>
<garnt> other one was christmas yeah it was a </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> rare occasion if i managed to get a game </connor>
<garnt> yeah on my birthday or christmas yeah </garnt>
<garnt> exactly </garnt>
<garnt> yeah so i remember it it was like the </garnt>
<garnt> highlight of my year because i'd be like </garnt>
<garnt> finally i can play something other than </garnt>
<connor> super mario 64 for like this </connor>
<connor> like millionth time and so i but i </connor>
<connor> couldn't get every game so i know </connor>
<connor> i normally get like two if i if it was </connor>
<connor> like a [ __ ] special yeah yeah it was </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> i knew my parents loved me when i got </connor>
<garnt> three videos yeah three games was like </garnt>
<connor> the limit for me is yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<garnt> that's like a hundred hundred quid 120 </garnt>
<garnt> pounds yeah yeah yeah pushing it </garnt>
<garnt> yeah so i mean that's that's probably </garnt>
<joey> why i will always remember the n64 </joey>
<joey> because the n64 was just like like god </joey>
<joey> mode yeah </joey>
<garnt> like i had never gotten a bigger present </garnt>
<connor> in my life at that moment yeah now that </connor>
<connor> you say that i think i remember why i </connor>
<connor> wanted to like why i kept doing like </connor>
<connor> chess stuff and being good at </connor>
<connor> things because my parents buy me [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> if i wanted things they would buy me </connor>
<joey> stuff so i should just win the stuff </joey>
<joey> that i'm good at and they'll keep buying </joey>
<joey> me things </joey>
<joey> because whenever i like win a tournament </joey>
<connor> or whatever they'd go and buy me a game </connor>
<joey> and i'm like stonks let's just let's </joey>
<joey> just get good at something </joey>
<joey> i think that was me but just with like </joey>
<joey> school and like especially like japanese </joey>
<joey> for me like if i if i did well in like </joey>
<joey> my japanese tests and what not my mom </joey>
<connor> would be like yes that is my brother was </connor>
<connor> always better so it didn't matter i was </connor>
<joey> like i gotta find another niche oh fair </joey>
<garnt> enough fair enough </garnt>
<connor> do you have any family traditions at </connor>
<connor> christmas we just have like family come </connor>
<joey> over and you know </joey>

<connor> [ __ ] be away this is my time off </connor>
<connor> you're making me do work </connor>
<connor> because to me right skiing with and </connor>
<connor> snowboarding my family was like a chore </connor>
<connor> when i was a kid right because they're </connor>
<joey> so </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] slow right i i would have to </joey>
<joey> like go on a ski thing and i would just </joey>
<joey> be like </joey>
<joey> i would wait at the time come on </joey>
<joey> peasants yeah i would i would wait at </joey>
<joey> the top and i'm like just go ahead i'll </joey>
<connor> be down </connor>
<connor> i'll i'll follow you and i would wait </connor>
<connor> five minutes on my phone and then when i </connor>
<connor> was like </connor>
<connor> it's been five minutes time to go like </connor>
<connor> full speed down and yeah and like </connor>
<connor> overtake them yeah </connor>
<connor> and then i have to wait and then you </connor>
<connor> know also when you're a kid and you </connor>
<connor> don't have money </connor>
<connor> i'm [ __ ] hungry as [ __ ] and in these </connor>
<connor> results because like we would go on like </connor>
<connor> packages </connor>
<connor> right so they were pretty cheap like </connor>
<connor> nothing </connor>
<connor> bashed my pants i'm very grateful but </connor>
<garnt> they were like the cheapest possible way </garnt>
<connor> that you could go to like italy and ski </connor>
<garnt> right right which is fair enough i </garnt>
<connor> i mean i applaud the effort but when you </connor>
<connor> had to eat out at these places they like </connor>
<connor> charge a lot for like food and drinks </connor>
<connor> oh yeah so like we're getting one meal </connor>
<connor> between us all we're all going to split </connor>
<connor> it and i'm like [ __ ] mom i'm </connor>
<connor> starving like i would i would nut for </connor>
<connor> more than one-sixth of the pizza right </connor>
<connor> right right please but going now as an </connor>
<connor> adult i have my own money </connor>
<connor> i'm like i'll waste all my money on the </connor>
<garnt> food there i don't give a [ __ ] i want to </garnt>
<garnt> be full no because like these activities </garnt>
<connor> i i've realized </connor>
<connor> the reason we enjoy them so much as an </connor>
<connor> adult do you do with your friends yeah </connor>
<connor> no </connor>
<connor> no no not just that but because we can </connor>
<connor> get alcohol involved yeah </connor>
<connor> like you know what i mean like it's it's </connor>
<connor> just like going on trips and everything </connor>
<joey> it's just it's just funner with a pint </joey>
<joey> and uh like oh no i guess yeah because </joey>
<joey> what you do after you have your fun </joey>
<garnt> activity you just want to wind down </garnt>
<garnt> as a kid you have [ __ ] nothing to do </garnt>
<garnt> but as an adult you can just </garnt>
<connor> get drunk with the boys and that's yeah </connor>
<connor> i enjoy spending more time with my </connor>
<connor> family now that i'm an adult than i did </connor>
<joey> when i was a kid yeah exactly </joey>
<joey> yeah because i've i've worked at i've </joey>
<joey> had three white christmases and all </joey>
<joey> three of them have been because i was </joey>
<joey> working at a ski resort in japan </joey>
<garnt> i'd say having a white christmas in </garnt>
<garnt> australia oh no no </garnt>
<connor> that's that's the difference that's </connor>
<connor> coming that's a different type of white </connor>
<connor> christmas </connor>
<connor> but yeah like the like i had the the </connor>
<connor> whitest christmases in like ski resorts </connor>
<connor> because it's just [ __ ] white </connor>
<garnt> everywhere but like </garnt>
<garnt> the only difference between the </garnt>
<garnt> christmas night at a ski resort and </garnt>
<garnt> every other night is that </garnt>
<garnt> there's just more white people outside </garnt>
<garnt> really that's the only difference </garnt>
<garnt> because like </garnt>
<joey> because what do you do at a ski resort </joey>
<joey> other than skiing and snowboarding </joey>
<connor> you get shit-faced yeah that's the only </connor>
<connor> sauna sauna's normally a good champ yeah </connor>
<joey> or like onsen right </joey>
<joey> but like other than that it's like the </joey>
<joey> only other thing if you if you wake up </joey>
<joey> in the morning you're like oh man my </joey>
<joey> body's feeling a bit sore i don't want </joey>
<joey> to go skiing or snowboarding </joey>
<joey> there's nothing to do during the day </joey>
<joey> other than to go to the one bar that's </joey>
<joey> open 24 7 and just get [ __ ] first </joey>
<connor> and also because like [ __ ] skiing and </connor>
<joey> snowboarding is so [ __ ] exhausting oh </joey>
<joey> yeah you're like all right that [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> pint is like amazing you even been </joey>
<connor> skiing </connor>
<garnt> never been skiing i mean like </garnt>
<garnt> the the reason i've never been is just </garnt>
<garnt> because i i mean every every holiday </garnt>
<connor> we went to thailand yeah it's also one </connor>
<connor> of those things where i feel like </connor>
<connor> i don't know why my family just were </connor>
<connor> like let's just go skiing for the first </connor>
<connor> time yeah i feel like normally you go </connor>
<connor> with someone </connor>
<connor> who's been yeah so they can be like i'll </connor>
<connor> i'll help you out yeah i'll you know </connor>
<connor> like skiing yeah also you know </connor>
<connor> when i was growing up i wasn't in the </connor>
<connor> most privileged position where my family </connor>
<connor> could kind of afford that because i i </connor>
<connor> feel like </connor>
<garnt> going skiing is like an expensive </garnt>
<garnt> holiday or it can be yeah it is i mean </garnt>
<joey> because </joey>
<joey> especially if you're in the country that </joey>
<joey> doesn't have like resorts nearby exactly </joey>
<connor> right exactly </connor>
<connor> right you know what i realized this when </connor>
<connor> i started flying for like conventions </connor>
<connor> and stuff right </connor>
<connor> i was i always thought that airports </connor>
<joey> were even worse than they actually are </joey>
<joey> because right if you get one of those </joey>
<joey> package deals the </joey>
<joey> company that does the package deal </joey>
<joey> charters the plane right right so you </joey>
<joey> all have to like wait in this [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> horrible line these planes are like the </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> worst yeah and the people are the worst </connor>
<connor> as well it's like the worst kind of </connor>
<connor> british tourist </connor>
<connor> yeah which i'm sure you've all seen </connor>
<connor> videos of you watch like airport </connor>
<connor> meltdowns </connor>
<connor> it's always british people right always </connor>
<connor> dude these these [ __ ] flights are </connor>
<connor> awful man it's the most oh god you've </connor>
<garnt> been on them </garnt>
<garnt> i've i've been on okay so the most </garnt>
<garnt> depressing place i've been to </garnt>
<joey> on earth i think is luton airport oh </joey>
<joey> it's awful </joey>
<joey> or in uk in the uk yeah okay so we we </joey>
<joey> stayed okay so this </joey>
<joey> you know back back back before back when </joey>
<joey> i was just like </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] poor and all that stuff we uh </joey>
<joey> we we booked this holiday um it was it </joey>
<joey> was me it was me and sydney at the time </joey>
<joey> so we booked this holiday on this like </joey>
<joey> budget airline that flew out of luton um </joey>
<joey> and i remember to save costs we needed </joey>
<joey> to stay near luton </joey>
<joey> because it was actually cheaper to stay </joey>
<joey> near luton than to like get there in the </joey>
<joey> morning in the </joey>
<joey> like rush hour right right and so we we </joey>
<joey> picked the cheapest hotel </joey>
<joey> which happened to be easy hotel which i </joey>
<joey> didn't know </joey>
<joey> that already sounds soft okay so so in </joey>
<joey> like europe there's this </joey>
<joey> there's this budget airline called </joey>
<joey> easyjet it's the one right </joey>
<joey> and it's the worst it's one of the worst </joey>
<joey> airlines i wouldn't say it's the worst </joey>
<connor> what's the worst ryan i'd say right </connor>
<connor> orion is there both there's </connor>
<connor> two sides of this anything that flies </connor>
<connor> out luton is automatically like horrible </connor>
<connor> for me but like </connor>
<connor> um so we stay we're staying easy it's an </connor>
<connor> easy hotel and i've never felt like i've </connor>
<connor> paid to stay in a prison cell before </connor>
<connor> until i until i stayed there so it was </connor>
<connor> like we go in </connor>
<connor> and there's literally like no windows </connor>
<connor> yeah it's just it's just a white room </connor>
<connor> right </connor>
<connor> yeah no it's yeah i was just ours it's </connor>
<connor> just a black room and like the walls are </connor>
<connor> paper thin and they're like </connor>
<garnt> i could hear at least like three </garnt>
<garnt> different people [ __ ] in different </garnt>
<garnt> places you know what i mean </garnt>
<connor> and i go into the shower right that's a </connor>
<connor> shared shower right or is it </connor>
<garnt> no no no you you had your own private </garnt>
<connor> shower but it was like it was wow that's </connor>
<joey> one step </joey>
<joey> but like but like there wasn't even like </joey>
<joey> a door to like separate the shower </joey>
<joey> from like the bed okay so you so it was </joey>
<joey> it was just like curtains </joey>
<joey> so you open up these curtains and then </joey>
<joey> there is like </joey>
<joey> a toilet seat and then there is a shower </joey>
<joey> right next to it </joey>
<joey> and it just it was the like definition </joey>
<connor> of how i imagine a prison shower to be </connor>
<connor> right because the only thing said that </connor>
<connor> because </connor>
<connor> there's nothing separating the toilet </connor>
<connor> from the shower right so so you just </connor>
<connor> you're just showering </connor>
<connor> and yes and and so while you're </connor>
<connor> showering the toilet's just like </connor>
<connor> getting [ __ ] soaked yeah and </connor>
<connor> everything like that and it's it's got </connor>
<connor> like the gray </connor>
<connor> kind of like kind of like floor as well </connor>
<connor> so it </connor>
<connor> it felt like i was in a prison cell yes </connor>
<garnt> and </garnt>
<garnt> i i had to pay good money how much was </garnt>
<joey> it for like </joey>
<joey> a night i can't remember like 20 quid a </joey>
<joey> night oh [ __ ] hell </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah i would have rather say </connor>
<joey> like i just like i it was just like me </joey>
<connor> and sydney there but i was like </connor>
<garnt> i better not drop the soap man i better </garnt>
<connor> not drop the soap while i'm here </connor>
<connor> some dude just burst through the walls </connor>
<connor> like yeah </connor>
<joey> right ryanair and easyjet if you like </joey>
<joey> forget your ticket they charge you like </joey>
<joey> 50 euros </joey>
<joey> i i got charged that when we flew from </joey>
<garnt> uh [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> amsterdam to ireland i gotta charge that </garnt>
<garnt> as well did you yeah </garnt>
<joey> i wanna i've never wanted to smack an </joey>
<joey> attendant in my life but when she said </joey>
<joey> that i was like </joey>
<connor> my hand is my backhand is ready yeah and </connor>
<connor> like if you have like over like five </connor>
<connor> kilograms or something which is like </connor>
<joey> what you're obviously going to have over </joey>
<connor> yeah they charge you like 50 pounds to </connor>
<connor> bring a carry-on </connor>
<garnt> it's ridiculous it's so dumb it's it's </garnt>
<connor> awful daddy because it's right in this </connor>
<joey> fine print where </joey>
<joey> they they tell you you can't check in </joey>
<joey> right yeah and i think that's the big </joey>
<joey> one i like i i </joey>
<joey> can i understand you know not not having </joey>
<joey> like not be able to check in </joey>
<joey> or everything but like putting it in </joey>
<joey> like the fine prints </joey>
<joey> that's just a dick move yeah it is it is </joey>
<garnt> like what what is it like [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> designs yeah </garnt>
<connor> that is that is it that is i they have </connor>
<connor> like a million ads </connor>
<connor> before you even get to you know what you </connor>
<connor> want to like get to like </connor>
<connor> the amount of [ __ ] renter cars they </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] try and show you is up the ass </connor>
<connor> online </connor>
<connor> and also yeah and also even if the plane </connor>
<connor> is completely empty they won't let you </connor>
<connor> choose seats and they on purpose scatter </connor>
<connor> you </connor>
<connor> so that you fought they force you to pay </connor>
<connor> to sit next to each other right right </connor>
<connor> but i'm like [ __ ] that </connor>
<connor> yeah no i'm not doing that [ __ ] i don't </connor>
<connor> give a [ __ ] i'll see them when i land </connor>
<joey> who [ __ ] cares </joey>
<joey> i'm not desperate that i need to be </joey>
<joey> within a two meter radius of my friends </joey>
<joey> all the time </joey>
<joey> jesus christ we have something like we </joey>
<joey> have something similar in australia it's </joey>
<connor> called jet star </connor>
<connor> and every every [ __ ] like continent </connor>
<joey> has that ah that's so bad i </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] flew jetstar once from sydney to </joey>
<joey> brisbane and it was like an hour and a </joey>
<joey> half flight but it's the worst [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> flight i've ever been on god </connor>
<connor> like delayed three hours for no reason </connor>
<connor> and then you get there and then it's </connor>
<connor> like 60 million years for the luggage to </connor>
<connor> come out on the other side i'm just like </connor>
<joey> where where is his luggage </joey>
<joey> it's like it's like uh you've been on </joey>
<joey> norwegian you've been on norwegian i've </joey>
<connor> been i've been on </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> like compared to other budget airlines </connor>
<garnt> norwegian is like the rolls royce of </garnt>
<garnt> budget airlines man </garnt>
<connor> no it's because it's the only budget </connor>
<connor> airline there's like long haul i sure </connor>
<connor> and you can do you can have a 12 hour </connor>
<connor> flight and they will give you </connor>
<connor> no food really yeah on noise you have to </connor>
<connor> pay </connor>
<garnt> for this oh yeah yeah but like and any </garnt>
<garnt> any budget airline that has </garnt>
<garnt> movies that has a movie choice it's </garnt>
<garnt> already </garnt>
<garnt> like better than percent of the fight i </garnt>
<connor> think it only has movies because </connor>
<connor> they don't make those planes the ones </connor>
<connor> that do long haul without them built in </connor>
<connor> yeah i don't think they do that anymore </connor>
<connor> like so i don't think it's possible i'm </connor>
<connor> sure if they could have removed the tvs </connor>
<connor> and made you pay for them i'm sure they </connor>
<connor> would </connor>
<connor> but like the fact that they can they can </connor>
<connor> go 12 hours and not give you food </connor>
<joey> like blows my mind i've never been on </joey>
<joey> norwegian nail and don't that long </joey>
<garnt> yeah i mean i i'd say i've i've been on </garnt>
<connor> worse and and also it's a 12-hour flight </connor>
<connor> ride and they try and they charge you </connor>
<joey> for like a carry-on where we where the </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] were you flying to la to uk </joey>
<connor> uk and it's always norwegian because </connor>
<connor> they were by far the cheapest </connor>
<joey> you guys didn't have like american or </joey>
<connor> united are there's america yeah okay but </connor>
<garnt> they were they were more like </garnt>
<garnt> double the price also broke as [ __ ] so </garnt>
<connor> it was like either norwegian which was </connor>
<connor> pretty consistently always like 400 </connor>
<connor> bucks </connor>
<connor> yeah return yeah jesus from uh london to </connor>
<connor> l.a and then the next stop was like </connor>
<connor> united which is like 500. but back then </connor>
<connor> it was like 100 bucks i was like that's </connor>
<connor> a big deal </connor>
<garnt> like that's like a slightly better hotel </garnt>
<garnt> it wasn't 400 to 500 it was like 400 to </garnt>
<connor> 600 </connor>
<connor> 600 700. yeah i i think you got what you </connor>
<connor> paid for </connor>
<connor> um i i i think that norwegian is good </connor>
<connor> for the price </connor>
<joey> and if you're like if you're like a </joey>
<joey> someone broke </joey>
<joey> who's trying to go to like ax or </joey>
<joey> something or trying to go to la for </joey>
<joey> four years it was super serious it is </joey>
<connor> but it was just like everything you just </connor>
<connor> run the risk of you know dying of </connor>
<joey> starvation </joey>
<connor> every single time i was on the plane i </connor>
<garnt> was [ __ ] hungry just eat a [ __ ] ton </garnt>
<connor> before you get on </connor>
<connor> bring a [ __ ] ton of snacks and you'll be </connor>
<joey> good you just have to fast </joey>
<connor> the first time i didn't know i didn't </connor>
<connor> know that because i saw that you could </connor>
<connor> pay for a meal </connor>
<connor> but i was like oh they'll give you like </connor>
<connor> a snack or something yeah </connor>
<connor> nothing you'll get anything you get </connor>
<joey> nothing would you like would you like </joey>
<connor> this granola bar for </connor>
<connor> six dollars these chairs are the i don't </connor>
<connor> know how </connor>
<connor> it's like they've engineered these </connor>
<connor> chairs to be [ __ ] god-awful </connor>
<connor> like at least other airlines have </connor>
<connor> semi-competent chairs but for some </connor>
<connor> reason on norwegian airlines they'd </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> handcrafted this [ __ ] to be disgusting </connor>
<connor> and painful </connor>
<connor> and if you get in the middle row of the </connor>
<connor> four it's like just just give up on </connor>
<connor> being happy in life for the next 12 </connor>
<connor> hours </connor>
<connor> and one time i went on it and there was </connor>
<connor> a i was on the i was in the </connor>
<connor> the end the aisle seat of the three okay </connor>
<connor> well it's not the middle of the four so </connor>
<connor> i'm happy and this couple were like </connor>
<connor> making out next to me </connor>
<connor> and i'm like i swear they were fingering </connor>
<connor> each other because i was like this is </connor>
<connor> disgusting </connor>
<connor> like i wanna i wanna i wanna die please </connor>
<connor> please and no amount of like don't look </connor>
<connor> at the side could like </connor>
<connor> focus me on game of thrones season four </connor>
<connor> of the [ __ ] i was watching i was like </connor>
<joey> please </joey>
<joey> please please yeah because it's like </joey>
<joey> it's the one time you curse that you </joey>
<connor> have a periphery right yeah because the </connor>
<connor> one every time i would take my headphone </connor>
<connor> off you for a second i could hear like </connor>
<connor> oh i'm like oh god oh why </connor>
<connor> tell you what if you're gonna go on at </connor>
<connor> budget airlines just pay 300 bucks for a </connor>
<connor> good pair of noise-canceling headphones </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> honestly like that's the best advice i </connor>
<connor> can give you don't cheap out on them </connor>
<garnt> jesus christ </garnt>
<garnt> like i don't know what it is about the </garnt>
<garnt> airplane design of seats </garnt>
<garnt> that are just like ergonomically </garnt>
<garnt> designed to be the most </garnt>
<garnt> uncomfortable thing you've ever sat on </garnt>
<garnt> did you see those standing seats they </garnt>
<garnt> were trying to make </garnt>
<garnt> it's like to fit more people in they're </garnt>
<garnt> trying to make standing seats </garnt>
<connor> for airlines so that like they can fit </connor>
<garnt> more people it's basically like this </garnt>
<garnt> at this at this point what's the </garnt>
<garnt> difference between that and just being </garnt>
<garnt> cattle you know what i mean </garnt>
<garnt> like would just be literally being </garnt>
<connor> herded in </connor>
<connor> obviously was the budget airline just </connor>
<joey> trying to do this it's like [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> sardines </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah they were like we could fit 20 </connor>
<joey> more passengers in the economy if we </joey>
<joey> if we yeah but but no one wants that </joey>
<joey> yeah because no passengers </joey>
<connor> because their argument was something was </connor>
<connor> that if it's a two-hour flight you can </connor>
<joey> stand for two hours </joey>
<joey> not but no i don't want to no no no no </joey>
<joey> no it's terrible it's [ __ ] what's </joey>
<joey> that </joey>
<joey> i don't mind a one-hour flight i'm like </joey>
<connor> whatever but like when it's 12 hours </connor>
<garnt> sometimes having a bad season </garnt>
<garnt> even a prison transport system has seats </garnt>
<garnt> guys come on they do </garnt>
<joey> the prison bus you can sit down yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah come on now </joey>
<joey> it's yeah it's sad man yeah but the </joey>
<joey> point was is that yeah now that i'm </joey>
<connor> older i'm grateful that my parents took </connor>
<connor> me on </connor>
<connor> vacation but when i was a kid now i'm </connor>
<garnt> older i'm glad i have disposable income </garnt>
<connor> yeah back to the thinking back to the </connor>
<connor> broke uni student days you know what i </connor>
<connor> mean </connor>
<connor> going back to christmas did you ever </connor>
<garnt> have like </garnt>
<garnt> any christmas movies or like stuff that </garnt>
<garnt> you'd watch </garnt>
<joey> i know i never got the concept of </joey>
<garnt> christmas movies or did it holiday </garnt>
<connor> movies i don't know like my dad </connor>
<connor> is like such a [ __ ] film i hate it at </connor>
<connor> the moment he hears the word christmas </connor>
<joey> movies he's like </joey>
<connor> get a [ __ ] away from i had really i had </connor>
<connor> relationships where they would want to </connor>
<connor> watch </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] around that time they would just </connor>
<connor> be obsessed with watching the same </connor>

<joey> have like the same kind of titles it's </joey>
<joey> always the same theme of like </joey>

<joey> also wholesome and by the way the entire </joey>
<joey> soundtrack to the movie </joey>
<connor> is christmas carol i have fun every </connor>
<connor> relationship i've been in they're like </connor>

<joey> like the christmas classic </joey>
<connor> i was i was trying it's like the office </connor>
<connor> for like white people but on christmas </connor>
<joey> this is their video i was trying to </joey>
<joey> convince aki that die hard is a </joey>
<garnt> christmas movie it is </garnt>
<garnt> it is tony she did not believe me she </garnt>
<connor> was like die hard </connor>
<joey> the [ __ ] yipikaya one i'm like yes </joey>
<connor> the yipikaya one that is a christmas man </connor>
<connor> there there are two things that i know </connor>
<connor> that i will probably not get on with a </connor>
<connor> person </connor>
<connor> that if they if they say like if they </connor>
<joey> love disney movies more than like </joey>
<joey> a healthy amount or if they own a horse </joey>
<joey> those are the two reasons </joey>
<joey> there's the two ways i know i'm probably </joey>
<joey> not gonna get on with them some slightly </joey>
<joey> what is it what is it about horse speed </joey>
<connor> everyone knows [ __ ] skills are crazy </connor>
<connor> right now yeah </connor>
<connor> because they they're gonna love the </connor>
<garnt> horse especially if you're in a </garnt>
<garnt> relationship with one they're gonna love </garnt>
<garnt> the horse </garnt>
<connor> more than they ever love you yeah and </connor>
<connor> that's just like that's a fact that is </connor>
<garnt> 100 </garnt>
<garnt> horse girls are just the equivalent of </garnt>
<garnt> car dudes you know what i mean </garnt>
<joey> the honda civics in their profile </joey>
<joey> picture no no offense alexi but </joey>
<joey> no offense alexa </joey>
<garnt> no but like i don't know i i never at </garnt>
<garnt> least with us like we never got like </garnt>
<connor> especially with like halloween movies as </connor>
<connor> well it's like halloween movies </connor>
<connor> christmas movies </connor>
<connor> are there even easter movies is that a </connor>
<connor> thing they try to make that's not a </connor>
<garnt> genre </garnt>
<garnt> yeah that's that's that there shouldn't </garnt>
<garnt> be a genre of easter eggs i don't know </garnt>
<connor> christ passion of the crisis of an </connor>
<connor> easter movie </connor>
<connor> you know fun one time my best mate </connor>
<connor> his dad for his like 14th birthday got </connor>

<connor> watched [ __ ] bruno at like 15 at his </connor>
<connor> house </connor>
<joey> so confused with some of the things </joey>

<joey> like </joey>
<joey> here you go why are you gay why are you </joey>
<garnt> again </garnt>
<connor> you you are gay here's bruno he was that </connor>

<connor> yeah they're like yeah sure you can </connor>
<connor> watch porn i don't know whatever </connor>
<connor> who why are you hurting you'll get to it </connor>
<connor> eventually it's all right just just get </connor>
<connor> a head start </connor>
<connor> you'll be good sorry so [ __ ] weird </connor>
<garnt> man so weird </garnt>
<garnt> like i i i don't understand watching </garnt>
<garnt> some of the christmas movies </garnt>
<joey> but i do like the feeling of just </joey>
<joey> getting together and watching </joey>
<joey> a movie like it doesn't necessarily have </joey>
<joey> to be a christmas right that's that's </joey>
<connor> that's what i </connor>
<connor> like watching like family movies </connor>
<connor> especially on christmas my parents just </connor>
<connor> have [ __ ] taste in movies </connor>
<joey> wait what's the definition of a family </joey>
<joey> movie like a rom-com or </joey>
<garnt> i don't know i mean i showed my parents </garnt>
<connor> like wolf children with the family </connor>
<joey> oh okay that was like cool that was like </joey>
<joey> a very nice you know it was it was a </joey>
<joey> nice family </joey>
<joey> i could not get my parents to watch </joey>
<connor> costumes no no no no no this this was </connor>
<connor> something i had to like </connor>
<connor> slowly slip in the idea for years like </connor>
<connor> this is like this is like inception you </connor>
<connor> know for years to be </connor>
<connor> i would be like yeah yeah you you don't </connor>
<connor> just like </connor>
<connor> rock up in christmas and be like mom dad </connor>
<garnt> i want to show you some animated titties </garnt>
<garnt> no you go you go </garnt>
<garnt> you gotta like plant the seed to be like </garnt>
<garnt> yo there's there's some like i </garnt>
<connor> i could not get my parents to like no </connor>
<connor> matter what i do they would refuse </connor>
<joey> yeah my dad was like [ __ ] strict </joey>
<joey> about his movies because again he's a </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] film </joey>
<joey> so he's like the only anime movies that </joey>
<joey> i will like and enjoy </joey>
<joey> is akira and wicked city if it doesn't </joey>
<joey> have anime tits in it i </joey>
<connor> ain't interested because also i think to </connor>
<connor> people in the uk especially around my </connor>
<joey> parents age to them anything animated </joey>
<joey> equals for children </joey>
<joey> right like women should show them wicked </joey>
<connor> city i mean i'm sure if i did they would </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<garnt> but those are the only three movies it's </garnt>
<joey> like is it violent does it have titties </joey>
<joey> in it </joey>
<garnt> i'll watch it so there's no way it's </garnt>
<garnt> already a christmas movie though is </garnt>
<joey> there no </joey>
<joey> i i don't expect my dad to be like hey </joey>
<joey> son merry christmas let's watch wicked </joey>
<joey> city like </joey>
<joey> i don't think that's yeah i don't know </joey>
<garnt> like i i never got </garnt>
<garnt> the idea of holiday movies i just i just </garnt>
<garnt> never really </garnt>
<garnt> saw the point because because again for </garnt>
<joey> us like christmas was like a time to </joey>
<joey> like celebrate with like family like </joey>
<garnt> i mean like do you believe in the you </garnt>
<garnt> saw so called like christmas spirit and </garnt>
<connor> everything like that </connor>
<connor> what do you think um do you think i </connor>
<connor> don't know because like </connor>
<connor> it's different it's different now like </connor>
<connor> but the only the only thing that's </connor>
<connor> different now really is being a youtuber </connor>
<connor> because like my like my entire life um </connor>
<connor> up until i became a youtuber christmas </connor>
<connor> was this like special holiday because it </connor>
<joey> was a holiday </joey>
<joey> like especially if you're in like an </joey>
<joey> office job as well it was </joey>
<joey> the biggest holiday you got of the year </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah and so </joey>
<joey> i don't know it was just like it i feel </joey>
<joey> like i got programmed into thinking that </joey>
<joey> this was like </joey>
<joey> just a special holiday and even if even </joey>
<connor> if i wasn't with family you know </connor>
<connor> something like watching watching </connor>
<connor> christmas anime for me like watching </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> some of my favorite christmas anime like </connor>
<connor> the disappearance of haruhi </connor>
<connor> was just like that that's something i </connor>
<connor> could never get bored of watching yeah </connor>
<connor> near christmas day i know you love that </connor>
<joey> i know you love </joey>
<joey> yourself like i don't give a [ __ ] about </joey>
<garnt> most christmas movies but give me that </garnt>
<joey> christmas anime man </joey>
<joey> yeah like i don't know i i never i never </joey>
<joey> chopped up i i never thought </joey>
<garnt> ah i could watch it i could watch anime </garnt>
<garnt> i suppose it's weird for you because you </garnt>
<garnt> grew up in a country where it's sunny in </garnt>
<garnt> christmas you know </garnt>
<joey> every christmas movie there's no concept </joey>
<garnt> of like </garnt>
<joey> grabbing a blanket and cuddling up on </joey>
<joey> the couch to watch yeah </joey>
<connor> yeah because you'd be sweating it's just </connor>
<connor> always [ __ ] cold in the uk so it's </connor>
<connor> like all right </connor>
<joey> yeah for us it's like merry christmas </joey>
<joey> let's turn on the cricket </joey>
<connor> that was it for us right i mean i think </connor>
<connor> that as i get older i think i i </connor>
<connor> appreciate the idea of it more which is </connor>
<connor> just spending time with family </connor>
<connor> especially because </connor>
<connor> i you know my little brother lives with </connor>
<connor> my parents and my older brother doesn't </connor>
<connor> live too far away </connor>
<connor> right yeah so it's not hard for them to </connor>
<connor> go visit him but for me it's like </connor>
<connor> because i haven't seen them in over like </connor>
<connor> a year i guess when i moved to japan </connor>
<connor> and originally they were like you're </connor>
<connor> gonna come back for christmas connor </connor>
<joey> like the first christmas was like three </joey>
<joey> months after i moved here like no i just </joey>
<joey> got here </joey>
<joey> yeah i'm not coming back that i'll come </joey>
<joey> next christmas i'm gonna celebrate </joey>
<joey> christmas with the boys </joey>
<joey> i'll come next christmas psych that </joey>
<joey> never happened so yeah i've seen my </joey>
<joey> family in like over a year and a half </joey>
<joey> now </joey>
<joey> yeah is that weird i don't know no it's </joey>
<garnt> weird i mean it's weird and i'm sure you </garnt>
<joey> would have seen them </joey>
<joey> oh i would have normally yeah i've </joey>
<connor> definitely seen them oh yeah yeah we </connor>
<connor> would not be here right now if if </connor>
<joey> the regular corona yeah yeah exactly </joey>
<joey> yeah probably probably would be back but </joey>
<connor> yeah that's how it is </connor>
<connor> unfortunately yeah unfortunately i i </connor>
<joey> guess as i get older it's made me </joey>
<joey> appreciate </joey>
<joey> you know that what it is is it's an </joey>
<garnt> excuse to all right all right go and see </garnt>
<connor> my family then come on </connor>
<garnt> yeah i don't know like i remember like </garnt>
<connor> like when </connor>
<connor> as as a kid and leslie as a young adult </connor>
<connor> i'm just like who gives a [ __ ] about </connor>
<connor> tradition </connor>
<connor> who really gives about the system who </connor>
<connor> really gives about tradition and all </connor>
<connor> this stuff but like </connor>
<connor> great growing older i'm just like you </connor>
<connor> know there is something a bit special </connor>
<connor> about keeping family traditions and </connor>
<connor> doing something special and like you </connor>
<connor> know it's it's </connor>
<connor> the whole christmas spirit thing is like </connor>
<connor> cheesy and like it's cheesy and [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> like that but </connor>
<connor> i will say like doing something special </connor>
<garnt> that you do every year on christmas that </garnt>
<garnt> reminds you of </garnt>
<garnt> you know how you were as a kid and you </garnt>
<garnt> know the stuff that your parents </garnt>
<garnt> uh parents like bestowed upon you and </garnt>
<garnt> everything it's like there's there's </garnt>
<garnt> something special about that yeah </garnt>
<garnt> you appreciate i appreciate it more like </garnt>
<garnt> there was there was like i really liked </garnt>
<garnt> as a kid </garnt>
<garnt> didn't get it as a teenager and a young </garnt>
<garnt> adult and like more grown older the more </garnt>

<connor> thing yeah i also want to you know just </connor>
<connor> keep in touch with my parents obviously </connor>
<connor> and just see them as much as i can </connor>
<connor> because i just thought about i was like </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] my little kid's gonna be a little </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] if i if he's raised by me </garnt>
<garnt> yeah like he's gonna [ __ ] he's gonna </garnt>

<connor> better instill some values in him to </connor>
<connor> come back and say hi you know </connor>
<connor> i'm an old [ __ ] it's like my dad you did </connor>
<connor> the same thing </connor>
<connor> it's like no yeah because because i mean </connor>
<connor> like as a kid the the highlight of </connor>
<connor> christmas was the [ __ ] presents right </connor>
<connor> but as you grow older presents become </connor>
<garnt> like a non-factor nowadays when you can </garnt>
<garnt> just when you have a displacement </garnt>
<joey> all right give me the presents get me a </joey>
<connor> drink though right now my parents now </connor>
<connor> they're like what do i get you connor </connor>
<joey> yeah cause you know you you buy </joey>
<connor> everything you want and i'm like well </connor>
<connor> i don't know actually yeah i don't know </connor>
<connor> think of something yeah yeah </connor>
<garnt> yeah it's like money can i say money so </garnt>
<garnt> so now that </garnt>
<garnt> it's not it's not a presence they're </garnt>
<garnt> just like a non-factor you've got to </garnt>
<garnt> have something to look forward to for </garnt>
<garnt> the christmas holidays that's right </garnt>
<joey> that's true yeah </joey>
<joey> spending time with the family spending </joey>
<garnt> time with the fans spending time with </garnt>
<garnt> the boys all the boys </garnt>
<garnt> yeah to explain what we did last year in </garnt>
<connor> christmas we just uh stayed up till like </connor>
<connor> 3 a.m watching super monkey ball speed </connor>
<connor> runs and it was </connor>
<connor> was [ __ ] amazing it was good that was </connor>
<connor> amazing </connor>
<connor> can we start that tradition </connor>
<joey> get the family around the world honestly </joey>
<connor> i could i could </connor>
<connor> i could start that [ __ ] tradition man </connor>
<connor> it is good man you don't know the magic </connor>
<garnt> of super monkey ball speed runs until </garnt>
<garnt> you watch one </garnt>
<connor> dude like especially when you're drunk </connor>
<garnt> as well they're like insane like it just </garnt>
<garnt> defies gravity </garnt>
<connor> and like just enjoyment they're really </connor>
<connor> entertaining </connor>
<connor> it was super entertaining but we also </connor>
<connor> watched die hard right before that we </connor>
<connor> did watch </connor>
<connor> out oh yeah we did we actually did watch </connor>
<connor> oh we didn't watch a christmas movie </connor>
<garnt> yeah because because that was when i was </garnt>
<connor> still naive and thinking like die hard </connor>
<connor> isn't a christmas movie </connor>
<connor> and then you guys were like no no trust </connor>
<connor> us because we're eating the hot pot </connor>
<connor> right while i played </connor>
<connor> that's right yeah and then we're like </connor>
<connor> let's watch a christmas movie die hard </connor>
<joey> and then we watch something like well </joey>
<joey> you know what it's </joey>
<joey> i stand corrected this is a christmas </joey>
<connor> movie it is it is a christmas movie with </connor>
<garnt> a christmas spirit before [ __ ] bruce </garnt>
<garnt> willis just gave up on acting </garnt>
<garnt> yeah you've seen his recent films oh </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] hell they're awful really he </joey>
<joey> refuses to like do anything and he has a </joey>
<joey> double doing </joey>
<joey> everything you should watch some of them </joey>
<joey> dude watch out </joey>
<joey> hard kill watch that hard kill kill </joey>
<joey> watch that movie that sounds like a </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] die hard </joey>
<connor> i [ __ ] watched it and it's oh my </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] god because i watched looper </joey>
<garnt> and i was like i just realized the </garnt>
<garnt> absurdity of that name </garnt>
<connor> he he died kill he does like he does </connor>
<connor> like six movies a year and they're all </connor>
<garnt> like straight to dv that's like a kojima </garnt>
<connor> character you know what i mean </connor>
<joey> dude seriously watch these dudes it's </joey>
<joey> like a metal gear character right </joey>
<connor> in some of these scenes he's like given </connor>
<connor> so little [ __ ] about trying that like </connor>
<connor> it's just a dubbed over actor really </connor>
<garnt> yeah it's so lazy it's just like let's </garnt>
<garnt> take two edgy words and smash them </garnt>
<garnt> together </garnt>
<garnt> like hard death knife hard kill oh </garnt>
<connor> please </connor>
<connor> okay this christmas watching hard kill </connor>
<connor> and you can see how [ __ ] awful bruce </connor>
<connor> willis is </connor>
<joey> gonna say he's [ __ ] terrible because </joey>
<connor> i think the last bruce willis film i </connor>
<connor> watch was looper </connor>
<connor> and even then it was like i was like </connor>
<connor> dude </connor>
<connor> he's giving up you just give a [ __ ] this </connor>
<joey> guy's made his cash already like he's </joey>
<connor> just he's just did it now </connor>
<connor> why still dude you've made so much money </connor>
<garnt> just [ __ ] stop yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah that one joseph gordon-levitt was </garnt>
<garnt> like acting bruce withers was just like </garnt>
<garnt> yeah you you can do you can carry this </garnt>
<connor> one always turns up and it's just like </connor>
<connor> bruce willis </connor>
<connor> he turns up to the set and apparently </connor>
<joey> like all the things he does is like </joey>
<joey> right </joey>
<joey> he agrees to do like three days of </joey>
<joey> shooting right and that's it like no </joey>
<joey> more </joey>
<joey> no retakes really and heart anything </joey>
<joey> that physically doesn't require him </joey>
<joey> is a body double so even if it's like </joey>
<connor> getting on his knees yeah like don't you </connor>
<joey> get a bodybuilder </joey>
<joey> because he's too lazy to do it oh my god </joey>
<joey> i i did watch a uh </joey>
<joey> uh i don't know when it was pretty </joey>
<connor> recent but uh wyatt did like uh </connor>
<connor> bruce willis answers like most googled </connor>
<connor> questions he doesn't give a [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> it was one of the most boring wide </connor>
<joey> videos i'd ever seen because he he just </joey>
<joey> it was </joey>
<connor> monotone the entire thing is like </connor>
<connor> harrison ford when you when you can tell </connor>
<garnt> that he respects the movie and a </garnt>
<connor> director he [ __ ] tries like in blade </connor>
<connor> runner the new one he was [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> amazing yeah but when he when he's in </joey>
<connor> interviews he's like i don't [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> give a [ __ ] yeah but bruce willis is </joey>
<connor> always like that </connor>
<connor> like nothing makes bruce willis care </connor>
<connor> like he he literally is like the </connor>
<connor> angriest oldest [ __ ] in all of these </connor>
<connor> interviews like </connor>
<connor> you can tell he's like whatever i've </connor>
<connor> made my money i just </connor>
<connor> sat up i just turned up and said words </connor>
<connor> you know it's acting </connor>
<connor> like all right bruce willis [ __ ] out </connor>
<joey> guys could you imagine if youtubers get </joey>
<connor> to that point </connor>
<connor> i'd argue something i mean yeah i didn't </connor>
<connor> i didn't want to say </connor>
<connor> but you know some some of us uh some of </connor>
<joey> us are already there </joey>
<joey> not not us i mean there's some youtubers </joey>
<connor> already there god </connor>
<connor> i just couldn't imagine just still doing </connor>
<connor> it when i hate this like i just yeah i </connor>
<joey> like that especially if you've already </joey>
<joey> made your like [ __ ] fortunate name </joey>
<garnt> at that point you're just doing it to </garnt>
<garnt> stay relevant yeah right </garnt>
<garnt> youtubers again yeah yeah well like </garnt>
<connor> that's the thing right you don't have to </connor>
<connor> stay relevant </connor>
<connor> if you're like at the point of like </connor>
<joey> bruce wills like everyone knows your </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] name and what you look like </connor>
<connor> that's why like no okay and like no one </connor>
<connor> watches action movies and </connor>
<connor> that has like a big name to it and </connor>
<connor> that's why they get him because </connor>
<connor> they can he just makes up a lot of bank </connor>
<connor> his name has a lot of pull for action </connor>
<garnt> movies and he just doesn't give a [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> that's true that's true i mean our </connor>
<connor> action movie is even like a big thing </connor>
<connor> nowadays yeah because john wick is i </connor>
<garnt> mean like no i was </garnt>
<connor> i was gonna say like aside from john </connor>
<connor> wick but that's the thing right if you </connor>
<connor> can bring it back and you can do it well </connor>
<connor> with the right actors like it'll be huge </connor>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> you're talking about like you know ones </joey>
<joey> that aren't falling under like a </joey>
<connor> notable ip right yeah yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah but john wick like hard kills </connor>
<garnt> like john wick wasn't a notable ip until </garnt>
<joey> you know keanu reeves made it notable </joey>
<joey> when did i week one </joey>
<garnt> hard kill to me sounds like one of those </garnt>
<connor> seven years ago i don't know hard kills </connor>
<connor> to me sounds like one of those titles </connor>
<connor> where </connor>
<connor> like so when i when i was in thailand </connor>
<connor> right that i would i would always have </connor>
<connor> this </connor>
<connor> like i i would always go to like in in </connor>
<connor> like southeast asia </connor>
<connor> there's always these stores that you can </connor>
<connor> buy like pirated pirated dvds </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah yeah and you'd go through like </connor>
<connor> you'd flick through the covers and you'd </connor>
<connor> be </connor>
<joey> you'd see these like the most random </joey>
<joey> movies of these like a-list actors </joey>
<garnt> but you'd never heard of the film before </garnt>
<connor> yeah that's hardcore that is </connor>
<connor> yeah but that is also all of bruce </connor>
<connor> willis his recent filmography </connor>
<joey> it's all movies like how is this man </joey>
<connor> doing eight movies a year how does it </connor>
<joey> happen how do you have time for that </joey>
<connor> i kind of want to just like go through </connor>
<connor> his imdb now just to see like have a </connor>
<connor> look at this </connor>
<connor> it's insane and it's like you know i </connor>
<connor> think that's the reason why and like </connor>
<connor> imagine at the time people probably </connor>
<connor> didn't give a [ __ ] about action movies </connor>
<connor> until like terminator came out and </connor>
<connor> probably at that time you're like this </connor>
<connor> is this is crazy what the [ __ ] like </connor>
<connor> because i mean that's not james cameron </connor>
<garnt> directing it which i don't know like </garnt>
<connor> 80s was like a [ __ ] golden period for </connor>
<connor> action movies right right right right </connor>
<connor> because it was like the schwarzenegger </connor>
<connor> um </connor>
<connor> right claude van damme yeah i mean like </connor>
<garnt> i could i could re easily re-watch </garnt>
<garnt> right like so many of their action </garnt>
<connor> movies and that's also when like martial </connor>
<connor> arts movies also were starting to like </connor>
<garnt> kind of </garnt>
<garnt> yeah because i feel like i feel like </garnt>
<garnt> before john wick there was this </garnt>
<garnt> huge period where action movies were </garnt>
<joey> just not pulling in the numbers anymore </joey>
<joey> i'm just reading these [ __ ] titles </joey>
<joey> i've never heard of any of these yeah </joey>
<joey> because they're all straight to dvd </joey>
<joey> so we have so 2017 first kill </joey>
<joey> acts of violence death wish air strike </joey>
<joey> ten minutes gone trauma center survive </joey>
<garnt> the night </garnt>
<garnt> i don't know any of that by the way all </garnt>
<joey> of those are direct to dvd </joey>
<garnt> yeah this sounds like all of them they </garnt>
<garnt> sound like a satire of themselves </garnt>
<connor> at that point no one wants to hire him </connor>
<connor> because why would you he's just gonna </connor>
<connor> turn up and [ __ ] be lazy </connor>
<joey> and there's five movies right now that </joey>
<joey> has been announced with ximena that is </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> to be announced midnight in the </joey>
<connor> switchgrass bro we got a cosmic scene </connor>
<connor> all right we're we're watching one of </connor>
<connor> these on christmas man i got it because </connor>
<connor> they're [ __ ] awful we got to watch </connor>
<joey> him it's terrible </joey>
<joey> he's given up dude it's terrible oh my </joey>
<connor> god that's that's really stop making </connor>
<garnt> films like why it's really watch one of </garnt>
<connor> these on christmas and tell you how it </connor>
<connor> is </connor>
<connor> next time why why my god </connor>
<garnt> yeah do you boys have any plans this </garnt>
<joey> christmas like </joey>
<joey> i mean uh i i'm curious to see what this </joey>
<joey> christmas will be like </joey>
<joey> in the current world situation true this </joey>
<garnt> is probably going to be the most </garnt>
<garnt> depressing christmas of all time because </garnt>
<joey> christmas in japan </joey>
<joey> is like it's it's a bit weird because </joey>
<garnt> yeah do you want to explain what </garnt>
<joey> christmas in japan is like </joey>
<joey> yeah so essentially by kfc yeah </joey>
<garnt> basically yeah </garnt>
<joey> yeah christmas in japan is sponsored by </joey>
<garnt> kfc basically it's like </garnt>
<garnt> kfc is the go-to place how did that </garnt>
<garnt> start </garnt>
<garnt> how did that start okay it's because i </garnt>
<garnt> did a video on this a few years ago but </garnt>
<joey> basically </joey>
<joey> the theory is that colonel sanders right </joey>
<joey> looks like santa that's the theory </joey>
<joey> because think about it right think about </joey>
<connor> it christmas colors what are the </connor>
<connor> christmas colors red </connor>
<connor> yeah right yeah yeah what does colonel </connor>
<connor> sanders dressed up in red </connor>
<connor> right does it yeah it's a white suit i </connor>
<joey> thought yeah but the kfc color has </joey>
<joey> really great </joey>
<joey> and then colonel sanders is an old guy </joey>
<joey> with a white beard </joey>
<garnt> kind of looks like santa right and i bet </garnt>
<garnt> if you trace that back it's like the </garnt>
<garnt> most </garnt>
<garnt> five-head kfc employee like working in </garnt>
<joey> the marketing team it's basically it </joey>
<garnt> it's it's it was a marketing ploy by kfc </garnt>
<garnt> to be oh it was amazing yeah </garnt>
<connor> like basically yeah basically like they </connor>
<connor> were like well uh you know the christmas </connor>
<joey> dinner overseas in in in the west </joey>
<joey> is uh they have chicken yeah they have </joey>
<connor> roast chicken </connor>
<joey> fried chicken is kind of the same thing </joey>
<connor> right it's like you know it's still </connor>
<connor> chicken </connor>
<connor> yeah why don't we try this let's try one </connor>
<connor> christmas that's pretty cool we're gonna </connor>
<connor> we're gonna try and sell this hello and </connor>
<joey> it just [ __ ] exploded because </joey>
<joey> you can't get a roast chicken in japan </joey>
<connor> and also other than kfc out of </connor>
<connor> outside of some kombini's i saw this </connor>
<connor> there'd be a an employee dressed in a </connor>
<connor> santa outfit </connor>
<connor> yeah with a fried chicken like yeah </connor>
<joey> selling </joey>
<joey> fried chicken yeah yeah sell fried </joey>
<connor> chicken well they sell like cakes right </connor>
<joey> this is so [ __ ] weird what am i </joey>
<joey> looking at it's it's bizarre </joey>
<connor> looking at an asian man dressed in a </connor>
<connor> santa costume sami fried chicken in the </connor>
<connor> name of christmas </connor>
<joey> i'm like what the [ __ ] but it's also </joey>
<joey> weird as well because like normally like </joey>
<garnt> everywhere else in the west right </garnt>
<garnt> christmas is like a family thing </garnt>
<garnt> right you gather like mom and dad grab </garnt>
<joey> yourself japan it's like </joey>
<connor> a beta valentine's yeah it's a reality </connor>
<garnt> it's it's like you go on dates </garnt>
<connor> yeah you go you watch you go to the prom </connor>
<garnt> that's that's </garnt>
<joey> that's uh christmas here but that but </joey>
<joey> that part i understand </joey>
<joey> because literally a week later is uh new </joey>
<connor> year's eve right and new year's eve is </connor>
<connor> like a super like buddhist family thing </connor>
<connor> in japan </connor>
<connor> yeah so it makes sense that the opposite </connor>
<connor> of what it is in western yeah </connor>
<connor> it's like in western cultures like oh </connor>
<connor> new year's eve </connor>
<garnt> yeah let's go see you next to your </garnt>
<garnt> parents yeah so </garnt>
<garnt> i don't know i just i personally have i </garnt>
<garnt> i mean well </garnt>
<garnt> this year i plan to go up uh north to go </garnt>
<garnt> see uh chris </garnt>
<connor> um and uh we're gonna we're gonna go to </connor>
<connor> natsuki's place and have kfc </connor>
<connor> for christmas yeah that's the plan </connor>
<connor> that's the plan and i'm like man </connor>
<connor> first time ever i've been living here </connor>
<connor> five years first year i'm gonna have the </connor>
<joey> true </joey>
<joey> japanese christmas experience of eating </joey>
<joey> kfc i'll i'll let you boys know how </joey>
<joey> depressing it actually is </joey>
<garnt> but uh having because it's not like i </garnt>
<connor> remember before coming to japan </connor>
<connor> i'd heard so many rumors about japanese </connor>
<connor> kfc being like </connor>
<connor> the best kfc in the world you you ain't </connor>
<connor> tried kfc </connor>
<connor> until you had japanese kfc and then i </connor>
<garnt> came here and then i ate it </garnt>
<garnt> and then it was just kfc yeah i </garnt>
<garnt> generally think the uk one was better </garnt>
<garnt> even </garnt>
<garnt> i thought the uk one of the better menu </garnt>
<joey> it is the most meat kfc i've ever had </joey>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> man i love the burgers the chicken </connor>
<connor> sandwiches that you get in kfc they're </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] amazing oh yeah </connor>
<garnt> in the uk they're so good as well </garnt>
<garnt> honestly i don't know what it is about </garnt>
<garnt> uk or kfc's </garnt>
<joey> it's good i mean i i feel that you guys </joey>
<joey> have kind of perfected like fast food </joey>
<joey> chicken with nandos right </joey>
<connor> i mean that's like south african though </connor>
<joey> yeah originally right but we just </joey>
<joey> i think every single fast food chain in </joey>
<connor> the uk has like fried chicken </connor>
<joey> options but as a not on its own right </joey>
<connor> like mcdonald's </connor>
<joey> i think some of the most popular stuff </joey>
<garnt> they sell in the uk is like just like a </garnt>
<joey> chicken select stuff like that chicken </joey>
<joey> chicken select and also like the wrap </joey>
<garnt> chicken </garnt>
<garnt> yeah oh okay that's the best thing that </garnt>
<connor> i get yeah that stuff is good </connor>
<connor> and every like every like dirty kebab </connor>
<connor> still has like the fried chicken option </connor>
<connor> as well </connor>
<connor> so there's just fried chicken everywhere </connor>
<connor> but like yeah </connor>
<connor> i don't know like because yeah british </connor>
<garnt> is the best kfc japan is like summer in </garnt>
<garnt> the middle </garnt>
<joey> and then america's america is just like </joey>
<joey> do i want to feel like [ __ ] </joey>
<garnt> yeah kfc it is yeah i i don't know why </garnt>
<garnt> like american kfc just stopped trying </garnt>
<garnt> because it's not like america doesn't </garnt>
<garnt> have bad </garnt>
<garnt> fried chicken options it's just one of </garnt>
<garnt> their like some of their biggest chains </garnt>
<garnt> are just the worst in america </garnt>
<joey> and i don't understand why i was drunk </joey>
<connor> one time someone gave me a kfc chicken </connor>
<joey> in america yeah and even drunk me was </joey>
<joey> like this is vile </joey>
<connor> and you know it's bad if drunk me is </connor>
<connor> like this is too much i draw the line at </connor>
<connor> the amount of grease </connor>
<connor> that's on this thing yeah like the skin </connor>
<connor> wasn't crispy it was </connor>
<connor> moist from all the grease it had and i'm </connor>
<connor> like that's vile sorry we somehow </connor>
<connor> turned this all around to bashing </connor>
<connor> america i love america i do i just </connor>
<joey> what's going on now </joey>
<joey> correctly case in point chick-fil-a yeah </joey>
<garnt> chick-fil-a but </garnt>
<joey> like that's why i don't understand why </joey>
<joey> anyone in america would eat kfc when </joey>
<joey> there's like </joey>
<joey> chick-fil-a or popeyes or you never see </joey>
<joey> good reviews on google maps </joey>
<joey> or for like kfc it's always like two </joey>
<joey> stars and i'm like who's willingly </joey>
<joey> going in here stop giving them [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> customers just stop </joey>
<joey> yeah it's sunday right and chick-fil-a </joey>
<joey> is closed </joey>
<joey> yeah that's true i mean not not all </joey>
<garnt> parts of america have chick-fil-a </garnt>
<garnt> apparently </garnt>
<garnt> yeah no they don't do that east coast </garnt>
<joey> doesn't have chick-fil-a or something i </joey>
<garnt> don't know </garnt>
<joey> there's like different chains like </joey>
<connor> different areas as well i know </connor>
<joey> but all i know is kfc's the worst fried </joey>
<connor> chicken </connor>
<connor> honest honestly now i feel like </connor>
<connor> christmas for me is more of like </connor>
<connor> it's it's christmas when i spend it with </connor>
<connor> the the people right so it doesn't have </connor>
<connor> to be on christmas day </connor>
<connor> yeah just around the time you know give </connor>
<connor> or take as long as i hang out with some </connor>
<joey> friends it could be like a week a few </joey>
<connor> drinks </connor>
<joey> you know just be like just let's just do </joey>
<joey> an early christmas you know exchange a </joey>
<connor> few gifts you know </connor>
<garnt> i i i do want to do something on </garnt>
<connor> christmas because there's </connor>
<connor> i do i've i've had like christmases </connor>
<connor> where i've done nothing before </connor>
<connor> and it is a bit depressing when you're </connor>
<connor> just like by yourself or </connor>
<connor> do nothing you go in your timeline </connor>
<garnt> everyone's opening presents with each </garnt>
<garnt> other </garnt>
<connor> just like what if you're having like </connor>
<garnt> christmas day the next day with your </garnt>
<garnt> friends it's like all right whatever i'm </garnt>
<garnt> getting it </garnt>
<joey> i think it was worse is new years alone </joey>
<joey> for some reason i've had new years alone </joey>
<connor> before yeah same i have two and for some </connor>
<connor> reason it's more depressing than </connor>
<connor> christmas alone </connor>
<joey> i don't know why i spent new year's one </joey>
<joey> year in the worst [ __ ] way possible </joey>
<joey> i think i was like 16 um and i was </joey>
<joey> working up at a </joey>
<joey> ski falls the first time i was working </joey>
<joey> up at a ski field and uh </joey>
<joey> we're in the middle of hokkaido in the </joey>
<joey> mountains it's like [ __ ] minus 30 </joey>
<joey> degrees in a [ __ ] blizzard </joey>
<joey> and of course i'm working that day i'm </joey>
<joey> outside </joey>
<connor> in the [ __ ] blizzard shoveling snow </connor>
<connor> but on top of that </connor>
<connor> one of the hotels had a blocked sewage </connor>
<connor> system </connor>
<connor> and i had to get in there with a [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> shovel so imagine a 16 year old </connor>
<connor> right right in the middle of a [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> blizzard in the mountains </connor>
<connor> literally shoveling [ __ ] out of the </connor>
<connor> ground </connor>
<garnt> like happy new year like 11 p.m yeah </garnt>
<garnt> right </garnt>
<garnt> and literally the moment we've unclogged </garnt>
<connor> the thing my boss was like </connor>
<connor> oh the oh it's the next year yeah happy </connor>
<connor> new year </connor>
<connor> oh yeah we did nice but also it was like </connor>
<connor> cool </connor>
<connor> my first uh experience of the new year </connor>
<connor> is the smell of frozen </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] hey it's only up from there right </connor>
<joey> yeah i mean what yeah true </joey>
<connor> sure it was a good year but it wasn't it </connor>
<joey> wasn't the greatest start to the year </joey>
<garnt> that's for sure </garnt>
<garnt> i feel like new year is like the biggest </garnt>
<connor> hoax that everyone's put over the world </connor>
<connor> it's never as good as you want it to be </connor>
<garnt> it's it's it's hyped up as </garnt>
<garnt> the biggest party of the year and nobody </garnt>
<garnt> knows what they're doing until the day </garnt>
<connor> before i swear to [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> everything's full like you can't get in </connor>
<garnt> anywhere everywhere's overpriced </garnt>
<garnt> everywhere is full everyone's doing </garnt>
<garnt> something </garnt>
<garnt> aside from you for some reason even </garnt>
<garnt> though you ask a week before </garnt>
<garnt> hey what are you doing for new year's </garnt>
<garnt> and they don't [ __ ] know yes somehow </garnt>
<garnt> on new year's you're that one [ __ ] who </garnt>

<joey> day of the year you have the biggest </joey>
<connor> fomo of the year i mean it's like </connor>
