<connor> (Joey smacks lips) </connor>
<connor> - I actually wash my phone, like, once a week. </connor>
<connor> - You wash your phone? </connor>
<connor> - I don't know, I just, I don't like it. </connor>
<connor> It gets, like, shit on it, I don't really like it. </connor>
<connor> - [Meilyne] Gets shit on it? </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> - I shit on my phone, Meilyne! </connor>
<connor> - Why do we talk about shit, like, every time? </connor>
<connor> - No, Mudan, don't fucking use this. </connor>
<joey> - Use this. </joey>
<connor> Do it. </connor>
<garnt> (chill music plays) </garnt>
<connor> - Welcome to this episode of, </connor>
<connor> wait, which episode are we on? </connor>
<connor> - I don't fucking know. </connor>
<connor> - [Meilyne] 43. - 43. </connor>
<connor> - Welcome to episode 43, I heard, </connor>
<connor> wait what is this? </connor>
<garnt> - We've never said an episode number </garnt>
<connor> in the history of "Trash Taste." </connor>
<connor> - I love, "welcome to episode," </connor>
<joey> "47." </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<joey> Just don't mention the episode name. </joey>
<garnt> - We've never mentioned an episode number before. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm gonna do it. </garnt>
<connor> I'm gonna fuckin' do it. </connor>
<connor> It's 43. </connor>
<connor> Welcome back to this episode of "Trash Taste." </connor>
<connor> And once again, I'm with the boys. </connor>
<connor> Who is Joey, who is Garnt? </connor>
<connor> That's the answer to the boys. </connor>
<connor> - Thank you. </connor>
<connor> - I didn't realize- </connor>
<connor> - What is this "Jeopardy?" </connor>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<connor> Who is Joey? </connor>
<joey> Correct. </joey>
<garnt> - Who is Garnt? </garnt>
<garnt> No, sorry. </garnt>
<connor> Grant, sorry. </connor>
<connor> - Here's your daily double. </connor>
<connor> Who is Grant? </connor>
<joey> - I've never watched "Jeopardy" before. </joey>
<joey> - Really? </joey>
<joey> - It's good fun actually. </joey>
<garnt> - So, why do they have to answer like, "what is," </garnt>
<garnt> like, "Grant," or whatever? </garnt>
<joey> - I don't know. </joey>
<joey> - Because what they, instead of the question, </joey>
<connor> they give you, like, an answer, </connor>
<garnt> and then the answer is the question. </garnt>
<connor> So, it's like reverse trivia. </connor>
<garnt> - Grown man finds out what "Jeopardy" is. </garnt>
<garnt> - I've only seen, like, out of context "Jeopardy" tweets, </garnt>
<garnt> or "Jeopardy" clips, </garnt>
<garnt> and I've just always tried to figure out </garnt>
<garnt> why are they answering in questions? </garnt>
<garnt> - I feel like it's pretty easy </garnt>
<connor> to figure out what's going on. </connor>
<garnt> - Now that you've explained it. </garnt>
<connor> Of course it's going to be easy </connor>
<garnt> now that you've explained it. </garnt>
<garnt> - No one had to tell me what was going on. </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, I'm guessing based on, you know, </garnt>
<joey> what's going on. </joey>
<joey> - I can't recall the moment in my life where I was like, </joey>
<joey> "I need to know how this game works." </joey>
<joey> - Good job, Garnt. </joey>
<garnt> - I can't even remember the last time I watched a game show. </garnt>
<garnt> It's just, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - Did you watch any game shows growing up? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I actually watched quite a lot. </garnt>
<connor> - We have quite good ones in the UK. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, like "How To Be a Millionaire." </connor>
<joey> That was a classic, classic game. </joey>
<joey> - Did you guys have, like, "Deal or No Deal?" </joey>
<joey> - What country originally made that? </joey>
<joey> - America </joey>
<joey> - America, but we had, like, an Australian version. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, the British one went for a long time. </garnt>
<connor> - Who was the host? </connor>
<connor> Noel Edmonds, yeah. - Noel Edmonds. </connor>
<connor> - Have you seen the American "Deal or No Deal?" </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<garnt> - It's like "Deal or No Deal" </garnt>
<garnt> but, like, it's way more Hollywood-ized. </garnt>
<connor> - Is it literally just like the "Kitchen Nightmares" deal </connor>
<connor> where like "Kitchen Nightmares USA" is like, </connor>
<connor> "You won't believe what happened." </connor>
<connor> And then the UK one is like, Gordon's like, </connor>
<connor> "All right, come on. </connor>
<connor> "You gotta get your act together." </connor>
<garnt> - It's just, it's way bigger. </garnt>
<garnt> They got like, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> instead of just fuckin' Noel Edmonds, </garnt>
<joey> like, opening the briefcase or something, </joey>
<joey> they've got, like, the proper, you know, </joey>
<joey> boxing ring chicks that like, you know- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, like, the models'll open up the briefcase, </joey>
<garnt> and you compare it to, like, the British version, </garnt>
<garnt> and it's just night and day. </garnt>
<joey> - Wait, does the British version not have, 'cause- </joey>
<garnt> - We have the boxes, we have the boxes. </garnt>
<garnt> - We have the boxes. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh, 'cause in Australia they took the American thing, </connor>
<joey> and lined up, like, 30 chicks. </joey>
<joey> - Should we explain what "Deal or No Deal" is </joey>
<connor> for someone who might not know? </connor>
<connor> - Okay. </connor>
<joey> - It's basically like a contestant comes on, </joey>
<connor> opens a bunch of briefcases. </connor>
<connor> - They have to get down to- </connor>
<garnt> - How do you explain "Deal or No Deal?" </garnt>
<connor> - Oh, wait so they get down to two boxes, don't they? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, okay. </connor>
<connor> So, if I remember correctly, you have, </connor>
<joey> I can't remember like 15 boxes or 15 briefcases. </joey>
<joey> - It's like 25. </joey>
<joey> - 25? </joey>
<joey> - It's, like, a lot, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And I believe you have to, like, </joey>
<joey> you have to choose random briefcases and- </joey>
<joey> - They get knocked out. </joey>
<garnt> - And then like every briefcase has a different amount </garnt>
<garnt> of money in it, and when you choose that briefcase, </garnt>
<garnt> that amount of money is knocked out of the prize pool and- </garnt>
<joey> - No, but isn't it, they pick a briefcase first, </joey>
<garnt> and they hang onto it, </garnt>
<joey> but they don't know what it is until the very end. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, and there's basically what they do is </connor>
<joey> is the reason why they don't just immediately skip </joey>
<joey> to the final one which you pick is </joey>
<joey> because along the way based on </joey>
<joey> what you've knocked out or got in, </joey>
<joey> so say you've knocked out all the lower prize pools </joey>
<joey> like the 1,000 pounds, the 2,000, they'll offer you deals. </joey>
<connor> So, the whole point of the show is that you kind of want </connor>
<connor> to knock out all the small ones at first, </connor>
<connor> so that they might offer you a really generous deal </connor>
<connor> 'cause your box might be, like, </connor>
<connor> the one that's left that sucks. </connor>
<connor> It was always a really fun game show, and I really liked it. </connor>
<connor> But in the UK, </connor>
<connor> I don't know if this is the same in Australia, </connor>
<connor> but, like, all ages watch, like, the quiz show or the- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I just couldn't see, like, my grandma watching, like, </connor>
<joey> bikini models fuckin' open up boxes. </joey>
<joey> - Dude, my grandma was fuckin' obsessed </joey>
<joey> with "Deal or No Deal." </joey>
<joey> - Oh, my great grandma too as well. </joey>
<joey> She watched it every day. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, wait, but did you guys not have, like, </connor>
<joey> the supermodels with briefcases? </joey>
<connor> - No, our game shows are, like, unapologetically, like, </connor>
<connor> just, like, chill people just doing, like, </connor>
<connor> normally for small amounts of money. </connor>
<joey> - But then on the opposite of the side of the spectrum, </joey>
<joey> you guys have shows like "Naked Attraction." </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I mean, I don't know. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, that's still a small scale, I would say. </garnt>
<garnt> - Even like "Pointless," which has been, like, </garnt>
<connor> if you don't know what "Pointless" is it's kind of hard to, </connor>
<connor> just fuckin' Google it. </connor>
<connor> I don't wanna explain every single game show </connor>
<joey> that we talk about. </joey>
<joey> "Pointless," the prize pool was only ever, like, </joey>
<joey> 1,000 pounds, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Really? </joey>
<joey> - Which is, like, to go on, you know, national TV </joey>
<joey> for like what? </joey>
<joey> Like, $1,500, no $1,300? </joey>
<joey> Not really a lot. </joey>
<joey> That's if you win. </joey>
<connor> You get nothing if you don't. </connor>
<connor> - At least "Deal or No Deal" had, like, </connor>
<garnt> I think the prize pool, the top prize pool was, like, </garnt>
<garnt> a million dollars or something. </garnt>
<garnt> - $250,000. </garnt>
<garnt> - $250,000 or pounds for the UK one. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh, really? </joey>
<joey> In Australia it was like a million. </joey>
<joey> - I think that's not too far off. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, you never saw anyone winning the million. </joey>
<joey> - Prize pools in general in the UK quiz shows are </joey>
<joey> pretty small, except for, like, the big ones </joey>
<garnt> which are marked as, like, the big ones. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think the biggest one we had was </garnt>
<garnt> "Who Wants To Be a Millionaire?" </garnt>
<joey> - That was the whole show. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, I think that was the biggest one anywhere, right? </joey>
<joey> - But then like, </joey>
<joey> UK version was probably, like, the most expensive, </joey>
<joey> just like, fuck. </joey>
<joey> Why is our currency so goddamn strong? </joey>
<connor> - A million pounds is a lot of money! </connor>
<connor> - Imagine a Japanese "Who Wants To Be a Millionaire?" </connor>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<joey> - We have that. </joey>
<joey> - Do you just win a million yen? </joey>
<joey> - Like, 10 grand. </joey>
<joey> - I think, wait, what is it again? </joey>
<joey> Ashley, do you remember, like, how much money is it </joey>
<connor> for the Japanese "Who Wants To Be a Millionaire?" </connor>
<connor> - [Ashley] I didn't even know. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, nevermind. </joey>
<joey> I'm pretty sure it's a million. </joey>
<joey> No, it's 10 million yen. </joey>
<connor> - That would make sense. </connor>
<garnt> - We spoke about it before. </garnt>
<garnt> I remember like "Takeshi's Castle." </garnt>
<garnt> Like, the Japanese version, </garnt>
<connor> I think it was three million yen was the prize. </connor>
<connor> I thought for a game show that fucking hard </connor>
<connor> $30,000 doesn't seem like a fair reward for a show </connor>
<connor> that only like five people ever won. </connor>
<joey> - But in most Japanese quiz shows- </joey>
<connor> - It's not about the money. </connor>
<connor> - Well, it is about the money, </connor>
<joey> but when it is about the money, the max you get is like 10K. </joey>
<joey> And usually that's split </joey>
<garnt> because, like, usually it's, like, a team-based thing. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh no. </garnt>
<garnt> - So, it's like, "You guys win 10K, </garnt>
<garnt> "split between the five of you." </garnt>
<joey> So, and then after taxes you probably get a grand each. </joey>
<connor> - What's your, like, favorite Australian </connor>
<connor> or, like, American game show that you've ever seen? </connor>
<joey> - God... </joey>
<joey> I'd probably say "Deal or No Deal" was probably my favorite. </joey>
<joey> - I really liked "Family Fortunes." </joey>
<joey> I don't know what the American one is, but- </joey>
<joey> - "Family Feuds?" </joey>
<joey> - "Family Feuds." </joey>
<joey> I've seen, like, the American, </joey>
<joey> like, clips of the American one, </joey>
<garnt> and that seems as fun if not even better </garnt>
<garnt> than the British version. </garnt>
<connor> - Because, like, on the American one I feel like they have, </connor>
<connor> like, more celebrities to choose from. </connor>
<connor> - Exactly! </connor>
<connor> - We only have like a few very giant celebrities. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, we had like Les Dennis, </garnt>
<garnt> which I don't even remember what he was famous for </garnt>
<garnt> in the first place. </garnt>
<connor> - Because like in America you have, like, celebrities, </connor>
<connor> which normally are known, like, the world over </connor>
<connor> just 'cause how it is. </connor>
<connor> But in the UK you have like two tiers of celebrities </connor>
<connor> which are like legit, like, </connor>
<connor> massive celebrities known all around the world. </connor>
<connor> Like, you know, like, normally musical artists </connor>
<connor> or, like, really big actors. </connor>
<connor> - And then the local- </connor>
<connor> - And then you have, like, the locally known ones, </connor>
<connor> which are normally like just, like, </connor>
<connor> the comedians are pretty good. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But, like, outside of that, you have, like, </connor>
<connor> someone who's like, he said a racist word on TV </connor>
<connor> and made a career out of it one time. </connor>
<connor> Like, all right, okay. </connor>
<joey> - Same with Australia. </joey>
<connor> I mean, it's same in Australia. </connor>
<joey> It's like, you're either an internationally known, </joey>
<joey> like, star who's hosting the show </joey>
<joey> or you're an Australian comedian that failed to, like, </joey>
<connor> market themselves outside of Australia. </connor>
<connor> So, it's just like, "We'll give you a spot. </connor>
<joey> "You speak in an Australian accent." </joey>
<connor> - We had this one game show. </connor>
<connor> I think it was, I don't know if it was British first. </connor>
<garnt> It was called "Golden Balls." </garnt>
<garnt> Did you ever watch this? </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yeah, I did watch that. </garnt>
<connor> Yeah, yeah, that was cool. </connor>
<garnt> - I know, I know. </garnt>
<connor> - Tee hee, golden balls. </connor>
<connor> - So what would happen is is that they would get, like, </connor>
<joey> five balls each </joey>
<joey> and they all had different amounts of money in them. </joey>
<joey> And then you have to, like, negotiate, I think... </joey>
<connor> - No, no, no, so- </connor>
<connor> - Who to kickoff? </connor>
<joey> - So, no, no, no. </joey>
<connor> - Like, a football game. </connor>
<connor> - I haven't actually seen it, </connor>
<connor> but I've, I think we're thinking of the right one </connor>
<connor> where the last round- </connor>
<connor> - The last round is the best one. </connor>
<connor> - Is the most interesting one. </connor>
<connor> So, you have a prize pool, </connor>
<connor> and it's I think it's based on, like, </connor>
<connor> the prisoner's dilemma or something. </connor>
<connor> I'm probably wrong on that. </connor>
<connor> So, you have two people, and you basically have to agree </connor>
<joey> if you're going to share the prize pool. </joey>
<joey> Or, like, okay so- </joey>
<joey> - You have to steal or share. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, you can steal the entire prize pool, </joey>
<joey> or you can share the prize pool. </joey>
<joey> And if you share, if both people pick share </joey>
<joey> then you share the prize money. </joey>
<joey> But if one person picks steal, </joey>
<joey> they get the entire amount of the prize money. </joey>
<joey> But if both people pick steal, </joey>
<connor> then nobody gets the prize money. </connor>
<garnt> - You just saw, like, </garnt>
<connor> the biggest pieces of shit on this show. </connor>
<connor> Like, yeah, you'd win the money, but like- </connor>
<joey> - That really seems like a show to, like, </joey>
<connor> expose the worst side of humanity. </connor>
<joey> - It was brutal, right? </joey>
<connor> 'Cause this TV show fuckin' loved it. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause they were like, </connor>
<connor> "Bro, whatever you gotta do to get this money, </connor>
<connor> "you ham it up." </connor>
<connor> So, these people would do like massive sob stories </connor>
<connor> to the person next to them, and they would believe them. </connor>
<connor> They'd be like, "Man, my kids, you know, </connor>
<connor> "they need this thing real bad, man." </connor>
<joey> They're like, "They need this expensive thing," et cetera. </joey>
<joey> And then they, you know, they would do it </joey>
<joey> and then they reveal it like they stole all the money </joey>
<garnt> and everyone's like, okay, sure you won 10 grand, </garnt>
<garnt> but at what cost? </garnt>
<connor> - At what cost? </connor>
<joey> They go through their entire life story to be like, </joey>
<joey> "I'm a devout Christian. </joey>
<joey> "I've given to charity. </joey>
<garnt> "I am the most honest person you could ever meet </garnt>
<joey> "in your life. </joey>
<joey> "JK." </joey>
<garnt> - They literally did a Dio and was just like, </garnt>
<connor> "I'm going to reject humanity, </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<joey> "to get this money." </joey>
<garnt> - I remember this one guy- </garnt>
<connor> - I think I've seen the same clip. </connor>
<connor> - Which one? </connor>
<connor> Which one was it? </connor>
<connor> - The guy who just fucking hacked, </connor>
<connor> like, social hacked the game where he was just like, </connor>
<joey> "Look mate, I'm gonna pick steal." </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I've seen it. </connor>
<connor> - Such a, like, a fivehead move. </connor>
<connor> He literally goes to the guy, </connor>
<connor> "Look, I'm not even gonna pretend. </connor>
<connor> "I'm going to pick steal, okay? </connor>
<connor> "And what I'm going to do is </connor>
<connor> "I'm going to share half the prize money with you </connor>
<connor> "once the game's over." </connor>
<connor> And the other guys was like, "No, you can't do that." </connor>
<garnt> Like, "No, we're gonna pick share. </garnt>
<garnt> "We're gonna at least agree to pick share." </garnt>
<garnt> He's like, "Nope, I'm picking steal, </garnt>
<garnt> "and you're gonna have to trust me </garnt>
<garnt> "that I'm going to share the prize money </garnt>
<garnt> "after the show ends." </garnt>
<garnt> And, like, the other guy asked the host, </garnt>
<garnt> "Is this allowed? </garnt>
<garnt> "Is this actually allowed?" </garnt>
<joey> And the host goes. </joey>
<garnt> "Whatever happens after this show, we can't guarantee." </garnt>
<garnt> So he's like- </garnt>
<joey> - So if you get shanked, that's your issue. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, so he's like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Well, I'm going to pick steal as well then." </garnt>
<garnt> And he's like, "Fine, if you pick steal, </garnt>
<garnt> "we're both going to lose the money. </garnt>
<garnt> "But the only chance you're gonna have to gain money is </garnt>
<connor> "by picking share." </connor>
<connor> Such a fucking fivehead move. </connor>
<connor> - Asshole move. </connor>
<connor> - That's like reverse reverse psychology. </connor>
<connor> - No, but at the end he didn't pick steal. </connor>
<joey> He picked share. </joey>
<connor> So, both of them got the prize money in the end. </connor>
<joey> - Oh shit. - Wow. </joey>
<connor> - And I was just like, dude, </connor>
<connor> this guy is the main protagonist of the fucking universe. </connor>
<garnt> What a fivehead move, man. </garnt>
<connor> - That is literally, like, the martyr. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> "I'll be the bad guy so that everyone can win." </connor>
<garnt> - Like, I just watched, like, </garnt>
<joey> IRL "Code Geass" right in front of me. </joey>
<connor> - That is literally "Code Geass." </connor>
<garnt> - This is what I saw right here. </garnt>
<garnt> - I saw, like, I swear, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know if this was like a popular clip. </garnt>
<garnt> I remember one time a guy, like, </garnt>
<garnt> literally came into the show, </garnt>
<joey> 'cause there's four contestants at the start, I believe. </joey>
<joey> He was literally just right from the start being like, </joey>
<joey> "I'm gonna steal. </joey>
<joey> "I'm gonna steal no matter what." </joey>
<joey> And then he stole. </joey>
<joey> And then he didn't get anything </joey>
<joey> because the person also stole. </joey>
<joey> So, it's like the same thing, </joey>
<connor> but like small brain version. </connor>
<connor> He was like, "I'm gonna steal," to everyone. </connor>
<connor> Everyone's like, "Yeah, we know." </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> "I'm not giving you anything." </connor>
<connor> - "So am I." </connor>
<connor> - Imagine you wait for months, right, </connor>
<connor> and you go through all the interviews and shit, </connor>
<connor> you get on the show finally, </connor>
<connor> you have a chance of winning money, </connor>
<connor> and some fucking asshole immediately said to everyone, </connor>
<connor> "I'm gonna ruin the show for all of you. </connor>
<joey> "I don't give a fuck." </joey>
<connor> You'd be like, "Well fuck. </connor>
<joey> "What am I supposed to do? </joey>
<joey> - That's like the, </joey>
<connor> what's the fuck the thing? </connor>
<connor> "The Millionaire Hot Seat" thing as well. </connor>
<connor> Did you have those? </connor>
<connor> - No, we don't have that I don't think. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, 'cause I don't know if it was in America. </connor>
<connor> We definitely had it in Australia though. </connor>
<connor> So, there's like, you know, </connor>
<connor> there's like "Who Wants To Be a Millionaire?" </connor>
<connor> which is just like a one-on-one thing. </connor>
<connor> There was this other version of it called </connor>
<joey> "Millionaire Hot Seat" </joey>
<joey> which is basically, it's one game of millionaire, </joey>
<joey> but then there's, like, four other people basically, like, </joey>
<joey> sitting on the benches, waiting for the person to fuck up. </joey>
<joey> And if one person gets the answer wrong- </joey>
<joey> - They swap? </joey>
<joey> - Then it goes to the next person from where they started. </joey>
<connor> - It's pretty cool. </connor>
<connor> - And so I saw this clip, </connor>
<connor> which is like you start off with five people. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - And they got to, I don't know, it was like the 2,000, </connor>
<connor> you know, not even halfway up kind of thing. </connor>
<connor> And I guess it was, like, a really hard question. </connor>
<connor> So, the first guy gets it wrong, </connor>
<joey> and he's like, "Oh fuck. </joey>
<joey> "All right, whatever. </joey>
<joey> "See you later." </joey>
<joey> Next person comes on fully confident being like, </joey>
<joey> "Well he just basically </joey>
<joey> "just got rid of one of the answers for me. </joey>
<joey> "I got this." </joey>
<joey> And not only does he get it wrong, </joey>
<joey> but then the next person during 50/50, </joey>
<joey> he also gets it wrong. </joey>
<joey> So, the fourth person comes up, is like, </joey>
<joey> "So, there's only one answer remaining. </joey>
<joey> "I think it's this one." </joey>
<joey> It's like, "You're correct!" </joey>
<garnt> But, like, imagine waiting, sitting on the benches </garnt>
<garnt> all that time to just come up and be like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Thank you for giving me this money." </garnt>
<joey> - "Thank you for the free money." </joey>
<joey> - "Thank you for the free money. </joey>
<joey> "JK, see ya later." </joey>
<garnt> - I'm trying to remember what else was there. </garnt>
<garnt> "The Weakest Link." </garnt>
<garnt> You remember "The Weakest Link?" </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, 'cause remember, like, what's his name? </connor>
<garnt> Was it Phil or Dan? </garnt>
<garnt> Which one of them was on "The Weakest Link?" </garnt>
<connor> - Oh, were they actually? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah one of them- </connor>
<connor> - The YouTubers? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, one of them was on "The Weakest Link." </connor>
<connor> - What's "The Weakest Link?" </connor>
<connor> - Oh, it's this, </connor>
<joey> it's not going anymore, is it? </joey>
<joey> - I don't think so. </joey>
<joey> - There was this really popular daytime British TV show </joey>
<joey> where we had this, like, really, like, </joey>
<joey> she was famous for being like bitch basically. </joey>
<garnt> 'Cause that was her whole character was that she was rude. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I can't remember her name. </garnt>
<garnt> - And it was just a quiz show. </garnt>
<garnt> And basically, like, it would just keep going </garnt>
<garnt> and asking questions, and you basically, like, </garnt>
<garnt> at the end of the question round, they'd ask eight people, </garnt>
<joey> you have to vote someone off, </joey>
<joey> and it was normally the person who was letting the team down </joey>
<joey> because if you've got a question wrong, </joey>
<joey> you, like, ruined the streak. </joey>
<joey> And it's like a video game where more streak, more points. </joey>
<joey> So, if someone gets a question wrong, they ruin it, </joey>
<connor> and then you get less money. </connor>
<connor> And if you, so, like, as it's going around, </connor>
<connor> so if I get one right, I get 100 points. </connor>
<connor> Then you get 200, then 400, </connor>
<joey> and someone has to like say "bank," </joey>
<joey> so that the points get saved. </joey>
<joey> So, the streak can keep going until someone saves it. </joey>
<joey> So, if you're the one who's like, </joey>
<garnt> "I'm gonna get the big boy question," </garnt>
<garnt> and then you fuck it up and lose the money </garnt>
<garnt> that everyone just earned, </garnt>
<garnt> you're probably gonna get voted off. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right, right. </garnt>
<garnt> - But then, like, there was a meta game behind it as well </garnt>
<garnt> because if you were too good, </garnt>
<connor> then people would just like gang up on you and vote you off </connor>
<connor> because they didn't have as much a chance of winning </connor>
<connor> if you were on the game show. </connor>
<garnt> - Right. </garnt>
<garnt> Sounds brutal. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I think, I can't remember which one it was. </garnt>
<garnt> It was Dan or Phil. </garnt>
<garnt> One of them was on it before they became a YouTuber. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh, wow. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it's really good. </joey>
<joey> You should watch it. </joey>
<joey> And then, like, the host is just, like, roasting them. </joey>
<joey> - That sounds fun. </joey>
<joey> - It's really endearing watching someone </joey>
<connor> before they were a YouTuber, like, do it. </connor>
<joey> It was just, I don't know. </joey>
<connor> It was really fun. </connor>
<joey> - I've always wanted to be on, like, trivia shows like that. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I mean, I think I'd like to go on a show </connor>
<joey> that has like, </joey>
<joey> literally that is just like, </joey>
<joey> hey, this is just a game show. </joey>
<joey> Just go up and do it. </joey>
<joey> Like, no, like acts. </joey>
<connor> No fuckin' like, </connor>
<connor> "Hey, play this character." </connor>
<garnt> No, just let me just fuckin' go on </garnt>
<connor> and make a fool of myself. </connor>
<garnt> - Like, is there like a what's really, </garnt>
<garnt> are game shows still going on? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, they are. </connor>
<connor> I think, like, it's like, </connor>
<connor> I'd like to think that most game shows are </connor>
<garnt> the complete opposite of, like, the talent shows. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause the talent shows are </garnt>
<connor> just heavily scripted narratives and all this stuff. </connor>
<joey> - I think we just don't know 'cause we don't watch TV. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I just stopped watching TV, </garnt>
<joey> so I actually have no fucking idea anymore. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Me too. </garnt>
<connor> There was this YouTuber now who's uploading, </connor>
<joey> he entered an American talent show that I'd never heard of. </joey>
<joey> I think he's called Reckless Ben on YouTube, </joey>
<joey> and he's like, he basically signed up for this thing </joey>
<connor> and then wore secret glasses while he's on it. </connor>
<connor> So, now he's uploading videos of him behind the scenes, </connor>
<joey> and his narration is really fuckin' funny. </joey>
<joey> And yeah, now they're just, like, </joey>
<connor> threatening him to take the videos down. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah, of course. </connor>
<connor> - And he's uploading videos being like, </connor>
<garnt> "I'm not gonna take it down. </garnt>
<garnt> "Here's the next video." </garnt>
<garnt> - "I'm taking it down." </garnt>
<garnt> - It's great. </garnt>
<joey> It's really interesting- </joey>
<joey> - Living up to his name. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, 'cause he's just, like, he's in it, </joey>
<joey> and he's just narrating really stupid, </joey>
<connor> and he's just like a complete clown </connor>
<connor> in like the best way possible. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, it's really interesting. </connor>
<connor> You should watch these YouTube videos. </connor>
<connor> I didn't sell it very well. </connor>
<joey> I feel like, I don't wanna explain too much. </joey>
<joey> You should just go watch them. </joey>
<joey> It's really, really underrated. </joey>
<joey> No one's watching these videos. </joey>
<connor> They have like 80K, 100K. </connor>
<joey> - It's still a decent amount. </joey>
<connor> - Well, for something, like, as crazy as this, </connor>
<joey> you'd think it'd be a lot bigger. </joey>
<garnt> - Is it like even a big kind of exposure that, </garnt>
<garnt> hey, this is kind of faked and it's all scripted. </garnt>
<connor> - It's really fun just seeing, like, a producer go up to him </connor>
<garnt> and be like, "No, not now," </garnt>
<garnt> or, "Hey, this is your," like, </garnt>
<connor> oh, like, you know like when the crowd's cheering? </connor>
<connor> He shows, like, the video footage of, like, </connor>
<connor> what's the show see then he cuts to what's happening to him, </connor>
<connor> and it's just him in the middle of a giant stage </connor>
<connor> and there's nothing. </connor>
<connor> Like, no noise or anything. </connor>
<connor> It's really funny. </connor>
<joey> - I think there's a big difference between just like hearing </joey>
<joey> and knowing that it's rigged versus actually seeing </joey>
<joey> that it's rigged. </joey>
<connor> - You know like all those talent shows as well have, like, </connor>
<connor> onsite therapists because of, like, </connor>
<connor> how, like, brutal the schedule is. </connor>
<connor> Like, some of them, </connor>
<connor> in like "America's Got Talent" had to, like, sit around </connor>
<connor> for like 19 hours to, like, wait to practice. </connor>
<connor> - Fucking hell. - Jesus Christ. </connor>
<garnt> - So, they had onsite therapists and they would, like, </garnt>
<garnt> and there was, like, cases where they're injecting them </garnt>
<connor> with, like, vitamins and stuff to keep them awake </connor>
<connor> during the show. </connor>
<connor> - What the fuck? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, and then obviously, you know, </connor>
<connor> these contracts you sign which have come up before </connor>
<joey> for like "X-Factor" in the UK. </joey>
<joey> - It's horrible. </joey>
<connor> - Oh my God, like some of them, </connor>
<connor> I swear it was "X-Factor UK" </connor>
<joey> where you literally sign away your rights </joey>
<joey> to anything you've ever done online </joey>
<joey> and anything you do in future ever. </joey>
<joey> Like, if you became a YouTuber, they own it. </joey>
<garnt> Like, you can't do it without their permission. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's fucked. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's nuts. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, I get why they do it </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause they want to cover their ass, </garnt>
<garnt> but they go, like, so beyond </garnt>
<garnt> where it's like, this is kind of like- </garnt>
<garnt> - This is kind of just exploitive now. </garnt>
<garnt> People want their five minutes of fame, right, that's why. </garnt>
<connor> - And it's like, what are you gonna do? </connor>
<connor> Get five minutes of fame yourself? </connor>
<joey> No, I don't think so. </joey>
<joey> What are you gonna do? </joey>
<joey> Build a career? </joey>
<joey> Good one. </joey>
<joey> Good one. </joey>
<joey> - "Not without my help." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> Not without Simon Cowell fucking breathing down your throat. </joey>
<connor> I don't think so. </connor>
<connor> - Jesus Christ. </connor>
<garnt> - I'll tell you what Sydney's been watching recently. </garnt>
<joey> She's been like, she's gone off the true crime for a bit, </joey>
<joey> and she's just- - Oh has she? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, she's now turned over to trash TV, </joey>
<garnt> reality trash TV. </garnt>
<garnt> She's been watching "90 Day Fiance." </garnt>
<connor> - Bro, I could just feel the scripts </connor>
<connor> when I'm watching that show. </connor>
<joey> Like, you can tell that the producers have made them do, </joey>
<joey> like, two, three takes. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Of course. </joey>
<joey> - It's awful. </joey>
<joey> I can't stand it. </joey>
<joey> I watched like one whole season of it, </joey>
<garnt> and it was just like, they just repeat- </garnt>
<garnt> - You watched one whole season? </garnt>
<connor> - I've watched a whole season. </connor>
<connor> - I'm impressed. </connor>
<garnt> - How? </garnt>
<joey> - I don't know. </joey>
<connor> I really don't know. </connor>
<connor> I didn't enjoy half of it either. </connor>
<connor> I was watching it and it's just like, </connor>
<connor> they go in fuckin' circles. </connor>
<connor> They'll be like, </connor>
<joey> so they'll meet up and they'll be like, </joey>
<joey> "Yeah, it's kind of weird, but we just love each other." </joey>
<joey> And then there'll just be, like, </joey>
<joey> red flags right from the start. </joey>
<joey> "He asked me to PayPal him like 10 grand." </joey>
<garnt> You know, "He doesn't want to have kids. </garnt>
<joey> "I want to have kids. </joey>
<connor> "But you know, I think love has a way." </connor>
<joey> And it's like- </joey>
<joey> - The shittiest, like, love drama, right? </joey>
<garnt> - Because I feel like watching "90 Day Fiance," right- </garnt>
<connor> - I lose brain cells watching this show. </connor>
<connor> - I lose brain cells watching it, but I think it, </connor>
<connor> like, I imagined what if it aired, like, </connor>
<connor> on Twitch or something? </connor>
<garnt> I think it would be a fuckin' excellent experience </garnt>
<garnt> if something like that aired on Twitch. </garnt>
<joey> - Like, unscripted? </joey>
<joey> - Huh? </joey>
<joey> - Like, unscripted? </joey>
<garnt> - No, I mean just, like, watching </garnt>
<connor> with, like, the Twitch chat to see all the reactions. </connor>
<connor> That's like part of the fun. </connor>
<connor> - The worst part about watching it, like, in seasons was, </connor>
<joey> like, without the YouTube comments, </joey>
<joey> "90 Day Fiance" is like 90% less enjoyable </joey>
<connor> because the best comments were, like, </connor>
<connor> making sure that everyone agrees with you </connor>
<connor> on who's the bigger asshole. </connor>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's, like, literally like the real life version </garnt>
<joey> of am I the asshole, you know? </joey>
<joey> You know, you go there to see the spicy drama </joey>
<joey> but watching it by yourself, </joey>
<garnt> I feel is just you lose half of the enjoyment out of it. </garnt>
<joey> - How did you sit through, like, a normal episode of that? </joey>
<joey> - Oh, it was hard. </joey>
<joey> - Because, like, I watched, </joey>
<connor> 'cause obviously, like, anybody I got into it </connor>
<connor> through the fuckin' Ed and Rose clips that went around. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, me too. </connor>
<connor> - So, I was just like, oh, if the clips are this good </connor>
<joey> then I'm pretty sure the entire episode is good. </joey>
<connor> It's not. </connor>
<connor> - Well, 'cause like the- </connor>
<joey> - It's such a drag. </joey>
<joey> - It is one of those TV shows </joey>
<connor> where like the clip is the best way to watch it. </connor>
<connor> Watching this was, like, brutal. </connor>
<connor> Like, none of these couples are, like, good people. </connor>
<connor> They're all just, like, </connor>
<connor> the worst people doing the shittiest things to each other </connor>
<connor> and then being surprised when none of it works. </connor>
<connor> And it's like, it is horrible. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, like, it's trash TV, </garnt>
<garnt> but I mean, you know why you're watching it, right? </garnt>
<garnt> No one's watching it to be like, </garnt>
<garnt> maybe this situation will work out. </garnt>
<connor> And this girl's like, you know, </connor>
<connor> "This guy who's on his 10th marriage </connor>
<connor> "and I've only known for three months, </connor>
<connor> "I don't know if he really loves me." </connor>
<connor> - It is like those- </connor>
<connor> - What, no way! </connor>
<connor> - That's what it's like! </connor>
<connor> - It is like someone has made a playbook </connor>
<joey> of like the worst setups to relationships. </joey>
<joey> There's always like someone </joey>
<joey> who can't speak the other person's language, </joey>
<joey> so they just can't communicate. </joey>
<joey> - Most of the time it's that, right? </joey>
<joey> - It's like, what the fuck are you doing? </joey>
<joey> Meilyne! </joey>
<connor> - What the hell was that? </connor>
<joey> - We're recording! </joey>
<joey> - You watching "90 Day Fiance" over there? </joey>
<garnt> - Meilyne's just loading up an episode right now apparently. </garnt>
<connor> - So, what are they talking about? </connor>
<connor> - There was like one where it was like the girl's like 18 </connor>
<connor> and the guy's 46 and has two kids. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, that just sounds like a bad idea. </connor>
<connor> - Like Ed and Rose. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, it was like that and someone else. </joey>
<joey> What was the other one? </joey>
<joey> There was, like, these, </joey>
<joey> there was one of them. </joey>
<joey> I think it was like, </joey>
<joey> he was like a South African guy </joey>
<joey> and other one was like an American. </joey>
<joey> Like, she was like super activist and stuff. </joey>
<joey> And like, he was just kind of like the most laid back man </joey>
<connor> on earth. </connor>
<connor> He was like, "Yeah, yeah, whatever, wherever." </connor>
<connor> And she was just like, </connor>
<connor> "I need you to know that I care about these things." </connor>
<connor> And she was psychotic. </connor>
<connor> And, like, watching her, like, </connor>
<connor> behave around this guy was, like, awful. </connor>
<connor> I was just like, this is terrible. </connor>
<connor> This is awful. </connor>
<connor> Why is he doing this? </connor>
<connor> How much is he getting paid? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, that's what I'm wondering. </connor>
<joey> Like, it's TLC. - Are they getting paid? </joey>
<connor> Like, I need to know. </connor>
<connor> - It's TLC so they're definitely paid. </connor>
<connor> - Are you sure they're getting paid? </connor>
<joey> - They're getting paid pennies. </joey>
<joey> - Like, 'cause I feel like- </joey>
<joey> - I hope they're getting paid. </joey>
<joey> - Because if they're not getting paid, </joey>
<connor> I don't know why they're putting up with half of this shit. </connor>
<connor> Like, it is- </connor>
<joey> - I'm pretty sure TLC pays all of the people that they have- </joey>
<connor> - Are you sure? </connor>
<connor> - But yeah, but, like, I use the word "paid" very loosely. </connor>
<joey> Like, they're probably getting paid scraps for that shit. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, it's just like, I'm watching this </connor>
<connor> and I'm like, how much would you have to pay me? </connor>
<joey> - Because you know that Rose, the Filipino girl, </joey>
<connor> she's like a YouTuber now. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I saw. </connor>
<connor> - So, it's just like, you probably got paid shit all, </connor>
<connor> but hey, you got a YouTube career now I guess. </connor>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<joey> You have a following. </joey>
<connor> - That's like a situation where, </connor>
<connor> if the other side is just so goddamn awful, </connor>
<joey> it makes you look amazing. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Ed did her a solid. </connor>
<garnt> - It's always weird for me watching American reality TV show </garnt>
<garnt> versus British reality TV show </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I feel like British reality TV show is, like, </garnt>
<garnt> so much more toned down than American. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, I think one of the thing of British reality TV shows, </garnt>
<connor> the peak that comes to me is something like </connor>
<connor> "Come Dine With Me." </connor>
<connor> - That's pretty good. </connor>
<garnt> Or like what's the other one that that fuckin' guy does </garnt>
<garnt> where you just come up to him at a table </garnt>
<connor> and he buys shit off you for like 100 quid? </connor>
<connor> Antique Hunters or something? </connor>
<garnt> - Oh, "Antiques Roadshow." </garnt>
<connor> - "Antiques Roadshow." </connor>
<garnt> - Is that it? </garnt>
<garnt> - I like that. </garnt>
<garnt> I like that show. </garnt>
<joey> - Show's literally been on the air for, like, </joey>
<joey> I don't know how long and it's just fun to watch. </joey>
<joey> People just bring in some things. </joey>
<joey> "I'll give you fuckin' 20 quid for it." </joey>
<joey> - It's like the fuckin', you know, like "Pawn Stars." </joey>
<connor> - But like legit. </connor>
<connor> - But like more legit than that. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, "Come Dine With Me" is </joey>
<connor> probably the best British reality TV show I think. </connor>
<garnt> - I enjoy it. </garnt>
<garnt> One of my favorite trash reality TV shows on, </garnt>
<garnt> I can't remember the name, </garnt>
<garnt> but the concept is they take this couple who, you know, </garnt>
<joey> doesn't have a lot of money, but want to get married. </joey>
<joey> - It's like a- </joey>
<joey> - "Cheapest Weddings," right? </joey>
<joey> - Not "Cheapest Weddings." </joey>
<joey> - That's the Australian version. </joey>
<joey> - Is that the Australian version? </joey>
<joey> - That's the Australian version. </joey>
<joey> - They give them 10K to sort out this wedding. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, it's like... </joey>
<joey> - And like, the bride has no control. </joey>
<garnt> She doesn't know anything, and it's all up to the guy. </garnt>
<garnt> - Aki's obsessed with that show. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was a BBC Three show. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - "Who Called the Bride?" or something like that? </joey>
<garnt> - Something like that. </garnt>
<joey> - "Who Wants the Bride?" </joey>
<joey> Something like that. </joey>
<joey> - Something like that. </joey>
<garnt> But it was such a good concept in my opinion </garnt>
<connor> 'cause like 10K I feel like is just the right amount </connor>
<connor> of money to be able to make a wedding happen, </connor>
<connor> but not enough to make everything you want </connor>
<connor> out of a wedding happen. </connor>
<connor> - It's pretty genius. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it's genius. </connor>
<garnt> And, like, making the guy do it as well. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I mean, you don't need producers, right? </connor>
<connor> You just sit there and follow the guy. </connor>
<connor> If he does nothing, that's fantastic content. </connor>
<connor> It's like- </connor>
<joey> - They must be fully aware of it too. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause they always choose to use the 10K </joey>
<connor> in the worst fucking way imaginable. </connor>
<connor> - We should've done that with Garnt's wedding. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<joey> - Hey, Garnt, here's 10K. </joey>
<joey> Go for it, dude. </joey>
<joey> - The guys in the show, </joey>
<joey> the first thing they do is like call up the crew. </joey>
<joey> - The boys. </joey>
<joey> - They call up their boys, and they're like, </joey>
<joey> and then like the main guy will be fucking clueless. </joey>
<joey> And that one friend who's like, </joey>
<joey> "I really don't think you should hire inflatable dinosaurs </joey>
<connor> "for your wedding. </connor>
<connor> "That seems like a bad idea." </connor>
<connor> - "Nah, nah, I got this. </connor>
<connor> "This is my wedding." </connor>
<connor> - It's always like, there's always that, </connor>
<connor> there's either the guy who like, </connor>
<connor> there was never a guy who got it like 100% right. </connor>
<connor> There was a guy who was like pretty close, </connor>
<connor> and it like did a modest attempt, </connor>
<connor> and then there was just the other type of guy that was like, </connor>
<connor> "I'm gonna do fucking Star Wars themed wedding. </connor>
<connor> "It's my wedding!" </connor>
<joey> - My favorite one is the one where, like, </joey>
<connor> the groom like decides to get married in like a pig barn. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yes, I've seen this one. </connor>
<joey> - They deadass go to, like, a farm with like fuckin' mud- </joey>
<garnt> - It's like muddy, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - He's like, "But you love pigs." </joey>
<garnt> - I think I saw one where the guy, like, </garnt>
<garnt> hosted the wedding in a cave, like a proper, an actual cave. </garnt>
<connor> - That's badass. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, that's badass, but then like, </joey>
<joey> he knew that the bride's mum was claustrophobic. </joey>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> - How to get rid of the in-laws. </connor>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<joey> - So, the bride's mum actually couldn't attend, like, </joey>
<joey> the wedding ceremony. </joey>
<connor> - Standing outside the cave. </connor>
<joey> - That's fuckin' big brain. </joey>
<joey> That's so big brain. </joey>
<garnt> "So, my in-laws hate boats, </garnt>
<connor> "so I decided let's get on a cruise." </connor>
<connor> - As someone who's, like, planning a wedding now, </connor>
<garnt> it's great for me 'cause I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> I see the stress that people- </garnt>
<connor> - Giving a survey to, like, Sydney's family. </connor>
<connor> "So what are your fears by the way? </connor>
<joey> "Spiders?" </joey>
<garnt> - "What are you afraid of?" </garnt>
<connor> - "We talkin' like zoos?" </connor>
<connor> - My favorite moment is always </connor>
<connor> when they try to pick the dress. </connor>
<connor> It's never, it's not even like a little bit wrong. </connor>
<garnt> It's always the complete opposite of what the bride picked. </garnt>
<connor> - It's literally like and one, two, three, </connor>
<connor> and have a breakdown, have a mental breakdown right now. </connor>
<garnt> Start crying, start telling him the wedding's over. </garnt>
<connor> That's literally how it. </connor>
<connor> This episode is sponsored by ExpressVPN. </connor>
<garnt> - Guys, we talk about shitting a lot on this podcast, right? </garnt>
<connor> - We do, we do. </connor>
<joey> - We do admittedly, yes. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Now don't you want to shit </joey>
<joey> with the privacy of the bathroom door locked? </joey>
<joey> - Of course I do. </joey>
<joey> - Well, using the internet without ExpressVPN is </joey>
<garnt> like going to the bathroom and not closing the door. </garnt>
<garnt> So, why would we want to do that? </garnt>
<joey> - That just sounds barbaric, and I will not stand for it. </joey>
<connor> - I'm being told that internet service providers </connor>
<connor> like Comcast or Verizon know every single website you visit. </connor>
<joey> - That's really interesting information </joey>
<joey> because I've also heard that ISPs can sell this information </joey>
<joey> to ad companies and tech giants </joey>
<joey> who then use your data to target you. </joey>
<garnt> - [Garnt] ExpressVPN creates a secure encrypted tunnel </garnt>
<garnt> between your device and the internet, </garnt>
<garnt> so your online activity can't be seen by anyone. </garnt>
<connor> - It's as easy as closing the bathroom door. </connor>
<connor> Simply fire up the app and press one button. </connor>
<connor> And I use this all the time when I'm watching anime </connor>
<garnt> as certain websites don't let you watch from Japan, </garnt>
<garnt> and trust me, it's fuckin' easy. </garnt>
<garnt> - What device do you use it on? </garnt>
<garnt> - Every single device I have. </garnt>
<garnt> My PC, my phone, </garnt>
<connor> probably my refrigerator soon when it gets installed. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Not only that, but it's rated number one </joey>
<joey> by CNET, Wired, The Verge, and other creditable sources. </joey>
<joey> And it's actually quite cheap per month. </joey>
<connor> - ExpressVPN has been a game changer for me </connor>
<connor> because I cannot tell that I'm even connected to a VPN. </connor>
<connor> There's no losses in speed whatsoever. </connor>
<garnt> - So, what are you waiting for? </garnt>
<garnt> Secure your online activity today </garnt>
<garnt> by visiting ExpressVPN.com/TrashTaste. </garnt>
<garnt> That's ExpressVPN.com/TrashTaste. </garnt>
<joey> - And you can get an extra three months free. </joey>
<connor> - Go to ExpressVPN.com/TrashTaste. </connor>
<connor> Back to the episode. </connor>
<connor> I would, you know, even if I got, like, </connor>
<joey> paid on top of doing the wedding, </joey>
<joey> 'cause I'm assuming the, like, kind of the reason </joey>
<joey> why people apply for that show is you get a free wedding. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But, like, man, organizing a wedding seems </joey>
<connor> like one of the easiest things to get wrong. </connor>
<joey> (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<joey> I thought about this- </joey>
<joey> - That's the most nervous laughter. </joey>
<connor> - I thought about this and I was like, "Goddamn." </connor>
<connor> Just the like, 'cause you know, like, </connor>
<connor> you have friends, right? </connor>
<connor> But like not every friend you want to come to your wedding, </connor>
<connor> right? </connor>
<connor> It must be so fucking awkward deciding, like, </connor>
<connor> you're a good enough friend, </connor>
<connor> but like, I don't know </connor>
<connor> if you're like good enough for the wedding. </connor>
<joey> - I can barely organize a boys' night out, </joey>
<joey> let alone a fucking wedding. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause also, like, how many friends do you have? </joey>
<connor> And like, where do you draw the line? </connor>
<connor> Who's close enough? </connor>
<connor> How do you decide? </connor>
<connor> Is it like a mutual thing? </connor>
<connor> You're like, "No, I don't like Ted." </connor>
<connor> - Wedding politics is like definitely a thing. </connor>
<connor> Like, my cousin went through it as well. </connor>
<connor> And it's just, </connor>
<joey> there's a lot that goes into a wedding that I, like, </joey>
<joey> I have no interest. - Didn't foresee. </joey>
<joey> - I didn't obviously, it's, like, </joey>
<joey> trying to plan a wedding yourself is hard enough, </joey>
<connor> trying to plan a wedding when you're not in the country </connor>
<joey> and also during, like, COVID hit- </joey>
<connor> - Hard mode. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> - This is like not even like hard mode. </connor>
<connor> This is like Dark Souls no hit run. </connor>
<garnt> Like, there's so many things that can, like, </garnt>
<garnt> that can fuck up as well. </garnt>
<joey> - I love how nowadays </joey>
<joey> whenever anything is like extremely hard, </joey>
<joey> the first thing you think of is Dark Souls no hit. </joey>
<joey> Nothing's harder than that. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, it's stressful, but it's rewarding. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, it must be. </joey>
<garnt> - I think. </garnt>
<joey> - Is it, Garnt? </joey>
<connor> If Sydney's watching, yes, yes. </connor>
<connor> - It's rewarding until, </connor>
<joey> like, it will be rewarding once it actually finishes, right? </joey>
<joey> And everything goes smoothly. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, like the planning parts, </joey>
<garnt> some of it's better than the others. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, I remember, like, my favorite moment so far has been </garnt>
<joey> actually going to the venue </joey>
<joey> and just being like, yeah, this is the place. </joey>
<joey> This is the place. </joey>
<joey> That's an amazing feeling. </joey>
<joey> Everything up to that, like, </joey>
<joey> searching through about 50 catalogs of possible places </joey>
<joey> and driving to about 10 different places, </joey>
<garnt> and being like, "Do I want to settle on this? </garnt>
<garnt> "I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> "Can I see myself getting married in a barn </garnt>
<garnt> "or a cave or whatever?" </garnt>
<connor> - In Japan it's, like, crazy </connor>
<connor> how, like, fucking seriously they take this. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, it's even, it's like in Asia they're like, </garnt>
<garnt> we think there's like wedding politics in Western weddings. </garnt>
<joey> No, in Asia it's a fuckin' statement. </joey>
<joey> And I hate that. </joey>
<garnt> I absolutely hate that 'cause- </garnt>
<joey> - There's so many unspoken rules in an Asian wedding. </joey>
<connor> - The amount that they must spend on weddings here- </connor>
<joey> - Oh, it's nuts. </joey>
<joey> - It's insane. </joey>
<joey> - If you go to, like, any, like, fancy hotel in Japan, </joey>
<joey> like, you just, 'cause you know, </joey>
<connor> if you go there for, like, a lunch or something, </connor>
<connor> you'll see that, like, the wedding planning rooms are </connor>
<connor> like full with people. </connor>
<connor> And like, those prices don't seem cheap. </connor>
<connor> They seem real expensive! </connor>
<joey> Like, 50K on a wedding, I'm like, what? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I went to one of my friend's weddings </connor>
<connor> from university and he did it in Japan in Tokyo, </connor>
<connor> and the inside of this venue looked </connor>
<connor> like a fuckin' mini Disneyland. </connor>
<connor> Like, there was, like, a castle </connor>
<connor> and, like, a fuckin' fountain </connor>
<connor> and this, like, massive completely white church. </connor>
<joey> I'm like, how much money did you spend on that? </joey>
<connor> - Like, what amount of money is too much to spend </connor>
<joey> on a wedding? </joey>
<joey> I get that it's a special day. </joey>
<joey> but there has to be a limit </joey>
<connor> where like special day is, like, ridiculous. </connor>
<joey> - Not to mention, there was like 300 people at this wedding. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, because like, nobody knows 300 people. </garnt>
<connor> I'm sorry. </connor>
<connor> I don't even know if I even have </connor>
<connor> that many friends on Facebook, </connor>
<garnt> let alone at a wedding. </garnt>
<connor> - Do you get, like, families asking like, </connor>
<connor> "Hey, can my like family friend of a friend come?" </connor>
<connor> Do you get, like, that? </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I feel like that, I'd be like, no. </connor>
<connor> Hell fuckin' no. </connor>
<joey> - In Japan, it's, like, the wedding politics extends </joey>
<garnt> to, like, you have to invite work people. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause it's all about face, right, </joey>
<garnt> so, like, in Thailand, you have to invite your family, </garnt>
<garnt> your family friends, your work colleagues, </garnt>
<garnt> like, basically everyone. </garnt>
<connor> - I mean, close colleagues, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - If they're actual mates. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm not inviting my boss. </connor>
<connor> - Another thing about Thai weddings is- </connor>
<connor> - Meilyne's like. </connor>
<connor> Shut up, Meilyne. </connor>
<connor> - Which is why, like, me and Sydney decided </connor>
<joey> to have our wedding in the UK. </joey>
<joey> So, we didn't have to worry about, you know, that side of- </joey>
<joey> - All that bullshit, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But, like, it's a customary in Thai weddings as well </joey>
<joey> that the groom has to give money, </joey>
<connor> has to give, like, a certain amount of money </connor>
<connor> to the bride's, like, family. </connor>
<connor> - What? </connor>
<connor> - For the father to accept or something? </connor>
<garnt> - What era are we in? </garnt>
<garnt> Are you buying her? </garnt>
<garnt> Is that like an extra step? </garnt>
<garnt> - "How much is your daughter? </garnt>
<garnt> "I give you two goats." </garnt>
<garnt> - Is there, like, an auction? </garnt>
<connor> Like, what is this? </connor>
<garnt> - I mean- </garnt>
<garnt> - That's, like, fuckin' Russian, like, mother, </garnt>
<joey> like, "I'll give you two goats." </joey>
<connor> - This feels like an extra step to, like, auction. </connor>
<connor> You know? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, it's something that I don't agree with. </garnt>
<garnt> And I've seen, like, some of my family members do it, </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm just like, yeah, I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> I kind of don't agree with this. </garnt>
<connor> - Is that where it comes from? </connor>
<garnt> Like, where does that come from? </garnt>
<garnt> - Honestly, I have no idea. </garnt>
<connor> - Does it come from some more sinister, </connor>
<connor> like way back- </connor>
<garnt> - It must. </garnt>
<connor> - It must've. </connor>
<connor> I mean, I'm not sure how the custom started </connor>
<connor> because, you know, it's something that, </connor>
<connor> I've attended Thai weddings and I've seen happen. </connor>
<garnt> I've never kind of asked where this came from. </garnt>
<connor> I just kind of was just like, </connor>
<connor> yeah, I don't think I want to do that. </connor>
<garnt> - "Did you buy Mom?" </garnt>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - "A cheap price." </garnt>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - "I did it at a deal, son." </garnt>
<joey> - "I mean, it's all bargained." </joey>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<joey> - It's also, like, the same customary where it's, like, </joey>
<connor> the bride's dad is expected to pay for the wedding. </connor>
<joey> And I'm just like, no, that shouldn't be the case either. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Like, it's, </connor>
<connor> to me a wedding there's so many customaries to weddings </connor>
<garnt> that revolve around money that I just don't understand. </garnt>
<connor> - I guess 'cause, like, maybe, </connor>
<connor> I mean that's pretty common in the West still </connor>
<joey> that the other person- </joey>
<joey> - The bride- </joey>
<joey> - The bride's parents will pay. </joey>
<joey> I mean, it's understandable </joey>
<joey> when marriage used to be way younger, like 21. </joey>
<joey> Like, I get it then 'cause you don't have any money. </joey>
<connor> But now people are getting married at what? </connor>
<joey> Like, 27, 30. </joey>
<joey> So, it's like, you know. </joey>
<connor> I mean, probably should have your own money by then, </connor>
<joey> you know? </joey>
<joey> - Probably shouldn't be planning a wedding </joey>
<connor> if you're unemployed at 30. </connor>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, maybe. </connor>
<connor> Just dissing some people. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, just saying. </joey>
<connor> - I'm sorry for that guy who just like, you know, </connor>
<connor> had, like, five children </connor>
<connor> and all of them ended up being daughters. </connor>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> "Fuck! </garnt>
<garnt> "Come on, son, son, son! </garnt>
<connor> "Oh God!" </connor>
<connor> - It's like the, like, aging population, </connor>
<connor> like, pyramid thing where it's like, </connor>
<joey> "It won't bite you now. </joey>
<connor> "It'll bite you later." </connor>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, because isn't there, like, </joey>
<joey> I remember I saw like this, </joey>
<joey> I don't remember if it was a "Vice" documentary </joey>
<joey> or some kind of documentary on YouTube where, like, </joey>
<joey> I forgot which country it was, </joey>
<joey> somewhere in the Middle East where, like, </joey>
<joey> they still have the tradition of, like, wife-napping. </joey>
<joey> - What? </joey>
<joey> - Where it's like, they, I forgot which country it was. </joey>
<joey> But I remember I saw this documentary, </joey>
<joey> and there's this tradition, </joey>
<garnt> "tradition," </garnt>
<garnt> where guys, if they find a girl that they find attractive </garnt>
<joey> and they see as "wife material," </joey>
<joey> some of them will actually, like, deadass kidnap them, </joey>
<joey> like in broad daylight, </joey>
<joey> take them back to their parents' place, </joey>
<joey> and the girl is then forced to get married to this guy. </joey>
<garnt> - What is this? </garnt>
<joey> Like, fuckin' real life Pokemon? </joey>
<connor> - This sounds like Runescape. </connor>
<garnt> This sounds like Runescape. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> And like, traditionally the girl can't decline it. </joey>
<connor> - Really? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, so, like, she has to get married. </joey>
<connor> And there's all these, </connor>
<joey> and this documentary I saw is, like, </joey>
<joey> it's so fuckin' disturbing 'cause there's these girls </joey>
<joey> who are literally just breaking down </joey>
<joey> while they get the veil put on top of them and shit. </joey>
<joey> And it's just, it's fucked. </joey>
<joey> I wish I could remember the name of the documentary. </joey>
<connor> - Literally the "Trash Taste" podcast is like, </connor>
<joey> "There was this thing. </joey>
<joey> "I don't remember though." </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Just look it up. </joey>
<joey> If look up, like, "wife-napping" I think it's called. </joey>
<connor> - "Trash Taste" podcast, early onset Alzheimer's. </connor>
<connor> Just fucking forgetting, we forget everything here. </connor>
<connor> We can't remember anything. </connor>
<garnt> We're fucking useless. </garnt>
<joey> - This thing I saw on the internet I vaguely remember about, </joey>
<joey> but there's one detail I remember </joey>
<connor> that I want to talk about now </connor>
<garnt> and just share it to the world. </garnt>
<garnt> It's fucked up. </garnt>
<garnt> - I remember perfect example of that I think was the, </garnt>
<joey> there was one episode we were talking about, like, </joey>
<joey> how very rarely, like, anime uses English, like, </joey>
<joey> songs in the openings and endings. </joey>
<joey> And we're bringing up all these titles, </joey>
<joey> and we're like, I'm sure there's other ones we don't know. </joey>
<joey> All the titles are, like, "Jojo." </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<joey> "Hello? </joey>
<joey> "You know that one show you're all obsessed about?" </joey>
<garnt> - I just forget everything all the time. </garnt>
<connor> - I feel like when you're put on the spot, </connor>
<connor> especially when you're put on the spot. </connor>
<garnt> - And you're recording. </garnt>
<garnt> - And you're recording, it's just- </garnt>
<joey> - Never take our word on anything. </joey>
<joey> That's just the golden rule. </joey>
<joey> Never take our word on anything. </joey>
<connor> - We are not liable for anything that we- </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> You know what I don't forget though? </connor>
<joey> 'Cause it happened to me right yesterday? </joey>
<joey> - What? </joey>
<joey> - I got stopped by the police. </joey>
<joey> - What do you mean? - What did you do? </joey>
<garnt> - I'm a criminal. </garnt>
<joey> - What illegal activity- </joey>
<joey> - Being white! </joey>
<garnt> I'm joking. </garnt>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<connor> - Being a minority for once. </connor>
<connor> - Wait, what did you do? </connor>
<connor> - Nothing. </connor>
<connor> I was, literally nothing. </connor>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<joey> So like, I was literally, like, </joey>
<joey> okay, so I'm coming up the escalator to, like, you know, </joey>
<joey> 'cause in Japan you have to, like, </joey>
<joey> ding out of the gates, right? </joey>
<joey> So I'm coming up to the escalator to go through the gates, </joey>
<joey> and there's like two pylons, two sets, </joey>
<joey> and so I'm coming up the escalator. </joey>
<joey> So, I'm gonna go forward, to go out, </joey>
<joey> and literally hiding behind the pylon is a police officer. </joey>
<joey> And when I pass him, I've got headphones on, </joey>
<joey> I got a, like, cap on, </joey>
<joey> so, like, maybe I look fuckin' dodgy. </joey>
<joey> I don't know. </joey>
<joey> But literally when I pass this guy, </joey>
<joey> I see like in my corner of my eye this guy jump in action. </joey>
<joey> Just immediately come up to me and stop me. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, "Fuck. </joey>
<joey> "What have I done, dude?" </joey>
<connor> But I'm like, "What's wrong?" </connor>
<joey> And I'm like, ah, so I won't say anything in Japanese. </joey>
<joey> I'll just translate it all. </joey>
<joey> He's like, "Oh, where are you going?" </joey>
<connor> And I'm like, "Just going home, you know. </connor>
<connor> "Just chilling out. </connor>
<connor> "Why, what's up?" </connor>
<connor> He's like, "Oh, really, cool, cool. </connor>
<connor> "Can I see your card?" </connor>
<connor> So you have, like, a foreigners card, right? </connor>
<garnt> - Which by law, you always have to have this foreigner, </garnt>
<connor> what's it called? </connor>
<connor> - Zairyu card. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> And he asked me if Japanese's okay. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Yeah, I can speak a little bit." </connor>
<connor> And luckily like everything he said I understood, </connor>
<joey> so it was good. </joey>
<joey> And he was like, "Oh, okay." </joey>
<joey> And by the way, like, my train is in, like, </joey>
<joey> I think like four minutes, so I'm like, "Come on, mate. </joey>
<connor> "Come on." </connor>
<connor> Like, "Keep it up, keep it up." </connor>
<connor> So, he looks at my card and it says like, </connor>
<connor> oh, I'm an entertainer. </connor>
<connor> And he's like, "Oh, cool, cool. </connor>
<connor> "What do you do?" </connor>
<joey> I'm like, oh, I say, "Seiyu" </joey>
<joey> which means like voice actor. </joey>
<joey> He's like, "Ah, seiyu." </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, "Yeah, yeah." </joey>
<joey> And then he's like, "Oh, sensei." </joey>
<connor> So, like, Japanese teacher. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, what? </connor>
<connor> I literally just told you, why would it be entertainer? </connor>
<connor> I'm just sitting there like, "Oh no, no, no." </connor>
<connor> Like, "Seiyu, seiyu." </connor>
<connor> Like, commercials, games. </connor>
<connor> He's like, "Oh, games." </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Yeah, yeah games." </connor>
<connor> He's like, "What games?" </connor>
<connor> And I was just like, what do you want me to? </connor>
<connor> Like, you gonna look it up? </connor>
<connor> Like, what do you want? </connor>
<connor> So I'm like, "Oh, it's an English. </connor>
<connor> "It's an English." </connor>
<connor> And he's like, "Oh." </connor>
<connor> Deadass, right, he goes, "Oh, do you play Apex?" </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> No joke. </connor>
<connor> He's, like, 40, maybe 50. </connor>
<connor> Deadass asked me if I play Apex. </connor>
<connor> I'm just sitting here, like, laughing. </connor>
<connor> So I'm like, fuck. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> I shit you not I say, "Yeah, I'm diamond rank." </connor>
<connor> He goes, (speaks Japanese) </connor>
<connor> Which means like, "Oh, you're strong." </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah." </connor>
<connor> Okay, like two minutes, two minutes. </connor>
<connor> My train's in two minutes. </connor>
<connor> And he's like, "Oh cool, you're from the UK." </connor>
<garnt> I'm like, "Yeah, yeah, from the UK." </garnt>
<connor> So it's like, and then this point, I feel like, ah, okay. </connor>
<garnt> I'm kind of like, I know he's not gonna, like- </garnt>
<garnt> - He's just making conversation. </garnt>
<connor> - He's just talking to me. </connor>
<garnt> - Sounds like he's just looking for a friend right now. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't know why he's talking to me? </connor>
<connor> He doesn't say why he stopped me. </connor>
<connor> He doesn't say anything like that. </connor>
<joey> - Maybe he was one of the Japanese dudes </joey>
<joey> you played Apex with. </joey>
<joey> - Maybe, maybe. </joey>
<garnt> - He just looks at you, and he's like, </garnt>
<connor> "This guy gives off gamer energy. </connor>
<connor> "I'ma stop him." </connor>
<garnt> - "I wonder if that guy plays Apex. </garnt>
<connor> "I'm gonna stop him and ask him." </connor>
<connor> And so, yeah, so I'm like, "Yeah, I'm from the UK." </connor>
<connor> He asked where I'm from. </connor>
<connor> - So, he can speak good English then? </connor>
<connor> - No, no, it's all in Japanese. </connor>
<joey> - He can speak, he was- </joey>
<connor> - Luckily everything he said, I either understood </connor>
<connor> or understood enough of what he's saying </connor>
<connor> to figure out what he's, </connor>
<connor> like, he said something about something going to UK, </connor>
<connor> something, something marriage. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "Ah," and I said like, honeymoon, </connor>
<connor> in like katakana, like, "Ah honeymoon." </connor>
<connor> He's like. </connor>
<connor> So, he told me that he went to the UK and he loved it. </connor>
<connor> He said, "Okii Ben." </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Okii Ben! </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<joey> - He said he liked Big Ben, and he liked Buckingham Palace. </joey>
<joey> He said, the Japanese word for palace which is- </joey>
<joey> (Joey speaks Japanese) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> He said that something palace. </joey>
<joey> (Joey speaks Japanese) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, he said, "Buckingham (speaks Japanese)" </joey>
<connor> I'm like, I'm pretty sure he's saying Buckingham Palace. </connor>
<connor> "Oh, it's beautiful. </connor>
<connor> "It's beautiful." </connor>
<connor> He's like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah." </connor>
<connor> - I can't get over Okii Ben. </connor>
<connor> - Okii Ben! </connor>
<connor> I was, like, laughing. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, I don't want to laugh though. </connor>
<connor> He's a police officer. </connor>
<connor> He'll be like, "Why are you laughing?" </connor>
<joey> - Because you guys know what ben means, right? </joey>
<connor> - What? </connor>
<garnt> - It means shit. </garnt>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<joey> So saying, "okii ben." </joey>
<connor> - I didn't know that. </connor>
<garnt> - Is like deadass means "giant shit." </garnt>
<connor> - I mean, it's pretty shit. </connor>
<connor> It's pretty shit. </connor>
<joey> - Big shit, big shit. </joey>
<joey> - It's the big shit. </joey>
<connor> - I thought he, 'cause I thought the word for shit was unko? </connor>
<joey> - No, ben is another word for it, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - So, yeah, and then he was just like, "Paris." </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Oh yeah, you like wine?" </connor>
<connor> He was like, "Yeah, me and my wife love wine." </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Cool, cool, I like wine too." </connor>
<connor> And he's like, "All right, yeah, you can go now." </connor>
<joey> And I'm like, "Thanks man. </joey>
<connor> "Thanks for making me miss my fucking train." </connor>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<connor> I had to wait 10 minutes for the next one. </connor>
<connor> - So you deadass just bonded </connor>
<joey> with a police officer over Apex. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, luckily it was nice, </connor>
<connor> but like, it's pretty, like, alerting </connor>
<joey> when you first stop you, </joey>
<joey> and I'm like, why are you stopping me? </joey>
<joey> Why are you stopping me? </joey>
<joey> And then someone told me, they were like, yeah, </joey>
<connor> apparently there's, like, </connor>
<connor> some police officers have quotas of, like, </connor>
<connor> people they have to stop. </connor>
<joey> - Oh really? </joey>
<garnt> - Makes sense. </garnt>
<joey> They've just got so little work to do here. </joey>
<connor> - And they're normally told to- </connor>
<joey> - I guess they're getting paid to do something. </joey>
<connor> - This is, like, the least, like, </connor>
<connor> xenophobic way of, like, saying this. </connor>
<connor> But I've been told, I don't know if this is true, </connor>
<connor> some police officers are told to stop foreigners </connor>
<connor> to practice their English. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, that makes sense. </joey>
<connor> - That makes sense. </connor>
<connor> - But it feels wrong. </connor>
<garnt> Like, if that happened in another country, </garnt>
<garnt> it'd be like, that's fucked up, that's not right. </garnt>
<connor> But I mean, you know- </connor>
<connor> - At least they're nice about it though, right? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I just don't like that they asked, like, my ID. </joey>
<joey> I don't know something about that feels weird. </joey>
<joey> - I guess they- </joey>
<joey> - Like, check my card. </joey>
<joey> - I think because they're obligated to. </joey>
<garnt> - I think they have to do that, right. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause if there's- </garnt>
<connor> - Feels threatening when someone asks your ID. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, there's never a way </garnt>
<garnt> where a policeman asks for your ID, </garnt>
<connor> and you don't at least sweat a little. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I'm like (breathes heavily) </connor>
<connor> - You do the like audible swallow. </connor>
<connor> - This is literally like white guy gets, like, </connor>
<connor> discriminated first time in his life POV. </connor>
<connor> This is the story, right? </connor>
<joey> - "So this is what it feels like to be a minority." </joey>
<garnt> - Shit. </garnt>
<connor> This is fucked up. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> I'm kidding. </connor>
<connor> I know it's fucking bad. </connor>
<connor> But like, yeah, I mean, it's happened a few times, </connor>
<connor> but it was 'cause it happened at like 10:00 PM. </connor>
<connor> I was like, you know, </connor>
<connor> for some reason when it happens at night, </connor>
<connor> it feels like way more like whoa. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, why aren't you stopping anyone else? </connor>
<connor> I'm the only non-Japanese here. </connor>
<connor> - Dude, you shouldn't have told this story on "Trash Taste." </connor>
<connor> You could have easily made a </connor>
<joey> "My first racist experience in Japan" type of video. </joey>
<joey> - I'll do it on a live stream. </joey>
<joey> So, the clip can come out before this. </joey>
<joey> - Good idea, good idea. </joey>
<joey> Big brain. </joey>
<joey> - I just like, I just started cracking up so much </joey>
<joey> when he asked me if I played Apex. </joey>
<joey> I was like, oh my God. </joey>
<connor> I was like, you can't make this shit up. </connor>
<connor> Like, I knew when I was gonna tell the story, </connor>
<garnt> people are gonna be like, "That's bullshit." </garnt>
<garnt> No, it actually, </garnt>
<connor> I wish I fucking recorded. </connor>
<garnt> - This like, yeah, and everyone applauded. </garnt>
<connor> - I was like, this is too unreal </connor>
<connor> that he literally just asked me if I play Apex. </connor>
<connor> But I literally, like, don't shut up about to everyone. </connor>
<garnt> But it's really popular in Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's massive in Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> - What are, like, the biggest games in Japan? </garnt>
<connor> - What genre of games? </connor>
<garnt> Like, what? </garnt>
<connor> In first person shooters? </connor>
<connor> I think it's, like, Apex right now. </connor>
<garnt> - Like, 'cause are online games big in Japan even? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, there's a huge scene for it. </connor>
<joey> - Apex right now is massive because, </joey>
<connor> because shockingly because of VTubers that are playing it. </connor>
<connor> - It was popular before that. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, but the VTubers propelled the fuck out of it. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, because like when we moved to Japan, </connor>
<connor> I think is when- </connor>
<connor> - PubG was big, right? </connor>
<connor> - PubG was big, but I think Apex either just released </connor>
<joey> or released like a while back, </joey>
<joey> and they were doing a huge push for it </joey>
<joey> because the month where he moved here, </joey>
<joey> every single ad I got was Apex Legends. </joey>
<joey> - Really? </joey>
<joey> - In Japan, yeah. </joey>
<joey> Everything was. </joey>
<joey> And I thought, wow, that's kind of weird </joey>
<joey> 'cause it's kinda like a dead game in, like, the West </joey>
<joey> or at least it was. </joey>
<joey> I feel like it flip flops in whether it's popular or not. </joey>
<garnt> - What even counts as a dead game anymore, right? </garnt>
<connor> - Overwatch I'd say. </connor>
<joey> That's 'cause Overwatch 2's coming out, </joey>
<joey> so they just like abandoned. </joey>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - But like, you know, I mean not a dead game, </connor>
<connor> but like not in, like, the public discourse is </connor>
<connor> what I would consider like, </connor>
<connor> when people say "dead game," </connor>
<connor> I think that's what they mean. </connor>
<connor> Like, it's not like no one plays it. </connor>
<joey> - The main population is talking about it or not, right? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, like it's not like you, you know, </connor>
<connor> you're not expected to have some general knowledge about it. </connor>
<joey> - You're not expected to have a police officer come up </joey>
<connor> to you and say, "Do you play Overwatch?" </connor>
<connor> And you're like, "Dead game." </connor>
<garnt> - "Who do you main? </garnt>
<connor> "Who's your Overwatch main?" </connor>
<garnt> - I'm gonna sound like such a fucking boomer right now. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, what even are the popular games right now? </garnt>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> 'Cause like when I think- </joey>
<joey> - No, I feel that. </joey>
<joey> - When I think popular game, I think, you know, </joey>
<garnt> whatever the fad is right now, like Among Us and Fall Guys. </garnt>
<connor> - Well I think, after the Among Us kind of like settled, </connor>
<connor> it definitely became a bit more variety. </connor>
<connor> Like, tends to be quite a lot. </connor>
<connor> Like, Valheim is picking up steam, </connor>
<connor> which is kind of like a re-imagining of Runescape almost. </connor>
<joey> - All I've heard Valheim is is just, like, </joey>
<joey> Minecraft but better graphics. </joey>
<connor> - I heard Runescape mixed with Minecraft. </connor>
<connor> - Oh really? </connor>
<connor> - Apex is obviously had a really big resurgence. </connor>
<connor> Really good numbers. </connor>
<connor> Like, a lot of big streamers are getting back into it. </connor>
<connor> I think Valorant is still doing pretty well. </connor>
<garnt> Leagues, obviously Leagues. </garnt>
<garnt> - League's just always up there. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think CS Go is still the same thing </garnt>
<garnt> where it's always been, </garnt>
<connor> like kind of like, you know, the scrappy little underdog. </connor>
<garnt> - Because I think the thing is, like, </garnt>
<garnt> I look at the top watched games on Twitch, </garnt>
<joey> and they're normally, like, the games </joey>
<joey> that I just never end up playing. </joey>
<joey> So, I don't actually, I never actually know </joey>
<joey> what everyone ends up playing </joey>
<garnt> or what's kind of popular right now. </garnt>
<connor> - We haven't had any massive games recently. </connor>
<joey> After Among Us we haven't really had anything </joey>
<joey> that's stolen the spotlight, I don't think. </joey>
<joey> I could be wrong. </joey>
<joey> I think the last time I spoke about games, </joey>
<joey> I got things very wrong. </joey>
<connor> People gave me shit, and that's fair enough, go ahead. </connor>
<joey> - I feel like the whole idea of, like, you know, </joey>
<joey> like, the most popular game nowadays is a little bit blurred </joey>
<connor> just because, like, anyone can play anything now. </connor>
<joey> - I feel like it's like there's gonna be the top games. </joey>
<connor> Like, chess has had a big resurgence obviously. </connor>
<connor> Bloons Tower Defense 6, man, I'm telling you, man, </connor>
<connor> I'm just kidding. </connor>
<connor> - It's coming. </connor>
<connor> - Everyone's playing it, man. </connor>
<joey> - I'm stepping in before it gets big. </joey>
<garnt> - Fortnite obviously is just Fortnite. </garnt>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<connor> Like, I feel like a lot of games are </connor>
<connor> just kind of like settled. </connor>
<connor> We haven't really had anything that's shaken up. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, I remember for the longest time </garnt>
<garnt> when the League community where everyone was just like, </garnt>
<connor> "Yo, League's dying. </connor>
<connor> "League's dying." </connor>
<connor> - It's never gonna die. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it's never gonna die. </connor>
<connor> It plateaued. </connor>
<connor> But I feel like there's a difference </connor>
<garnt> between something plateauing and something kind of, like- </garnt>
<connor> - Also the League viewership has been, like, </connor>
<connor> pretty consistent. </connor>
<connor> - Just because it plateaus doesn't mean it's, </connor>
<joey> you know, dying. </joey>
<joey> - No, no, no. </joey>
<connor> I mean, League is still like, you know, </connor>
<joey> you can still easily support a billion dollar company </joey>
<joey> with the amount of people playing it, so you know. </joey>
<connor> But it's like, in public discourse, right, and all. </connor>
<joey> - I usually chalk up to whether a game is popular if like- </joey>
<connor> - Minecraft as well. </connor>
<connor> - Like, the younger generation are playing it. </connor>
<joey> - True. </joey>
<connor> - Like, if you go to like a primary school, </connor>
<connor> and they're talking about Apex and Fortnite and Minecraft </connor>
<joey> then it's like, okay, this is like the big games right now. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, it's funny, man. </connor>
<connor> I mean, my mom was telling me, </connor>
<connor> she works in a primary school, </connor>
<connor> she's telling me like one kid got, like, really bullied </connor>
<connor> because he was, like, bad at Fortnite. </connor>
<joey> - No, wasn't there a, there was a story- </joey>
<connor> - Skin as well. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, there was a story in Japan where a kid got bullied </connor>
<joey> because he had the default skin in Fortnite. </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<garnt> - Serves him right. </garnt>
<connor> - Wow. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, I think we've talked about this before, </connor>
<connor> but I've heard the same story as well. </connor>
<joey> - But like, I think Minecraft is definitely </joey>
<joey> probably the biggest. </joey>
<joey> - I'd say Minecraft is still the biggest. </joey>
<connor> - Minecraft's just a juggernaut at this point. </connor>
<connor> - Since the last stream, I've been like, </connor>
<joey> ooh, should I play Minecraft? </joey>
<joey> - Play Minecraft, dude! </joey>
<garnt> - Should I play Minecraft? </garnt>
<joey> - It's deadass so fun. </joey>
<connor> It's so relaxing. </connor>
<connor> - If we all play Minecraft, you guys gotta try Apex. </connor>
<joey> We should do that. </joey>
<joey> We should do, like, a game cultural cross-pollination. </joey>
<joey> - Cross-pollination. </joey>
<joey> - We should do that. </joey>
<connor> Come on. </connor>
<connor> That's what the people want, Garnt. </connor>
<garnt> - You're just never gonna give up on this, are you? </garnt>
<connor> - 'Cause I know if you guys try it, you'll have a good time. </connor>
<joey> I reckon you guys will enjoy it. </joey>
<connor> - Will we? - Yeah, I think you will. </connor>
<connor> - I think every person </connor>
<joey> who offered me an FPS game said the same thing. </joey>
<connor> - 'Cause this is with the boys, so you know. </connor>
<connor> - I heard it about Fortnite. </connor>
<connor> I heard it about Overwatch. </connor>
<connor> I've already talked about this. </connor>
<joey> - We'll give it a shot. </joey>
<connor> We'll give it a shot. </connor>
<connor> We'll try it, guys. </connor>
<connor> Don't worry. </connor>
<connor> I'll convince them </connor>
<connor> - So, I guess switching gears. </connor>
<garnt> Did you guys hear about this, like, deepfake story </garnt>
<garnt> that happened, I think today or yesterday? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yesterday for us, </garnt>
<garnt> but probably like three weeks for the audience. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, three weeks for the audience. </garnt>
<connor> - So, facts may come out and we could be totally wrong. </connor>
<connor> - I have not. </connor>
<connor> - With deepfake becoming such a, </connor>
<connor> like, a bigger thing now, </connor>
<joey> so I can't, </joey>
<joey> we're gonna go back to this! </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<joey> I can't remember every detail of the story, </joey>
<joey> but I think the main gist of it was </joey>
<garnt> there was this mom and she had a daughter </garnt>
<garnt> who was on the cheerleading squad. </garnt>
<connor> - Can we get Meilyne to check the story </connor>
<garnt> while we're talking about it? </garnt>
<garnt> Just Google deepfake news. </garnt>
<connor> It'll be, like, the top story. </connor>
<garnt> - So, I believe there was a mum who had a daughter </garnt>
<garnt> who was on the cheerleading squad. </garnt>
<garnt> And there were other girls on that cheerleading squad, </garnt>
<garnt> and for some reason she wanted the, </garnt>
<connor> she wanted to kick these other girls off of the squad. </connor>
<connor> So, what she did is she made some deepfakes, like, </connor>
<connor> of the other girls. </connor>
<connor> - Like, smoking, drinking- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, like smoking, drinking, </connor>
<joey> doing like bad illegal activities or whatever. </joey>
<connor> And I think threatening them with it. </connor>
<connor> I can't remember if she threatened them </connor>
<connor> or she sent them straight to- </connor>
<connor> - I'm not sure how she did it, but I think they saw it. </connor>
<connor> And the reason why it got even found out was </connor>
<garnt> because they took it to the police. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, a few of them went to the police. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, and how she got found out was </garnt>
<connor> she used the fake number. </connor>
<connor> She used like this internet service </connor>
<garnt> that gave her a fake number, </garnt>
<garnt> but that didn't hide her IP address. </garnt>
<garnt> And that's the only reason she got found out. </garnt>
<garnt> - Cut to the sponsor. </garnt>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<connor> - This episode is sponsored by (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - You know, I don't think she would've got caught </connor>
<joey> if she was sponsored by (laughs) </joey>
<connor> I don't think our sponsor would be very happy. </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<joey> That's why we're not gonna mention any names. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, but I mean, I saw it, and I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> I can't believe it actually took this long </garnt>
<garnt> for something like this to happen. </garnt>
<connor> - You know what the most unbelievable part of the story is? </connor>
<connor> There's a mom out there that's tech savvy enough. </connor>
<connor> - That's what I thought. </connor>
<connor> - I don't even think my mum knows </connor>
<connor> what a fuckin' deepfake is, let alone, </connor>
<connor> she doesn't even know how to search for files on Windows. </connor>
<connor> I'm actually impressed her mum knew how to make a deepfake. </connor>
<garnt> What? </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm impressed that mum knew how to do a deepfake, </garnt>
<garnt> but I'm even more like, </garnt>
<garnt> because, okay, I'm not sure if any of this is confirmed. </garnt>
<garnt> So, I'm gonna put out a disclaimer that- </garnt>
<connor> - We could be totally wrong. </connor>
<connor> Please check the story. - Do your own research. </connor>
<garnt> - By the time this comes out. </garnt>
<joey> All right </joey>
<joey> - I'll check the story while- </joey>
<joey> - By the time this comes out, everything might be confirmed. </joey>
<joey> This might all have been, like, false information </joey>
<joey> or it might've just been, like, claims. </joey>
<joey> But at the time of recording, </joey>
<joey> we don't know if it's real or not. </joey>
<joey> But these are what the allegations are. </joey>
<joey> And the allegation was that she did this </joey>
<joey> because the daughters on the cheerleading squad. </joey>
<garnt> She stopped hanging out with her daughter. </garnt>
<garnt> And so she wanted to get them kicked off because of that. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm just thinking </garnt>
<garnt> if someone's this petty to be this crazy. </garnt>
<garnt> - How dare you not be friends with my daughter. </garnt>
<garnt> - How does she manage to figure out how to do deepfakes? </garnt>
<connor> - She also sent them anonymous messages telling them to, </connor>
<connor> that they should, you know, end their own lives as well </connor>
<connor> to these kids. </connor>
<joey> - The mum did that? </joey>
<joey> - The mum did that. </joey>
<joey> - What the fuck? </joey>
<joey> - This fucking, how, </joey>
<joey> this is some fucking- </joey>
<joey> - Some people are not supposed to be parents. </joey>
<connor> - So like cartoon villainous. </connor>
<connor> Like, it's so absurd that someone can be this fucked. </connor>
<garnt> Oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> But I mean, I saw that, and I'm just thinking, </garnt>
<garnt> my first thought was one, I'm surprised </garnt>
<garnt> that it took this long for something like this to happen. </garnt>
<joey> - This mugshot looks like she's tore someone's face off. </joey>
<connor> - Oh my God! </connor>
<connor> - She looks like a Disney villain. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, Maleficent just ripped someone's face off </connor>
<joey> and stitched it. </joey>
<joey> I shouldn't say that. </joey>
<joey> It's probably going too far, isn't it? </joey>
<joey> Actually no, fuck you! </joey>
<joey> You deserve it! </joey>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<joey> Telling kids to, what? </joey>
<connor> - That actually looks like she's wearing </connor>
<connor> someone else's face. </connor>
<joey> - Oh my God. </joey>
<connor> You know what's more concerning about that? </connor>
<connor> That was someone's parent. </connor>
<connor> Holy fuck. </connor>
<connor> Imagine being raised by someone like that. </connor>
<connor> Holy fuck. </connor>
<connor> That kid's gonna be fucked. </connor>
<garnt> God. </garnt>
<garnt> - But apparently the kid knew nothing. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, the mum did this without telling the kid. </garnt>
<garnt> She did this by herself. </garnt>
<connor> - How would you even tell the kid? </connor>
<connor> Like, "Are you cool with this, kid?" </connor>
<connor> "No, I'm not! </connor>
<connor> "Mum, what's wrong with you?" </connor>
<joey> - There's replying back to a nasty tweet </joey>
<joey> and then there's creating deepfakes. </joey>
<joey> - "Please don't tell my schoolmates </joey>
<garnt> "to go kill themselves and make deepfakes of them." </garnt>
<connor> - When I would tell my mum that I was being bullied, </connor>
<joey> she wasn't thrilled about it, but she was like, you know, </joey>
<joey> "I'm not happy about this. </joey>
<joey> "I'll put in a word to the teacher </joey>
<joey> "but you're on your own kid. </joey>
<connor> "This is your problem." </connor>
<connor> - It's like, "I can't deal with this shit. </connor>
<connor> "I don't even know what's going on." </connor>
<connor> - Like, I mean, fucking hell. </connor>
<connor> - That's scary. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, just so many parts of the story is actually insane </connor>
<garnt> that this could happen. </garnt>
<garnt> It is literally like a horror movie plot. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] It is. </garnt>
<connor> - What? </connor>
<garnt> - This is kinda like, it's almost too cartoony </garnt>
<garnt> to be a "Black Mirror" episode. </garnt>
<connor> - It is, it is. </connor>
<connor> It's so like, </connor>
<connor> if this was a "Black Mirror" episode, </connor>
<joey> you'd be like, "Yeah, twist's really predictable. </joey>
<joey> "Really over the top." </joey>
<joey> - Like B grade horror film. </joey>
<garnt> - The mom's kind of an unbelievable villain here. </garnt>
<garnt> She could have used more character development, </garnt>
<joey> more motivation. </joey>
<joey> No, this is reality. </joey>
<garnt> But what scares me is that, like, </garnt>
<joey> what does this mean for the future of deepfakes now? </joey>
<joey> Because like this week especially, </joey>
<joey> this new app's come up where it's gotten really easy </joey>
<joey> to deep fake, you know. </joey>
<joey> Deepfake, you know, use it for memes, </joey>
<joey> use it for harmless memes </joey>
<garnt> to make people sing fucking Baka Mitai. </garnt>
<connor> - You know, we're used to people doing </connor>
<connor> fucking terrible Photoshops or doing stuff like that. </connor>
<connor> So, if someone sent me a video of me doing </connor>
<connor> something I clearly didn't do or never ever did, </connor>
<connor> I'd be like, "I don't really give a fuck. </connor>
<connor> "It's fake." </connor>
<connor> And I'll say it's fake, </connor>
<connor> and that'll probably be the end of it. </connor>
<connor> But to someone who's never really had anything online </connor>
<connor> or any kind of like, you know, </connor>
<connor> posted anything about themselves </connor>
<joey> outside of their personal Facebook, </joey>
<joey> I can see why receiving a video </joey>
<joey> that looks like you doing something </joey>
<joey> that you didn't do could be fucking terrible. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - You would think that, </joey>
<connor> wow, people are really going to believe this, </connor>
<garnt> even though, you know, realistically </garnt>
<connor> they're probably not going to if you explain that it's fake. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, it's gotten to a point where like, </garnt>
<garnt> for people like us especially where we show our faces </garnt>
<garnt> on camera pretty often, </garnt>
<garnt> it wouldn't be hard to make a convincing deep fake </garnt>
<garnt> with, you know, us coming on camera literally every week. </garnt>
<connor> - I think we all agree on this </connor>
<joey> that you do not have permission to make any deepfakes of us </joey>
<garnt> and we don't condone any of them, by the way, just saying. </garnt>
<connor> You're legally not allowed to do that. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, is there anything legal that's you know, that- </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, you can't, you're not like, </connor>
<joey> I think legally speaking, you can't like just do that. </joey>
<connor> Depending on what jurisdiction you're in. </connor>
<connor> I remember Tom Scott did a video about it. </connor>
<connor> I think the laws around it are a bit iffy </connor>
<garnt> and obviously stuff like this always takes- </garnt>
<garnt> - It's such a new thing. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's a really new thing. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause like, you know, I've seen, like, </connor>
<connor> the Baka Mitai deepfakes. </connor>
<connor> I'm just like, you know, this is a funny meme or whatever. </connor>
<connor> But then I don't know how I would feel if I saw the, like, </connor>
<connor> you know, the KSI Ainsley Harriott deepfake 'cause- </connor>
<connor> - That's so good though. </connor>
<connor> - That's so good. </connor>
<connor> It's funny as fuck, but then- </connor>
<connor> - Also so worrying. </connor>
<joey> - Something at the back of my mind </joey>
<joey> which makes me, like, that's fucking worrying </joey>
<joey> how good it is. </joey>
<joey> And I'm glad it's been used as a funny meme. </joey>
<joey> But my God, if I saw my face on somebody else like that, </joey>
<connor> I would just think, damn, </connor>
<connor> I'm glad this is being used for a funny meme, </connor>
<connor> but this could be used for something that's really- </connor>
<garnt> - Luckily right now as many deepfake things are being made, </garnt>
<joey> there's just as many things that are detecting </joey>
<joey> if deepfakes have been made. </joey>
<joey> Like, programs that are being written to detect them. </joey>
<joey> So, right now it's like, a lot of softwares will detect </joey>
<joey> when it is a deepfake. </joey>
<connor> But whether it will get to the point in the future </connor>
<connor> that there is- </connor>
<garnt> - Do you think like it's only a matter of time </garnt>
<garnt> before we get our first deepfake cancellation? </garnt>
<joey> - No, I think we're quite far away from that. </joey>
<connor> I think they're still too rough </connor>
<connor> and the technology isn't there yet, </connor>
<connor> but I think it's possible within like 10 years. </connor>
<joey> - I've seen some deepfakes </joey>
<joey> that are really fucking convincing though. </joey>
<connor> - But, like, the videos are, like, </connor>
<connor> always in like 480p max. </connor>
<garnt> - But that's kind of the video you would expect for, </garnt>
<joey> I don't know, like the kind of phone quality expose videos. </joey>
<garnt> They're never like 720p 4K. </garnt>
<joey> - It's always like fuckin' PlayStation eye camera quality. </joey>
<connor> - But I think the easier it gets to cancel someone </connor>
<connor> from a deepfake, the less canceling will happen </connor>
<joey> 'cause everyone will be like, "It's a deepfake. </joey>
<joey> "Is it a deep fake?" </joey>
<joey> Or everyone's defense is gonna be, "It's a deepfake." </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. - Right. </connor>
<joey> But, like, how - </joey>
<connor> - "That video of me punching a baby? </connor>
<joey> "Deepfake." </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<connor> - How long until the deepfake argument is going </connor>
<joey> to be legitimate? </joey>
<connor> - I mean, the moment that you can cancel someone </connor>
<connor> for a deepfake is when that argument would come valid. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause they'll be like, "Oh, well you saw that deepfake. </connor>
<joey> "Yeah, it was deepfake." </joey>
<joey> - "It's a really good deepfake. </joey>
<joey> "Looks so real! </joey>
<joey> "Oh my God, I can't believe it myself." </joey>
<joey> - Our world's going to become a lot more messy </joey>
<garnt> when it gets there unfortunately. </garnt>
<connor> But you know. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, what's scary is that there's nothing </garnt>
<joey> to stop the technology being out there. </joey>
<joey> But I mean, I guess you can argue this for a lot of things. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I remember when, you know, 3D printers became a thing </joey>
<connor> and then- </connor>
<connor> - Well, you can still 3D print guns. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, you can still 3D print guns. </connor>
<joey> - You shouldn't, but you can. </joey>
<joey> - You shouldn't, and I believe it's illegal, right? </joey>
<garnt> - Well, it's most- </garnt>
<connor> - The laws around it are real weird I think. </connor>
<connor> - I think what it is is </connor>
<connor> that there's most 3D printing machines can detect </connor>
<joey> if it's, like, the blueprint of a gun or firearm </joey>
<connor> or something and just not- </connor>
<connor> - Well it's like a Photoshop. </connor>
<garnt> If you put a picture of the dollar bill in, </garnt>
<garnt> it won't let you do anything to it. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - It'll, like, stop you. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh really? </garnt>
<garnt> I had no idea. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, so they don't want you to Photoshop it </garnt>
<connor> to like try and like, you know, </connor>
<connor> because the software is so powerful. </connor>
<connor> Photoshop is- </connor>
<joey> - Print out free money, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Photoshop is a really powerful tool, </connor>
<connor> and the stuff that they constantly adding to it, </connor>
<connor> it's just adding to the repertoire of how strong it is. </connor>
<connor> And it's like very concerning. </connor>
<connor> But then again, you know, it's like </connor>
<connor> when Photoshop first started as well, </connor>
<connor> like we were all like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh my God, people are gonna be like, it's crazy. </connor>
<connor> "Everyone's gonna start getting canceled </connor>
<connor> "or they're gonna be, </connor>
<connor> "people are gonna put Nicholas Cage in orgies." </connor>
<connor> Although that's, </connor>
<connor> that's not unrealistic. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - Bad example. </garnt>
<connor> - I can't remember there being a case </connor>
<connor> where someone got in trouble for a Photoshop picture. </connor>
<connor> Like, a big story. </connor>
<joey> Like, because normally, you know, </joey>
<joey> a picture at least, you know, </joey>
<joey> there needs to be a lot more context </joey>
<joey> behind why the picture exists </joey>
<connor> and without reasonable context of </connor>
<connor> why the picture would exist, </connor>
<connor> people aren't really gonna believe it. </connor>
<connor> I feel like it's probably gonna be the same for a video. </connor>
<connor> Like, if there's a video of like, I don't know, </connor>
<connor> like Robert Downey Jr. just like I said, </connor>
<joey> like, punching a kid in like a park or something, </joey>
<joey> it's gonna be like, well, one why is Robert Downey Jr. </joey>
<joey> in a park? </joey>
<connor> Why is he playing basketball with a kid then punching him? </connor>
<joey> The context is gonna be needed. </joey>
<joey> Like, there's gonna be so many questions </joey>
<joey> that are gonna need to be answered </joey>
<connor> before you take a video seriously. </connor>
<joey> - But, like, how long until you do run into like that, </joey>
<joey> you know, perfect situation where it's like, </joey>
<joey> oh, the story is there, the narrative is there, </joey>
<joey> everything lines up. </joey>
<garnt> The only difference is that Robert Downey Jr. didn't </garnt>
<connor> actually punch the kid. </connor>
<joey> But I can make him punch the kid. </joey>
<connor> - It was a hoax. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, fuckin' fake news articles are bad enough already, </joey>
<joey> you know, with how, you know, </joey>
<joey> there are fucking anti-vaxxers and flat earthers </joey>
<joey> and just things that have been enabled </joey>
<connor> because it's so easy to stay in your bubble </connor>
<connor> and really like strengthen your own argument and your own- </connor>
<connor> - It's a worrying time. </connor>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<garnt> - It is definitely a worrying time. </garnt>
<connor> - But I don't let it get to me. </connor>
<joey> I'm trying to enjoy life, you know. </joey>
<connor> - I'm just trying to live my best life. </connor>
<garnt> - The world may be ending, but I'm gonna have a good time. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'ma still laugh at these memes. </garnt>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> - I care about what I need to care about. </connor>
<connor> No more. </connor>
<connor> That's kinda how I like to do it. </connor>
<connor> Like, I just think that after a certain point </connor>
<connor> if you just start worrying about everything, </connor>
<connor> you're just gonna be fucking miserable. </connor>
<connor> And like, I think obviously, you know, </connor>
<connor> when it comes to like, you know, </connor>
<connor> you're voting on your politician, </connor>
<connor> yeah, I think you should care about that </connor>
<connor> and that should matter. </connor>
<connor> But like beyond that, do I care if a news presenter </connor>
<connor> in the US says like something fucking abhorrent? </connor>
<joey> I'm like, no, honestly it's not really my problem, </joey>
<joey> and I don't really give a fuck. </joey>
<joey> Like, maybe that's, I don't know. </joey>
<joey> Is that, like, elitist to think that? </joey>
<joey> - I think it's just- </joey>
<joey> - Outside of my like, like, you know, I don't know. </joey>
<joey> To me like stuff that goes on in the US sometimes I'm like, </joey>
<joey> "That's honestly not my problem." </joey>
<joey> Like, is that bad? </joey>
<joey> Like, some people say that's like a prejudice </joey>
<joey> or ignorant mindset. </joey>
<garnt> Like, I have the luxury. </garnt>
<connor> - It depends on the context, right? </connor>
<connor> Because the problem is that the problem </connor>
<connor> with that argument I feel is </connor>
<joey> that there's no way a human can care </joey>
<joey> about absolutely everything. </joey>
<joey> So, at some point you're going to have to pick </joey>
<joey> and choose what you care about. </joey>
<joey> Otherwise, one, you're probably gonna be a miserable fuck. </joey>
<joey> And two, you're gonna wake up </joey>
<joey> and you're just gonna be exhausted </joey>
<joey> and not gonna be able to do anything in the day </joey>
<garnt> because you just feel flooded. </garnt>
<garnt> And I feel flooded enough </garnt>
<garnt> with my own social media right now. </garnt>
<garnt> And this is me, like, </garnt>
<garnt> where social media is so intertwined with our jobs. </garnt>
<garnt> So, I see this stuff and I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> I can't care about this. </garnt>
<joey> - I'm pretty sure that's how people become nihilists, right? </joey>
<joey> They're just like, they look at the world as like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, the world is shit. </joey>
<joey> "I guess nothing matters anymore." </joey>
<connor> - I mean, it feels like it's just been so much, like, </connor>
<connor> heavier as well ever since the pandemic as well. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause you're just trying to like get by, you know? </connor>
<joey> Life's already difficult enough and then shit's going on, </joey>
<connor> and you're like, fuck, man. </connor>
<joey> Like, I'm literally just trying to be happy </joey>
<connor> for like 10 seconds here. </connor>
<connor> Can I have this? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I kind of feel a bit jealous of our parents </garnt>
<garnt> when they only had to care about the shit </garnt>
<garnt> that was happening around them. </garnt>
<garnt> Now I have to care about shit </garnt>
<garnt> that's happening halfway across the world. </garnt>
<connor> - Like, when I see like, you know, </connor>
<connor> my parents are gonna get fuckin' furious </connor>
<connor> that they changed the bin size of, like, the council </connor>
<connor> by like 10% lower they're like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh my God, this is unreasonable." </connor>
<connor> You know? </connor>
<connor> And like, I just miss the days </connor>
<connor> where I could give a fuck about stupid like that. </connor>
<connor> Now I've got to worry about like, literally like, </connor>
<connor> cultural ending stuff. - Shit that has nothing to do </connor>
<joey> with you, right? </joey>
<connor> - It's just like, I don't know, man. </connor>
<connor> Like, I want to care about everything, </connor>
<connor> and I want to give, like, </connor>
<connor> people who are fighting for like legitimate, like, </connor>
<connor> good fights, I want to help them out. </connor>
<connor> But at the same time, it's like, </connor>
<joey> there's so much fucking shit going on. </joey>
<joey> And obviously the internet's </joey>
<joey> obviously made all the information even more accessible, </joey>
<joey> so there's so many more things to care about. </joey>
<joey> Like, all right checking up on global warming. </joey>
<joey> Don't waste too much food. </joey>
<joey> What's going on over here? </joey>
<joey> What's the, there's a civil war going on in this country </joey>
<joey> and like atrocities happening. </joey>
<connor> How do I, like, legitimately, like, give my energy- </connor>
<connor> - You're literally just explaining how to live. </connor>
<joey> That's just life, isn't it? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, and like, I don't want to be like, </connor>
<connor> "Global warming is more important </connor>
<connor> "than people dying in this country." </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> Where do you draw the line of where to start caring? </connor>
<joey> - I mean, I think you can, like, </joey>
<joey> pick and choose what you care about, </joey>
<joey> but it's the difference between being publicly open </joey>
<joey> about that stuff, right? </joey>
<connor> - I mean, I wouldn't say I don't care about something </connor>
<connor> as much or, like, oh my God, this is so tough to talk about. </connor>
<connor> - It is. </connor>
<connor> - It makes you sound like an asshole </connor>
<joey> if you say you don't give a fuck about, like, </joey>
<joey> Meilyne, what do you think? </joey>
<connor> You're our manager. </connor>
<connor> Will you make sure we don't get canceled? </connor>
<connor> - Are we gonna get canceled for this, Meilyne? </connor>
<connor> But no, no. </connor>
<connor> But no, I totally understand because I feel like </connor>
<connor> that's just part of being human. </connor>
<joey> And you know, there's gonna be people </joey>
<joey> that, you know, make the argument, </joey>
<joey> well, you're privileged enough </joey>
<joey> that you don't have to care about it. </joey>
<joey> But, I would argue that surely, </joey>
<joey> surely you also can't care </joey>
<joey> about every single issue happening in the world </joey>
<garnt> 'cause you feel strongly about this one issue </garnt>
<garnt> because it definitely affects you and I understand that, </garnt>
<garnt> but surely that means that you can't put the energy </garnt>
<garnt> into caring about another issue. </garnt>
<joey> - I don't think there's any person out there living any type </joey>
<joey> of life, like, you know, prejudice or not prejudice, </joey>
<joey> privileged or not, </joey>
<joey> who can deadass be in a position where it's like, </joey>
<joey> right now everything in the world I need to worry about </joey>
<connor> because it's important to me. </connor>
<connor> Like, it doesn't matter who you are. </connor>
<joey> Like, there's gonna be one piece of news </joey>
<joey> where you're just like, "That has nothing to do with me." </joey>
<joey> - Something that resonates with you, </joey>
<joey> that you like really believe in </joey>
<joey> and that you fight towards like helping that, </joey>
<joey> like I'm down with that, man. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> At least you're fighting towards something. </connor>
<joey> That's better than someone just getting up </joey>
<joey> in the morning being like, </joey>
<joey> "I don't care about any of this shit." </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I mean, like, it's, </connor>
<connor> it doesn't really bother me much </connor>
<connor> when people get like angry about, you know, </connor>
<joey> "Oh my God, you don't care about this." </joey>
<joey> But I hate people who are like, </joey>
<joey> "You don't care enough about this specific thing." </joey>
<joey> Like, "You should be so angry about this thing." </joey>
<connor> And I'm like, man, I am literally just trying to get by. </connor>
<joey> - What dictates like the quantitative worth of </joey>
<connor> how much you care about something? </connor>
<connor> - There's always some people who are willing </connor>
<joey> to get, like, outraged and, like, </joey>
<joey> really light a fire up their ass for something, you know? </joey>
<joey> And like, you know, obviously we need people like that. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, of course. </joey>
<connor> - Otherwise shit doesn't get done. </connor>
<joey> - You can't expect everyone to be like that. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, but then I hate it </connor>
<connor> when I see people, like, blackmailing other people being </connor>
<connor> like, "You should care more. </connor>
<garnt> "You should care so much more about this." </garnt>
<garnt> - Because the problem with the argument is </garnt>
<garnt> that there's no way to frame it without the person </garnt>
<garnt> who, you know, cares less about the topic. </garnt>
<garnt> There's no way to frame the argument </garnt>
<garnt> without making them, like, look good </garnt>
<garnt> because it's just, okay, you don't care about it. </garnt>
<garnt> Therefore you are the asshole </garnt>
<garnt> because you don't care about this important issue. </garnt>
<joey> And I feel like, can we just accept that we are all human? </joey>
<joey> You know? </joey>
<joey> We are all just trying to get by. </joey>
<joey> Everyone has different issues. </joey>
<joey> Some matter more than others, </joey>
<joey> but it's a lack of empathy. </joey>
<joey> You know, we, </joey>
<joey> in order to empathize with your problem, </joey>
<joey> you at least have to give us some empathy as well, you know? </joey>
<joey> And, I feel like </joey>
<joey> there's just, like, a lack of empathy in that sense </joey>
<connor> in that kind of argument. </connor>
<connor> - I'd like to think if I'm being ignorant on any of this, </connor>
<connor> that, you know, it won't result in fuckin' </connor>
<garnt> "let's cancel the boys" </garnt>
<joey> but just let me know down below. </joey>
<joey> I will read the comments. </joey>
<joey> So, if I am missing any big point here </joey>
<joey> or I'm being ignorant, please do let me know </joey>
<connor> 'cause I would like to change my mindset. </connor>
<joey> - I don't think it's ignorance personally. </joey>
<connor> I think it's just like being honest. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, I'm exactly the same. </garnt>
<joey> I try to keep as open-minded as possible about everything, </joey>
<joey> and I've, you know, I've definitely changed my viewpoints </joey>
<garnt> on certain topics thanks to what people have said </garnt>
<connor> and what's been discussed. </connor>
<connor> - There was one person who, </connor>
<connor> 'cause I think someone tweeted at me and was like, </connor>
<connor> "Connor, you shouldn't say the word crackhead </connor>
<connor> "as like a descriptive word. </connor>
<garnt> "It's a bad word." </garnt>
<connor> 'Cause it apparently has to do with a lot of, you know, </connor>
<connor> like racial stereotyping back in the war on drugs in America </connor>
<connor> and stuff and it's used as a derogatory term. </connor>
<garnt> So, I just stopped saying it. </garnt>
<connor> That was just 'cause someone tweeted at me saying, </connor>
<garnt> "stop saying it." </garnt>
<joey> And I was like, well I don't really need this word. </joey>
<joey> Like, you know, 'cause I said it a lot on the podcast, </joey>
<joey> and you know, I realized afterwards I'm like, yeah, </joey>
<joey> I mean, there's like way better ways to describe that, </joey>
<joey> that feeling I was trying to get across without using that. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, yeah, I don't really need to use that word. </joey>
<joey> I haven't said it since on like podcast or anything. </joey>
<joey> So, I'm like, oh, I haven't said it ever </joey>
<joey> and I just don't feel the need to, </joey>
<joey> and I'm like, cool, thanks for letting me know, commenter. </joey>
<joey> Like, if I have a bad habit, let me know. </joey>
<joey> I'll try and get rid of it. </joey>
<joey> If you're like, "Connor, you're fat." </joey>
<connor> Fuck you. </connor>
<connor> I'm working on it. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<joey> Other things, okay. </joey>
<connor> - The ones I hate the most are, </connor>
<connor> "Connor, you got fatter." </connor>
<joey> It's like, wow, thanks. </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<connor> - That's always rough 'cause that's like, oh my God, yeah. </connor>
<joey> I just feel bad for people in that situation. </joey>
<joey> It's rough. </joey>
<joey> Comments be brutal sometimes. </joey>
<joey> Comments really do pick apart like everything. </joey>
<connor> But it's cool though because sometimes you miss something. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<joey> I feel like having a good balance is the healthy thing </joey>
<joey> because you have to find this balance </joey>
<joey> between knowing that you can't please everyone </joey>
<joey> and finding a balance between, okay, </joey>
<joey> this person's making a legitimate point. </joey>
<garnt> I can change my behavior because, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> they're making a sound argument and I completely understand. </garnt>
<joey> - The comment section for the yes-men is </joey>
<joey> just kind of boring, isn't it? </joey>
<connor> - You know, people have that, you know, </connor>
<connor> whenever I read comments about "Trash Taste" </connor>
<joey> it'll be like, "Oh, I fucking hate Joey," </joey>
<joey> or "I fucking hate Connor." </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, well, I mean, I get it. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause it's like, I guess we're like characters. </joey>
<connor> - It's all good, dude. </connor>
<connor> - You have your favorite. </connor>
<connor> I get it. </connor>
<connor> - If you got your favorite, it's all good, dude. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> But then sometimes they go a little too far with it, like, </connor>
<joey> "Man, I wish Connor would just fuckin' quit the podcast." </joey>
<joey> - Oh, sorry, that's not gonna happen any time soon. </joey>
<joey> - It's not gonna happen. </joey>
<connor> But like, if it did, do you think everyone wants that? </connor>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<connor> - There are some that are just like, </connor>
<connor> "Man, I wish Connor would just deck Garnt in the face." </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> Or other way around. </connor>
<connor> - I will off camera. </connor>
<connor> - I'm just like, wow, is this how friends act? </connor>
<connor> At least wait 'til the "Trash Taste" special </connor>
<connor> where we decide to have a boxing match or something. </connor>
<connor> Not that we have anything planned. </connor>
<garnt> - Boxing special? </garnt>
<joey> - Boxing match confirmed? </joey>
<joey> Confirmed? </joey>
<joey> - I'd actually unironically love to be </joey>
<joey> in like a YouTuber boxing match </joey>
<joey> 'cause I just think like, one, </joey>
<joey> Meilyne's like getting ideas right now. </joey>
<joey> That multi-million dollar idea. </joey>
<connor> I wish I could bring in multi-million. </connor>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause like, one, you get an excuse to train. </connor>
<joey> You can probably hire a personal coach, you know? </joey>
<joey> I'd probably get in mad shape for that. </joey>
<connor> And it'd probably be fun. </connor>
<connor> I'd play the villain. </connor>
<connor> I'd love that. </connor>
<connor> That'd be so much fun. </connor>
<connor> But who would I fight though? </connor>
<connor> You know, that's the thing. </connor>
<connor> I haven't got any enemies, </connor>
<connor> so I should start beef with someone else. </connor>
<connor> - Stop flexing. </connor>
<connor> - What? </connor>
<connor> Is not having enemies like something to brag about? </connor>
<connor> Like, "Man, Connor, doesn't hate anyone." </connor>
<joey> - I mean, I didn't even ask for enemies and I have enemies. </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, enemy's a very strong word. </garnt>
<connor> - There's probably some people who dislike me, </connor>
<joey> but, like, I don't have any like open beef </joey>
<joey> with anyone on YouTube. </joey>
<joey> I mean, I don't really fuckin' do anything. </joey>
<connor> I just kinda just do my own thing. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, there's a difference between having YouTuber beef </garnt>
<garnt> and having actual real beef </garnt>
<garnt> where you have a big problem with someone. </garnt>
<connor> - What's like, what would you categorize </connor>
<connor> like the KSI Logan Paul stuff? </connor>
<connor> Just pure YouTube beef? </connor>
<joey> - That has to be YouTube beef, right? </joey>
<joey> It was so over the top. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, I don't like- </garnt>
<connor> - I think they hated each other, </connor>
<joey> and I think along the way they started liking- </joey>
<connor> - I'm pretty sure it started as legitimate beef. </connor>
<connor> And then they were like, "Hold on, bro. </connor>
<connor> "We can make money off this." </connor>
<joey> - Tens of millions. </joey>
<connor> Hold on, hold the phone. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, I feel like the line is blurred </garnt>
<joey> where you have a financial incentive to have beef. </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<garnt> If they're just like shit talking- </garnt>
<garnt> - I can see the light bulb, like, </garnt>
<connor> over Meilyne's head right now just like lighting up, bro. </connor>
<joey> - She's like, she has a POG face right now. </joey>
<joey> - They made like over like what? </joey>
<garnt> 20, $30 million each? </garnt>
<connor> - Something like that. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause it's not actually beef, </connor>
<garnt> like personal beef about anything that really matters. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, no one told one of their moms to go fuck themselves </garnt>
<garnt> or like, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, the insults were, </garnt>
<joey> the fuckin' pre-match like beef, like, </joey>
<joey> shit talking things were the best part </joey>
<joey> of the boxing matches. </joey>
<joey> They were so bad at talking shit to each other. </joey>
<joey> - It was like wrestling levels. </joey>
<garnt> - Way worse. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no, wrestling has good shit talking. </garnt>
<connor> - I've seen some wrestling beef like talking where I'm like- </connor>
<joey> - Kindergarten insults. </joey>
<joey> "Like, my dad works for Microsoft." </joey>
<connor> "Well, my dad works for Sony." </connor>
<joey> - "My dad is Nintendo." </joey>
<connor> - "My dad knows Shigeru Miyamoto." </connor>
<garnt> It's like what? </garnt>
<garnt> - "Well my dad is Shigeru Miyamoto." </garnt>
<garnt> - "My dad's Goku." </garnt>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Just like, yeah, watching, </connor>
<connor> and if you didn't give a about any of the YouTube boxing, </connor>
<garnt> it was quite entertaining as much as- </garnt>
<garnt> - It was entertaining to watch. </garnt>
<garnt> - I paid for the pay-per-view cause I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> you know what? </garnt>
<connor> If he can make this a thing on YouTube, I'm more than happy. </connor>
<garnt> - I paid for it because I'm just like, you know what? </garnt>
<connor> You are making entertainment. </connor>
<connor> I fuckin' get that. </connor>
<garnt> I'm watching a clown fiesta, </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm paying to watch the circus, </garnt>
<garnt> but I'll pay to watch the circus. </garnt>
<connor> - I want more of this. </connor>
<connor> I think this is great for YouTube. </connor>
<connor> And also for boxing, it did like wonders. </connor>
<connor> And it was like- </connor>
<connor> - It's like the Renaissance of boxing. </connor>
<joey> - For the people in our age group. </joey>
<joey> - For people who didn't care about it. </joey>
<joey> - My dad loves boxing. </joey>
<joey> And then my dad's age bracket love boxing. </joey>
<joey> They love it. </joey>
<joey> But like, you know, under 30 and I think mid thirties, </joey>
<joey> they don't fuckin' give a shit about boxing. </joey>
<joey> A lot of people don't. </joey>
<joey> I mean, I'm sure there's a good segment of people </joey>
<garnt> who probably love boxing and MMA and all that. </garnt>
<garnt> But it wasn't like nearly as popular </garnt>
<connor> as it used to be with our age group, at least. </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause boxing was like, you know, </garnt>
<joey> some of the most classic moments </joey>
<joey> in sports are boxing matches, </joey>
<joey> like anything like "Rumble in the Jungle," </joey>
<joey> you know. anything with Muhammad Ali. </joey>
<joey> - Iconic. </joey>
<joey> - Fuckin' iconic to this day. </joey>
<joey> And you know, I grew up in an era </joey>
<garnt> where I didn't even watch any boxing match, I don't think. </garnt>
<garnt> I didn't watch boxing matches. </garnt>
<joey> - I don't think I've ever sat down </joey>
<joey> and watched a boxing match in my life. </joey>
<connor> - I watched 'cause my dad loved watching it, </connor>
<connor> and he'd be like, "Man, this guy is fighting this guy </connor>
<connor> "for the world heavyweight." </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "Who are these people?" </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause if you're a kid and your parents weren't into it </garnt>
<garnt> then how the fuck can you afford to watch the pay-per-view? </garnt>
<garnt> Like, there's no way you could watch it. </garnt>
<connor> And it's always in American time. </connor>
<connor> So, it's always at like 3:00 AM. </connor>
<connor> - And you had to pay for like Sky, </connor>
<connor> which was already like 40 pounds a month, </connor>
<joey> and you pay an extra 20 pounds on top </joey>
<joey> to get the pay-per-view. </joey>
<joey> It was just, yeah, it was- </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Crazy. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I mean, I don't know. </joey>
<joey> It's like, what do you think about the whole, </joey>
<joey> I don't know if this is changing gears too fast, </joey>
<joey> but what do you think about the whole thing </joey>
<joey> where everyone's like, man, they're ruining like boxing </joey>
<joey> by bringing in these influencers to it? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause it's happened with chess as well. </joey>
<joey> - By bringing in these, like, non-traditional- </joey>
<connor> - Like, you bring in, like, you know, you kind of, </connor>
<connor> I guess the way they would argue is, like, </connor>
<connor> you're diluting, like, the sport. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't understand how putting more eyes </garnt>
<garnt> onto a sport ruins it. </garnt>
<garnt> Because the whole point of keeping a sport alive is </garnt>
<garnt> that a sport is kept alive by how many viewers watch it. </garnt>
<connor> - I mean, there's a side of it where I can understand, </connor>
<connor> like, you know, for chess, like, </connor>
<connor> at least, you know what, if you start at age 12, </connor>
<connor> and then you're like 30 now. </connor>
<connor> You're a Grandmaster. </connor>
<connor> You've literally been playing your whole life for chess. </connor>
<connor> You're about to, like, </connor>
<connor> this is your time to shine. </connor>
<connor> And then fuckin' PogChamps has like, you know, </connor>
<connor> 20, 30 times more viewers than anything you ever will get. </connor>
<connor> I could understand why they're mad. </connor>
<garnt> - That just sounds like a villain protagonist </garnt>
<connor> to some sports anime. </connor>
<connor> - Yes, I understand why- </connor>
<garnt> - A bit of backstory to some sports anime. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's super easy to understand why they would get mad, </garnt>
<garnt> but then, you know, if you, </garnt>
<joey> it's like a YouTube video. </joey>
<joey> If I make a YouTube video and I'm a small YouTuber, </joey>
<joey> about this Mike Wazowski figure. </joey>
<joey> And then Garnt who has, you know, a million, </joey>
<joey> let's say Garnt has 3 million. </joey>
<joey> And a YouTuber with 10,000 makes a video </joey>
<joey> about Mike Wazowski. </joey>
<joey> Garnt pretty much does like nearly a one for one video, </joey>
<joey> you know, but in Garnt's style, right? </joey>
<joey> Yes, that guy will be angry. </joey>
<joey> He's like, "Garnt just made my video, </joey>
<joey> "but to a bigger audience. </joey>
<connor> "He's going to get all the views." </connor>
<connor> What you're not seeing is a huge kick </connor>
<connor> that you're going to get a bunch of trickle-down views, </connor>
<joey> and that's what's gonna happen with all the stuff. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, you're not gonna see the immediate results of, </joey>
<connor> you know, getting the trickle down effect </connor>
<connor> from all these massive events with like normies, </connor>
<connor> if you will. </connor>
<joey> - Right, but I think the problem is </joey>
<joey> that most of these "purists" don't see it </joey>
<connor> as a trickle down effect. </connor>
<connor> They just see it as like sloppy seconds. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, well they see it as like </connor>
<connor> you're ruining the sanctity of my sport. </connor>
<joey> - It's like, "I wanted all the guys to come to me first." </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> But you know, it's, you know, again, </connor>
<connor> more eyes, more sponsor money. </connor>
<connor> It's all good. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, I think we talked about this, like, </garnt>
<garnt> two weeks ago where you have to evolve with the times. </garnt>
<connor> And you have to find a way to garner interest in your sport. </connor>
<joey> - Keep up or get left behind. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I mean, you know, sports like boxing </connor>
<connor> and chess are lucky that they've had such a good history </connor>
<joey> and a good legacy where that has, like, </joey>
<joey> kind of carried them a bit in the modern age </joey>
<joey> where they have like a solid fan base. </joey>
<joey> But obviously, you know, if they want to modernize </joey>
<joey> to a point where they want </joey>
<garnt> to bring in a bunch of new viewers, you got to mix it up. </garnt>
<garnt> And chess is having like a massive Renaissance now. </garnt>
<garnt> It's huge. - Yeah, I'm happy for chess. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like, chess streamers the biggest one's, </garnt>
<joey> Hikaru's pulling in like plus 25K I think a stream. </joey>
<joey> Like, and a bunch of the other bigger ones pulling in, </joey>
<connor> like, over 5K viewers on Twitch which is nuts. </connor>
<connor> - Like, you know, just because you're, like, </connor>
<joey> pulling new viewers I feel like that doesn't, like, </joey>
<connor> dilute the history that has already been built. </connor>
<connor> Like, people are still gonna look back </connor>
<joey> to, like, the greats of the time once they get into it. </joey>
<joey> - There's still the greats going on right now. </joey>
<connor> It's just people don't like that they're not the ones </connor>
<connor> that are solely being talked about. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, I think one of the big things is that I think, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know, I might be talking out my ass. </garnt>
<garnt> But it seems like a lot of the younger generations are less, </garnt>
<garnt> there's less of a focus on sports, </garnt>
<joey> and more people are like getting into, like, video games </joey>
<joey> and stuff like that. </joey>
<joey> Like, we literally talked about how my nephew got bullied </joey>
<joey> because he wanted to play sports </joey>
<joey> but everyone was playing Fortnite. </joey>
<joey> Whereas when I was growing up- </joey>
<joey> - The other the way around. </joey>
<joey> - It was the other way around. </joey>
<joey> The cool kids were playing sport, </joey>
<joey> and that's why sports had such, like, so many eyes on it. </joey>
<joey> And now I think because less kids might be interested </joey>
<garnt> in sports, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> you have to find a new way to appeal to a younger audience. </garnt>
<garnt> Otherwise they're just not gonna give a shit </garnt>
<garnt> at the end of the day. </garnt>
<connor> - This is gonna sound weird. </connor>
<connor> But I think that video games are </connor>
<garnt> now more accessible than sports. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think that's why they're doing better. </garnt>
<joey> Like, if you want to play a game of rugby or football, </joey>
<joey> you need what? </joey>
<joey> Like, at least five a side. </joey>
<joey> You need a lot of people to get that done. </joey>
<joey> - And a lot of space. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, a lot of space. </joey>
<joey> Like, anyone can play a video game on their smartphone </joey>
<joey> or whatever, and anyone can download chess. </joey>
<joey> - Anyone can play Madden. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, like, it's like, you know, a lot of the sports, </joey>
<joey> like I love swimming, </joey>
<joey> but like finding a swimming pool in Japan is so hard. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, without paying out the ass, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, and there's not one anywhere near us. </connor>
<connor> And like, I don't fuckin' know where to go. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, there's like gyms that have them, </joey>
<joey> but you have to pay, like, 150 bucks a month to access them. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, most sports that I liked as a kid, </joey>
<joey> I realized how lucky I was that there was like, </joey>
<joey> in the UK you have so many sports centers all around </joey>
<joey> where you can do this, </joey>
<joey> but now I'm like, it's so hard to do the sports </joey>
<joey> that I want to do and get into it. </joey>
<joey> - I want to get back into sports. </joey>
<joey> I don't know why. </joey>
<joey> - And get like a newer generation into them. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause it's like, I mean, I'm not being funny. </joey>
<joey> How are you gonna convince a kid to go play golf </joey>
<connor> when he can play Mario golf? </connor>
<connor> It's so accessible. </connor>
<connor> So easy. </connor>
<garnt> - And the problem is golf looks so boring. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm sorry, but golf, like, I can not. </garnt>
<garnt> There are some sports where I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> I do not understand how people can watch this </garnt>
<garnt> and be entertained because, </garnt>
<garnt> like, I've played golf before. </garnt>
<connor> 'Cause like I used to like live kind of near a driving range </connor>
<connor> and it's just, so I had a period </connor>
<connor> where I just really enjoyed playing golf. </connor>
<connor> It was really satisfying to like smack the ball. </connor>
<connor> Wasn't rich enough to afford my own golf clubs, so (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Another barrier to entry. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> That's my barrier to entry. </connor>
<connor> But it's really fun to play golf. </connor>
<garnt> My God, it's so boring to watch! </garnt>
<connor> - I can not watch a golf game. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, I'm sure the people who are watching this </garnt>
<connor> who love watching golf, and I'm sorry to disappoint. </connor>
<joey> - But, like, there's so many sports like that though. </joey>
<garnt> Like, I used to play tennis like a lot. </garnt>
<joey> But I can not sit down and watch a tennis match. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, I don't know, I can. </garnt>
<joey> - Some games are so good though. </joey>
<garnt> But they are long. </garnt>
<garnt> They are long. </garnt>
<garnt> - They are very long. </garnt>
<garnt> - But I find it just so weird </garnt>
<joey> and interesting how, like, I myself love playing the sport </joey>
<connor> and yet I can't bear to sit down and watch the sport. </connor>
<connor> Like, you'd think if someone played the sport, </connor>
<joey> they would be just as interested to watch it as well. </joey>
<connor> - No, not always. </connor>
<connor> Because the inverse is also true as well </connor>
<connor> where I might, like, have no interest in playing the sport, </connor>
<joey> but I love watching it. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah. </joey>
<joey> That's more common I feel. - Like, Garnt with League. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, like me with League. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Is that a sport? </connor>
<joey> Ooh. </joey>
<garnt> - Ooh! </garnt>
<garnt> But yeah, I mean, like for example, I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> There's always gonna be, like, massive sports, </garnt>
<garnt> like football. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's not gonna go away. </garnt>
<garnt> That's, like, too deeply ingrained. </garnt>
<joey> But I feel like that's why the Olympics are so weird to me. </joey>
<joey> Because you end up watching a load of these sports </joey>
<joey> which you would in any other circumstances have no interest </joey>
<joey> in watching, but it's the Olympics. </joey>
<joey> Does anyone want to watch like men's volleyball? </joey>
<garnt> Anyone? </garnt>
<joey> - I never gave a shit about archery </joey>
<joey> until I watch it in the Olympics. </joey>
<connor> - There are a lot of sports that are interesting </connor>
<joey> when you have them or you experience them </joey>
<joey> once every four years. </joey>
<joey> And your country's kind of in the race. </joey>
<connor> 'Cause you gotta a horse to root for, right? </connor>
<connor> You know, I don't think archery week by week </connor>
<connor> Monday night archery, you know. </connor>
<connor> You know, you gotta build storylines. </connor>
<joey> You gotta build up characters. </joey>
<connor> - The Olympics definitely opened my eyes </connor>
<connor> to, like, some sports being really- </connor>
<connor> - Like, handball. </connor>
<connor> I never fuckin' saw handball before. </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God, curling. </connor>
<connor> I fucking love watching curling. </connor>
<connor> - Curling is fun to watch. </connor>
<joey> - I never thought I'd be into it. </joey>
<joey> But I was like, you know what? </joey>
<joey> This is hype as fuck. </joey>
<garnt> I don't know why. </garnt>
<connor> - Curling is like a Mario Party game </connor>
<connor> that actually turned into a real sport. </connor>
<joey> - It's like a mini game. </joey>
<connor> But, like, every round is curling. </connor>
<connor> - Literally, by accident. </connor>
<connor> They're like, "Let's just fucking make it real." </connor>
<joey> - That's one sport I really want to play, </joey>
<connor> like try out. </connor>
<joey> Is there like a sport that you've never done </joey>
<joey> that you want to try? </joey>
<connor> - Speed ice skating. </connor>
<connor> It looks so cool. </connor>
<joey> - That seems so dangerous. </joey>
<joey> - I thought of that 'cause there was </joey>
<connor> somebody who watches "Trash Taste" reached out to me </connor>
<connor> on Twitter, and I was like, </connor>
<connor> 'cause they were verified and they had like 1,000 followers. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, what the fuck? </connor>
<joey> And they were like- </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Sports? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, they were a pro ice skater in like America? </connor>
<connor> Canada? </connor>
<connor> And they're like, "Yeah, I love Trash Taste." </connor>
<connor> And they were on the Olympic team. </connor>
<connor> - Oh wow. </connor>
<connor> - For like ice skating. </connor>
<connor> And they watched us. </connor>
<connor> I think ice skating is real cool. </connor>
<connor> Real cool. </connor>
<connor> Teach me. </connor>
<connor> Nah, I love ice skating. </connor>
<connor> I'd love to like go fast and do it. </connor>
<connor> But that's too dangerous. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it's dangerous as fuck. </connor>
<connor> - I'd slam my face. </connor>
<connor> - I'd have to, like, get past that mental barrier </connor>
<connor> of just like, you know when you reach a certain speed </connor>
<garnt> and especially if you're not used to it </garnt>
<garnt> you have to get past that barrier of just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "I'm going a bit too fast now. </garnt>
<connor> "If I fall, it's really gonna hurt." </connor>
<connor> - You know what Olympic sport I want to exist </connor>
<connor> but will never exist is like, </connor>
<joey> you know when you go to like Round One here </joey>
<joey> and you get the Zorb ball around you? </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah! </joey>
<joey> - It's like football where you're wearing, like, </joey>
<joey> the balls where you can just run into each other. </joey>
<joey> That'd be such a fun Olympic sport. </joey>
<joey> - Imagine just like 18 people on the field </joey>
<joey> just fucking crashing into each other. </joey>
<garnt> - Honestly if you ever come to Japan, come to Round One </garnt>
<connor> 'cause most Round One have this. </connor>
<connor> You're gonna see it on screen. </connor>
<joey> - It's spo-cha, right? </joey>
<joey> - It's spo-cha yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So you're gonna see it on screen now. </joey>
<garnt> You can easily get access to this. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah, they're everywhere. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] And then a lot of Round Ones in Japan. </garnt>
<connor> - [Connor] They had like BB gun shooting. </connor>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah, it's surprisingly. </garnt>
<garnt> I remember when we did it right in the fuckin' summer, </garnt>
<garnt> which was a fuckin' stupid move. </garnt>
<joey> - Right after we had like the biggest bowl of curry. </joey>
<joey> We were like, we were in the fuckin' Zorb ball </joey>
<connor> just like rolling around. </connor>
<connor> We're just like, "Oh, I'm gonna throw up." </connor>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<joey> - It's surprisingly, it was surprisingly- </joey>
<joey> - We should go back there. </joey>
<joey> We haven't been there in so long. </joey>
<joey> - It was surprisingly fucking tiring to do that though. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It looks really light to just run around. </joey>
<joey> No, it's not. </joey>
<joey> It is kinda like playing a Mario Party game. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause like, it feels like, </joey>
<connor> 'cause you're playing football </connor>
<connor> but it's got this like really janky physics engine. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> It's like trying to drive a car in like Cyberpunk. </connor>
<connor> - Custom game mode. </connor>
<garnt> - Like, big head mode where you're just fuckin' top heavy. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's literally Gang Beast controls. </garnt>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, fun as fuck. </garnt>
<joey> - I'd love that to be a sport. </joey>
<garnt> - Are you guys gonna go watch any of the Olympic sports </garnt>
<garnt> if it happens this year? </garnt>
<joey> - How the fuck do I apply? </joey>
<joey> - Supposedly now that like, </joey>
<garnt> I think it's been confirmed </garnt>
<joey> that they're not gonna bring any foreigners in. </joey>
<connor> So, but, you can go see it at the stadium </connor>
<connor> which means there's gonna be way more available seats </connor>
<connor> for the actual Olympics. </connor>
<connor> I kind of want to do it just because like- </connor>
<connor> - Do you know how to get tickets? </connor>
<connor> - I'm gonna look into it. </connor>
<connor> - I have no idea. </connor>
<connor> - Because, like, if I can find it out, </connor>
<joey> then I'd want to go just to say I've been. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, the only time I've ever seen tickets available, </connor>
<connor> the only way you could win it was by buying something </connor>
<connor> from Panasonic and you get entered into a lottery. </connor>
<connor> Which of maybe you'll get the right to buy it. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, that sounds like a very Japanese- </garnt>
<garnt> - That sounds like a Japanese thing to do. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't wanna buy Panasonic. </connor>
<connor> I want a ticket to the Olympics. </connor>
<garnt> - Because this would be the second time </garnt>
<joey> that I've lived in a city where the Olympics was held </joey>
<joey> 'cause I was there for London. </joey>
<connor> - I wasn't there in London. </connor>
<garnt> - You weren't there in London? </garnt>
<connor> - I was in Wales at that time. </connor>
<garnt> - So, yeah, I was living in London at the time. </garnt>
<garnt> And yeah, I mean, I... </garnt>
<garnt> During the normal Olympics things just, like, </garnt>
<garnt> get super, super busy, </garnt>
<garnt> and I don't really like crowds that much anyway. </garnt>
<garnt> So, like, I didn't want to go through the hassle of going </garnt>
<garnt> to a sporting event. </garnt>
<joey> And I don't know. </joey>
<joey> I didn't care enough about the sport for me to want to go </joey>
<joey> to this big sporting event where I, </joey>
<joey> you know, I literally just said, </joey>
<joey> the Olympics is where you watch sports </joey>
<joey> you normally don't care about, </joey>
<joey> but you watch it 'cause it's the Olympics. </joey>
<joey> So, I don't even know what sports I would want to watch. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know, I feel like- </joey>
<connor> - Would you just want to watch any sport? </connor>
<garnt> - But also, what if you watch a sport, </garnt>
<joey> but it's like a bad game, like it's a bad matchup. </joey>
<joey> It's like a stomp. </joey>
<joey> It'd be like America versus like Venezuela in basketball. </joey>
<joey> Like, it's like, oh, come on. </joey>
<connor> - Obviously Venezuela's gonna crush. </connor>
<connor> - Obviously, obviously. </connor>
<connor> - No, I feel like, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> With those kinds of stuff, </connor>
<connor> I feel it's just you go to just enjoy the atmosphere, </connor>
<connor> you know? </connor>
<connor> 'Cause like I remember- </connor>
<connor> - How many have you been? </connor>
<joey> - I've never been to the Olympics, but- </joey>
<connor> - So, how would you know the atmosphere's good? </connor>
<joey> - Because, well, I mean every other sporting event I've been </joey>
<connor> to has been, 'cause, like, </connor>
<joey> I remember I went to go watch, like- </joey>
<connor> - But like Japanese atmosphere though in a crowd, </connor>
<connor> they're not very rowdy, are they? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - That's not true. </joey>
<joey> I went to go see the baseball here, </joey>
<joey> and it was really, really fun. </joey>
<joey> I mean, it was a shit game. </joey>
<joey> - Really? </joey>
<joey> What was fun about it? </joey>
<joey> I say this having been to a baseball game in the US </joey>
<garnt> and I kind of found it a bit boring. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh, really? </connor>
<connor> - You don't love the kiss cam, Garnt? </connor>
<connor> What? </connor>
<joey> - I feel, okay, okay, this might be a bit biased </joey>
<joey> 'cause I actually quite enjoy watching the baseball </joey>
<joey> every now and then. </joey>
<garnt> - I also don't enjoy cricket either. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just making an enemy of, like, the US, </garnt>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> Australia, India now. </connor>
<connor> Who else? </connor>
<garnt> - All the sports. </garnt>
<joey> They all suck. </joey>
<joey> No, well, 'cause, like, </joey>
<joey> I remember I went to go watch a rugby game </joey>
<connor> and it's like I'm not huge into the rugby, but- </connor>
<connor> - Watching rugby games is fun though. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, on the TV. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, and in person. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> I went to go watch the rugby, and it's like, </garnt>
<connor> it was a shit game 'cause our team got fuckin' destroyed, </connor>
<connor> but I still had a really fun time </connor>
<connor> just because of the atmosphere. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, everyone's rowdy. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, but baseball was the same thing as well. </connor>
<garnt> Like, my team was losing, but I didn't really give a fuck, </garnt>
<joey> 'cause it was just, I don't know, it was just fun. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, 'cause like how we had fun was just getting </garnt>
<connor> very, very drunk. </connor>
<connor> It was in Milwaukee- </connor>
<connor> - That's typically what you do. </connor>
<connor> - And like everyone was just very drunk, </connor>
<connor> and it was just like, </connor>
<connor> "I don't know what the fuck's going on. </connor>
<connor> "I'm having a good time now though 'cause I'm pretty drunk." </connor>
<connor> - "Yes, please, another Miller Lite." </connor>
<joey> - "Yes, I'll pay for another eight dollar hot dog." </joey>
<connor> - "Oh, yes, this hot dog that is not meat, I'll have that." </connor>
<connor> - I don't know, </connor>
<garnt> I just like having an active component to my sport, I guess. </garnt>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> How can I say this? </joey>
<joey> I don't like when sports are stop starts. </joey>
<joey> You know? </joey>
<garnt> I like it to be, like- </garnt>
<joey> - So you're not into like the NFL? </joey>
<joey> - Oh my God, bro, watching NFL is hard. </joey>
<joey> The amount of ads they have. </joey>
<joey> - But, it's also very stop start heavy game. </joey>
<garnt> - But like, I feel like the NFL is like, </garnt>
<garnt> I can get into the NFL </garnt>
<garnt> because when the game is in motion, </garnt>
<garnt> like, it's hard to find a sport as exciting as the NFL </garnt>
<garnt> when everything is in motion. </garnt>
<garnt> - Garnt's winning over our American audience. </garnt>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - There's so many things going on </garnt>
<garnt> in such a short period of time. </garnt>
<garnt> Whereas, you know, I look at something like cricket </garnt>
<garnt> or baseball and there's only, you know, there's- </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, it's very stop start heavy. </joey>
<garnt> - It's very stop, start, and there's, you know, there's, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm gonna sound like, </garnt>
<joey> sound so bad. </joey>
<garnt> It's just, I just see like a guy trying to hit a ball. </garnt>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - What do you prefer American football or rugby? </connor>
<garnt> - Ooh, it's hard. </garnt>
<garnt> I think rugby. </garnt>
<joey> Overall I prefer rugby. </joey>
<joey> But I've had more exciting, like, </joey>
<garnt> moments watching American football. </garnt>
<joey> - I feel then you would really enjoy AFL. </joey>
<garnt> - What's AFL? </garnt>
<garnt> - The Australian football. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, </garnt>
<garnt> it's basically like NFL except- </garnt>
<garnt> - I didn't know Australia had- </garnt>
<garnt> - If we're representing our own country, </garnt>
<garnt> I have to talk about AFL </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause someone's gonna talk about it. </garnt>
<garnt> But AFL is basically like it's, </garnt>
<joey> it's Australian football, but think of NFL, </joey>
<joey> but if it was just one continuous play that never stopped. </joey>
<garnt> - Right. </garnt>
<garnt> Okay, that sounds pretty fun. </garnt>
<joey> - And it's like twice the field size as well. </joey>
<garnt> - Sounds exhausting. </garnt>
<connor> - It is fucking, </connor>
<connor> AFL players are legitimate athletes. </connor>
<connor> Like they- </connor>
<connor> - How do they do that in Australian heat? </connor>
<connor> - As opposed to like every other sport. </connor>
<joey> - I think I saw something which is like </joey>
<joey> in an average AFL game, a player can run upwards </joey>
<garnt> of like 20 kilometers. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's a two hour game. </garnt>
<garnt> - Fuck. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my God. </garnt>
<joey> - But they split it. </joey>
<connor> - I bet they made that game </connor>
<connor> that long on how long Australians need to drink. </connor>
<connor> Probably </connor>
<connor> - Pretty much. </connor>
<connor> - "Another round." </connor>
<connor> - That's why AFL games are the best to watch at home. </connor>
<connor> It's just like two hours of drinking. </connor>
<joey> Fuck yeah, dude! </joey>
<joey> - 30 minute recess, you know? </joey>
<joey> It's perfect. </joey>
<joey> - No, but I think you'd really like it. </joey>
<joey> If you don't like the start stop aspect of NFL, </joey>
<joey> I think you'd really like AFL. </joey>
<garnt> - 'Cause I do like a lot of sports </garnt>
<joey> where like there's a lot of things in motion, you know. </joey>
<joey> Love football, love watching basketball. </joey>
<connor> - When I went to Canada, I loved watching the hockey. </connor>
<garnt> - Hockey's great. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think I could really get into hockey. </garnt>
<garnt> - Hockey was fuckin' fun. </garnt>
<garnt> - Hockey's really fun to watch. </garnt>
<connor> - So fast paced. </connor>
<connor> - That's a sport where I think watching </connor>
<connor> that, like, live would be super, super fun. </connor>
<connor> - I'd love to watch that. </connor>
<garnt> - Like, the atmosphere just looks super, like- </garnt>
<garnt> - And in the back of your head, it's like, </garnt>
<joey> "Ooh, this might turn into a fight." </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<connor> - Exactly, right? </connor>
<connor> - Sadly I've never lived anywhere </connor>
<connor> where it's, like, a popular sport </connor>
<joey> which is so sad 'cause I want to. </joey>
<joey> But every time when I went to Canada, </joey>
<joey> it was, like, literally like I was watching it all the time. </joey>
<joey> So fun. </joey>
<joey> I want to go and watch one next time I go to Canada </joey>
<joey> or America. </joey>
<joey> But yeah, see, I said something nice about America for once. </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<connor> I got an angry email that was like, </connor>
<connor> they were like, </connor>
<connor> the subject was "please educate yourself on America." </connor>
<connor> Something like, "You talk about America all the time, </connor>
<connor> "but you always get everything wrong in our culture. </connor>
<connor> "Totally incorrect." </connor>
<connor> I should find it. </connor>
<connor> I think I deleted it though </connor>
<connor> 'cause I was like, shut the fuck up. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<joey> - What about, like, Sumo? </joey>
<garnt> - Sumo? </garnt>
<garnt> Ooh. </garnt>
<joey> - 'Cause I really want to go watch Sumo. </joey>
<joey> - I think that would be fun to watch. </joey>
<joey> I don't watch enough Sumo to have an opinion </joey>
<garnt> or haven't tried to watch enough Sumo </garnt>
<garnt> to have an opinion about it. </garnt>
<joey> - Someone in my Twitch chat notified me </joey>
<connor> that there's a Twitch channel that streams the Sumo. </connor>
<connor> - Really? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, with English commentary. </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> - So like every now and then when it's on, </connor>
<connor> I just kind of flick it on, and leave it in the background </connor>
<joey> while I'm working 'cause I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> like, don't even have to turn my TV on. </joey>
<joey> It's on Twitch. </joey>
<joey> It's fucking great. </joey>
<garnt> - Have you ever, like, gotten into a sport or something </garnt>
<garnt> because of a show you watched or an anime </garnt>
<garnt> or something like that? </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause, like, the only reason I gave the NFL a chance was </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause of fuckin' "Eyeshield." </garnt>
<garnt> I sound like such a weeb for saying this, </garnt>
<garnt> but I'm just like, okay, I'm gonna give the NFL a chance. </garnt>
<garnt> - Mine's even worse. </garnt>
<joey> I got into tennis 'cause of "Prince of Tennis." </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<connor> Deadass. </connor>
<connor> - I got into like cycling from "Yowamushi Pedal." </connor>
<garnt> - Did you actually? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's fuckin' hype. </garnt>
<garnt> Okay, I found the email. </garnt>
<garnt> "Hey Connor, love the podcast. </garnt>
<garnt> "But if you could do me </garnt>
<garnt> "and the rest of American fans a favor, </garnt>
<garnt> "could you please stop throwing misconceptions around </garnt>
<garnt> "about us? </garnt>
<garnt> "Maybe educate yourself a little bit </garnt>
<garnt> "on how we do things here </garnt>
<joey> "instead of believing the typical stereotypes. </joey>
<joey> "It's almost every podcast now you say something </joey>
<joey> "about America that's completely false </joey>
<joey> "and only applies to 1% of us and is just annoying." </joey>
<joey> - Like, what? </joey>
<joey> - I don't know. </joey>
<joey> I wish they gave examples, so I could be like, </joey>
<joey> "Okay, that's fair." </joey>
<joey> Are we wrong about things most of the time, Meilyne? </joey>
<connor> A lot of it? </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> A lot if it's right? </connor>
<connor> - A lot of it's right apparently. </connor>
<connor> - Here's the problem with America, right. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> Wait, wait. </connor>
<connor> - Go on. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, okay. </connor>
<connor> - Go on. </connor>
<connor> - Well, there's many problems. </connor>
<connor> So, so. </connor>
<joey> Something that applies to one state does not apply </joey>
<joey> to another state. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause America is fuckin' huge. </joey>
<joey> - It's so varied, right? </joey>
<joey> - Like, Meilyne, do you not think of like, </joey>
<joey> you feel very different to other states, right? </joey>
<joey> Like, you don't feel like you have anything in common </joey>
<joey> with people from like Florida, right? </joey>
<joey> Yeah, so like someone from, </joey>
<joey> like, I can relate to someone from any part of the UK. </joey>
<connor> I can understand everything. </connor>
<connor> I understand how you live. </connor>
<connor> Like, everything's the same. </connor>
<connor> But for like someone in like California, </connor>
<garnt> you can't possibly relate completely </garnt>
<garnt> to someone from like Minnesota. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no. </garnt>
<connor> Totally different culture. </connor>
<garnt> Totally different vibe. </garnt>
<connor> - Shut up, Meilyne. </connor>
<connor> Like, there's so many, </connor>
<connor> 'cause it's so vast. </connor>
<connor> There's so many different, like, micro-cultures </connor>
<connor> and everything. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, like, definitely like </garnt>
<garnt> whenever I go visit Sidney's family in Milwaukee </garnt>
<garnt> and Wisconsin, it's like, </garnt>
<connor> there's definitely a Midwestern culture that's- </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah. </connor>
<connor> From traveling the US you realize </connor>
<joey> how different they all view each other as Americans. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, it's completely different. </joey>
<joey> - It's really interesting. </joey>
<joey> So fuck you. </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<connor> I'm kidding, I'm kidding, I'm kidding. </connor>
<connor> He did say he was a big fan of the podcast though. </connor>
<joey> Sorry. </joey>
<joey> - Have you guys seen any, like, obscure sport </joey>
<joey> that you, like, that you only know about </joey>
<garnt> because it's been recommended on YouTube or something </garnt>
<garnt> but then like, it actually looks pretty fuckin' hype? </garnt>
<garnt> - What was it? </garnt>
<joey> Oh, there was one. </joey>
<joey> I forgot what it was, but I think it's, like, </joey>
<joey> an Indian sport or a Southeast Asian sport </joey>
<joey> where it's volleyball, but you kick the ball. </joey>
<garnt> What the fuck is it called? </garnt>
<connor> - Wait, what? </connor>
<joey> - I've seen this. </joey>
<joey> - Sepaktakraw. </joey>
<joey> Sepaktakraw. </joey>
<joey> It's literally just think of volleyball, </joey>
<joey> but like, you know how with volleyball </joey>
<garnt> you pass it with your hands. </garnt>
<garnt> But instead of your hands, you kick it. </garnt>
<joey> - [Garnt] Isn't that just football tennis? </joey>
<connor> - [Joey] Kinda. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Don't say that, Garnt. </connor>
<joey> - Every sepaktakraw player's like, </joey>
<connor> "How dare you? </connor>
<joey> "How dare you ruin the sanctity of our sport?" </joey>
<garnt> - Well, that sounds cool. </garnt>
<garnt> Like, have you seen stuff like professional tag </garnt>
<garnt> and stuff like that? </garnt>
<connor> - Professional tag is fuckin' awesome. </connor>
<connor> Like, Vox did a video about how it came to be as well. </connor>
<garnt> - How did it come to be? </garnt>
<connor> - Just a guy who was like really obsessed </connor>
<joey> with the idea of making like tag courses. </joey>
<joey> Just kept, like, building them, </joey>
<connor> and people were like, "Yo, this is pretty fun actually." </connor>
<joey> - You know what's one obscure sport I really enjoy watching? </joey>
<connor> Ultimate frisbee. </connor>
<joey> That's a really fuckin'- </joey>
<garnt> - [Garnt] That's really fun. </garnt>
<garnt> - In the US I think it's quite popular? </garnt>
<joey> 'Cause like Marques Brownlee plays it. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Oh really? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, he plays it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Is it an Olympic sport? </garnt>
<joey> It's not, is it? </joey>
<joey> - No, no. </joey>
<joey> - It's not an Olympic sport. </joey>
<joey> - He mentioned it quite a lot though in his videos. </joey>
<connor> And he's shared videos of him playing it. </connor>
<connor> Pretty cool. </connor>
<joey> - I guess outside of America, it's not really like a thing. </joey>
<joey> I mean, I remember we played it for, like, sports </joey>
<joey> once for school, and it was really fun. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean, we played it in school as well, </garnt>
<garnt> so it was definitely a thing, </garnt>
<garnt> but it was more seen of just- </garnt>
<connor> - It sounds like the most college sport ever. </connor>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<joey> - Ivy League past time. </joey>
<joey> - "I have the luxury of being able </joey>
<connor> "to play ultimate frisbee." - "Ultimate frisbee." </connor>
<connor> - "Yes." </connor>
<connor> It's the ultimate, </connor>
<connor> it's the ultimate that like... </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, why ultimate? </connor>
<connor> - We don't have ultimate football. </connor>
<joey> We do. </joey>
<joey> - What if they called it like epic frisbee? </joey>
<garnt> - I'd be playing it right now. </garnt>
<garnt> - "Would you like to join our epic frisbee team?" </garnt>
<garnt> - That's the kind of sport you'd think you'd see on Twitch </garnt>
<joey> or something. </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Epic frisbee. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know, I could see ultimate frisbee on Twitch. </joey>
<joey> Why not? </joey>
<joey> That'd be fuckin' awesome. </joey>
<garnt> - Like, POV. </garnt>
<joey> - POV. </joey>
<joey> You're a frisbee. </joey>
<garnt> - POV you're an ultimate frisbee. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, I feel like Twitch would be the perfect platform </garnt>
<garnt> for a lot of these more obscure sports, </garnt>
<garnt> like professional arm wrestling as well. </garnt>
<connor> Have you seen that? </connor>
<garnt> That's like the most dude bro sport I've ever seen. </garnt>
<connor> - It's like the slapping. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Moist Critikal loved to commentate on. </connor>
<connor> - Like, what I love </connor>
<garnt> about watching professional arm wrestling is </garnt>
<garnt> that, like, they're egging each other on to do better. </garnt>
<connor> It's almost like a gym session </connor>
<garnt> where it's like, "You got this, bro! </garnt>
<garnt> "You got this, bro!" </garnt>
<connor> - Actually, you know what the best one is? </connor>
<joey> I decided this is the best one. </joey>
<joey> The best sport you've seen on the internet three times, </joey>
<connor> forget about, but remember is badass. </connor>
<connor> It's the like Sumo, but with the, like, robot wars. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah. </connor>
<connor> - What? </connor>
<connor> - It's a Sumo ring with like, </connor>
<connor> where they have like mini robots, </connor>
<connor> and they have to push each other out. </connor>
<connor> And it's from where the omae wa mou shindeiru, </connor>
<joey> like that really popular edit where it like. </joey>
<connor> It's such a good video. </connor>
<connor> Play a gif. </connor>
<garnt> - [Man] omae wa mou shindeiru. </garnt>
<joey> (man yells) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it's like the, </joey>
<connor> what was that show? </connor>
<connor> - "Robot Wars." </connor>
<connor> - No, but America did a version of it. </connor>
<connor> "BattleBots" that's it. </connor>
<connor> - I think that clip is from a Japanese- </connor>
<joey> - From the Japanese one. </joey>
<joey> - Where they do it with miniature ones. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause the "BattleBots" and "Robot Wars" in the UK were </joey>
<connor> like fuckin' giant robots. </connor>
<joey> - These ones are like tabletop. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, it's not meant to destroy. </connor>
<garnt> It's supposed to push the other thing out. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's pretty cool. </garnt>
<garnt> Really fuckin' cool. </garnt>
<garnt> - There's nothing getting destroyed, I am not interested. </garnt>
<connor> - My man monkey brain not happy, no destruction. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, I kinda miss "Robot Wars." </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know when it got canceled. </garnt>
<connor> Is it still a thing? </connor>
<connor> It's probably not still a thing. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't think it's still a thing anymore. </garnt>
<connor> I don't think "BattleBots" is still a thing either. </connor>
<garnt> Meilyne, check that out. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's one of the few things we had growing up </garnt>
<garnt> that made engineering look cool. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause it's really hard to make engineering look cool. </garnt>
<garnt> But you see these like mechanics- </garnt>
<connor> - That would be like a really cool way </connor>
<joey> to teach engineering, coding, like all in one thing. </joey>
<joey> Get them to make just a little thing fuckin' move </joey>
<joey> around a little bit. </joey>
<connor> Like, why not teach that? </connor>
<joey> - The one thing I loved about "BattleBots" though was </joey>
<joey> just like, just the fluctuation </joey>
<joey> between like the different people </joey>
<joey> who clearly had completely different skills in engineering. </joey>
<joey> Like, one robot was, like, </joey>
<joey> this robot has an automated arm that can, you know, </joey>
<joey> grab and pick up robots. </joey>
<joey> And then there's another dude, </joey>
<joey> like the challenger comes in. </joey>
<connor> It's like, "I attached 60 knives onto this. </connor>
<connor> "And the only function it can do is go forwards </connor>
<joey> "and backwards." </joey>
<joey> - It's a chainsaw on wheels. </joey>
<connor> Literally it. </connor>
<garnt> - It's so funny. </garnt>
<garnt> - And you see it like some like piddly robots </garnt>
<garnt> that had like the most depressing flipper of all time. </garnt>
<joey> Like, couldn't even flip my grandma, </joey>
<joey> and then it goes up against like fuckin' Hypno-Disc </joey>
<joey> or something and just gets absolutely destroyed. </joey>
<garnt> - Half of them, like, don't even move in practice. </garnt>
<connor> So, it's just a doorstopper on wheels. </connor>
<connor> - And then like, I don't know if "BattleBots" had this, </connor>
<joey> but the UK one had this where, like, </joey>
<connor> the showrunners had their own, like, OPS robots </connor>
<connor> that would just like when the nothing was happening, </connor>
<connor> they'd be like, "Send out Charles" or something. </connor>
<connor> - "Send out Sir Killalot." </connor>
<connor> - And then like this just fucking massive, </connor>
<joey> clearly like absolutely god tier engineering robot came out. </joey>
<joey> - Like, created by NASA. </joey>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Just started like gorilla smashing them around, </connor>
<connor> and it's like, oh, that's kind of anticlimactic. </connor>
<joey> - [Meilyne] Apparently "BattleBots" was supposed </joey>
<joey> to come back in 2020, but it's postponed. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, wow. - Oh, okay. </garnt>
<connor> "BattleBots" is coming back. </connor>
<connor> - When did "BattleBots" end? </connor>
<connor> So wow, two thousands it ends, it's coming back soon. </connor>
<connor> - I'm just getting reminded of all, like, </connor>
<garnt> these old television shows I used to watch as a kid now. </garnt>
<joey> Do you remember "Gladiators?" </joey>
<joey> Was that a part of- </joey>
<joey> - That's very, very old. </joey>
<joey> - That's very, </joey>
<garnt> that's like 90s. </garnt>
<connor> - That sounds really familiar. </connor>
<joey> What is that? </joey>
<garnt> - It's basically like- </garnt>
<connor> - Very much inspired, like, the whole, like, </connor>
<connor> kind of sporty-esque, like, really intense physical sports. </connor>
<garnt> - It was kind of like, instead of like, </garnt>
<garnt> instead of like, </garnt>
<connor> what are like the shows that like Fall Guys </connor>
<connor> and stuff is based around? </connor>
<connor> - "Wipeout." </connor>
<connor> - So instead of, like, going against an obstacle course, </connor>
<connor> you'd have an obstacle course, </connor>
<connor> but then you'd be competing against a gladiator </connor>
<joey> which was like this kind of, like, </joey>
<joey> really fit muscular person. </joey>
<joey> And there would be this competitive element </joey>
<joey> where you'd have to beat, like, </joey>
<garnt> beat this person on this obstacle course, </garnt>
<connor> something like that. </connor>
<connor> - Or you'd have to just, like, literally fight them. </connor>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<connor> - That's the final hurdle. </connor>
<garnt> - Basically. </garnt>
<joey> - You get to the end, he's just standing there. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, the best way I can describe it, </joey>
<joey> it's basically something very, </joey>
<joey> it's like "Wipeout" </joey>
<joey> with wrestling basically. </joey>
<joey> - So it's, like, real time, like, you're fighting, </joey>
<connor> well, not fighting but like- </connor>
<joey> - So, there's like one, </joey>
<connor> I think there's one event in it where, like, </connor>
<connor> you both have, like, the long poles </connor>
<connor> with like the cushions on the end, </connor>
<connor> and you fuckin' have to smack each other off. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh yes, yes, I remember that. </garnt>
<connor> - Basically giant cotton buds. </connor>
<connor> Try to push each other off the platform. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I remember that. </connor>
<garnt> - I know that show is old </garnt>
<connor> 'cause I think when I was watching that like very </connor>
<joey> early 2000s everyone was wearing like latex and spandex. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, oh yeah- </joey>
<joey> - I'm pretty sure all that's just taken </joey>
<joey> from "Takeshi's Castle," right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, what was the other one? </joey>
<joey> The Japanese one was called, like, </joey>
<joey> I think it was, it's called, like, </joey>
<joey> "Ultimate Banzuke" or something. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah. </joey>
<joey> - You heard of this one? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I think so. </joey>
<joey> - Where like, literally they will do, </joey>
<joey> this show is so fun. </joey>
<joey> You should watch clips on YouTube. </joey>
<joey> It's really fuckin' cool. </joey>
<joey> So, what they would do is </joey>
<joey> that they would have like someone, </joey>
<joey> either they would be a generic thing </joey>
<joey> or they'd have an expert. </joey>
<joey> So, they bring on like 10 expert pogo people, </joey>
<joey> and they would build, like, </joey>
<joey> a fuckin' impossible pogo obstacle course. </joey>
<joey> And they would have to do it. </joey>
<joey> And, like, the shit they would do is insane. </joey>
<joey> It wasn't just general people. </joey>
<joey> It was like, no, they get professionals. </joey>
<joey> And there'll be people who like, they'd have to be, </joey>
<joey> they bring people who are professionals at like handstands, </joey>
<joey> and they'd have to do a whole course </joey>
<joey> handstand walking around. </joey>
<joey> Like, going upstairs, going on wobbly- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I've definitely seen that. </joey>
<joey> - It's really fucking cool. </joey>
<joey> You should watch this. </joey>
<joey> Just type it in. </joey>
<joey> I think it's, I'll have to- </joey>
<joey> - "Ultimate Banzuke," right? </joey>
<joey> Something like that. </joey>
<joey> Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And, like, the stuff they had to do was crazy. </joey>
<joey> Like, they had that, you know, </joey>
<connor> that Mario Party game where you have to, like, </connor>
<connor> there's like seven things stacked </connor>
<connor> and you have a hammer and hit it. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - They had a game where two people had to do that, </connor>
<joey> and they had to like, hit them all out. </joey>
<joey> But obviously when you hit it, </joey>
<joey> it would like tip the thing over. </joey>
<joey> It was really cool. </joey>
<connor> - That's based off like a traditional Japanese, like, toy. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> It was pretty cool. </connor>
<connor> - What's like the best concept of, like, </connor>
<garnt> a reality TV program that you've seen? </garnt>
<garnt> - Like, physical game show challenge? </garnt>
<garnt> - Anything. </garnt>
<garnt> - I like "Ninja Warrior." </garnt>
<garnt> The original, the Japanese original. </garnt>
<garnt> - "Sasuke." </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, that was really good. </connor>
<garnt> - There was this really old reality TV show </garnt>
<garnt> that Channel Four made. </garnt>
<garnt> I can't remember the name </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause it was, like, a one-off series. </garnt>
<garnt> But I always remember it </garnt>
<garnt> because I thought the concept was genius. </garnt>
<garnt> Because what they did is this was, </garnt>
<garnt> this was way back when when "Big Brother" was, </garnt>
<garnt> like, a massive thing, </garnt>
<garnt> but the twist was, they took these group of people </garnt>
<garnt> that weren't exactly the brightest bunch of people, </garnt>
<garnt> but, you know, wanted to be on a reality TV show. </garnt>
<garnt> And they would basically, </garnt>
<garnt> they basically convinced them </garnt>
<garnt> that they were going to go to space. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh, I think I remember this. </joey>
<joey> - So what happens is they literally go, </joey>
<joey> they literally, like, take them astronaut training. </joey>
<joey> And make them go through all the training, </joey>
<joey> but also feed them like a bit of fake information. </joey>
<joey> Because they had this real mock spaceship, </joey>
<joey> and they taught them that, you know, </joey>
<joey> we are using new technology </joey>
<joey> where it doesn't require rockets. </joey>
<joey> It's kind of like an airplane where it, like, </joey>
<joey> slowly circles up to the Earth's atmosphere. </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<joey> And these guys would believe it. </joey>
<joey> They thought they were, like, being trained in Russia. </joey>
<joey> - What was the name of the show? </joey>
<joey> - I can't remember. </joey>
<joey> I'm gonna have to look it up because it was a genius show. </joey>
<joey> And, like, at any point, if like, </joey>
<joey> at any point one of them could have found out. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause they were, </joey>
<joey> the producer said, you know, </joey>
<joey> you're gonna be trained in Russia. </joey>
<joey> It's not gonna be in England. </joey>
<joey> And what happened is they just took them on a plane </joey>
<joey> and just, like, circled round </joey>
<joey> and just landed in like an abandoned airfield in Surrey </joey>
<joey> or something like that. </joey>
<joey> So, they were just, like, in the middle of England </joey>
<joey> thinking they were going to space. </joey>
<joey> And they actually took some of these people, </joey>
<joey> and just, have you ever been on like one </joey>
<joey> of those fake rollercoaster rides? </joey>
<joey> Where it's like, it's kinda like- </joey>
<joey> - Like, the 4D ones? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, like the 4D ones </joey>
<joey> where, you know, you just kind of, like, have this spaceship </joey>
<garnt> that just kind of tilts up. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's called "Space Cadets." </garnt>
<joey> Aired in 2005 on Channel Four. </joey>
<joey> Channel Four normally does all the really bizarre, </joey>
<connor> really unique game shows in the UK. </connor>
<garnt> - If you got, like, if you got some time you want to kill </garnt>
<garnt> that's honestly, it was such a good concept. </garnt>
<garnt> And it was a one off as well, one off season. </garnt>
<garnt> It was just- </garnt>
<garnt> - It sounds hilarious. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was fuckin' hilarious. </garnt>
<garnt> Highly recommend it. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, the first thing that comes up </connor>
<connor> when you Google it is like controversies. </connor>
<joey> It must be quite controversial. </joey>
<joey> - I guess so. </joey>
<joey> - I want to watch that now. </joey>
<joey> That sounds awesome. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that sounds really funny. </joey>
<garnt> - The UK has some pretty unique game shows </garnt>
<garnt> like the hunted one. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, the hunted one. </garnt>
<garnt> - The hunted one was cool. </garnt>
<garnt> Basically there's a game show in the UK, </garnt>
<garnt> I think it was literally called "Hunted." </garnt>
<garnt> And they would have, like, I think six pairs or 10 pairs, </garnt>
<connor> something around that, </connor>
<connor> and basically what they would do is they were like, </connor>
<connor> all right, you have like one day, </connor>
<connor> and then we're gonna start trying to, like, </connor>
<connor> track you as if you're a fugitive. </connor>
<connor> So, like any of your, </connor>
<connor> if you use your phone, if you do anything, </connor>
<joey> you make calls, you go to places, like they'll find you. </joey>
<joey> And so some people were really good at it </joey>
<joey> and some people are terrible at it. </joey>
<joey> And like, yeah. </joey>
<joey> And then they had to survive two weeks? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, two weeks. </joey>
<joey> - Two weeks, and then go to a location to get, like, </joey>
<joey> a plane to, like, to escape. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right, right, right. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, well, one team did win. </joey>
<joey> - That sounds really fun. </joey>
<joey> - It was really cool. </joey>
<connor> It was really popular the first season, </connor>
<joey> and the second season I think was a bit shitter </joey>
<joey> and didn't do too well. </joey>
<connor> - I feel that's a concept, like, </connor>
<connor> at first that would be like, wow, that's cool. </connor>
<joey> But then I feel it'd get old quite fast. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, because there's only so much you can do </garnt>
<garnt> once you know the formula and once you know the secrets. </garnt>
<connor> - There's something like, </connor>
<joey> the logistics behind that must've been like crazy. </joey>
<joey> Like, I wonder how much of that was faked though as well </joey>
<joey> because you surely can't have access to all the, like, </joey>
<connor> the police force's like ability, right? </connor>
<connor> 'Cause it's just a waste of police time and services. </connor>
<connor> - That's just a lot of government money. </connor>
<connor> - "Hold on, wait, we've gotta find the fake one." </connor>
<connor> I wonder. </connor>
<connor> But like in a concept, really cool. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> Was that on Channel Four as well? </garnt>
<connor> - That was on Channel Four as well. </connor>
<garnt> - Channel Four made some good, like, one-off reality- </garnt>
<connor> - I'm surprised I never heard of any of these. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, Channel Four makes really good TV shows in general. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, like, some of my favorite are definitely, like, </garnt>
<garnt> some of the Derren Brown specials. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know how famous Derren Brown is outside of the UK. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right now probably not so much. </garnt>
<connor> - Never heard of him. </connor>
<connor> - You've never heard of Derren Brown? </connor>
<connor> Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> Some of the shit this man did was crazy. </connor>
<connor> His favorite thing that he's ever done. </connor>
<connor> So Derren Brown is a magician from the UK. </connor>
<garnt> - He's a magician that basically like- </garnt>
<connor> - Hypnotist as well? </connor>
<connor> - Sorry? </connor>
<connor> - Like, a hypnotist as well? </connor>
<connor> - I can't remember exactly what he calls himself, </connor>
<joey> but he's more like a mental magician where- </joey>
<joey> - Mentalist? </joey>
<joey> - Not even like- </joey>
<joey> - It's fucking- </joey>
<garnt> - Something about the word mentalist makes it sound fake. </garnt>
<connor> - This man is just one of a kind. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, like, he's a showman. </garnt>
<garnt> He says, like, "Everything I do is," </garnt>
<garnt> like, it's not so much that it's fake, </garnt>
<garnt> but like it's, there is like magic involved. </garnt>
<garnt> He doesn't claim to have special powers </garnt>
<garnt> or something like that. </garnt>
<garnt> He just claims to understand psychology and plays on that. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, so there's this one TV show that he did </connor>
<connor> and it is literally my favorite, </connor>
<connor> and it's so big brain, this whole thing. </connor>
<connor> So I'll spoil the end of it. </connor>
<connor> So I'll warn you I'm gonna do that, </connor>
<connor> but I'll spoil it for you, </connor>
<connor> but it's still cool either way, if you watch it. </connor>
<joey> So, what happens is this TV show starts </joey>
<joey> and you're following this perspective of this one woman. </joey>
<joey> - I know it. </joey>
<joey> - This one's so good. </joey>
<joey> And so basically what happens is is that, </joey>
<joey> so the show is that he, </joey>
<connor> basically he knows which horse is gonna win </connor>
<connor> in these horse races. </connor>
<garnt> - So, the exact name of the special is called "The System." </garnt>
<garnt> So, the way he markets it is that he has a system </garnt>
<garnt> that can 100% predict which horse is going to win </garnt>
<garnt> in a horse race. </garnt>
<connor> - And so it's like this middle-aged woman </connor>
<connor> and you know, we follow her. </connor>
<connor> He calls her up, he's like, </connor>
<connor> "Listen, bet on this horse, go now." </connor>
<connor> So she goes and she bets on it, </connor>
<connor> and the cameras are following her. </connor>
<joey> She bets on it. </joey>
<joey> She wins. </joey>
<joey> It's like, oh, shit, okay. </joey>
<joey> And then he rings her up again. </joey>
<joey> He's like, </joey>
<joey> "Right now, put all of your money on this horse now." </joey>
<joey> Like, a week later. </joey>
<joey> And she puts all the money on it. </joey>
<joey> She wins again. </joey>
<joey> It's like, what the fuck? </joey>
<joey> How is he doing this? </joey>
<joey> This is legit, like, </joey>
<joey> this is a fully legitimate, </joey>
<joey> it's, like, a public gambling that anyone can bet on. </joey>
<joey> - It's a real horse race. </joey>
<joey> - He gives them the money. </joey>
<joey> He gives them a thousand pounds, right? </joey>
<connor> I think. </connor>
<garnt> - I can't remember. </garnt>
<garnt> It's been a while, but, </garnt>
<garnt> no, I don't think he gives them any money. </garnt>
<connor> - So anyway, she wins and it happens again. </connor>
<connor> And he's like, "All right, now, bet again. </connor>
<connor> "All the money on this horse." </connor>
<connor> She does it again, and she wins. </connor>
<connor> And I think it's one more time. </connor>
<connor> He's like, "All right, now this is the final one. </connor>
<connor> "Bet all of your money on this again." </connor>
<connor> And she wins. </connor>
<connor> And you're like, what the fuck is going on? </connor>
<connor> Like, he's literally guessing. </connor>
<connor> And then he reveals, and as the episode ends </connor>
<connor> that like he's literally done like a tournament bracket </connor>
<connor> of like, every single race there's nine horses. </connor>
<connor> So, every single race he's literally found nine people </connor>
<connor> and told them to bet on the different horses. </connor>
<connor> He's literally gone through and done like a giant, </connor>
<connor> like, hundreds of races. </connor>
<connor> - It's like a pyramid. </connor>
<garnt> So, like at the beginning he started </garnt>
<garnt> with like thousands of thousands of contestants. </garnt>
<garnt> And he said, you know, I, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> he didn't reveal who his identity was. </garnt>
<garnt> He was just like an anonymous tip. </garnt>
<garnt> And so, you know, part of, like, </garnt>
<garnt> certain amount of people won, they got eliminated. </garnt>
<connor> He gave them a refund, </connor>
<connor> and then he went up to the next bracket. </connor>
<garnt> And then he kept, he basically kept enough of a group </garnt>
<garnt> of people to make sure there was at least one person. </garnt>
<connor> - And it's so simple. </connor>
<garnt> - That's so cool. </garnt>
<connor> - But when you're following the story </connor>
<connor> and her perspective, it seems like literal magic. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because the message he was trying to say was like, </garnt>
<garnt> don't forget about perspective. </garnt>
<joey> Just because you are winning doesn't mean that, like, </joey>
<joey> doesn't mean like there's a magical system </joey>
<joey> or something like that. </joey>
<joey> It's all to do with probability. </joey>
<garnt> - That sounds right up my alley. </garnt>
<connor> - Dude, he's literally a fuckin' genius. </connor>
<connor> His shows are amazing. </connor>
<connor> And like, he did one where, he's done so many crazy shows. </connor>
<garnt> - I think one of my favorite ones is, like, </garnt>
<garnt> the ones where he actually faked a zombie apocalypse. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh, that sounds familiar. </joey>
<garnt> I might've seen that. </garnt>
<joey> Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - So basically he takes this one guy. </garnt>
<garnt> So how he gets people in his specials is </garnt>
<joey> that people apply to be on his specials. </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> - But he doesn't tell anyone </joey>
<joey> that they've succeeded. - What it is. </joey>
<joey> - He doesn't tell anyone that they've succeeded. </joey>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - So he gets thousands and thousands of applicants, </connor>
<connor> and he chooses one out of everyone. </connor>
<connor> So, he takes this guy and he puts, </connor>
<joey> he basically hypnotized him, so he like passes out, </joey>
<joey> and he wakes up in this like abandoned hospital. </joey>
<joey> - Right, right. </joey>
<joey> - And you know, it's basically </joey>
<garnt> just this guy going through a zombie apocalypse. </garnt>
<connor> - Like, the "Truman Show." </connor>
<garnt> 'Cause they get everyone around him to act </garnt>
<garnt> and go along as if there's a zombie apocalypse. </garnt>
<garnt> So this guy literally believes </garnt>
<connor> that there's like a zombie apocalypse. </connor>
<connor> - I think this is on Netflix as well. </connor>
<garnt> So, you can actually watch this on Netflix. </garnt>
<connor> - There's another one where he sees </connor>
<connor> if he can convince someone to commit murder. </connor>
<connor> - Jesus. </connor>
<connor> - Like, fake murder. </connor>
<connor> He sets up the situation. </connor>
<connor> That one's not as good as the other ones, </connor>
<connor> but like, they all vary in quality, </connor>
<connor> but you're definitely gonna have an experience. </connor>
<connor> You definitely can't find anything like it. </connor>
<connor> - What's the name of the show again? </connor>
<garnt> - Just type in Darren Brown. </garnt>
<garnt> - Derren, Derren. </garnt>
<connor> - Derren Brown? </connor>
<connor> - D-E-R-R-E-N. </connor>
<garnt> But he's done a lot of stuff. </garnt>
<connor> - His live shows are really popular as well. </connor>
<garnt> - I've been to his live shows actually. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh really? </garnt>
<garnt> - It's really good. </garnt>
<connor> - Does like a lot of psychology things. </connor>
<joey> He basically like manipulates like perception. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - It's really just interesting stuff. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, it gives you a lot of perspective, </garnt>
<garnt> and he, you know, he goes in saying, </garnt>
<garnt> you know, all of this is just magic. </garnt>
<connor> You know? </connor>
<garnt> Like he, a lot of- </garnt>
<connor> - None of this is magic. </connor>
<garnt> - Sorry? </garnt>
<garnt> - You said all of this is magic. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no. </garnt>
<garnt> - "So I'm just a fuckin' magician. </garnt>
<garnt> "You guys know me. </garnt>
<connor> "Hogwarts diploma right here." </connor>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<joey> - No, 'cause like watching his stuff, </joey>
<connor> he doesn't pretend to be, </connor>
<connor> he doesn't pretend like he has powers </connor>
<connor> or something like that. </connor>
<joey> It's all showmanship- </joey>
<connor> - That's how British people like it. </connor>
<connor> - But that's my favorite type of musician, </connor>
<connor> magician. </connor>
<joey> Like, fuckin', </joey>
<joey> what's the... </joey>
<joey> - David Blaine? </joey>
<joey> - No, not David Blaine. </joey>
<joey> Penn and Teller. </joey>
<joey> That's what I like about Penn and Teller </joey>
<garnt> 'cause they're just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "We're not fuckin' magicians. </garnt>
<joey> "We're just good at what we do." </joey>
<garnt> It's all just slight of hand shit, you know. </garnt>
<connor> Unlike, you know, like fuckin' Chris Angel </connor>
<joey> who's like, "Yes, I am the second coming of Christ." </joey>
<joey> - "I'm literally fucking dying." </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<joey> "I literally die." </joey>
<joey> - To be fair, every now and then I love going back </joey>
<joey> and watching like Chris Angel clips on YouTube </joey>
<joey> just because, like, I remember back in the day </joey>
<joey> when I watched, like, Chris Angel being like, </joey>
<joey> "Yeah, I split this woman in half." </joey>
<joey> And I was just like, oh my God, this man is, </joey>
<joey> he's actually a magician. </joey>
<connor> - This man is insane. </connor>
<joey> - He's like, "Yes, I'm walking on water." </joey>
<connor> And it's totally not just, like, </connor>
<joey> see-through fuckin' plastic boards on the pool. </joey>
<garnt> - Were you around when David Blaine did </garnt>
<connor> that stunt in London where he would like- </connor>
<connor> - Stayed in the cage? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, stayed in the cage or something for like, </connor>
<joey> how long did he stay in there for? </joey>
<joey> - A month wasn't it? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it was a long time. </joey>
<joey> - It was like a month without any food or something. </joey>
<joey> I remember just thinking, </joey>
<joey> there were so many moments during that month </joey>
<connor> where he just got fucking shit on by all, like, </connor>
<connor> the fuckin' chavs. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> It was so bad. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause like it was back in the time when, you know, </connor>
<connor> England had this nice prim and proper image </connor>
<connor> to Americans, especially. </connor>
<connor> And you just had, like, these fuckin' people, like, </connor>
<connor> these Londoners who were just chucking paint balls at him </connor>
<garnt> and shit like this. </garnt>
<garnt> I felt so bad. </garnt>
<connor> - Chavs in London are a different breed, man. </connor>
<connor> Man, it, just like as well, </connor>
<connor> like when I saw that he's like staying in there for 30 days, </connor>
<connor> I'm like, why? </connor>
<connor> Why? </connor>
<connor> Is the record really worth it? </connor>
<connor> Like, I get it, like, the stunt. </connor>
<connor> But like, is this fun? </connor>
<joey> - I mean, I guess the fact that we're still talking about it </joey>
<connor> to this day is worth it, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, true. </connor>
<joey> I guess that's the point, right? </joey>
<connor> Like, I just lose a month of my life </connor>
<joey> to get a bit of clout. </joey>
<joey> - To be talked about. </joey>
<connor> - He's the ultimate clout chaser. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> I'm kidding, I'm kidding. </connor>
<connor> This shit's very impressive. </connor>
<connor> He could probably kill me with magic for all I know. </connor>
<joey> Make a frog come out of my ass. </joey>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<joey> - Shitting out frogs. </joey>
<connor> - Have you seen his Ted Talk? </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<connor> - He had a Ted Talk, </connor>
<connor> like breaking down how he did one of his stunts, </connor>
<joey> which was like how he stayed under water </joey>
<joey> and like broke the world record. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, that was cool. </connor>
<connor> - And, like, he was going through the process of, like, </connor>
<connor> they tried a load of different things. </connor>
<connor> Like, they tried stuffing, like, </connor>
<connor> a airbag into his stomach to give him like a breathing tube. </connor>
<connor> And that just- </connor>
<joey> - Isn't that just cheating? </joey>
<joey> - No, it's magic. </joey>
<joey> - That just ended up horribly. </joey>
<joey> Then they just kind of, like, tried a lot of different ways </joey>
<joey> to see if this was possible. </joey>
<joey> And then, like, the conclusion they came to was just, </joey>
<joey> let's just fuckin' do it properly. </joey>
<joey> So yeah, he- </joey>
<joey> - Let's just, you know, train. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, let's just almost drown myself, </joey>
<joey> and that's basically what he did. </joey>
<joey> And it's just like, man, </joey>
<garnt> this man has just monetized being fuckin' mental, right? </garnt>
<connor> - He's a true mentalist. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - Like, it's respectable that he did that, </garnt>
<garnt> and he achieved that, like, all the credit to him, </garnt>
<garnt> but my God, you must- </garnt>
<garnt> - It's the magic of willpower. </garnt>
<garnt> That's all it is. </garnt>
<connor> - It's the fucking craziest people that do, like, </connor>
<connor> the fuckin' like, </connor>
<connor> most absurd shit. - Dumbest shit. </connor>
<garnt> - That, like, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> you have to be a little bit crazy to be a genius, </garnt>
<joey> I think, you know what I mean? </joey>
<connor> Like, I think there has to be a little bit. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I mean, what was that quote again? </joey>
<joey> It's like a genius is just an insane person </joey>
<connor> with an audience. </connor>
<connor> - Is it really? </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<joey> - I don't know who said that quote, but it's a quote. </joey>
<joey> - I just, my God, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like going back to the caving stuff, </garnt>
<garnt> we spoke about a few weeks ago, right? </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, it has to, </garnt>
<garnt> there's gotta be some dopamine deficiency going on here </garnt>
<garnt> that requires you to like, need to like, </garnt>
<joey> I'm like, I have a good meal and I'm like, </joey>
<joey> damn, that dopamine hit was good. </joey>
<joey> Someone has like a seven 11, </joey>
<joey> like, no, I gotta fuckin' climb the building instead. </joey>
<joey> I gotta climb the seven 11 to get a hit. </joey>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> You're like, what? </connor>
<connor> What's going on? </connor>
<connor> - "Fear Factor?" - What's "Fear Factor?" </connor>
<connor> - Oh, "Fear Factor." </connor>
<joey> Yeah, I mean- </joey>
<joey> - Didn't that have a lot of controversy, "Fear Factor?" </joey>
<connor> - I mean, I've seen- </connor>
<connor> - Like, Joe Rogan did it, right? </connor>
<connor> 'Cause it's either like, you can eat your own shit </connor>
<joey> or drink your own piss. </joey>
<connor> - It's not even that bad though. </connor>
<joey> It's like, I remember, like, </joey>
<joey> I think I saw one episode or one season </joey>
<joey> where, like, the final gross </joey>
<joey> or whatever the fuck it was called, </joey>
<joey> it was like the worst meal was, it was balut. </joey>
<joey> You know the- </joey>
<joey> - It was what? </joey>
<joey> - It was balut which is, like, the duck fetus </joey>
<joey> that they eat in, like, the Philippines. </joey>
<joey> And it's like, I remember </joey>
<joey> 'cause when I went to the Philippines for the first time, </joey>
<joey> Aki was like, "Do you wanna try balut?" </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "What the fuck is that?" </joey>
<joey> He's like, "It's a duck fetus." </joey>
<joey> It was the worst thing they had on "Fear Factor." </joey>
<joey> And I ate it and I'm like, </joey>
<joey> people on "Fear Factor" are fuckin' pussies. </joey>
<garnt> (everyone laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - Get Joey on "Fear Factor." </connor>
<connor> - There's something weird about the fact of being like- </connor>
<joey> - I'm like, this is delicious. </joey>
<joey> What are you on about? </joey>
<joey> - I can just imagine someone went to the Philippines, </joey>
<joey> and then someone really politely is like, </joey>
<joey> "This is our culture. </joey>
<connor> "This is what we eat." </connor>
<connor> And he's like, "I can't wait to put this on Fear Factor! </connor>
<connor> "People are gonna eat this!" </connor>
<connor> Like, it's so weird about that. </connor>
<connor> - Like, I understand like, you know, </connor>
<joey> eating cockroach or something right where it's like- </joey>
<connor> - Something that shouldn't be eaten. </connor>
<connor> - Something that shouldn't be eaten- </connor>
<connor> - And isn't really widely eaten by any culture, </connor>
<joey> I kind of like, I get it. </joey>
<connor> Like, you know- </connor>
<joey> - And then there's taking, like, an obscure food </joey>
<joey> from like a cultural background. </joey>
<connor> And it's like, "This is disgusting, isn't it?" </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> - "Look how vile this is! </connor>
<connor> "Someone's gonna eat this shit!" </connor>
<connor> - "Someone's gonna eat this shit!" </connor>
<joey> Meanwhile everyone in the Philippines is like... </joey>
<connor> - The Philippine audience is like Mike Wazowski. </connor>
<connor> What? </connor>
<connor> - It's either McDonald's or this. </connor>
<joey> - Are they really gonna waste that balut like that? </joey>
<garnt> - Oh my God. </garnt>
<joey> - I don't know, man. </joey>
<joey> I'm Thai, and Thai people eat water bugs, </joey>
<connor> and I don't stand by that shit. </connor>
<connor> I still haven't forgotten, Meilyne. </connor>
<garnt> I still have not forgotten. </garnt>
<connor> - You're not gonna like go and be like, </connor>
<connor> "Mom, can I take some water bugs back? </connor>
<connor> "I'm filming Fear Factor. </connor>
<connor> "This is crazy!" </connor>
<connor> - "Nobody eats this!" </connor>
<connor> - "Sarah has a choice between jumping off a bridge </connor>
<connor> "or eating a bug. </connor>
<connor> "She chose to jump off a bridge." </connor>
<garnt> - What is "Fear Factor?" </garnt>
<garnt> I've never watched it. </garnt>
<connor> - Isn't it you get two choices? </connor>
<connor> No, am I crazy? </connor>
<joey> - Was it two choices? </joey>
<connor> No, I think- </connor>
<connor> - I don't fuckin' give a shit, it's garbage. </connor>
<connor> - It's just a show where it's, like, </connor>
<connor> contestants basically line up and being like, </connor>
<joey> if you eat this, then you go onto the next round. </joey>
<joey> And if you survive the entire round, </joey>
<joey> you get a prize money or something like that. </joey>
<joey> But like the food or what you have to do is, like, </joey>
<joey> usually considered gross according to Americans at least </joey>
<connor> and like- </connor>
<joey> - Vegetables. </joey>
<joey> I'm gonna get shit after. </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<connor> - The first step- </connor>
<connor> - Okay, okay, now the email is warranted. </connor>
<garnt> I'll give you that. </garnt>
<connor> Okay, fair enough. </connor>
<connor> - You know what meme with that kid </connor>
<connor> who's just got vein popping out? </connor>
<connor> It's like, </connor>
<garnt> Connor when he hasn't shit on America for 30 minutes. </garnt>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<joey> - True, true, true. </joey>
<connor> Hey, I think it's fair fuckin' game. </connor>
<connor> You don't see me fuckin' emailing Americans being like, </connor>
<connor> "Stop making British memes. </connor>
<connor> "I don't say the word eight." </connor>
<connor> Shut the fuck up. </connor>
<connor> Be a little bitch and take your shit. </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> We all get mocked, okay, it's 2021! </connor>
<garnt> - But yeah, "Fear Factor." </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, anyway. </joey>
<joey> - "Spinach or carrots." </joey>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<joey> - "Who the fuck eats celery?" </joey>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> - "Celery without hummus." </connor>
<connor> (everyone laughs) </connor>
<connor> Americans, I don't actually believe this. </connor>
<connor> I'm joking. </connor>
<connor> This is a joke. </connor>
<joey> This is a bit. </joey>
<joey> - "Eat the celery or take the hummus and go home." </joey>
<joey> No, but basically it's like, </joey>
<joey> you have to do something gross or eat something gross. </joey>
<joey> And if you decide to do it, </joey>
<connor> then you move onto the next round. </connor>
<joey> If you don't decide to do it, then you get kicked off. </joey>
<joey> And basically each step it just gets worse </joey>
<connor> and worse and worse. </connor>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<connor> I might be talking out my ass. </connor>
<joey> This is how I remember it. </joey>
<joey> - What the fuck is wrong with us? </joey>
<connor> Wanting to watch people do fuckin' stupid shit like this. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't know. </garnt>
<connor> - It's entertaining. </connor>
<connor> - Actually I had another flashback </connor>
<connor> to another Derren Brown special. </connor>
<connor> He did another special as well which is great </connor>
<joey> where the audience get to choose </joey>
<joey> whether something bad happened to the guy </joey>
<joey> or something good happened to the guy. </joey>
<joey> So they would follow a guy in his daily life. </joey>
<connor> He obviously signed a bunch of things. </connor>
<connor> Literally the audience every single time chose bad things. </connor>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> And like, one of them was, like, </joey>
<connor> his family gets Christmas presents early </connor>
<connor> or he gets fucking kidnapped. </connor>
<connor> And he literally got kidnapped </connor>
<connor> because the audience wanted to see him get kidnapped. </connor>
<connor> We're fucked up! </connor>
<connor> We are fucked up! </connor>
<garnt> - Do you know what the most fucked up thing </garnt>
<garnt> about that special was? </garnt>
<garnt> - What? </garnt>
<garnt> - So the special basically ends </garnt>
<garnt> with the audience shows a bad thing happening </garnt>
<garnt> like he got kidnapped or something. </garnt>
<joey> And then I think as they were trying to kidnap him, </joey>
<joey> he got into a car crash. </joey>
<joey> Now the car crash, the car crash was staged. </joey>
<joey> The audience didn't know this. </joey>
<joey> The car crash was staged. </joey>
<joey> And so the audience see him get hit by a car. </joey>
<joey> And then, they just like, this unplanned thing. </joey>
<connor> Derren Brown just walks off. </connor>
<connor> And then you're just left seeing, like, </connor>
<connor> the audience kind of like- </connor>
<connor> - Really uncomfortable. </connor>
<joey> - Like, what's going on? </joey>
<joey> And like one of the audience members going like, </joey>
<joey> "Excuse me, you're not being funny, </joey>
<connor> "but like this like-" </connor>
<connor> - "It's not our fault, is it?" </connor>
<connor> - I can't remember exactly what she says, </connor>
<connor> but she's like, "Excuse me, this isn't funny. </connor>
<connor> "Like, can you tell us what's going on? </connor>
<connor> "Like, why would you make him go through this?" </connor>
<joey> And it's, like, the lack of self-awareness and self irony </joey>
<joey> that you literally came on a TV show- </joey>
<joey> - And kept voting. </joey>
<joey> - And kept voting for bad things to happen. </joey>
<joey> And then something bad thing happened that wasn't scripted, </joey>
<garnt> but because it wasn't scripted, </garnt>
<garnt> suddenly it's a serious matter. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, it was like really interesting. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause it was basically just like you </connor>
<joey> as the audience does not care about who is on screen. </joey>
<joey> You just want to see bad things happen. </joey>
<joey> You know, these are people. </joey>
<joey> It's really good. </joey>
<joey> - Because you know it's staged. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause that's what you think. </joey>
<garnt> You think it's all fake or like, or you don't care. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was a message about, like, anonymity </garnt>
<joey> within, like, crowds. </joey>
<joey> I don't know. </joey>
<joey> What's the word I'm looking for? </joey>
<joey> - Hive mind? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, like the hive mindset </joey>
<joey> where if you have anonymity, </joey>
<connor> responsibility is kind of like taken off you, </connor>
<connor> and you're willing to do, like, </connor>
<joey> you're willing to do things that you might not do </joey>
<garnt> if, you know, you were the one responsible. </garnt>
<joey> - I'm pretty sure I saw, like, </joey>
<joey> at least four, like, "Black Mirror" episodes </joey>
<joey> that were like that. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, but "Black Mirror" sucks now. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it sucks now. </connor>
<garnt> - It sucks so much. </garnt>
<connor> - It went downhill real fast. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> Is there anything else you guys want to bring up or? </garnt>
<connor> - No, watch Derren Brown I guess. </connor>
<connor> This has been a really a strange episode. </connor>
<joey> We talked about so many things. </joey>
<joey> We sped run through stuff today. </joey>
<joey> But like watch Derren Brown. </joey>
<garnt> That's all you gotta take away. </garnt>
<joey> - I need to. </joey>
<joey> You guys sold me on it. </joey>
<joey> - Out of every British, like, you know, </joey>
<joey> I like to show Sydney some British TV shows </joey>
<joey> because I feel like British TV shows, </joey>
<joey> people only know like fucking "Doctor Who" </joey>
<joey> and maybe "Top Gear," you know? </joey>
<joey> And I'm just like, you know, </joey>
<joey> British TV shows, they have some good TV shows. </joey>
<joey> And I think Derren Brown is one </joey>
<garnt> of the best examples you can get from </garnt>
<garnt> just quality TV shows coming out from England. </garnt>
<connor> - I mean, you guys have convinced me, </connor>
<joey> so that's what I'm gonna do. </joey>
<connor> - How can you not hear any of that and be like, </connor>
<connor> "Yeah, I'm not really interested." </connor>
<connor> Like, you know what I mean? </connor>
<garnt> It's so interesting. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause the thing about British TV shows is that they like, </garnt>
<garnt> he would make one special a year at most. </garnt>
<garnt> So, they'd obviously been like dwelling on this idea </garnt>
<garnt> for like a long time. </garnt>
<garnt> So, like some ideas are better than others, </garnt>
<garnt> but there's no idea that you hear about </garnt>
<garnt> and you think, "That's not interesting at all." </garnt>
<connor> - His one special he teaches old people </connor>
<garnt> to, like, rob an art gallery. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - That was one as well. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, that's good. </connor>
<connor> You should watch that. </connor>
<garnt> It wasn't his best but it was good. </garnt>
<garnt> - That was a good one. </garnt>
<joey> - I can do that or go watch another episode </joey>
<joey> of "Don't Tell the Bride." </joey>
<joey> (everyone laughs) </joey>
<connor> - That's what it's called! - That's what it's called! </connor>
<connor> We figured it out! </connor>
<connor> - We didn't know what it's called! </connor>
<garnt> Show's over now! </garnt>
<garnt> - And it's all come full circle. </garnt>
<joey> - I figured it out. </joey>
<connor> "Don't Tell the Bride" that's what it's called. </connor>
<joey> - I was thinking like "3,000 Pound Marriage" or something. </joey>
<connor> In UK it was 3,000, it was 3,000, right? </connor>
<connor> - I think it was 10,000. </connor>
<connor> - The episode's over now. </connor>
<joey> The "Trash Taste" episode's over now. </joey>
