<SPEAKER_04> - I can't stop farting recently. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> It's terrible. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just had the most unpleasant shit, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like, five minutes ago. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Are we rolling? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I swear it's not a
"Trash Taste" recording day </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> unless Garnt takes, like, a wicked shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, I know we're
about to start recording </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> when Garnt comes out of his, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> shit training arc. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just on schedule, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Garnt's like, "Oh, its
two PM, all right let's go." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (chill techno music plays) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Welcome to this
episode of "Trash Taste." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm your host of course, your boy Connor </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with Mike Wazowski here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Nice seeing you back, Mike. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And no one else. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I like how you grabbed the G Fuel there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I didn't want to hurt Mike like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - By the way. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Mike! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Mike. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I can't handle Mike that harshly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's great seeing you back, Mike. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And of course the boys, I guess. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I love how we're second to Mike. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Of course, we're all
second to Mike, Joey. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - He's the real player four. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Mike Wazowski for all
you listeners out there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - People are like, "Oh,
there's a guest called Mike." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I forget sometimes that
we have audio only listeners </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> which shout out to you guys. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Hello. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm waving at you right now
even though you can't see. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Let us know your presence. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh wait, you can't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's audio. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - So what've you boys been up to recently? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, fuck all, I guess. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, this is the
first recording session </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> of the new year for us, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So we just come out of our Christmas </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and New Year's I guess "break." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Because it didn't really
feel like a break to me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Even though it's never
really a Christmas holiday </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for YouTubers because I feel like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we've talked about this many times before, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but we never, we are very
bad at taking breaks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - If anything, it's like the
last minute grind, right, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we do at the end of the year. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I've just been
watching a shit ton of anime </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because it's the end of the year. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I remember when I used to do that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - This is like my one time of the year </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where I actually just sit down </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and just catch up to the year. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause you don't feel bad, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause you know that everyone's not, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> doing anything, so it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't feel bad for,
like, binging a few shows. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - What did you binge, Garnt? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> What did you watch? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Basically most of
everything I missed in 2020. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I watched "Jujutsu Kaisen." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yes, that was so good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Have you watched that yet? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Bro, it's so good! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't watch anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Have you read the manga at least? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's really fuckin' good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I was going into it thinking like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> are we just going to get, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> every year there's everyone's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> "Dude, this is the shonen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "It's gonna replace-" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, that's what
I've just been hearing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Then I'm just, like, they
said that about "Dr. Stone." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> They said that about a lot of
shows last couple of years. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm just like, all right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - "Jujutsu Kaisen" is where
I've actually got, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a chub watching it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I'm actually, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm actually like hyped,
like see where it goes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's a show that is just, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> it just knows what it's doing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's obviously been, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> influenced from previous shonen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But my God, it's just doing everything </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that it needs to do right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - All I've heard is that
if you watch the anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it basically does
everything the manga does. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> So it just makes the manga obsolete. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Great. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, that was just
"Demon Slayer," right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I want no manga. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Get rid of manga. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm sick and tired of these, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm kidding, I'm kidding. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why would you disrespect- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was like this man's done, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> entire manga reading streams before. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm about ready to
throw hands right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm tired of manga readers </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> constantly playing the
same damn card, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> When is that card gonna get old? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> How many times can you use the
"I've read the manga" card? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, I use it all the fuckin' time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How many times can you use it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> before you're just an asshole? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, I just don't care. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I think a lot of manga
readers just don't care. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So everyone just says </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the "Jujutsu Kaisen" anime is exactly- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Basically what I've heard is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that the anime does everything
the manga does but better. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, from what I understand </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's just a lot of shonen jump titles. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Seems to be the way to go though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, "Demon Slayer" did it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> You know, "Attack on Titan" is doing it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like, I don't understand
why there was even a thing of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "let's just change the story" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> unless, you know, it
hadn't been adapted yet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Hadn't been, sorry, finished yet, sorry. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Why even changed the story in my mind? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> When everyone loved this thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So everyone's like, yeah,
everyone loves this show, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> let's just change it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I feel like you've
started watching anime </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> after the period where there was, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> so many anime adaptations
that just fucked around </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> with the manga and the story </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that you've forgotten that
this was a legitimate, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> selling points where we
had a manga that followed, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, we had an anime
that followed the manga </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> through to the end. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can understand why they did it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> In the 90s or 80s, whatever. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - You didn't watch the 90s
shonen jump adaptations </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where it's just like, "Oh
no, I liked this manga." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I imagine the producers were just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "I'm sick and fuckin' tired
of these manga readers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> "on their high horse. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "You know what? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I'm a fuck them over and make something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "they can't say, oh, I know what happens." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's probably why </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because they probably, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> brought the manga readers
to the screenings. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> They were like, "Yeah, yeah? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "You know where it's going, do you?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, if anything, it made
the manga readers look better </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause then the anime
watchers would be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> "Well, I've heard from the manga readers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "that this anime's pretty good." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then they go and they're like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "So what happens in the manga? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Could you tell us? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Could you tell us? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> "We're interested now finally." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - But do you find that
like the older you get, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like, the less anime that you watch </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but the more manga that you read? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I'm in that right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like that's like
the path of every anime fan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Maybe I'm not old enough yet. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I haven't got there yet. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're, like, what, two
years younger than me? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Is 25, like, the turning point? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - To be fair it was around
your age where I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Manga's a thing." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Really? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - At 24? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You didn't start reading
manga properly, like, until- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I've been reading manga all my life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But the thing is like
up until around, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a couple of years ago I would
be like very heavily, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I'd say like 80/20 anime/manga, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but now it's like kind of flipped around. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like 80/20 manga to anime now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause you just realize </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that reading manga is
basically watching anime </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but just more optimized. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's basically the speed run
version of watching anime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Basically. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And no voice acting, no music. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> What am I supposed to do? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Do this shit myself? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The only part where it could, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> potentially fuck up is,
like, on the author. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There's, like, no second hand to- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like pure story, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You don't need anything else
but just the pure story. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And sometimes- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's only one person
to blame if it sucks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's because it's like you don't know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> what you're missing out because
you never think about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, you would never, I'll
keep coming back to it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you don't know that you needed
"Giorno's Theme" in your life </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> until you had "Giorno's
Theme" in your life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, Part Five was amazing
without "Giorno's Theme," </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but now Part Five has "Giorno's Theme," </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like 10 times better. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Didn't you read the manga of Part Five </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> before you watched the anime? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I did, and I think the anime is better. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, no, we can agree with that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, we all agree with that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, wait. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was giving it a second to sit there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, all right I'm
waiting for the fans to turn. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Of "Jojo's" by the way. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I haven't seen
all of Part Five yet, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but the little that I have seen is, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> already better than the manga. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But that's not to say
that the manga is bad. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is a very rare case </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where I feel like a legendary
manga has been adapted </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> into a legendary animation. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And we don't get many of those I think. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> It's always one or the other. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because the problem is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when you have a legendary manga </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everyone's expectations
is so fuckin' high. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I think that's what's happening </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with "Attack on Titan" right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I swear to God, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone is looking for
every little fuckin' nitpick </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they can think of to shit on, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the, like, the change of studios. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Where I think MAPPA's doing a
great fuckin' job right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - They're fuckin' killin' it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And the amount of, like,
shitty takes I've seen on Twitter </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> when the first episode aired. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was streaming the
day after it came out, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and all the comments were like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "What do you think of the 3D CGI, Connor, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "in 'Attack on Titan?'" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, "I didn't
even fuckin' notice it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "What do you mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "It was fine." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They're like, "It looked gross! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "What do you mean?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, but it was like two
seconds and it looked fine. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Stop fuckin' nitpickin'. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Holy shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I love all those shitty
takes where it's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh, it's done by, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> "knowing now that it's
done by MAPPA instead of," </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was it Silver Link? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> No, not Silver Link. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Studio Wit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was Studio Wit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, it's like, "Knowing
that it's done by MAPPA </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "instead of Studio Wit, it
just feels different now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> "It just feels different." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I had this image in my head </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of someone in their house, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They've got, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> "Shingeki no Kyogin"
shit all over the room, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> waiting with that popcorn. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They're like, "Yes!" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The moment, like, the CGI comes on, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh, fuck this!" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "I knew they'd fuck it up!" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, 'cause what I want to know is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that did they just forget </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> what the Colossal Titans looked like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in season two and three? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It looked shit! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It looked like absolute
garbage compared to the CG now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And just because every Titan is CG now, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> people, like, I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's just bad takes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I feel like it's just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> because it's such a
massively popular franchise </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I feel the new, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> MAPPA are doing a great job. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And you got a great story anyway. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's what I love
about following, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> those, like, massive toxic fan bases. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just the amount of shit
takes that come out of it is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just so entertaining. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - And people like shitting
on the opening as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I saw that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - what was wrong with the opening? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's what people said
about the last opening! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And now everyone fuckin'
loves the last opening. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I already get it, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> People just get angry
every fuckin' season. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But I guess it's 'cause
the problem is, right, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> is that someone has a bad take on Twitter </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then everyone fuckin' clowns on them, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so that's the only take that anyone sees </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause everyone's fuckin'
clownin' on that guy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> who's like, "The opening sucks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Why's it all colorful?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Although to be fair, the
"Attack on Titan," like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> when episode one came out,
there was a lot of shit takes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was just all over my timeline. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, who are these people? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause people want brownie points, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And so if you're- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Brownie points for what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Looking like a clown? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, that's the thing, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause to these people, it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people aren't gonna see if you're a clown. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But if that one time you
get a successful take </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that, like, takes off. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Imagine the clout you get, Joey. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like, "Yes!" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like the hot, the
science behind hot takes, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause hot takes aren't
actually hot takes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like saying
unpopular opinions, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The unpopular opinions
that people up vote aren't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> actually unpopular opinions. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> You know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just, like, people
say unpopular opinions </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just so they can get brownie points </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because it's never actually. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If it's an actual unpopular opinion, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that's the opinion that people shit on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - That statement alone just, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> completely negated my
"Let's Fight" series. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause that's what that show is all about. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Taking unpopular opinions. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I love that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But like, that's why I have such trouble </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> with, like, making a next episode of that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because every time I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Hey guys, give me your
unpopular opinions on anime." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The top replies are like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Boku no Piko was bad." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, "Really? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> "You don't fuckin' say, mate." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I remember, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause voice actors do a lot
of those challenges on Twitter </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that like, "Hey man, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> "what's an unpopular
voice acting opinion." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "You know, I think hard
work matters the most." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then stuff like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, what do you mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's not even an opinion. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's genuinely good advice. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Just do the thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What's unpopular about it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's like the level of, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah, I don't know, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's what happens. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Twitter's weird, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Especially when you're in
like communities on Twitter </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's, like, creative stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I love watching, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> artist Twitter is my favorite. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Artist Twitter is like
watching trash TV to me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like you can just grab the popcorn. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's like watching "90
Day Fiance" or something, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The amount of tea that
is spilled on, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> artist Twitter, like, it's more tea </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> than the fuckin' Americans
threw into the water </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> when, like, they gained independence, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> My fuckin' god. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know why, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but why is it almost always
written in lowercase? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It's, like, it's never proper punctuation. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just like, let's just make
it as lowercase as possible. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Fuckin' seven tweet thread. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's just like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just shit that you could've summed up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> into just one tweet. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, there's a lot of funny ones. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I love it as well when it's like people, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just artists are, like,
giving advice to each other, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they all like repeat the same stuff. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's always interesting sometimes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because they'll be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Yeah, you should charge
people for your art." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like, is this like not known? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You should charge people for work. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Apparently it's pretty common though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, you see the messages
on, like, For Exposure, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That Twitter account. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> For Exposure is a Twitter
account people, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> ask people to do things "for
exposure" which is very funny. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is that an unpopular
opinion you just gave? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Doing work for free. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - That artists should get paid? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Guys, I'm gonna do an
unpopular take right now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Guys, guys, guys,
don't count me for this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but artists should get
paid for their work. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - To be fair though, I joke on that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but a lot of voice actors, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where they start out they'll
spend all their money on, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the new stuff and then they'll be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> "Yeah, I'll do your commercial for free." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause it's different with artists </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I think voice actors
'cause voice actors, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you get credits. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You need credits. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So it's like a race. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Everyone's just, like,
de-valuing themselves </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause they're like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Yeah, I'll do your
Kellogg's commercial for $2 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "and a Kit-Kat bar. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Like, that's fair. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "That seems good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "My name's on the credit though, right?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think there is a
balance that should be taken </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because there is value in clout basically. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean that's how we
make our money, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's literally we are monetizing clout. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That is the modern day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We are clout chasers as an occupation. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Go on. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no, but like I get, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> artists should definitely be paid </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you definitely have a skill set, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> but there's also building up
your personal branding as well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which you have to worry about. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's the problem, right, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> is that so many artists starting out, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> they don't see themselves
as a brand per se </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> because of that artist mentality. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They're not like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh no, I'm just doing it
because I like drawing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "I don't want to make this a profession." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But then they make one piece
where it's really popular </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and getting shared fuckin' everywhere. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And then suddenly they're like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> "Actually I'm a brand. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> "You're stealing." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause I've seen the
exact opposite of, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> talented artists who just
don't know how to charge here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> where you have like an artist
who has like two drawings </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on their portfolio or something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and are charging, like,
ridiculous amounts of money. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's just like, come on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> There's a balance that
needs to be taken here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, my favorite is when they're like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've worked with some artists before. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And like great. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know, it's all good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know, and it's all reasonable. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> All the prices seem fair. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I'm like, oh, it's
for, like, commercial use </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And they're like, "Oh,
you're like selling it?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then they might, like,
try and figure out like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Okay, you make this much money. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "It's now worth $10,000 for this piece." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's like, what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What do you mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> No, okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm pretty sure on
your website it said $20. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Looks at industry standard rates. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That ain't right, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Well I'm not Pepsi. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which is basically the
Fiverr environment, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> How is it like working with people. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> How do you know how much you're worth? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And how to sell yourself on Fiverr? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because I think on Fiverr, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> it's inherently people,
like, devalue themselves. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> But there are people on Fiverr
who are charging like $500 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for honestly what is
like really bad quality. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> But then the thing is right on Fiverr, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at least I can only speak for voice actors </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I've hired a lot
of voice actors on Fiverr, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and like voice actors
on Fiverr there's, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> $5 is, like, you get a very
wide variety of, like, skill. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You go all the way from headset mic. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause Fiverr there's no checks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There's no one on Fiverr being like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Yeah, you seem like a voice actor. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "You're good to go, champ." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, "Oh, you have
something that your PC recognizes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "as an audio recording device. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "You're good to go." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Tyler1 fuckin' headset
microphone all the way. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've heard people with
worse quality microphones </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> than Tyler1 screaming. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> They're charging, like,
$20 with commercial rights </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as an option. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - What commercial? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - How do you not know
what a good microphone is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but you know that you should be charging </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for commercial rights? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, these two things are like, come on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But then Fiverr does, like,
scummy things as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, Fiverr takes cuts
from, like, the tips, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and Fiverr also, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't like personally
that Fiverr charges extra </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for, like, higher quality audio files. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just think you should
just send them a WAV file. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Or high quality MP3s. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So are people just sending MP3s- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 128 kilobytes MP3. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Fuckin' putting the WAV
behind jail or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, they put like WAV files
behind paywalls some times. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, why? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Don't do that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just give me the fuckin' WAV file. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Why would you not do that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's, like, difference
between high and low quality. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> It doesn't matter. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I didn't know fuckin' </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the voice acting industry had DLC now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Jesus Christ! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's literally DLC. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The WAV expansion. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You want the ray tracing
voice acting pack add on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, you gotta fuckin' pay $5 extra. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But it's, like, there's people on Fiverr </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who, you know, charge industry rates. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I don't think Fiverr given the, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Fiverr shouldn't be charging
industry rates in my opinion </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause it's like not really
where you should be hiring. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Industry shouldn't be hiring on Fiverr, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and the ones that do I think
should be kind of like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We won't get into that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I never had that experience myself. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But yeah, no, I mean it's difficult, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and Fiverr voice actors are, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just listen to their audio. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You'll know if they're worth it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, it's not just Fiverr audios. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's Fiverr- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Everything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Everything, every creative
job you can think of. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The way I feel about Fiverr
is that a good testing ground </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause you've got such a wide range. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I feel like it would be a good place </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to build up your portfolio </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> because from what I see, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it doesn't really matter </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where you had your education or whatever. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What we really care about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause most of the time
we are the clients now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We're buying the service. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We just care about your portfolio. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's the thing that's
most important to me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, show me your work. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's a good place to build
up your portfolio as well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and also get paid. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, I used to recommend
to voice actors, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if no one's hiring you, you
don't know where to start, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know, don't go to
one of these websites </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that costs, like, $400
a year to sign up too </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause you're not gonna
make your money back. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, like for example, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if we're hiring video editors, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like we can get emails about people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who are qualified for X, Y, and Z. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> But at the end of the day, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we're most likely gonna pick people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who have worked on anime videos </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause we know they
have experience working </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in that fuckin' field. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Or who, like, actually know us </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and, like, watch our videos and stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, that's the thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It's more about knowing
your target audience </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and knowing what your
personal branding is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's less important
about what you put on your CV </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because we don't really
care about CVs that much. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't give a shit
what school you went to. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Is the shit good or not? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, it's all there is to it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's lots of video editors out there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just a matter of- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I normally go to,
like, Fiverr or somewhere </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> for like if I need something,
like, one off and, like, fast. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, I just like, because other times </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it's a bit of a pain to search around. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Have you used Fiverr other
than in your Fiverr videos? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I've used it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I used it for, where did I use it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If I need something composed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause I don't know any composers. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, making music. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I go from knowing zero
composers to Kevin Penkin. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I can't go, "Oh, Kevin mate. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "I got this video idea. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Could you just compose
me a track for it?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, so I'll go to someone I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm only like make it,
like, a middy track of this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or make, like, a version of that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's normally very basic, like, thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where I'm, like, "Copy this thing." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, I mean, I think I've had, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> some emotes on my Twitch drawn there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was pretty decent. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, there's a lot of
Twitch stuff on there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, there's a lot of
artists on Fiverr, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, oh my god, there's so many. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Or "artists." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is that where you get your Twitch stuff? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I've actually been looking to try </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and, like, upgrade my Twitch presentation </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> because my Twitch
presentation is fuckin' shit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I've never given the
shit about streaming before. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Problem is on Fiverr,
it's tailored towards, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I think what the like
general audience of people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who are looking to get into
live streaming would want. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So it's all like very gamer looking. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know what I mean
when I say that, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, 90% of the Fiverr
stuff for, like, Twitch, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like, Twitch overlays
all looks like something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that is an application to the FaZe Clan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, it doesn't look like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like the default ones </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you get on, like, Streamlabs, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, which is why I think
I ended up hiring someone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who I know that did a lot of this stuff </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and who watched some of my stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> So they were kind of
familiar with my stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm thinking to update mine as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I met an artist recently </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who probably gonna get to hire </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because yeah, at the same thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, right now I'm using,
like, a default one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just like, should probably
personalize it a little more, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> make it stand out a little bit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - How'd you guys find artists? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> You just DM people on Twitter? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just tweet out or,
like, ask on live streams. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, "Hey guys, I need something. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Can someone tell me like where I go?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - A lot of them actually
I find through, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> them doing fan art of me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, so like the person I'm
probably gonna be hiring soon </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is Rocket Cat who did
like a bunch of, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> drawings with me and Chris,
the journey across Japan stuff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And it was really fuckin' cute. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I asked her and I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Can you do some Twitch stuff?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And she was like, "Okay." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> So just asking around really. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I have, like, no idea what art is worth, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> so whatever they give me,
if it's not ridiculous. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, sure, fuck it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I'll pay that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm way more comfortable
being like, "What do you want?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know, versus like,
"I'll give you $15." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's always a debate, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Is it you as the buyer should ask </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> or should the person, the client, say, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Hey, this is what I'm worth." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because it frustrates me when I hear like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "What's your budget?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, I don't
have a fuckin' budget. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What are you worth? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What's your hourly rate? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You tell me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, I don't know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I understand that that's in place </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for people who can't maybe
afford, like, a lot of things. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I'm like, "I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> "Whatever you think it's
worth, tell me, I'll pay it." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like a fuckin' standoff, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, you're
waiting for the first one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> to, like, say a number. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just like, how much is this worth? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, what's your budget? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I fuckin' hate that debate! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I get it from the artist's perspective </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because like, they're probably like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh, if I say something
that's a little too high </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "then I'm afraid I might lose the client." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> That's when you can negotiate, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You can be like, "Ah, I think
that's a little too high." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, but a lot of them starting off </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't know any better. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - True, true. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was afraid at first as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, when you know, I'd get
sponsorship opportunities </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> they'd be like, "What do you want for it?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, "Ah, fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> "I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> "How much do you have?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Have either you been ever
good at, like, bartering or? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I love doing it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, I've learned to do it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just 'cause my dad was really good at it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I fuckin' suck at it, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This is why I love Japan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where everything is labeled and priced. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Because whenever I go to Thailand, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you just play this dance
around everything you buy, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because it is a fuckin'
dance where you're just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh, okay, so you're gonna charge me that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> "Well, I'm gonna, like, say a
price that's 10 times lower." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - In Australia it's, like, a
dance that you will only dance </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you decide to enter the ring. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, you can stand back
and just kind of be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh, this is how much you want? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "All right then." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Pull your wallet out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> But then you could also be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Hold on, let me roll up
my sleeves real quick. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Let's samba, baby." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because like my dad was so fuckin', </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause my dad has been,
like, an IT salesman </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for, like, the past 30 years. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So this man, I don't know
how the fuck he did it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I remember, like, when
I was in, like, high school </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or something and I wanted
to buy my first guitar, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like a proper electric guitar. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he bought me like this like
really nice Epiphone guitar </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is worth like
two grand or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he looked at it and he's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "So this is just the guitar, right?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And the guy's like, "Yeah." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He was like, "Can I have
a chat with you, mate?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> And he took the dude back
behind the counter into a room. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And he's like, "Hold on, son." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Did he fuckin' beat him up? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why'd he have to go in the back? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Why couldn't he do it at the counter? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But he like took him to the back. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He was like, "All right, let me talk." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And then I think maybe like
10 minutes later he came out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's free. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's free. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Black eye. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He came out 10 minutes later, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and he's like, "All right,
so the guitar now is 1500." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And he threw in a free amp. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like, "What did you say? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "What did you do? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "How did you do it?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He's like, "I just talked to him, mate." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, no, no, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, if it was that easy, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then everyone would be getting deals. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's not just a matter of,
"Oh, I just talked to him." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, what did you say to him? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Everyone can talk. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - He'll never know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was like, "What did you say?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Did he do a fuckin' Jedi mind trick? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's technically
fuckin' talkin' isn't it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Did you like inception,
like, plant the seed? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And he's just like, "It's 1500 now." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - The first time I ever
saw, like, bartering happen, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, my mind was blown. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Wait, you can go against
the price that's written?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You can do that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's an option? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because, like, we were on
a school trip to New York. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It was the first time
our school ever, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> went to a different country. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You got to go to New York for school? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, dude. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was chaos. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was pure fuckin' chaos. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - What the fuck? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - How old were you? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 16 I think. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was an absolute mess, bro. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - The only school trips I went to was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just, like, France at most. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That was the furthest that I've
ever gone to a school trip. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That was, like, the bougiest one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And for some reason, for one
year, they never did it again. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think they realized
it was horrible mistake. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They took us to New York. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was a fuckin' mess. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was awful. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, if I was a teacher
there I would have hated it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I had a great time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But yeah, I remember
it was very expensive, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but we stayed in, like,
really fuckin' sketchy motels. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can talk about it more after the story, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but we were basically like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I really wanted converse </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause obviously when you're like 15, 16, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you see the shit on, like, American TV, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're like, "Yo, Converse." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I went to a store and
my friend was with me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and he was in the year above me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, "Man, I want to get these. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "But I've only got like 30 bucks left </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "and they're 40 bucks." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He was like, "Oh, I'll ask
him if we can do it for 30." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He was like 17, bartering with him. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then eventually he said, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I'll give you for 30 if
you give me a $2 tip." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, "Is that okay? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Are you allowed to do that?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know if he's the owner or what, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but that's what he got it down to. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was so impressed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> When I went home to the
UK, I tried to do it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but immediately all the
stores are like, "No." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wait, what store was this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - In America or the UK? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - In America. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Was it an official store? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think it was like in a mall, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it was like an
independent store maybe? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think that's why I got away with it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I went to like a fuckin'
supermarket in the UK, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> go to the theater- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Go to fuckin' Tesco. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Five pounds is a little
too much for this meal deal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're selling me this
Kellogg's fuckin' Krispy Kremes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for like how much? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'll be like, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> "Three pounds is a little expensive. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Could you do 2.50?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - "Yeah, I'll do 2.50. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "I'll do 2.50." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - "I'll give ya 2.50." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> She's like, "No, no." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, oh, okay, fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I never tried
it again for awhile. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I like going to
places where you can do it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> because I like trying to do it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't often succeed though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know how, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I probably could do it
if I really wanted to, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> but I'm always just so fuckin'
afraid to do it as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're like um. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause with that kind of stuff, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> if you're not coming in with confidence, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're basically fucked. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> There's no way you're gonna win it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You need to come in with,
like, a winning mentality. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You gotta come up in with,
like, the biggest dick energy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, I can do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It just takes so much fuckin' energy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> But whenever you're in a
place in, like, Thailand, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's like 90% of the stores you go to, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you just want a store
where you pay the price </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that they originally ask for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and just not have to like do
this mini game every time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I remember I watched like the, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I think I mentioned him
on the YouTube rep series. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He does videos about Prague. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He covers, like, taxi scams. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was in Prague, and I had a taxi, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was like this is
like in the simulations. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is exactly what he spoke about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause they were trying to charge me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what he said was being overcharged. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember I was with my mate in a taxi. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, "No, no I've
seen the YouTube video. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I've got this." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, "I'm not paying that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "That's too much." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And eventually we got
it, like, half the price. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was supposed to be, like, 50 euros </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for like the equivalent in Czech money </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for, like, it was supposed
to be, like, half that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was like only like a 20
minute, like 15 minute journey. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, "No, I've
seen the simulations. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I know this is right." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And there's YouTube channels of dudes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who go around India, like, bartering. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I can imagine bartering in
India is just like next level. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> That's like expert mode, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's literally, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it looks like a reality TV
show with every purchase. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The guy's like, "I'm walking away. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> "I'm going, I'm not getting in your taxi." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then they're like following him. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - "No, no, no, please, please!" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - "Please, please, sir!" </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_02> - Get good, Conner. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Get good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But yeah, back to my
school trip to America. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It was my first time
ever going to America. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I remember there was two things. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I was really excited for going to America. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What do you think they were? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - In-N-Out? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, I didn't go there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I only went to New York. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, you only went to New York. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The food? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I wanted two things from
what I'd seen from media. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I wanted Twinkies, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I wanted Mountain Dew. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wait, do they not
have Mountain Dew in UK? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They do, but it's not, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's the stuff without,
like, the green stuff in it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because that stuff's illegal in the UK. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Our Mountain Dew just
tastes like Sprite. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - What? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - We have it, but it's not that popular </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and it doesn't taste
like Mountain Dew at all. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's not proper Mountain Dew. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What the fuck is in Mountain Dew </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> that makes it illegal in the UK? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - The stuff that makes it super green. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like, 'cause I'm pretty sure, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> all the sodas in the UK </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're not allowed to
use corn syrup either. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So, like Coke and soda
in America tastes different </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> from, like, sodas in the UK. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Ours does have less sugar in it as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It has, like, a little less
sugar, and you can taste it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> You can definitely taste the difference. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The first time I had,
like, proper Mountain Dew, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> or I guess now I know is
proper Mountain Dew in America, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Australia might have
different, it might not. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But Twinkies are shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Twinkies tastes like ass. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why did you think it was good? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because in all the TV shows </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> they made Twinkies look amazing! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Did they? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - From what TV show? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Maybe like "Zombie Land"
or something actually </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because he's obsessed with
them in "Zombie Land." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Then I also learned that they, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can survive nukes or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't think that's true at all. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> But in "Family Guy-" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like survival food. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I wonder how much Twinkies
paid "Zombie Land" like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> to fuckin' promote. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That was fantastic advertising. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - That was like five head
advertising right there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I went there as a teenager,
and I fuckin' wanted Twinkies. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - The shitty spongy thing
that you put into your mouth, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> survival food. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> During an apocalypse. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - My God, so like I'm prone
to getting like nosebleeds </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> as well until I got my nose cauterized </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is like, when you
get like fuckin' burn it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, if it got like even remotely
hot I would get nosebleeds. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> So when I went to America,
it was just too hot </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause it was in the summer </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I just every day I had nose bleeds. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - How hot does it get in
New York in the summer? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's pretty damn hot. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Pretty humid. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I remember I went to
New York once in the summer, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it was like pretty hot and humid. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, in the 30s. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know why I thought </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because it's so cold in the winter </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I would assume it got, like,
quite cool in the summer. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was great though </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause any of the like
really boring places, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I would just be like, come on. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I'd get to go get
ice cream or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The staff would go take me out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause we were like going
through like one museum </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that was really fucking boring. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can't remember what it was as a kid. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, it's the big museum
in New York, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, the Smithsonian was pretty cool </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause that has, like,
loads of exhibits and stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There was some other
museum they took us to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which was like, maybe it was, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> some CIA thing that was, like, just books. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like, I have
no interest in this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I have no interest. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Pow! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - They just like, let us go
around Times Square on our own. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That could have gone horrendously wrong. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, that sounds really dangerous. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, Times Square is like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I wouldn't let my 16 year old kid. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't even feel safe
during the day in Times Square </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> let alone at a night. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't feel safe as an adult there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> let alone like a 16 year old kid. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I remember (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just so funny. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> One of the kids came back
and he had a bunch of CDs. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And we were like, "Why do you have CDs?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> He's like, "Oh, well the
guys kept coming up to me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "and telling me if I
wanted to hear them spit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "So I kept having to buy
them for five dollars." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, you know, the
dudes come up to you like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Yo, here's mix tape." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> He was paying every time for
everyone that came up to him. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So he just has all of
these, like, shitty mix tapes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I can't remember what I did. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think I just went around all the stores, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> just looked at it and be like,
"Wow, it's just so strange." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Would go in like M&M World and be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Wow, I can't afford any of it." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Because it would be like
$10 for a pack of M&Ms. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, "Wow, I'm really broke, huh? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> "My parents really didn't
give me enough money." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Can't even afford M&Ms. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember as well, our
hotel, they put us in, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think it's like the sun
inn, what is that called? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like the Comfort Inn or something? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Is that what it's called? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The chain? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's the sun... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's got like a sun logo. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think it's called Comfort Inn. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I remember we were all baffled </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because the only thing they had </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for breakfast was like burgers
that could be microwaved. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And it was disgusting. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We were all like, "Yeah, American food!" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We ate it, and we were
like, "Oh, American food." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like some White Castle shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it was gross. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember as well that we
had to get the bus everywhere. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it was just the worst
'cause they tried to fit, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like they used public
buses, like private coaches. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - The more you're talking
the more I'm realizing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who decided to go on a
school trip to New York? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think it must have been one teacher </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> that really fuckin' wanted to go. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It makes sense that they
didn't do it the year after. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - So, we would go on,
like, the public buses. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, the whole, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> 40 kids would go on a normal public bus. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was already full. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That sounds terrifying. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, and then all the dudes
were like topless on the bus. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And we were like, "Oh God,
oh God, I'm in danger." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> And then when the teachers
would all go to bed, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> all the fuckin' kids
just went out at night. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And we were in 'cause we were obviously, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> we were like not a rich school at all. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So we were in, like, the really
sketchy part of New York. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But you're rich enough
to go to New York though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Not really. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I remember the whole trip
for like four or five days </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with flights and five
hotels was, like, 800 pounds </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and everything was taken for. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I guess that has to
compensate for the flights. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Very budget, very budget. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> So the hotels we stayed in
were, like, not good at all. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Were they, like, in the ghetto? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Bro, we were hella. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Imagine it, you've got like 40 just, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> white school kids that have
no idea what's going on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Then they break out at
night in like a ghetto. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, oh God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Were you guys in, like,
Harlem or something? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can't remember where we
were, but we were very far away. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was like a 40 minute
bus journey into town. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, Jesus, that could've
been anywhere sketch. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I think we were- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like Queens maybe. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think we might've been
around somewhere like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was definitely, I remember that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember having these, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because you would see on the
movies that New York was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah man, it's bustling, it's great. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Why is where we're staying
everything is boarded up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> "and dirty? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "What's up with that?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because the hustling
bustling is like two blocks </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> in Manhattan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I distinctly remember I
really didn't like New York, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and I liked DC because when we went to DC, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was really nice. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I remember that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause I was just scared
when we were in New York. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - That was my first impression
going to New York as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I also went when, I was a bit older. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> So I was like 22 or something like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I feel like when you're 16 and 22, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the way you see the world
is completely different. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I still had this, like, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the American film image of New York. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I remember my first time going there, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember thinking, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Man, there's a lot of street
corners that I've never seen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "in any films that look
pretty fuckin' dodgy." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is where, like,
Spider-Man's parents got killed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's the thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> When I went to New York
like four or five years ago, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like, it was really good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> as long as your neck was
like above, like, landscape. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, "Wow, these buildings
look really good." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And the moment you look
down and just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh, that's a lot of trash." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - That was my first impression. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There is a lot of trash </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that just has never appeared on any films. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, there is mountain
of trash on this corner </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that is like reaching,
like, traffic lights. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like, my God, going to
Chinatown for the first time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it don't hit different. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It smell differently, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is episode 33
where we clown on America. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Actually I remember on stream yesterday, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I had a person coming and being like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> "Why do you guys hate America?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - We don't hate America. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I love how absurd America is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - The way I talk about Americans is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like the way I like to shit on my cousins. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like the distant cousin </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I just like to talk shit about. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - We don't hate on America. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We just like making fun of America. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> There's a big difference. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know, Europe's boring. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> There's nothing weird about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> America is weird to a T, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and that's why I love it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, no, it comes from a place of love. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This is how us Brits show like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we, you know, we talk
shit to our like mates. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's how I see it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, they're like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Innit, oh, your teeth are shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> "Go drink and some tea." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And they're like, "Wait, why
are you making fun of America?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Call your mates "cunts,"
and ya call cunts "mate." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's how it works. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - True, true. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Would you ever live in America? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Have I asked this before on the podcast? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't think you've
asked me on the podcast. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think I've asked you personally. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Can't remember what your answer was. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> That's why I'm asking again. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean like, I've given it- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're dating, because
you're both with Americans. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, we hate Americans. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> We hate America, we hate
Americans so much so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> that are significant others are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> from that country.
- Are Americans. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know the way Sydney talks to me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> about food sometimes
with, like, a nostalgia. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, disgusting. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Gosh. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've considered living in
America for maybe like a year </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just to like give it a go. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like, it's an asylum. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I would go there to visit, you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like, for real I don't hate visiting. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, I love visiting
America, but I don't, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Just difference in
personality at least with me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and, like, way of living is, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's very different to
what I'm used to open. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I love how open everyone is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I do love how open everything is, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> open everyone is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel like the biggest thing
I would have to get to is, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> like, I like feeling safe. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, legit, legit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> The only thing stopping me
from living in America is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the fact that even during
the day I don't feel safe. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, like it's so weird for me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where you can be in some
of the most famous places </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> in the world in America, and
you just can't walk anywhere. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I like walking to places,
you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, Japan is all
about walking everywhere. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel like I have to
recalibrate my brain in order </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> to travel to places in America </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I forget that you
have to just drive everywhere </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and just walking isn't normalized </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because, you know, it's just not safe. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Even when you're in like
the middle of LA, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, you'd be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh, you know, I'll just
like go to the Starbucks </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "that's just around the corner." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> You know, it's like just going
to the next town in an RPG. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And yet on the street corner, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> there's a level 100 crackhead
standing there being like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "You gonna come passed me?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - When I was in San Francisco, man, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> just walking back to my
hotel at 2:00 AM felt </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like a Cyberpunk mission, dude. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, honestly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's scary there! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - The fuckin' music
was playing in my ears. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The fact that you said
you walked back at 2:00 AM </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just like already scares me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, I legit have never been scared </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> just walking somewhere. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was right in the middle </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> of like the financial
district in San Francisco. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, "Fuck." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think I've mentioned it
before on the podcast a while. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> But yeah, that was fuckin' scary. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Fuck, I'm scared. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm scared thinking about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's the only thing that's stopping me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from living in America. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Also everyone I know from San Francisco </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> has had their car broken into. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I've heard so many
weird stories about, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> some of the stories that Meilyne says </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause Meilyne is from San Fran </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where it's one of it's, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> it's so counter-intuitive for
me where this is the place </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where it's got like one of, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the highest cost of living in the world. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Pay like a million dollars
a year to live there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like, a millionaire is
considered like poor there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> That's kind of the place
we're talking about, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yet it's a place where the
cost of living is so high, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yet it seems like you still need to worry </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about some of the stuff </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where I feel like if I'm
earning a million dollars, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I wouldn't need to worry about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, why would I need to worry? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Like why would I need to pay this much </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and worry about living in a neighborhood </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where my car could get broken into? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yet, it feels like everyone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> who I've met from San Fran
has had something stolen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> or something robbed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - They talk about that
as if they got, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a parking ticket. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> You know, it's like, "Ah, shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> "Got it again. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh, well." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, when Meilyne was talking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about how she has to have
like one headphone in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just in case of someone
behind her to, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> take her purse or something, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, "What the fuck?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, why would you, how
do you feel safe living </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in a city like that or a country
like that for that matter? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is why I'm convinced
the Cyber truck's being made. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> It's purely so it can withstand criminals </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in San Francisco breaking in. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Everyone's gonna be in, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fuckin', like, armored
trucks in San Francisco. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> But they'll still find
a way to break into it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But that's the thing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> the only places I feel
safe in America are, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the super tourist heavy places right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So like the piers in San Francisco, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or like, you know, fuckin' Vegas strip. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, UK's somewhere
in the middle I think. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, you can't really,
like, leave your laptop </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on the dashboard really? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I would argue though,
like, other than Japan, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> there's not a lot of countries
where you can do that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, not really. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But like in the UK, I'd leave, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my headphones on the chair. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't really mind risking that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, I wouldn't even do that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, it depends where you are. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> London? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> No. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, Wales? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, it's whatever. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, yeah, because
that's countryside, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - What are they gonna do? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Run away with the sheep? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Get on the sheep. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "All right, go, go, go!" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, yeah, I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's weird. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've always said this
I've always wanted to live </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in America for a year. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I would like to live in America for- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I wouldn't mind trying it out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think if I moved from Japan, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think I would like to try and get- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm still like because
me and Sydney want to move </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> to America for a bit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because, like, her family's there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and, you know, she wants
to be close to her family </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> for a while. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just finding the perfect place </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I would actually want
to live in for a while. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause I don't know where I
could see myself settling down </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> in America. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because like, you know,
for YouTubers it's, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the number one spot is always
LA, but fuck living in LA. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Sorry if you're from LA. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, it's not about LA. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's about LA YouTubers, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - LA YouTubers are different beasts, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - They are a different breed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel like there's literally
just two scenes on YouTube, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> YouTube and LA YouTube. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's totally different. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, and you know, when
someone's living in LA I swear </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause when you talk to them, you're like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Bro, you're just, like,
in another reality." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - "You sound brainwashed." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - But I get it because
like when you're there, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like, you feel it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> You feel like you're in a
different place when you're in LA, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you feel like everything you do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> somehow has a bigger weight to it I think. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I think that's what they think. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Everything's like
brand, fuckin' marketing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - We were talking about
clout chasing before, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> LA's like the epicenter
of clout chasing I feel. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, everyone's out to get some clout. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I feel dirty when I'm there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> When I'm talking to people. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm just, like, I'm just
trying to get Starbucks, bro. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, why are we talking
about how many subs you have? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, I don't care. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - But did you see, like, that
Dunkey video where he, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> did a commentary over- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - The 100 Thieves. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - The 100 Thieves one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, the house! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, the 100 Thieves house. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - 100 Thieves is an E-sports
organization made by Nadeshot </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> who used to be a YouTuber. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> But yeah, he started one,
so he has his own little, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you want to go tell the rest of it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, so he basically
commentates over, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this house tour. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it is like, the way
Dunkey commentates it is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> basically like you're going
into a different fuckin' world </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause what was like the room? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like the fuckin' </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Tortino's. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Tortino Fortnite
training room or something. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just like, this sounds like a, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you say out of context </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and this sounds like
a dystopian nightmare. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Every room has a
sponsor in the building. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So when you mention I'm in this room, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> you have to say like, I'm in
the Monster Energy gaming room. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I want that for Trash Tastes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is our Del Taco's toilet. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm in the Tenga recording room. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Dude, I'll fuckin'
have Tenga sponsor us. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Tenga coffee room. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yes, yes, yes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - We should probably
explain what a Tenga is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to the audience I guess. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah 'cause YouTube
just recently got one, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - We got a joke gift from a friend of ours </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who gave us a Tenga which is just- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - A Tenga is just a, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> is a branded fleshlight. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - A fleshlight. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> No, a Japanese fleshlight. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's a high class fleshlight. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Fleshlights when I see them, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they make me look uncomfortable. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, sorry, when I see
them I feel uncomfortable. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, I see it and I'm like,
why does it look like that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Why's it look like Donkey Kong's lips? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's fuckin' disgusting. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What is that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It's so gross. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've never heard anyone refer to a Tenga </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as Donkey Kong's lips. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, the stereotypical
fleshlight you see, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> why would anyone want to
stick their dick in that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It looks disgusting. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, that's true. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - How horny you gotta be to do that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> You know, I don't wanna know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because the thing is no
one's using like a fleshlight </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and actually looking at it to be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh yeah, I'm like basically
fucking a pussy a now." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, nobody cares what it looks like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's so gross. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know how Tenga
managed to make it look normal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No they make it look like a- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like an ornament. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, like a sleek thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If you come to Japan, go check it out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> They're in, like, Don Quijote. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, in a lot of stores. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, so there's like
different types of Tenga. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember the first
time I heard of it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> just the Tenga eggs, which- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How do those work?
- I've never seen that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - You've never seen them? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It's, like, you can get like a half dozen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> or like a dozen of them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's in an actual, like, egg carton. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - So yeah, they sell actual egg cartons, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and there's these Tenga eggs, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which are actually like, I've never- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Where do you put your dick in there? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So, how does it work? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So you have to like crack it open </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and then it kind of stretches out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, it's basically just like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - So wait, you literally just
crack it open on the side and- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - You kinda just fuckin' do
this and it cracks on the side. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then basically, like,
the fleshlight part is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of, like, squashed in. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So you like stretch it out, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then you kind of just wrap it up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Don't ask me how I know that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - You know what's one thing
I've never understood? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> People who jack off in their socks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What's up with that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know anyone who
jacks off in their socks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I hear it all the time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I thought that was just an urban legend. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - There was someone in
my university who did it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> He would jack off into, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he had socks specifically for jacking off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why would you give your
dick carpet burn like that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, how is that fuckin'
comfortable at all? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - For some reason, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> the thought of using
tissue is too much effort. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like rubbing your
bare dick on the carpet. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It just sounds like it hurts. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Is that how furries happened? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's the first step of yiffy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> That's how you yiff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - You get a taste for the
fur, you can't go back. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - But you hear it all the time, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like the whole, like,
crusty socks kind of thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just like, (laughs)
that's a funny fictional thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> that never happens. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So the guy in my one, he would use them, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like he would use his
dirty socks that he could, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> you know, when you go to
bed, you take off your socks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, he would just throw them in his room. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Then when he was going to
do it, he would grab one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then he was like,
"Well, it doesn't matter. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "I'm gonna wash it anyway." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, "So wait, you're telling me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Let me get this straight. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "You might've played rugby,
you might've gone running. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "You would use that sock and then-" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Dude, he literally gave
himself his own foot job. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He gave himself a self
foot job, basically. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - But a sweaty stinky foot job. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm so sorry to the listeners
who are grossed out by this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But yeah, I just couldn't believe it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And I've asked people
like, "Do you do this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Is this is a thing? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Do you know anyone?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I know people who know people who do it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm like, "Why are
you friends with them? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "What's wrong with you?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, but what if they're doing like a, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh yeah, a friend of a friend of mine," </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> but it's actually them? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I've heard people who
have found out, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> the sister found their brother doing it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've heard that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, that's the worst. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's gross. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Imagine walking in your brother's, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you see his, like, socks. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Why are they crusty?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I just don't understand how they, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause I've heard of people
as well using the same sock </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> more than once without cleaning it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do they want to get like a fuckin' UTI? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's just like the speed
run any percent to, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> a sexual transmitted disease. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, I don't understand. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Chlamydia any percent. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is like Victorian
era syphilis simulator. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, what is this? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - At which point was the
tissue just too, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> complicated to figure out? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Get a box. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> They're not hard to put on any surface. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They're flat, you know, just. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Or if you can't even do that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just roll of toilet paper, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like that'll also suffice. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just don't understand. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean like, dude, aside from, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fuckin' apparently wanking into socks </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which is what we're talking about. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Do you actually know
anyone who owns, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a fuckin' pocket pussy? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, a non Tenga? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, like a non Tenga. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like people don't admit it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel like it's probably
way more than I realize. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know anyone who's, like I- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause they're not telling you, Garnt. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They're not telling you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Is it just a thing that guys
just don't tell each other? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Or is it just a thing
that guys just don't buy? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think there's a
certain shame in admitting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that you cum into a plastic toy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel as well, like maybe
we're just hanging out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with, like, not those kinds of people. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] I think it's also because like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I'm kidding.
(everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like you said, they look fuckin' ugly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and look fuckin' weird. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, there's no way that
your mom opens a drawer </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and sees like an owner
hole or pocket pussy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> How do you explain that shit away? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like, to me in my mind, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it has to be like,
there's two graphs, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> There's effort to clean it
and enjoyment I get out of it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Are you like midmaxing
pocket pussies right now? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because the problem is, right, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is that I don't want to clean it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't want anything to
do with it when I'm done. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I want it to be done and dusted. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You get it in a tissue,
you throw that shit away. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's gone. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's out of my mind. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, worst case scenario </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if I'm really desperate
for lube for some reason, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm sure I can just lube up my hand. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I don't want to make a mess. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That is like my priority here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just want to get this over with. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not trying to have, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not lighting candles,
you know, scenting the air. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, I don't give a fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just trying to get it done. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Turn on the mood lights. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like, I don't understand, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's that enjoyable to them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that they're willing to
go then to the kitchen, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have this shameful thing and just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "All right, I'm gonna clean out my jizz." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, I don't want to touch that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't want to fuckin'
do anything with it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I get disgusted when I get
a little bit on my hand. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, "Oh no, that won't do at all. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> "Get that off." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just some people
just don't care, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just weird for me because, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it seems like it's, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> socially acceptable for
girls to have, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> whatever sex toy they want, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I mean, they sell it
on high street stores. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like in England we have Ann Summers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where you can go in there and- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I get it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> For a guy it's like you can
do it in, like, two seconds. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Get it done, done and dusted
if you really need to. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> For a girl I guess it takes longer. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's a bit harder. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - For the girl, you
actually have to, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> light the candles and
turn on the mood lights. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, but I also imagine, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fingering yourself is, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I wouldn't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Connor laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's probably a little more difficult. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I wouldn't know that
the thumb is way harder </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> than the pinky, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I wouldn't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - This is getting way too
graphic for this podcast. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Cut that, cut that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Have you though? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Fingered myself? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, me neither. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay Joey, what the fuck? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm guessing we're cutting this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - No. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - What the fuck? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Where the fuck did that come from? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Are you admitting that
you fingered yourself? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - No! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you have something
you wanna tell us, Joey? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I said no! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Something you wanna admit, bro? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I said no! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's like the have you ever? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We're all homies here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - My homies don't like fingering. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Joey's like, "My stool broke one time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "I've never been the same." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - But yeah, I guess like coming to Japan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I am impressed by the
fuckin' variety of sex toys. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, I see it way more often </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because you know I'm fuckin' dating Sydney </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's her fuckin' job </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to review these different types of things. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But man, they are so imaginative and I- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I unironically love going to just, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> there's one in Akihabara </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I always go to called Love
Merci, I think it's called. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's like under the bridge, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's like a four-story
fuckin' sex shop. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And that's right in the
middle of Akihabara, isn't it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right in front of the station! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It doesn't look like a adult store. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - And like the fourth floor,
like the top floor is, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no females allowed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause, like, that's where
all like the guy toys </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and, like, the fucked up porn is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like, "How bad could it be?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> So I went up there, and I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Yeah, I'm allowed on
this floor technically </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "under the rules of the store, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "but I don't want to be on this floor." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It feels illegal just being around that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like I'm committing
a felony just being here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - When you get up higher and
then you see the sex dolls. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - They creep me the fuck out, bro. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And they're fucking expensive too. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like, 10 grand, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, the good quality ones. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, what's the difference? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The thought of having
to clean out, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a fake person is so disgusting. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - What is the maintenance cost
on these fuckin' dolls, man? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, they must be more
expensive to fuckin' maintain </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> than just going out to a soapland. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - But that's what I'm thinking. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> These things are so expensive. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You're better off going
to, like, a soapland, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, 10, 20 times. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I guess there's the shame, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I get it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> It's a bit different, but I get it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I get it though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like financially it makes sense. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The shame? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The shame of having
to go to a prostitute </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> or something basically. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think I'd rather do that
than fuckin' buy a doll. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - The shame of having
someone look back at you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> As opposed to like
looking at lifeless eyes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> They can't judge. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - If other people want to
fuckin' do it, that's fine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't care. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't do that, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The shame would be too much for me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I had a mate who, like,
couldn't go to any strip clubs </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause he was just like, yeah, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> "Going to a strip club is
just like looking at porn </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "that can look back at you, man." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've never been to a strip club, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and they always just seem
weird, the idea of it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's sad because
everyone always tells me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> the food is, like, normally
the best part of it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I would not order food at a strip club. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Me and the boys go to a strip club </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> just to have, like, a
five-course delicate meal, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why not? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I would! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like your friend is like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Yo, I know this fuckin' great strip club. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Steaks are fuckin' bomb here." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Someone said, like, I
can't remember who it was, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> someone in America. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They're like, "Yeah, dude,
the wings were bomb." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, yeah, in my mind, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if any food would be good in a strip club </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for some reason it would be wings </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - At that point, does that
mean you've just gone to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> too many strip clubs where you go there, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and they're just like naked girls dancing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're like, "No, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Give me the wings. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> "I want the wings." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I would pay for a YouTube series </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where someone is, like,
very loudly in, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> a music blaring, he's like
reviewing a strip club </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the wings. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I would pay good money for that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - A review. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, a report of the
week in a strip club. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, reviewing the wings. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He's like, "Can you turn the
music down a little bit?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I fear for what I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't want to use any of these sex toys </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I don't want to start liking them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause I feel like I'm
just gonna just get more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and more extravagant with it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> until the maintenance
costs are through the roof. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm happy with where I'm at right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Just beating my meat and
just getting it done. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - With my own trusty hand. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It does the job. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't need more than that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's why I'm afraid of, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> trying something like VR porn. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Where it's just, like, this is going- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What if I like it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is going an extra mile here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, what if I like it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> What if I experienced
something new from this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't want, I'm in a happy relationship. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - You recently bought a VR headset, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I bought it to play fuckin' games! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I want to play Half-life Index, okay? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - There is no way there is
a part of you that is, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I gotta try this out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> There is no way there isn't a part of you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Of course there is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - So? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just don't like the idea
of cumming with a headset on. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There's something about
that that feels wrong. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, I'm wearing a big headset </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with these controllers and shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Are you kidding me? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can imagine just, like, you climax </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and, like, the post nut shame
must be on another level. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Take the headset off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like, "Oh, God!" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You've got the
controllers and you're like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh, this is where my
life has led me now." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You're just like, "(sighs) Beat Saber." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Again, like, I feel like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - You just did a video
on this, didn't you? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Where you went to illusion. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I went to illusion
and played the VR porn games </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that they made. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's fuckin' weird. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, I dunno. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I did like a "safe for work" one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was barely safe for work. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - If you were in the privacy of your home, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> could you nut to it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey sighs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - If I tried really hard, maybe. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What do you mean if you
could try really hard? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - If I was given like 30
minutes to myself, like maybe. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm sure I could
manage to cum to anything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> if I had 30 minutes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's what I'm saying. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's not the optimal thing I would use </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> because it's like, I dunno. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> There's a part, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was really fun to do because
it's just so ridiculous. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But there's just so much
about it that's just so jank </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where you're just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, okay, I'm supposed to
be lying down in this thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> "but I'm also standing up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "And if I look down, I just
look into the guy's neck." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just a bit weird. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's the thing about VR porn, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, you have to be
dedicated to this wank session. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> There are so many steps you are putting on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just to jack off, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - What if the sensors get, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> they stop working midwank? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What am I supposed to do? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Just finish? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I guess so, I guess so. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's not exactly a casual wank, is it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's a ranked competitive wank. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's a fuckin' side quest. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I guess the thought I had was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I've watched the least
amount of anime this year, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I feel like a lot of people- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You mean last year? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, sorry, fuck off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Last year. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Hey. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've watched the least
amount of anime last year. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And I feel like a lot of people
in the anime fandom have. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I feel like the
community now is evolving </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from just being like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's a difference between
now being an anime fan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and a weeb, and we
touched on this earlier. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> But I realized this when
hanging out with Connor, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how much of a normie Connor is
compared to both me and Joey. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, how's it feel- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - What re you saying? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - We're saying you're a normie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How does it feel for you hanging out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> with like people like us, I guess? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - What do you mean people like you? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - We're a different breed apparently. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Why do you think I'm
a normie, first of all? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, because- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You don't care about
anime as much as we do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I care about anime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You care about anime, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but you only go so deep into the culture </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where you don't really get waifu culture, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you don't really get a
lot of, like, VTubers. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No comment. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Is VTubing part of the culture? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think it is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, it grew out of
the anime culture, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, you know, you
gotta kind of have a like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> an appreciation, for anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in order to watch anime girls streaming. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, I guess. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - How deep do you say
your anime fandom goes? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's a weird question. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Could you frame me maybe scale </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> or something that you can judge me by? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> 10 being a fake fan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, one is like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, I watch "Attack on
Titan" and "My Hero Academia." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, just getting started level. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And 10 is like, I look at an anime, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and I know exactly who the
Genga artist for this is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Fuck that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What are you on that scale? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Where would you put
yourself actually then? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This might help me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like, a seven or an eight I would say. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I would put myself
as a seven or an eight. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It probably would have been like a five, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> but now it's probably like a four, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe even a three honestly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's probably gone down to
a three, you know, recently. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you feel like you've
become less of an anime fan, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like, more recently? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And have you like falling
out with the culture </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ever since you moved to Japan? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I guess, I guess because... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, it's not like
you don't watch anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, you still keep up
to like all the stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I love anime memes,
I love otaku culture, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I love like the community in general. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But I think just when
you get so deep into it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and the community, I just start to, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not enjoy the community
when it got into a point </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where it was getting really deep </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and everyone was like, "Name
your favorite key animator." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like, what, who cares? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I like the show and the story. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Why do I need to care about that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, we can argue that
Garnt and I are probably </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> at that point too, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but if someone came up to me and said, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Name your favorite key animator," </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I'd be like, "Fuck if I know." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think there was just a lot
of like, at least when I was, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know if it's still going on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, you guys can tell me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but when I was trying to
get really deep into it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I really wanted to
learn more about it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it got very, like, gatekeep-y at a point. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it definitely did. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's been like that
for a while to be honest. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - To where I just started to,
like, not really enjoy it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then I realized, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I think I just enjoy these shows way more </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> when I'm just casual. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, I just kinda
learned to appreciate it more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and kind of get deeper into it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> without really interacting
with the community around it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, I guess for a lot of people, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think me included, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> when I get into something the one thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I will always do is just, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> look at the community for it and be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all right, what's the norms? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What should I get into? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What's everyone saying
like the best thing? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Because that's a way of
like guiding your, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like a tailored experience of, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what everyone thinks are the
best way of enjoying something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause I feel like
you don't really follow </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> seasonal anime anymore. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You just kind of wait to see
what everyone's talking about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and what's worth watching. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, how do you decide
what anime to watch? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - But I think that's because, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the seasonal experience of viewing anime's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> kind of like died almost. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't think so. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't think people nearly
talk about seasonal anime </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> in a week by week way like they used to. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I disagree. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just think it's because
last year was, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so dry for seasonal anime </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that there was just nothing
for people to talk about. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was just a lot of
mid shows last year. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just feel like now,
especially with, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Netflix coming and releasing
the episodes in batches. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Everyone is like, it's not, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> "Did you watch the latest
episode of Beastars? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Did you watch Beastars?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - But, like, that's like one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> out of every fuckin' 100 anime
that comes out every year. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I feel like everyone asks that now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's not, "Did you watch
the newest episode?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's "Are you watching Attack on Titan?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I would say like,
people are still asking, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Are you watching the newest
episode of Attack on Titan?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - People just say "Are you
watching Attack on Titan?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Not, "Are you watching
the newest episode?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Literally every stream
I do, there's always, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like, "Have you watched this anime?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - "Attack on Titan" is different. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Attack on Titan" is like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, not "Attack on Titan." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, any seasonal anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, normally I never get
seasonal anime people asking me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, I get that all the time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No one gives a fuck
if I was watching, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Oriomon, what is that called? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What the fuck is it called? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> What's it called? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - "Oreimo." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Who the fuck gives a shit? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Were you trying to say
"Oreimo" and "Doraemon?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, who gives a shit? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's cursed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Generic feels good anime
that's an eight season, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like, are you watching that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> No one asks me fuck if
I'm watching that shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No one asks me if I watch "Deca-Dence." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know what I fuckin' mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, no one gives a shit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause there's so many
animes that are so mid now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and there's so many coming out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - God, I remember "Deca-Dence." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I tried watching that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's so many animes
that are coming out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that the only ones people,
I seem to have that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because it used to be, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> again when there's a
lot less anime as well, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that everyone could kind of ask </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are you watching these shows? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Are you watching it weekly? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And now there's just so fuckin' many. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And we have so many like good shows </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but like we only really, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I find in my experience at general, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Twitter only really asked </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if you're watching a show weekly now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or keeps up with the hype, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if it's a big event
like "Attack on Titan." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I feel it was missing last year was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that fuckin' big event. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause last year we had something
like the "Demon Slayer," </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that "Demon Slayer"
episode that really like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - But even then I never saw,
like, week by week plays </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> by "Demon Slayer." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Week by week plays. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - "Yo, Demon Slayer episode 17! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Boys, what we all sayin' on Twitter?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know, there wasn't like any of that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It was just episode 19 was amazing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It gave the birth of my children. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Jesus Christ is re reborn. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like that's what happened. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That was it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, there wasn't anything else </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> other than like, "Demon Slayer good." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That was it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Do you not think that's kind
of like, it shifted a little? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Am I seeing something you guys aren't? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think maybe it's just shifted </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just because you've kind
of shifted away from it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause I've also shifted away from it too. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I've definitely
noticed like the lack of- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I do feel like that's so many people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I know so many
people now who, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> they say they're anime fans- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It shifted to manga, 100%. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And all they do is read
manga, watch VTubers, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and play gacha games. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wow, I'm in this photo and I hate it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's literally me! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> That was me in 2020. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I never see people talk
about "episode three of this." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's always "chapter this of this manga." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause everyone knows that
they're released at this point. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then everyone keeps
up with it on Twitter. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But I never see it for anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> No one does anime episode reviews anymore </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> except for like big shows
like "Attack on Titan." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Everyone does manga chapter things still. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They're so popular. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I genuinely think it's shifted. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't think I'm the weird one here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I think you guys can't see the truth. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> What's happening? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I disagree with, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "no one does episode reviews anymore." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Not really. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause there's still like
a big group of YouTubers </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> who still do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh really? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You watch episode reviews? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Name every episode reviewer right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Chibi. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Chibi's probably the only person I know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Chibi's the only one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - YouTube will be taken down </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and Chibi will still be making reviews. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know who like, come
on, that doesn't count, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's the only one that
matters in my opinion. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I guess, I mean- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like that kind
of mirrors the culture now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I feel like definitely
being an anime YouTuber </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> last year was fuckin' hard. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Anime content last year was, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> from my perspective, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> anime content on YouTube
just didn't do as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause no one was watching any anime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But videos around anime culture, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like what you guys were doing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you guys fuckin' killed it
last year, in my opinion. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I feel like that's because, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people care less about
individual shows now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And people just more
care about the culture. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think the last time
I did a show or a video </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> on a show that was like seasonal </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and ongoing was fuckin'
"Promised Neverland." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And that was what, two years? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Three years ago almost. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think mine's like "Banana Fish." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's fuckin' amazing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was like two or
three years ago, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's like, since then, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just like every season comes around </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and I do a what will I be watching? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then I look at the
list and I was like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - The biggest lie of the century. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Joey needs to change the title to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> "I Lied to You For 20 Minutes Straight." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - "What I'm Looking At." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I love how the comments
have finally called you out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> on it though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They're like, "Don't fucking lie to us." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> No, that series now is just
a fuckin' quick easy way </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> of being like, "Oh, let's see
what Joey thinks about this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "We know he's not gonna watch it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> "but at least we'll know
what he feels about it." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - For me, seasonal anime has just become </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> this glorified manga
recommendation system. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Connor laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Where if I find a series
like this, it's so rare- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is what, like,
shopping is to Amazon. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I go to the store to go
and buy it on Amazon. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause most of the
time you find an anime </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's like, we talked
about this before, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where it's not an
adaptation that's amazing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's a passible adaptation
where I'm just, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't get anything more than this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> from, like, watching the anime
versus reading the manga. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So you just end up reading the manga. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Jujutsu Kaisen" is like
one of the few, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Jujutsu Kaisen," "Jojo," </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and like some of like
the big shonen ones are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one of the few exceptions
where they actually have budget </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and money behind this to make this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a fuckin' amazing production. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But for the most part
you have a production </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that's just mediocre. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They're just there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They're just there, and it's just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'd rather just read
the manga and get ahead </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and speed run this stuff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, honestly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, that's how I've
kind of found myself too. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And also like, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at least very unique
opportunity for me is that like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I can read 90% of the shit
that hasn't come out yet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> So it's like, why not just
get ahead on that shit? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you feel like you'd read more manga </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you could actually read it physically? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Or do you not care? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Probably would. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Although I would annoy me
having fuck tons of manga </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> at my house 'cause I've read it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm not really gonna read it again. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Call Joey out like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm in this photo and I hate it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - How often do you pick up
a manga and just read it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Every day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's a fuckin' lie. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was ready for that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm not joking. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I have to because I have so
many that I've yet to read. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - But, you never reread the
ones you've read, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Sometimes I do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because I like it otherwise
I wouldn't fuckin' buy it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If there's a new manga I pick up- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Maybe if I could speak
Japanese, it'd be a different. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - If there's a new manga I pick up, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I pick up new manga
all the fuckin' time, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> because it's like, "Oh, I
don't know anything about this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "This just came out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Might be good." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I buy it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I don't like it, I resell that shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Rewatching media to me
feels like playing, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> casual games on, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> when there's a ranked playlist. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, why would I waste
my time on this casual game? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, but you never casual game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I casual game all the time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - To me when, you know- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm just built different. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Back in the day when you'd meet a girl, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you'd be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh cool, yeah, what movie
do you want to watch?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Just like, "Let's watch White
Girls, my favorite movie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> "I've watched it like 15 times." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, 15 times? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Why? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Why would you watch "Frozen" 16 times? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Did you get something the
16th the time that you, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know why? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, I've seen "Pulp
Fiction" about 30 times </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, movies like that
where you miss a shit tons, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I get it to go back. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But you ain't missing any like deep themes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> from "Frozen" or "White
Chicks," you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, come on. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like part of the
allure of rewatching films </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> or media with people you
haven't watched it before- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, with people who haven't watched. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I understand that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because I feel like the only time I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> actually rewatch something now is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when I'm with someone who
hasn't watched this show. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You're just like waiting
for their reaction. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Just like, "Oh, oh, oh. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "The big part's coming up." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And they're on their phone,
and it's like a heartbreak. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like fuckin' heartbreaking to you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> You want to politely say, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Pay the fuck attention, you scrub!" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But like, you don't want to
sound like an asshole, you know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - That is my fuckin' pet peeve, dude. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And the worst is like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember one time I was showing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I forgot what movie it was to Aki, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and, you know, she was like really quiet </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for like the first hour. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, "Oh, she must be
really paying attention." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I look over she's fuckin' asleep. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just like, this is so sad, Alexa. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Doesn't she make you,
like, watch Disney movies </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> all the time? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, to be fair though, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I wouldn't watch half the movies </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that she shows me unless it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but at least the good thing
is 80 to 90% of the movies </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> she actually does show me,
they're actually pretty good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think if you asked me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> would I rather be
interrogated in Guantanamo Bay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or have a girlfriend who's obsessed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> with Disney or Kingdom Hearts? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think I'd take Guantanamo Bay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think I'd have more
chance of staying sane. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I cannot stand girls </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who always just want
to watch Disney movies. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> It drives me insane. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> That's like 90% girls. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm sorry for you, Joey. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's my nightmare as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, I thought I was
gonna hate it but then again, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've seen so few Disney
movies, understandably. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm so glad that girls
are moving away from that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and getting into true crime now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I can get behind girls
wanting to watch true crime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, no.
- My fucking god! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - If anything I would
rather watch Disney movies </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> than true crime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I love true crime! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, I would have to
go with the true crime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - But you don't understand Aki. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Every morning I wake up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> to some kind of police
interrogation tape audio. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Same here! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Joey wakes up and is like,
"Is it a rapist today, honey?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Every time he's just
like, "So why did you do it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "So why did you do it?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't want to wake up to this! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's that criminal
psychology channel, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> That I swear every girl is watching now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Jim Can't Swim Psychology. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> But there's so many of them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> There's so many channels like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm just like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause I watched the
Jim Can't Swim Psychology </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and then the recommended was just, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like the new reaction YouTubers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They're all reacting to interrogations. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, what is happening? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Why are we reacting to interrogation? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like, I get it because you watch it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and you almost feel physically suffocated. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because I remember watching
some of these videos </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you feel like a kid again, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where you, you'd like stole a cookie </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and your mom's like,
"Did you steal a cookie?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And you're just like, "Oh, what do I say? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "What do I say?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's like that simulator </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> without being back in that- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - They have the thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> They'll pause the interrogation </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and be like, "This is the backward Suplex </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> "mental gymnastic move." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I love it when my mother
used to do that one to me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Or like, "This is the alter
ego sufficing technique." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm like, loved it
when my dad did that to me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> That's a classic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I love that one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it's like being
back in school, you know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Getting told off for detention. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause the detectives would be like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> "We have proof." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And they wouldn't say the proof. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, this is like
the big mind game at school. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, "We know you did it." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, "Bullshit you do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> "You got no proof. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> "No proof!" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then they would go,
"We don't need to show it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Just know that we have it." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - They're just shitting their pants. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And just seeing like
good cop bad cop in action </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and seeing it actually work. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's just, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can see how you can
fall down that rabbit hole </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and become addictive. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I do like it, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's interesting, don't get me wrong. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But every day? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, honestly, I could
probably watch it everyday. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Every fucking morning? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I couldn't do it every day. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's not something I want to watch </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> first thing in the morning. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I would rather watch
a mediocre documentary </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> over a good movie. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - You have programmed your brain wrong. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You literally have
programmed your brain wrong. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - That just doesn't make sense. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just like real life
stuff way more than like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know why. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I've somehow gotten into it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where I just really enjoy
like stories of real people. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - But like here's the thing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I've thought about this recently </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where I feel like a lot of
people now are more, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> will be more willing to watch something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that they don't have to
pay 100% attention to. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So if you have like a
really high quality movie </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> or something that you need
to like pay attention to, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're less likely to watch that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then say fuckin' Trash Tastes, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just three people chatting
shit for two hours </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or like a real life documentary </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where not every detail is important. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> You just get like the
basic story around it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's fine. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know why I'm like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just enjoy it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm sure there's people
out there who are the same. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, 'cause on Netflix I
think all I watch is, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> documentaries. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Every time I meet you you
watch a new documentary. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I have no idea where you
find the time to do that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I play a lot of them in the background. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - But does that count as watching it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, like I said, some of them are mid, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so it's like just put it on the background </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and let it do its thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's the one thing I've
never understood is, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people who say like, "Yeah,
I've watched like 500 movies." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, "Oh, how did you watch it?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh, I just let it play in the background </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "while I was like cleaning." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Does that count as watching the movie? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm, like, I'm typing out
while it's in my peripheral </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I'm listening to it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I dunno. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't really count that as watching it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - What? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Fuck off. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> That's watching </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can't concentrate on it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's watching, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> but you couldn't do that to
something like "Pulp Fiction." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, God, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's why I would never
treat it like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Same with anime. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I feel like doing that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've realized that because
I've been doing that more often </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with YouTube videos as well, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I've found it harder and
harder just to fuckin' sit down </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and watch something. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, do you find that like watching, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> unless it's like a super engaging show, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like watching any standard show now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just 10 times harder </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause you kind of just want to skip to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where the important plot points are. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Sometimes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, I've been watching
some pretty good shows recently </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I haven't really had trouble with, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but yeah sometimes I have that problem. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm glad I've never
subjected myself to that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause otherwise I'd probably
be feeling the same pain. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I don't put something on
unless I have the full intent </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of putting 100% of my
concentration into it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, I don't see the point
of like working on something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> while something else is
playing in the background. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause then I'm just gonna get distracted </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> by whatever's playing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So either way I can't
concentrate on watching the thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and doing whatever the fuck else. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I can't focus without some noise. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I just put music on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, music or put something on. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> It's whatever. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, but like I can't have anything </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's like visual on. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What's the last thing you put on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that you properly concentrated on? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Was it "The Boys?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I watched "The Boys." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - "The Boys" was a good TV show. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - That was really fuckin'
good, really good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That was really fuckin' good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've heard good things about that, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was like, I didn't reach
out my phone or anything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was just watching it the whole time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Season one was really fuckin' good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's the kind of experience I want </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> whenever I watch something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I've been noticing
I've been getting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so distracted recently when watching stuff </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that I just I enjoy it less, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I miss the enjoyment I
had when I guess I was a kid. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Are you one of those people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who, like, can't be watching something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> unless they have, like,
their phone in their hand? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I didn't used to be like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I've slowly become that
person, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And doing that on anime is hard mode, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because you gotta read the subtitles. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because I gotta read the subtitles! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> My fuckin' god, it's like
trying to watch "Monogatari" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when you're eating something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, it's so fuckin' difficult. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like, "Wait, I missed
the one second of dialogue </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> "that was important </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> "because of the crunching
sounds in my ears!" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I don't really do it with anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause anime, again, you have to focus. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Can't get distracted, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is why I think I find I don't watch </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> as much anime as I used to
is 'cause it is kinda like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's why watching anime
on Netflix is so much easier </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> because you watch the
dub and it becomes, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> same type enjoyment now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Hell yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But watching subbed anime, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> watching seasonal anime has
just become that much harder </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because of that exact reason. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Going back to the debate
about, am I a real anime fan? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But like, 'cause you mentioned something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you said like VTubers, whatever, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> anime, manga, gacha games. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Why do you feel like gacha games is, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a big part of being an anime fan? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because gachas originally
fuckin' from anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> The Japanese kind of invented it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, but it doesn't mean, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's not that deep in anime culture. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, it kind of is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You can be an anime fan without
ever playing a gacha game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> But you can't play, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> but you very rarely play a gacha game </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> without being an anime fan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean there's plenty of original, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> gacha games out there that
aren't anime based at all. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, but how many
people play those compared </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to the anime based gacha games? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, I mean, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is Genshin Impact an anime game? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - How is Genshin Impact not an anime game? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, I would consider anime being </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like the actual like manga anime shows. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm more talking about
like the anime art style. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The Arknights. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> They weren't based off anything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Same with VTubers, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, I would say who's watching VTubers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> who's never watched anime before? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - A confused dad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> That's who's watching it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I like the gacha games. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, I really enjoyed
Arknights when I was playing that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't really play it anymore. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> But like, and Genshin was fine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I didn't like how I couldn't skip </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> any of the fuckin' dialogue. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think they added that now though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - They've added that now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I literally rage quit one of my streams </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause there was so much
dialogue and it wouldn't stop. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, and you would walk 10
seconds to get another dialogue </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for two minutes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is taking the piss. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> This is ridiculous. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No one can enjoy this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I want to see
you play Yokis again. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You'd probably lose your fuckin' mind. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'd be like, "What is happening? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> "What is going on?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And like, (sighs) I don't get it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> how people can get excited for
every new fuckin' gacha game. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think that's a question
you have to ask Tectone. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - We've also been brainwashed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> into being excited for rates
that are higher than 2%. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> We're like, "Boys, boys,
it's practically 50/50. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> "It's practically-" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Once it's above 2%, it's
basically a guaranteed draw. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I feel called out now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - They've all memed it so much </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that they're actually like
proud of it when it's like 2%. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> They're like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> "They're practically giving
the five stars away." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, do you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's practically a guaranteed draw. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - A lot of the stuff, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just hate how games have just
completely normalized, like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Microtransactions? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - To death, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, I enjoyed Arknights. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was fun, but like, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'd spent like 800 bucks on that game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and there was still some
missions I couldn't do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm like, "How much do I need to spend </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "to be able to like do
the hardest missions? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> "Tell me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "How much? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> "It's ridiculous." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just turn your brain off
and just enjoy the game, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you'll just enjoy the experience. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - You can't because
then it fuckin' is like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Beep beep, you got no
fuckin' resources left. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "You want to pay? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> "You want to pay a little
money to keep playing, do you?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, I hate that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I would say the only
real gacha game I'm playing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right now is Genshin. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And my biggest problem with
Genshin has nothing to do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with like the gacha system </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even though the pull rates suck ass. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I mean, like if the
drop rates are fuckin' ass, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> then I don't go into
it with a mentality of, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "I'm going to get this character," </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or "I'm going to get this person." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> When you come in with
expectations, that's when you lose. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like walking into
a casino being like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "I'm gonna win the jackpot." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - My actually biggest problem
with Genshin right now is that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when you reach the end game, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it really feels like
you reached the end game </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because you are, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're squeezing out content
that's just not there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, we went over that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's become so apparent with Genshin </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as opposed to other gacha games </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause I'm sure we've
played enough gacha games </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> that you reach that point where you- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You open into the
dailies and you're like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "I got nothin' to fuckin' do." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is just a part-time job. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm fucking grinding away. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I gotta clock in on my daily. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm just watching numbers go up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But it's less noticeable
when it's a phone game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But when it's on Genshin </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I dunno how fuckin'
people play Genshin </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on the phone, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Disgusting. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How you do storm terror
or the fuckin' wolf boss </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on your phone, that's fuckin' beyond me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But, like, it feels so weird </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when I got to the end game in Genshin, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I would log on for like
an hour a day on the PC. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I would just, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I would just grind and I
will do nothing but grind. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I'd gone through all the, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the actual content of the game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it really feels, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's really apparent on Genshin </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because it feels like
the first real gacha game </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that should be played on console, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it feels more like an RPG. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Whereas if it's a mobile game, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, you can do it whenever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You can do it in your free time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, because I mean, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I definitely felt like when
I was grinding Arknights, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I was over leveled
for a lot of things, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> even though I still
couldn't beat some stages, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like, 'cause you would do it daily </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause you've been conditioned to, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> get your daily rewards, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Get them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> To the point where anytime
any new content ever came out, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I fuckin' steamrolled
it, like, immediately. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, well that was
like two hours of fun. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I waited three months
for that content update. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I do feel like a bit like Pavlov's dog. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Where it's just like, "Ooh, good, good." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - New content, new content! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - And it's just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you can't shit on these games </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and like, say, "Oh man,
yeah, it's super grindy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "You know, the microtransactions
are a little bit much." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Whatever. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then people are always
so quick to like defend them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm like, just admit that it's shit, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and what they're doing is
like, you get a free game </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and then you have to
put up with this shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And they're like, "Well,
I'm free to play." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't give a shit if
you're free to play. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Other people are out there
spending a thousand dollars. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Why is it okay if it's just
you're fuckin' free to play? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's always the excuse
you see this shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It drives me insane. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like as long as I'm not paying money. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - People are like, "What do you mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "I'm free to play. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "I've never had any difficulties." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, well good on you
that you have willpower. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I'm one of
those people honestly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - What, free to play? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, not free to play,
but I'll defend the fact </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> that you can play these
games being free to play </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because all you need is willpower. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And you know- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Shut the fuck up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - All you need is the power of friendship. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's all you need. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, if I wanted to,
I could be free to play. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just don't want to. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel bad for the people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who physically like can't
control their gambling. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I mean- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - They shouldn't be playing it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - But they should not be
playing games like this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I feel like these
games should really come </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with a warning. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Tell that to Tectone. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - But yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> There should be, like, heavy
warnings on games I think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to like say, "Hey listen,
you can spend a grand </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> "and come out with PNGs." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What was that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What're you looking at Garnt? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (fly buzzes) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay, sorry. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> There should be like a
heavy warning saying, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Listen, you can spend a
grand for like an animation </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "and PNG that gets you a
little bit of serotonin." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Like that's. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, no money involved. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, gambling totally fair. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just, it angers me so much. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> How, like, I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - You just don't see
the value in those PNGs. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's just the new generation, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What would you want to pay for it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Do you want to pay for more money? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Nah, I'll pay for a
little bit of serotonin. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - People don't often, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you never hear people, like,
defending gambling odds. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They're just like, "Yeah, dude. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> "It's what it is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Gambling is what it is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "You go in there and it's fucked. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "And yeah, if you want to
go and waste your money." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - House always win. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But in gachas everyone's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh no, actually." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Like it's, everyone's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I guess 'cause the option
there is free to play. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's no free to play gambling option. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well actually, some
casinos give you free drinks </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> if you just turn up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Let's go. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I guess that's the
equivalent of free to play. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "I'll have an orange juice please. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "No gambling." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's the equivalent of
like free ten pull today. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, and they are generous. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But I guess, if you don't
have a gambling addiction, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you can't understand </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how it feels to have a gambling addiction. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I get it why some people
might just want to play a game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Don't know that it has
like gambling in it maybe, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> essentially. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then they get, like,
kind of tricked into it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause they've been weaned on the game. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's just modern apps in my opinion. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It sucks though! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because we've just found a way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to literally hack our brains. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like human beings,
like, we'd like to think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that we're not predictable, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But like, five, 10 years ago, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can you imagine like, just
having most of your life, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> most of my life now is
scrolling down on something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Most of my life when I'm
not talking to you guys, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm scrolling down on some
kind of fucking timeline. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> It's never ending. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I get it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We'll get into some
philosophical stuff here, Garnt. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> But back to the point of gacha, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The other thing that we've done is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that we've done the best
thing that we could ever want </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for these companies. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We've memed spending money. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Nobody wants to feel bad for wasting $200 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and not getting what they want. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So what do you do? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You go to Twitter, you tweet
out how you didn't get anything </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you may pick like the pain
Peko or whatever it's called. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - The pain Peko. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is that what it's called? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm such a fucking boomer! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - You sound like a dad. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's like a dad
trying to describe a meme. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - "Hey son, pain Peko." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - "What is that pain Peko? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh, that is a pog
champ right there, son." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I am not a boomer! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Garnt, stop meming about me
being a boomer for one second. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Listen, we have all
like tricked each other </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> into making gambling,
like, a community event </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and like enjoying it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> because no one wants to lose alone! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because we share the pain, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - We share the pain Peko. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We've done exactly what
these companies wanted us to do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> which is make, like, the gambling
into a form of acceptance. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You haven't joined the gacha community </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> unless you've fuckin' gambled 1,000 bucks </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and haven't got the one with thick thighs </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> that you forget about three months later. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Fuck! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, are you telling
me that part of, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the gambling experience, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like you go into a casino, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember the last time I
went to a casino with you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Great time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Great time because you got to, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you fuckin' egged on Eugene
to, like, lose his money! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You thought it was fuckin' hilarious! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That was funny. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Eugene's our friend. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So you basically did the exact same. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What happened was, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at the time he didn't have a job, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and we were telling him, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> "You probably shouldn't
be spending your money." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, you know, I kept playing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't lose much like 100 bucks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was spending that much. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he wanted to keep up with me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and I was like, "If you
want to, you can go ahead. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "But you don't have to do it." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That sounds very suggestive to me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> It's the reverse psychology. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, "I'm going to do a 10 pull. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "I mean, you don't have to do a 10 pull. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> "I mean, it's a raid up today." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm not streaming me going to a casino </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and being like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Hey guys, let's fuckin'
gamble on blackjack. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> "Pog, man, go blackjack." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's the equivalent though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, it is the equivalent of that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, like I said,
gacha is a waifu casino. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Can you stream gambling? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Poker, I know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, there's poker, there's blackjack. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Can you? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There's pretty heavy rules
around it though, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, probably. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - But there's not heavy
rules around gacha. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Why not? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Should there be? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know maybe. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - There honestly should be. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think there should be some regulations. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like the biggest
thing about gacha is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that people should know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what they're getting themselves into. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - People should know a lot of things. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> That's why people should
also have the option </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to tell casinos, "Hey, can you ban me? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Because I have no self-control." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There's no way to do that with gacha. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is that an option with casinos? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, in every country you can do that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - So what you're saying is we
need to come up with, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the gacha police. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Gacha police! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Ring, ring, you've spending
too much money on gacha. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I am dead serious. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There should be something
on the play store </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or something that you can be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Listen, I gamble too much. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> "Can you please not allow me to spend more </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "than like 100 bucks like
a year or something?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, set a hard limit that
there's no way to turn off. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I agree with you on that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because if you go to the casinos, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you fill out the form says, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Please ban me from this casino." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They will never let you in ever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause they have like a database </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and a lot of the time, if you, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think sometimes some
courts require you to do it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for certain occasions, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but it's very popular and common </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that people who gamble too much </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they what they want to
get that life on track. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know, because it's,
it's easy to have a lapse </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in like willpower and
you go to the casino. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So if 95% of the time, you're like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "I'm never gambling." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Basically just chastity belt themselves. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Basically. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You can say like, "This
is not good for me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "I'm gonna fill out a form." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I didn't know you could do that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> In the UK 100% </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because gambling is a
huge problem in the UK </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> for like betting shops and
stuff, so they'll do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And you can basically,
if it's a chain as well, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> they'll ban you from every chain. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - But like, I do think
you're talking about, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a vast minority 'cause
like most of the people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who I've met who are playing gacha games, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they're not like us. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> But for us, it's kind of
like, like for me at least, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know, it kind of
revolves around my job. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You stream, you do it, it gets views. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But like for most people
that I know that play gacha, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> they haven't spent like an
inordinate amount of money on it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - But like, I don't think
there should be an ability </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to ruin your fuckin' life
for pulling anime girls. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, we know Tectone, who's
a popular gacha game streamer. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And at one point he used
to play, what was it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Computer] Summoner's War. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He nearly- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He went homeless. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He legit went like financially, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I think he might've filed
for bankruptcy or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He went fully broke from gacha games. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That should never be a thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> That should never be able to happen. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I remember him telling me that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like it was like a fuckin' war story. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - That should never be a thing
for casinos either, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, but I mean- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I agree there should be
more regulations about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - There needs to be a gacha police. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> That's all we need! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Again with casino, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it is extremely heavily
regulated and you can win money. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So it makes sense that
you can't have the risk </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of winning money without losing money. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But with gacha games (laughs) come on. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - For some people though that
PNG is worth more than money. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It is to me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It blew my mind. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm fucking serious! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What's wrong with you? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What happened in your childhood, Garnt? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause like I've never cared about- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Anything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Until those PNGs came along. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've never cared about winning money </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause like, you know,
to me money has value. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like obviously like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - You can't put a price on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You can't put a price on waifus. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> That serotonin here when you
win like a fuckin' character </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that you're actually
emotionally attached to. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause people who win money in casinos, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're not emotionally
attached to this money. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I doubt that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I doubt that very much. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, I've had friends who
have actually had actual, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, proper gambling
problems as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I remember this, I knew
a friend in a university </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who one day won like
10,000 pounds in a casino. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Could have paid off his student loans, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> could have been like completely debt free. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And within three weeks he had
spent the 10K, 10,000 pounds. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - On gambling? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - On gambling. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Mostly on gambling. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I asked him, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Dude, you could've fuckin'
invested this money. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "You could have used it like more wisely. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "You could have used
it to better your life. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Why did you spend it on gambling? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> "Or why did you spend it so easily?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And he said, "Because I
didn't care about it." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because he didn't earn it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause he had no emotional
attachment to the money </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause he was just given it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So to him it just felt like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It is the equivalent of
just someone coming up to you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and being like, "Here's 10K." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - A lot of these, you know,
the serotonin hit you get </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> from these waifus, three months
later you don't give a fuck. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So, that's on you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> That's your prerogative, dude. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do you give a shit
about some of the games </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you pulled for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and got that lovely serotonin
hit like months after? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, but I have a nice
memory, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - He goes to his fuckin', like, wall, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like, "Ah, yes, I remember
the time I pulled-" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I had a good experience playing, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all the gacha games I've played. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Otherwise I wouldn't have
played them in the first place. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like, you know, small, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> basically the same as like going </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> to a fuckin' arcade or something </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and, like, putting money into that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's different. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, it's different. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like, yeah, you're only, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> maybe 100 yen, at a time,
but it's still the same. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like why- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's the problem is that
you could do 100 yen at a time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and if I wanted to spend 500 bucks, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> which I tried to do, it
takes like five hours. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's a long time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If you want to spend 10 grand on gacha, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> give yourself 20 minutes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - 10 grand in 20 minutes? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - You probably could. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If you were just buying the
highest option multiple times. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Speed running
bankruptcy, let's go, baby! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like, you could I'm sure, you know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, you see the streamers
who spent like 10 grand </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but they're making the money back. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Think about all the
people who are doing that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> who aren't making the money back. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And yeah, some people are probably </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in the financial position
to be able to do that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But why even give yourself
the chance of like making </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that happen to other
people who aren't, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, and again, you
hear the horror stories </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> of kids spending their mother's
money and shit like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, why is this even able to happen? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> There should always be
a hard limit built in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that shouldn't be able to like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think that's on the person though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Let me ask you this, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what regulations would
you want to see then? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> How do you fix this problem
that you've presented? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think when you download the game, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and there is gacha in it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there should be an immediate question </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of what is the maximum
you're willing to spend </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in like one year? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And you physically no matter what you do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cannot go over that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like it will not let you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - But what if you said zero
and then you change your mind? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, that's on you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You've already said zero. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Isn't that the same as just putting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in the credit card numbers
by yourself anyway? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - You've decided zero, you
then can't hurt yourself more, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you're stuck with the thing
because you agreed to zero. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think that should be a thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, because like on the other side then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that means spending money in
essence is also on you, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, that shifts responsibility </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> from just one place to another. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is the problem. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, the problem that
people have with I think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> when they're talking about,
like, gambling addicts is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that we don't think of it 'cause
we're not gambling addicts. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We can't think of it as, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> "Why don't you just not spend money, bro?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> That's not how it works. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This is the problem is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I think people alienate these people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and don't even remotely think how it is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to be in their position. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I totally understand. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But at the same time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's what I'm trying to say is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> obviously there are people that
are proper gambling addicts </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that have a problem that
they, you know, physically, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, like cannot control, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have a harder time to control. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But how would you introduce
a system where, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how do you introduce a system
that can regulate that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you know, as opposed to, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> other people who have, you
know, no problem, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> having willpower and being able </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to control their spending
and financial decisions. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I do think that there
should be a hard limit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on monthly amount of money
you can spend on any game. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I legitimately believe that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I believe that as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I do not think that, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> anyone should have any excuse
to spend over like $10,000 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on a video game a month. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like that should be just, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that should be like a hard limit baked </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> into the game or app store. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Something like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Because, realistically, no one
needs to spend over a grand. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And if they do, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if everyone's playing by the same thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of no one can spend over a grand, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the devs won't make games
that are able to get benefit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of spending over a grand,
you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, I don't understand </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> why there hasn't been some
kind of like hard limit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on video game spending. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because why would the devs
cuck themselves like that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's in the government's best interest. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, no, that's probably
the best solution I can, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> agree on because I do feel like
there should be a hard limit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on how much you can spend on mobile games. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think there should be
something again with like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how you can say, I want
to quit like casinos </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because, you know, gambling addicts </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> probably aren't gambling addicts 24/7. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's probably like a
lapse of like willpower </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where they're like,
"Fuck, I need to gamble. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I'm depressed," or some shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't fuckin' know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know how it works. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But there should be
something in the system </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's like, okay, I want to gamble. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then you can say that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or at one point when you
download the game say, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't want to gamble. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> You can only change this in say seven days </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of like, are you sure? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So you say yes, I want to gamble. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> All right, come back in seven days. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If you're sure you want to
gamble, we'll let you gamble. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Why not something like that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Developers. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because most of the money I bet is spent </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is everyone's moment of weakness </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> where they're like, "Fuck
it, I'll spend 100 bucks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Let's see what I get, come on." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> How often would you spend
100 dollars on the gacha </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> if I had to ask you Joey,
come back in seven days, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> tell me you still want
to spend that 100 bucks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I just wouldn't
bother with playing the game </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> at that point. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - You'd play it free to play. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, or not play it at all. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I say more than anything, I'd
probably not play it at all. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - What, if you can't
spend money in the game? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, if I'm persistently being
asked, like, are you sure? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Are you sure you want to do it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just like, I'm not
even gonna bother with it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was that intrusive? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "What do you mean you won't
let me spend my money? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "I'm furious!" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like, leave me alone. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll spend it if I want to spend it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like the opposite now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where they're like,
"Spend money, spend money. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Get this pack, a deal!" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, and I'm in a
position where I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "I'll get the pack if I
feel like getting the pack." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But I'm not going to if
I don't feel like it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But it's the same thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What do you mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> You can just say no to the money thing! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - You literally just said the same thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You're just being an asshole now! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I literally just gave you
the opposite situation </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> where I was like, "Spend
money, spend money." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And you're like, "I'm fine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I don't want that." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - So what's the difference of saying no? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel like you're just
playing devil's advocate </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just to piss me off. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I love pissing you off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's my favorite hobby </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, I mean, I can agree. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's my serotonin. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just think that there's
been way too many cases, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> obviously, of people going fuckin' broke. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - How many cases do you know of? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, how many do you know of? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - You hear it all the fuckin' time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - From who? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I bet if you asked how
many people had, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> spent a significant
amount of their savings </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or like spent too much money, oh, sorry. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Spent an amount of money
that they regretted. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I bet it would be like 50% minimum. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - No. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - We can do it right now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We can fuckin' do it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's fine. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Let us know on Twitter, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> have you ever spent an amount
of money on a gacha game </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or video game that you ended
up severely regretting? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - And be honest. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Be totally honest. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is a proper scientific
conduct we're doing right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> We actually want to know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like, no meme, I'm
actually genuinely curious. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I love gaming. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I am a gamer, gamers rise up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Rise and grind. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I am a casual gamer. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just like enjoying my
time playing a video game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And if I, you know, if
I wanted to, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> enjoy my time pulling for some waifus, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then I know that that's on me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I know that that's
what I'm paying for. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I also, me as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I understand that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I have self control. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't regret any money
that I've ever put into gacha. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> From the beginning. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Would you ever say that
you've fallen for something </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that is perhaps like, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> not predatory but close to it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Maybe like they keep offering you stuff, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know, there's deals constantly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Look, I'm not going to lie </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and say that gacha isn't just
fuckin' gambling with waifus </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause it fuckin' is, okay? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But like, I've never seen
the appeal of casinos </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because of the reason that I said where, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know, to me casinos are scary. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause you pay for the
chance to win more money. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And that's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's to me that's like a risk, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause that's literally just gambling. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But to me like gacha is I'm
paying for an experience. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm paying because I
actually want this thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I'm putting money into. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I actually want it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's different where people
are gonna meme this and say, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Garnt doesn't care about getting money." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's not what I'm saying. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm saying if I'm going to get money, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there are plenty of other ways </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I would want to get money. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Gambling is the last resort. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Gambling's the last way I
would use to actually get money. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I wanna work for that shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - But there's only one way to get waifus. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I rarely give a shit
about what memes do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm not like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But I guess because we're in the position </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where we all have our own job. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> We're all old, old people
compared to the zoomers out there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And apparently you're the youngest one, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but you're the boomer of the group. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like a boomer, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> When I go on Twitter sometimes
I feel like a boomer. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - You are the boomer. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So, it's all hella normalized, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Spending, you know, 100
bucks on a few pulls. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Me and the boys gonna pull a few waifus. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then, you know, we're
joking about it on Twitter, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, we're going to be stream it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it's not like, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> someone goes to a casino and is like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh, we do a cheeky like
10 pull on roulette." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then like everyone's meming it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> "Hey, the classic, you know, bet on red." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> We're meming the shit
to like 16, 15 year olds </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> who are then wanting to do it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It feels weird. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay well, what I would say is, okay, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like part of the reason
I've been spending more </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> on, like, gacha now is
because 2020 has been boring </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> as fuck or 2020 was boring as fuck. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I think to myself, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what would I have spent
that money on anyway? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Probably going out and getting pissed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, how much do you
spend on a night out? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It depends, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - How big the sesh is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Let's say a standard sesh in
London with the boys, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> You can spend upwards of like
100, 200 pounds on drinks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Fuck, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What are you getting up to in London? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Popping champagnes in London. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - When one single cocktail
in London is like a tenner, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like you start off at like
a Wetherspoons or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, that's the cheap drinks, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but as you get further and
further on in the night, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people easily spend 100 to
200 pounds on one night. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Do you get more out of that 10 minutes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of pulling that gacha than a
whole night with your boys? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I would say that- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Connor laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> No, no, no, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What are you, a
politician right now, Garnt? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> What is this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Come on, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Answer the question. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm just saying like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm being attacked right now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I am attacking you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I need to fuckin' defend myself. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I need to fuckin' defend this shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Mister speaker, if I may interject. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But you know, you say
we've normalized the stuff, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but like, you are fine, for example, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> spending that much on a night out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because that's what you choose. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, that's what you
choose as the experience, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and that's what you choose
is okay for the price. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - So basically what you're
saying is a night out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with the boys is the equivalent </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to getting your favorite waifu. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - There's tangible stuff you're buying. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You're buying drinks there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That is stuff that has to be made. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You're going, you're transporting. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This is all stuff that, you
know, has a cost for a reason. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The gacha it's conflated </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because they know they
can get away with it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They know they can charge
this much for a pull. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, it's the equivalent of, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> going out to a bar and
buying a tenner drink </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and going home and pouring
yourself that same drink, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, it's different. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, it's the same. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because like getting your
favorite waifu on a free pull </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> is the pouring your drink at home. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, it's not. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yes, it is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - What's the going out then? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What's that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - The fuckin' ten pull you pay for. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> No! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's exactly what it is! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my God, this is such low brain IQ. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> No dude, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> When you go to, like, let's
say you go to a bar in London. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> You pay, I don't know, fuckin'
nine pounds for a cocktail. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You're not paying for the ingredients. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You're paying for someone one, to make it- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You're paying for the experience. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - You're paying for the experience, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're paying for like,
you know, the glass, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the expertly prepared. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The glass. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do you have nice
cocktail glasses at home? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I ain't gonna buy them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They're like fuckin' 30 quid. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They have really nice ones, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Everything you get is tailored experience. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's where the price goes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Is it a bit of a rip off? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, kinda. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But it's not, like, to the point </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where I feel like I'm
being taken advantage of. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> With gacha games I kind of do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - But that's just on you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I feel like they, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I genuinely believe
that, like, gacha games </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> to some extent are like just getting away </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> with as much as they can
to take advantage of you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Of course it is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm not gonna say that
they're not getting away with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> as much as they can. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I totally believe that
there should be regulations </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> around this stuff. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> That's not the argument here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - The fact that it took, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> multiple governments to get involved </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> just to make them show you
the odds is ridiculous. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, how long were
people getting fucked over </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause they didn't know
the percentage was 0.001? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - A long time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - A lot of people. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> But they probably also didn't care. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, but how is it ever acceptable? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, that that was okay? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like casino, you know, the odds. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, even casinos aren't that scummy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They'll let you know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, this is just blows my mind </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and how people constantly defend them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I would be more okay with
if everyone just admitted </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just one big scam. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And we're all just in for it- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, it's not a scam though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> It's not a scam! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like one step away from a scam. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - What's that one step? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - What is a scam for you then? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> What is a scam for you? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because to me a scam is like it means </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you are getting, what's
the word I'm looking for? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, the user's in the dark. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We know exactly what we're
getting ourselves into. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And that's why, to me, it is not a scam. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - A scam is like saying like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh, on this banner, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "the ten pull is a guaranteed six star," </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> when it's not a guarantee. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's come in to stop any
more government regulation. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause if they were trying
to get away with that for- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, that is a scam. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> If they're actively lying to the user base </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then that to me is a scam. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Which I'm sure many of
them were at some point. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But we don't know that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, come on (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The best weapon against
that is just education, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> No, no! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - DARE, don't do drugs. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just have a wrinkly
brain, that's all it is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, I meme it the fuck up, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but if you want me to talk
about the realities of it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I will talk about the
fuckin' realities of it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And that's because I don't want, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I know exactly what I'm
getting into with gacha games. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I know what my limits are. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I do think it's gotten
much better since they've, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> one, you get a guaranteed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and, you know, you get to see the rates. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's much better. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's increased it a lot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like, I meme the fuck up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I'm like spending money on, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> literally a fuckin'
0.6%, but that's on me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're in a financial
position to be able </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to make that decision though. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - But even if I wasn't,
you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's on the person. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Not always. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think sometimes depending on how, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we're going in circles kind of, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but like depending on how the
game is presented and made </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I think sometimes a
fault can be on the game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I hate how you can't
even have this discussion </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> without people being like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh you're just whining, bro. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "It's free to play any way." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's like, it's not that simple. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think it's never that simple. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, I feel like if- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think not opening the door </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to that conversation is irresponsible. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, for me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like the conversation
to me, it always ends at </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if it doesn't feel like, you
know, your type of game, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't feel like you
are made for gacha games. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I genuinely believe that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I feel like someone
with your personality, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a true fuckin' gamer </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just would never enjoy gacha games. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, I don't. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I hate that I'm paying
for part of the game. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I hate that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm completely fine with that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The reason I love gacha games is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause it suits my lifestyle perfectly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It suits my mentality </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when it comes to playing games perfectly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - He's a true gacha gamer girl. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm not saying that
Gacha shouldn't exist </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or anything like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I totally recognize that it has its place </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's got its value. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just want like everything
to be more transparent. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And there'll be systems in place </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to stop people going broke from them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't think anyone should
go broke from fuckin' like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Fuckin' Arknights. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Are you kidding me? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, no one should be going
broke from fuckin' video games. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Why? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Why was that even an option? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, it shouldn't be an option </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and that's what we agree on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, we've totally
made it totally memeable </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and okay to be like,
"(laughs) He's gone broke. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "What an asshole." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We haven't memed up people going broke! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - People do, man! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What do you mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - But that's not us. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> We're not doing that! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Who's meming? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Go on Twitter, I bet there's some, bro. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - But Twitter you meme
up fuckin' everything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - If someone's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "(laughs) I just spent
100 dollars on a gacha </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "and I pulled nothing." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's basically like the same </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as what you did to
fuckin' Eugene being like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "(laughs) You just spent
100 pounds on a casino </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "and you didn't get anything." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Also there's nothing on Twitter </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's not getting memed up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, you can scroll
on Twitter being like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> "LOL his dad died." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - If someone has a legitimate problem </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and someone's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> "Dude, I fully regret
spending this much on gacha." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Then I'd be like, "Bro, I feel you." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, sorry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - "You just got to quit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "You know what I mean?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> This is bad. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, there's nothing else to say. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - They're gambling addicts for a reason. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> You can't just quit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's not that easy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's nothing else we can say. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> In our position there's
nothing else you can say. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - "Just stop doing drugs, bro. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Just stop. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> "Why're you doing drugs, man?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, it's not that easy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> End of point. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> No more. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There should be regulations. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Bottom line. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Someone needs to make the
gacha police a reality. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Bottom line there should be regulations. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> How strict they are that's up for debate </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> between gacha players and
pro gamers apparently. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Pro gamers. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Pro gamer girls and gacha gamer girls. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> The never-ending war. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think there should be
like a cool-down period, 100%. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's my closing statements. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Are gacha games predatory? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's the title. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh my god. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Why not? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's a brilliant title. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause then the entire
fuckin' gacha game community is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> just gonna destroy us. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - See, that's the problem is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that the gacha gamers get offended </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when you insinuate there could be anything </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> even predatory about it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Why? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's not what we said. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I know, but why though? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Why do they? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've seen the moment you
complain about gacha rates, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> there are like a hoard
of people being like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh I'm free to play. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "No, no, no, no." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because we hurt their feelings. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because basically from a
lot of people's perspective, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it sounds like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh you're enjoying this thing? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "No, you're not allowed to enjoy this." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, why, why are you enjoying this? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> It's wrong to enjoy this thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no, the games are totally good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The games are great. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Genshin's a great game. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> All chill, whatever you want. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You want free to play? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Cool. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You want to spend money? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Cool. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But I just think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that there shouldn't be
like predatory systems </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on anything to do with video games. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like having like a Fisher-Price toy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and being like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Do you want to roll
for a new fuckin' toy? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "You want a 10 dollar?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, we don't put that shit near kids. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - So you're not the kind
of person who's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh, there's a new DLC." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't give a fuck about DLC. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> You give me the game as is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's what I'm playing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You're just a true gamer, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Maybe. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The most vanilla gamer out there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - How's that vanilla? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Hardcore, I'd like you to add. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Go and fuckin' play a
fuckin' disguised book </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and call it a game, Joey. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - What is your perfect
gaming experienced, Connor? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> What is your perfect gaming experience? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, League. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Fuck off. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> No League player would ever say that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Then why do you play it so much? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's a good question, Joey. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Addiction. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> There should be a systems in place. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - There should be restrictions. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You meme, but League
addiction is a fuckin' thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Don't try to tell me- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, you memed that! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Don't try to tell me League
addiction is not a thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> It is a fuckin' thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, but it's not like you, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, you have to try
very hard to ruin your life </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> with a League addiction. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You have to really be on
that path of ruining it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Perfect game for me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Maybe like something like
one of the Halo games. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was a very fuckin' good game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Perfect game experience. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You get a good game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Maybe some of them had like DLC, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but that's (mutters) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Points down for that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Are you talking about, like, OG Halo? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, OG Halo. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, Halo one and two. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Halo one and two are
really fuckin' good games. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Just a game that has an experience </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that when it's over it's over. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What about, like, a current game? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - A current game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Hades is probably the best
game I've played recently. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's a fantastic example of a game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> No DLC, no bullshit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You just play the game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> You know, you get the
story if you want that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm not into that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That ain't me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> But the gameplay, fuckin' amazing! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - To me, like, 90% of the games
I ever play, I don't finish. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know why. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Such a fuckin' weak mindset. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no, like, I get to a point during- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you cum during sex? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Or do you just walk out
halfway through, Garnt? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (Connor laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Does the sex- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Does the sex take 50 hours? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Does the sex take 40 to 50 hours? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Bare in mind I don't play Final Fantasy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't play your coups. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't play any of
those long games at all. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The longest game I played
was like fuckin' Blue Dragon </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> or some shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like, I have to be properly
invested in this stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm the type of guy who, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I get really into a game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then I hit around
like the 20 hour mark, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then I still have a
quarter of the story left </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or a quarter of the gameplay left. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I feel like I've gotten
everything out of that game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I need to do, and
then I just stop playing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, a big reason why I, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even with gacha games
is that if there's not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that reason for me to keep playing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or if I'm not getting
something new out of it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then I just drop it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What do you mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> It's just a fuckin' daily quest every day. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, sometimes I like the story. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Sometimes I, you know,
sometimes it is, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (Connor laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sometimes you want to get
that grind for that character- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - The moment you said
story he just checked out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I could see his brain just power down. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I cannot fathom why
people want to grind. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, why do people put
themselves through that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's torture. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, it's kind of like
just that mindless task, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it's just something to do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You feel like you're- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Go fuckin' knit or some shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're telling me that League
isn't a grind after a point. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's a fuckin' grind. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just a grind with
more complicated controls. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yes it is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's a loss, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and there's like a win and a
loss have different outcomes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Grinds there's only one outcome. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You just win. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You just, you do the thing
that you're meant to do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then you've already planned- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, it depends how you grind. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But it's like, all right,
I've got my spreadsheet out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's gonna take eight years of grinding </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of killing these boars. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What is- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is that how you view every JRPG player? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That we have a fuckin' spreadsheet? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, but in your mind it's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "I'm gonna do this
mindless task five times </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "to get this thing." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - What is the end goal of League? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There is no end goal. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like self-improvement in mechanics. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Exactly.
- Checkmate. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's exactly it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because that's my problem
with competitive games. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I, you know, every time I
get to do a competitive game </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> whether it be League, Overwatch, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fuckin' Valorant, whatever, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is like the golden
period is the first time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when you're learning the game. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then you started
getting good at the game. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then you start learning the systems. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And then you start the ranks
playing, you start climbing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> That's when the game is fun. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> When you feel like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what you've learnt has had
a tangible effect, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But everyone, everyone will hit that wall. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Everyone will hit that wall </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where you climb as hard as you can, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> unless you're fuckin' faker or something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you've won like the world tournament. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause that is basically the
only end goal there can be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in any competitive game, to
be the best in the world. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so everyone will reach a
point where it becomes a grind </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because there's no way that
you can overcome that wall </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> without grinding your way
to overcome that wall. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, but that's like
a self-improvement thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then after you do
that you reach another wall </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and another wall after that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - But it's constantly
like improving a skill, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but in like JRPGs and you know gacha games </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> often it requires no
skill to do the grinding. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> In fact, it requires the opposite. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - But what I'm saying
is you feel like you're- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - But you're working towards a goal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You talk about self-improvement, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> well you're working towards a goal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You're gaining something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> To us gacha games is just that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, like, not just gacha games, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but like I'm pretty sure in like any MMO </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> when you're grinding, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> you just feel like you're making
progress towards something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You just less- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's like fun to people? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just having like the super
easy thing just play out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And you're like not engaged at all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just because you're
going towards something? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, you know, sometimes
I don't want to feel shitty </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when I've played five League
games and lost five in a row. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I play games to
have fun, not to rage. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's just, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you're just activating
the fuckin' neurons. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You don't need to worry about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just like being challenged constantly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, I want something
that is challenging always. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, the moment you grind- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How do not get tired? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What do you mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know why. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I like being challenged constantly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you not feel like
competitive games get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to a grind after a point? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Do you not feel like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, it gets to a
point where I feel like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> okay, I genuinely think unless
I put X amount of effort in, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not going to improve at this game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I normally just quit at that point </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I'm like, all right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like I've gotten
all the challenge I can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> out of this game in a
reasonable amount of time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm going to find something else. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, and that's
exactly the same for me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> When I reached the point
where I reached that grind- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Half these gacha games have auto-play, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so what are you doing? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Sorry? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What are you doing? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm doing other things. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I mean, that's why, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the only times I'm okay with auto-play is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when it's on a mobile because- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm not fuckin' staring at my phone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> while it's auto-playing the entire time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm doing other shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, but I've been out with you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and your auto playing on the thing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you gotta keep track
of it a little bit, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> make sure it's all going well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> You're like, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, for like two seconds, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then I'm doing other things. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You also can't use
your phone in that time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> because you are doing the
mission, so you can't reply- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh sorry, I have other things
to do than look at my phone. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I have emails to reply to, Joey. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I have, you know, messages
I've got to reply to, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> You know, it's busy life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I don't know about that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I also like not fucking my battery </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is like really
annoying on the gacha games. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> When I was playing Arknights, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I had to carry a fuckin' spare
charger with me everywhere. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> My battery was fuckin' dying. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - For me when gacha
games stop getting fun is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> the moment I start thinking
about optimization. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause when I start
thinking about optimization, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just like, okay, now I'm just like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - That is the challenge
for me in gacha games. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's exactly the point. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Which is problem. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because once I figure out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how I can optimize this game maximized, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> then it's not fun anymore. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Then its not fun! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But I figure that out immediately </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because all the shit's online, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and everyone tells you how to do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> So once you've seen the spreadsheet- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - So, you basically, like,
just willingly is like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "I just figured out a way
to make this game not fun." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - There is nothing fun
about pressing auto-play. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's fuckin' shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - When you're opening up a spreadsheets </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and you know, actually, thinking
about how to optimize this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and optimize that, that's
when it stops getting fun. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I just like the experience of just doing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like a very simple activity. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't need to worry about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I just feel like
I'm gaining something, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm not gonna say that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Hey, this is the peak
of all entertainment. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "This is why I play video games." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> You know what I mean. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just a nice little
thing in the background. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I cannot understand. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, my brain cannot
wrap around the thought </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of just I'm just progressing- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Maybe I'm the monkey
brain in this instance. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - To me, the idea of progressing to a goal </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> without actually doing anything, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it seems like the dumbest thing ever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - How is it a goal if
you're not progressing? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because fuckin' life
is stressful enough, bro. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - What do you mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, I get rid of my stress- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Life is already a challenge! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't want another
challenge on the side. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I de-stress by getting
like challenged to do stuff </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> outside of, like, life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, you're fuckin' weird. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because there's no pressure. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If I lose in a ranked
game, I don't give a fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm not gonna get my fuckin'
mortgage taken away from me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, it's nothing like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - With a mindset like that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm surprised you're not a speed runner. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because that's the exact
same mentality I feel. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no, no, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> That's psychotic 'cause that's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> "I want the same experience
again with a minute difference." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That to me like blows my mind. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - But that's exactly what
I'm hearing right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause when I get done with
the challenge, I'm done. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm on with another game. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, these speed runners
will spend like two months </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to get a one second optimization. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Aren't you all about optimization? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, and other things, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but not my like complete my fun. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, my fun is learning something
and getting better at it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, I will optimize- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, wouldn't you say
that that is speed runners </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> because they're learning a game? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think it's almost an
obsessive amount though I think. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, I get it 'cause I got
into like speed running Cuphead </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at one point. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That was quite fun because I
was seeing good improvements. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But the moment it became not fun is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when I would do a 40 minute run, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was just like, "I don't
really know what to do now." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't really see much to improve. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I would look on
the line and I'll be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Okay, I guess I can do this." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But then like, yeah sure, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the mechanical aspect
of trying to get better </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at like a certain thing was better but- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But it's a challenge. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, but it was not, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when you play against other players, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's always a constant
direct challenge facing you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And every second there
is constant decisions </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you have to make to outplay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And every new game is a new experience. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's a lot of things that are the same. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But with a speed run, I think
the problem I have with it is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that it's always, like,
we follow the formula </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then we try and improve on
the formula little by little </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is not kind of fun </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause if you're doing, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people do like three hour
games that speed runs. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, they might do like a
two second optimization here </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and then redo everything the same way. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That sounds like insanity to me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You're not changing anything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There's no variation. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You're just changing one detail, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> constantly trying to improve it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And sure, I can understand
why that's fun to someone. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But for me I can't do that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I just can't get invested in that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's just not what I do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - So what do you get invested in then? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Self-improvement? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, self-improvement. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - What is your definition of fun? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - What is fun for you? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's a skill. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then seeing how well
I can apply the skill </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on the fly to things. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, how well I can learn it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and adapt to situations
is what's fun to me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I like losing 'cause that
means I can get better. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - See, for me, I play video games </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause I just like escapism. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That is my escapism. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, to me video games, I
do that enough in my real life. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's probably why I
fuckin' watch so many isekai. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just realizing this now, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Escape to another world. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But yeah, it's just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I want to do something
where it's, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sometimes with gacha games, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's no way you could
lose at the gacha game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> unless you were fuckin' spending money. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But like, in terms of like
the grinding and the progress, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's no way to lose against it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So you just don't like losing? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> You don't like losing? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Who does like losing? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I like losing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're fuckin' weird. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, it's not. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Every fighting game player's
obsessed with losing I swear. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, that's why they're all psychotic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's like some martial arts mantra. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was playing Mario Kart With someone, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and they couldn't drift on Mario Kart. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And I thought this is
a very basic mechanic. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is not that hard to understand. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "You should just try it
without the baby mode on." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I feel like the baby mode </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> just all you're then doing is holding A. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause the fun part about
Mario Kart is drifting I think. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And nailing drifts, and,
you know, playing the game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I like drifting in Mario Kart. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay, I'm gonna say that
for like the 90th time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you like drifting in Mario Kart? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I love drifting in Mario Kart. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - You say that is if it's
an unpopular opinion. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was playing with
someone the other day. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm glad you laughed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, hot take. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I drift in Mario Kart. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Hot take, hot take. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So they couldn't beat me in Mario Kart. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Yeah, it's 'cause you're
not fuckin' drifting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "You're never going to beat
me if you're not drifting." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And they were like, "Oh,
okay, I guess I'll try." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And they tried it once. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They tried it without baby mode on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They kept falling off the
edge, and they're like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> "No, I don't like Mario Kart now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "It's not fun." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, what did you expect? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> That you were just gonna
be amazing right away? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> No, you've got to put some effort in? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Start learning how to
drift, you dumb fuck! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Try it! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - The fact that you've
gotten that competitive </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> over fuckin' Mario Kart just
shows what your mentality is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It drives me insane when
people try something like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> That is not that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> we're not talking about, I'm not like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Just get good at StarCraft, bro." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm not asking that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like press one button on Mario Kart </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when you come to the corner. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> That's all I'm asking. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> That's what I'm trying to explain to you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> People who like throw a fit and are like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> "I don't wanna play anymore. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "It's not fun now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> "I failed this one mechanic
and I don't care to learn it." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, that drives me insane. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I can imagine the dad you're gonna be. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, "Son! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> "You can't drift in Mario Kart. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> "You're a disappointment. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Dead to me!" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I do not have like, people will be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Wow, Connor's that guy," </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause to me fighting
game combos are absurd. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, the amount of combos </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and inputs you have to
put in is just too much. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, there was just such
a steep learning curve. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Again, the fighting game
community will be up in arms </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> now that I've said that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They'll be like, "(scoffs) Okay, Connor." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The drifting in Mario Kart is
such a low barrier of entry </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> in terms of intense mechanics. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - For you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Is it really? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Do you think it is? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I know some people who just,
no matter what game it is, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> some people just don't, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> their brains just don't operate
when it comes to like games. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Even a simple mechanic like drifting, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> they're just like, "I
don't understand that." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think to me it's, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if they had never wanted
to drift, it's fine. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But they wanted to drift
and wanted to learn. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And then it was difficult,
and they gave up immediately. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> And that's what annoyed me is
that they immediately gave up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, I mean- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - How do you get anything done in life? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But isn't that the equivalent
of you playing Tekken </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and being like, "I want to do this combo." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And you try and you're
like, "I don't like it." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, I would try the combo
and I'd be fuckin' shit at it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'd get my ass clowned on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Then I realize I'm just not
getting better at this game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's the exact the same! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> That's the exact same thing! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, I would try multiple
sessions to get good at it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What's the difference? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's just the same thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> with a different difficulty curve. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's the same thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's the difference of I have one life </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> versus I have three lives. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh, game over, woops. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is why I said, I
prefaced right in the start, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, it's not like
I'm asking you to get good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at StarCraft or anything intense. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm not asking you to
learn intense mechanics. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> It is Mario Kart drift. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, but you have to understand people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for some people that is intense. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - How? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> How is that intense? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's just how it is! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I refuse to believe that's intense. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Are you telling your grandma can fuckin' </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> figure out Mario Kart straight away? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - If you're my age, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Mario Kart drifting should
not be an intense mechanic. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think it's like early onset dementia </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> if that is a problem for you, honestly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's some big claims there, buddy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I do not expect my grandma </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> to even know how to get like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just click the fuckin' menu
on the Nintendo Switch. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not expecting her to do that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Very extremely basic
mechanics, like, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Again, this is not my problem
that they can't do it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's that they gave up right away. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The first failure of the first track, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they're like, "I'm done, I quit." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Maybe because they don't want </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a fuckin' challenging
experience in a video game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Maybe they just want to play it for fun. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're like the Navy Seals dad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I despise those people. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're becoming one! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I would never expect someone
to be good at any video game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - "Are you trying to say </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "that you're playing Mario Kart for fun? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> "No, no, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "It's all about the challenge. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> "It's about the challenge." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I would never claim to be, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I want to be good at fighting games </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then I'll try and give up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If I want to actually learn something, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm gonna do it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm not gonna throw a hissy fit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and give up when I'm not good at it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - But, that's just how you operate. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So you have to realize not
everyone is an epic gamer girl. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Some people just don't see games that way, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and you just have to accept that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I just think it was annoying. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I get it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I get like, that's annoying to me as well, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I'm not gonna get
like pissed off at them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just like, well, that's
just how you play games. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - That just means probably it
just ain't the game for them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's just not the game for them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Maybe they just don't like
playing games like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just genuinely off the top of my head, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I can't think of an
easier mechanic to learn </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> than the Mario Kart drift. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Can you? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Name an easier mechanic, go right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Probably accelerating in Mario Kart. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Actually no, it's automatic now, Joey. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is it actually? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, there's an option. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> It's on automatic by default. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So, you don't even have to do that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Turning in Mario Kart. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - On baby mode it's automatic! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's what I'm saying. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There's literally the game play- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's what I'm saying. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There's a reason why they
added those mechanics </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> because for some people
it's just too much. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's what I'm saying then- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - They just want their monkey
brain neuron activation- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - To you Mario Kart might be a baby game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> But for some people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's the equivalent of playing StarCraft. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I never said it was a baby game. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just saying what happened was is that- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - What you're saying is- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - They were complaining
that I was winning. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, "You're never going
to win if you don't drift." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> So my problem was is
that they're complaining </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I'm winning, I told
them how I was winning, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I explained to them,
this is how you can do it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and how easy of a mechanic it is to learn. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, you can learn it in
one sitting very comfortably. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, most people would if
they actually just tried. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> But they just gave up immediately. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Son, just start winning." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Just get good!" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - "Son, son!" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Why aren't you winning, son?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Why aren't you winning?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It would never get to that point. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> My son would be disowned before- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I would be like, "Why haven't
you won already, son?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm kidding, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know, am I being- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - My son was winning out the womb. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Connor doesn't ask,
"Are you winning, son?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Why am I the asshole? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - "You're winning right, son?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why am I the asshole
for thinking, that's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just like, I dunno. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> You should maybe just not give up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause you're literally complaining </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about competitive Mario Kart! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, I'm not complaining about that! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm complaining about the part </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that they gave up immediately </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and were like, "I can't do it." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I hate when people do that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, "I just can't do that." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I hate it too, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but I'm not like fucking
lose my shit over it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't give a shit about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's fuckin' Mario Kart. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - If they don't want to win
in Mario Kart that's on them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's fuckin' Mario Kart. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't give a shit if someone
gives up in Mario Kart. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, but they were having
like a little hissy fit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm like, "That's your problem, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Stop giving up on shit in life. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "This is why you get nothing done." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's why you're not in the Navy Seals. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's why you never
excelled at anything, son, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> because you gave up the first time! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - If you're getting pissy over
someone losing in Mario Kart </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> or someone throwing a
hissy fit in Mario Kart, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> imagine something more
intensive in life for them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, you guys are
taking it out of context. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm saying they were getting pissed off. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And then it kind of pissed me off </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that they were getting pissed off about it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because they didn't put any effort in. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, yeah, but like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Then you tried to got me
like with a gotcha moment </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on fighting games and it's
completely not related at all. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It is related! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We're talking about- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You gave me an entirely
different situation. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, no, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> What we're saying is
that you got pissed off </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with someone having a hissy thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I wouldn't even bother getting pissed off </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> at someone having a hissy fit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause it's fuckin' Mario Kart. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It irked me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Basically them giving up on
not being able to learn drift </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in Mario Kart is exactly
the same situation </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as you not being able to
learn the difficulty curve </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in the fighting game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's completely different thing, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> If that was my own choosing,
and I went through that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> or like someone pushed me on it, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "You should start learning combos." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I could totally understand
if I was pushing it on them </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but they wouldn't want to do
it or wouldn't be good at it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Because I mean, I'm putting it on them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They never wanted to do
it in the first place. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But you were pushing them to drift. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, I never said that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, you did. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They said, how was I winning? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I said, drifting. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And they were like,
"Oh, I want to do that." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I literally said that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Stop putting words in my fuckin'
mouth, Joey, you asshole. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What I'm saying is like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if I was pushed into doing it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> totally understand why
you would then give up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Basically you just
hate people who give up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I hate people who give up right away. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I hate it, dude. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - What's the right amount
before someone gives up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when it becomes acceptable? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, you can tell if
you're like good at something </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> when someone just isn't
getting the hang of it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they aren't gonna get a hang of it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, if you have been doing
something for a long time, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can just tell they're struggling. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But like, most people,
like, not most people. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's a fair amount people out there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who are perfectly capable
of doing something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who just give up immediately </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause they failed the first time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Probably with you guys
with ranked games I imagine. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, I mean, I don't give up immediately. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I just get bored. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Go and spend your money. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Go and get that serotonin. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't even start 'cause
I know I'm gonna hate it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't even try. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause you have a hissy
fit when you lose at games. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Connor laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I don't want to have a hissy
fit when I'm losing a game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> That's not why I play games. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Why do you get a hissy
fit when you lose at a game? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because when does it ever feel- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Someone has to lose. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Name me a moment where
I'm like, "Oh man, I lost." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, no one says that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't give a shit
when I lose at a game. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, "All right, well fair enough. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "I got outplayed, you know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "It is what it is." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Does that feel good to you? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Sometimes if I know
where like I could have- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The fuck's wrong with you? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think it is, like, a
healthier mindset to be of, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> "I don't mind losing so I can improve." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm not, I'm not- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Fuck that is the
complete fuckin' opposite </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of League experience, my friend. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> The League experience
is, "Fuck me, I lost. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> "Was it my fault or was
it my teammate's fault? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "I have literally no fuckin' clue." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, I deadass know in League </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when it was completely my fault. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, there are some games you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it is 100% not your fault. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - There are some games when
it's like the 50/50 game, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then your teammate is
just caught out one V five </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> while, like, you're all
doing Baron or something, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and then you just fuckin'
lose the game thanks to that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And that feels horrible. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> That feels awful. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - That doesn't feel great. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> But then, you know, you can
leave that game be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "All right, I could
have set that up better. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "I could have done things better </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> "to make that W more secured." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't look at games that deep, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just do it to fuckin' escape. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, no, I don't look at it deep. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What happens is that I enjoy games, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and then I look into now,
when we're talking about it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm thinking, "Okay, why do
I enjoy the games that way?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And that's why I'm talking
about it now, Joey. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not sitting there at my window sill. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, "Why do I enjoy suffering in League? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "I don't know." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And that is the question
that we're posing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Why do you enjoy suffering in League? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - That is the question to
all League players right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm League free, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I haven't played the game in- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm League free. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (everyone laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I haven't played a ranked game of League </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in like two months, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Three months. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I went to League anonymous, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I just fuckin' said it, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, "Yeah, I'm League free." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Congratulations, everybody claps. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Basically I enjoy league the most </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when I don't care about winning or losing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, that's literally my enjoyment </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of those types of competitive games. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think Joey's just
a little gamer bitch. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> A little crybaby boy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And that's where we're
going to end it today. </SPEAKER_04>
