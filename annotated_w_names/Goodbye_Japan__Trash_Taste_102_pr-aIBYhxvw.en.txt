<SPEAKER_01> known to like you know wear good clothes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah like I like you know I'm privileged </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm privileged I'm privileged to wear </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Google but you know I've always been </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like interested in like clothing like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fashion you know like streetwear stuff </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like that so I was like yeah there's so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> much good street wear out there but like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> nothing that was like really like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> speaking to me personally right it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like there's a lot of good brands and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> whatnot but it's like so I was just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll [ __ ] do it myself I'll make it a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> pain in the ass yeah absolutely it was a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> pain in the ass yeah yeah so like um </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah so it's like a full-on proper brand </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> or anything and like the one thing I was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> always scared of right is like whenever </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> YouTube is released clothes yeah it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> usually under the merch yeah yeah right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but like I didn't want this to be much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it's like because you know these </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> designs and like all the designs are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> going to be releasing have nothing to do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> with me or like the likeness of me or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> anything like that yeah I wanted to just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> be like something separate to me right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> that like in the case that like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> anime man or whatever just [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> implodes in on itself right in a couple </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> years time that this can still be around </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> right so he's like I'm already not </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> watching an anime exactly it's already </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> it's already on the Dire Straits all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right back up exactly it's already on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the Dire Straits I'm like you know what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like I'll I'll try something new I'll </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> try something like challenging yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> so uh yeah so by the time this episode </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is out like all the Social Media stuff </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is probably ready to go we literally </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> didn't know anything about it we we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> didn't know anything </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> you don't know you don't understand how </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> hard it was to keep it a secret I'm like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Joey's kept a secret from us </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like literally I started this before we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> moved to this office are you serious </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah like at the old office what yeah so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> it's been like over a year now okay so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah I'm uh I'm very passionate about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> this and I wanted to do well and uh I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> have so I have so many questions I don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know where to start it's all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everything's designed by me as well like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sketched by me obviously I obviously I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> obviously got designers and everything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to clean it up and everything like all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the designs are done by me yeah and uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah I hope people like it so check out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> nonsense it's uh I'm gonna be and we're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> gonna be doing this thing where we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> release a new design every month okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like one new design a month because I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thought like originally I was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> should I do like the usual thing where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like oh I drop you know like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> collection yeah a collection of the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> collection but I was like no I'm selling </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it to people on the internet and the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> people on the internet have the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> attention span of a goldfish somewhere </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> let's just like keep bringing stuff out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah so keep the drip dripping </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> exactly keep it keep that tap just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> slightly open so that the water's just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> constantly drooping you know rather than </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> keeping it closed and then suddenly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> being like here you go you know so yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that's the that's the plans for it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> obviously I'm not like you know [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> quitting anything else this is just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> another thing I'm doing on the side so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> hey if you like it then uh check it out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I guess and then hopefully pre-orders </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> will start soon was there anything that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was uh surprisingly Difficult about </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> making your own clothing brands yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like well for one like you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> everything's designed by me but like I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> can't do like graphic design yeah well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know like I can't do like logo </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> design and stuff like that right so like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> even just coming up with like you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> just like the font and stuff like that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> for nonsense and like uh I don't know if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the logo is anywhere but like yeah like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> you know just something like that right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah even just coming up with like that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> font took me like two months well that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> why graphic designers are like job </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I basically just described what a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> graphic designer is damn this [ __ ] hard </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> job for this yeah right because like you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> know I'm not used to that with like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> video creating right yeah like usually </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like nine times out of ten I think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> of an idea and then I try and make it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> work and then whatever I have you know I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have to work with right especially with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the kind of content I make so it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know even if it's not like perfect </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> perfect yeah I have to get something out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there right otherwise I won't you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll have the [ __ ] upload schedule of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know 2015 gaunt essentially yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah so it's like but like with this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I have to like really be careful with it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I don't want to get a design out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> there and it just looks like [ __ ] yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you know because it's like my brand is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> on the line essentially how many fonts </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> did you have to go through </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> uh like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> well I mean for one like the the actual </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the official font for the brand is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> completely custom yeah so I had to get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like a like a typographer not a not a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> graphic designer a typographer I have to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> find a typographer to be like and like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> font specialist to be like here's the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> brand here's what the brand is about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> here's the kind of designs I want yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> uh can you come up with just like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> shitload of fonts yeah and we literally </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> went through about 100 fonts and just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> decided that's what we want because the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> thing about fonts is that it's something </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> that like most people don't really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> appreciate or think about until you have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to choose one like I remember like just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> having to choose one just to use for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> more like my YouTube videos or just yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> right a logo or something I'm just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where the [ __ ] do I even start and then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> you go through like the Photoshop like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fun and you like realize that's just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> calibri in it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> just like the aerial yeah yeah and then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> you talk to Graphics yeah yeah and then </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> you talk to graphic designers and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> they're just like they're just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> built different they see a font and they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> can like name the font yeah like they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> can name the font they can name like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [Music] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so like I I got like a like you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> working with like a typographer and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> everything like I gained like a whole </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> new appreciation for like graphic design </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and typography because like yeah that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> shit's hard as [ __ ] and I can see why </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know like in the case with like this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for example like just changing this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> spacing the kerning between each of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> letters yeah makes like a completely </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> different design yeah and you wouldn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> think otherwise though when you make </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like a YouTube thumbnail right yeah like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah just [ __ ] put the font there and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're good right right kind of thing so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like it made me appreciate like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> subtle design yeah if anything and like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know because I'm kind of going with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like kind of a combination between like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> street wear but also loungewear right so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like you could wear this like outside of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> course and you know be great but you can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> also it's comfortable enough where you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> can wear it inside yeah as well so for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for you for you weebs out there that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't go outside you can still wear it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> this is like the longest trash taste ad </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we've ever done </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah no because like you know it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> talking about like fonts and having to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> choose fonts and just like being thrown </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> into a world that you just don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> understand sometimes that yeah you never </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> knew that you know there was this much </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thought into it like I remember like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> recently uh this is like going off on a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> tangent but I remember recently I've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just got like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> had like a binge not really a binge but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just like had my recommended taken over </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> by these really weird keyboard ASMR </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> videos I don't know I don't know if you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> guys know what I'm talking about I think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I've seen a couple of them </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because because uh because how uh how </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how like how I basically discovered it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was just this random keyboard video </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right and I was just like why is why is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> there a keyboard video of just someone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> typing on my timeline it's like I click </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on it just just uh because I think that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think the video title was just listen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to the sound of this keyboard or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> something right right and it's just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> him like oh or like him or her like just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> pressing the keys right and just and the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> title was just listen to the space bar </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> right and it's pressing the keys right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then he goes to the space bar </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it just sounded like a space bar I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was like it's just a space bar and then </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I go to the comments section to be like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what what's what's going on and all of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the comments were just like I was I was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> having a nice time until you press the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> space bar and then I vomited and it was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just like the vomit emote or something </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like that and I was just I've never been </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> put into a world that I just did not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> understand well I mean like I I kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> felt that when uh I think it was Conor </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> ride who got like I think one of your </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fans made like a custom keyboard yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah yeah but then they also you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know with the custom cable which looked </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> sick as [ __ ] there was also this like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> other smaller keyboard where you could </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> test out oh that was gone oh that was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> gone it was like it was like a smaller </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> keyboard where you could test out all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> the different types of keys yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and like Hammers and I'm just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> what's the difference </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like I touched all of them and I was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like half of these sound the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> thing I think I think they as someone </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> who's like using the one of the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> expensive keyboards because I don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> think it was given to me I would never </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have gone out my way and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [Applause] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> now I get it because I use it yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> before I didn't understand what the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> difference was yeah right but I really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like the smoothness and like the subtle </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> clicks yeah now that I've watched it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> it's a very slight click but it's really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> nice yeah now that I'm like like 20 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> keyboard videos down I kind of get it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> there's like a nice there's like it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like the thunk sound yeah there's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> it's the thong sound where it's zero or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> have you just been conditioned maybe </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I've just been conditioned I feel like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm I'm one of you Cherry MX brand </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> switches can suck my dick there you go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> uh welcome keyboard enthusiasts yeah I'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like the Cherry switches I can actually </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> tell they [ __ ] suck now I used to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have it wait listen like why why why it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> sounds like like a car crashing every </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> time you [ __ ] press it in it's so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> goddamn loud Oh you mean like the clicky </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> one super super clicky okay [ __ ] those </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> ones they what like I had one in my old </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> office in the UK and since I went back </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> to the UK it's probably like charity </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Brown MX switches they're like the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> cheese I think it's like the Cherry blue </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> the gatrian ones the gatron is like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> gatron's where is that I've got the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> gatron Black Ink one oh that's a good </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> one it's like oh it's [ __ ] good yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> it's [ __ ] good dude yeah I really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> like the gatron like milk yellow I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> believe it's it's literally called milky </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> something milk because it it like it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> just has this like nice little thunk to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it and it's nice it's like ASMR right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> it's it's so smooth and it's so it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> milky it just sounds like one piece </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> [Laughter] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> like what Lube he used and I was like I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> don't need to know what you jacked off </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> with but yeah I appreciate it yeah so so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> to explain like I'm also getting a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> custom keyboard made because a fan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> message me yeah um but like dude I mean </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like I I did pay for the the thing yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> so he was like oh do you want to get a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> keyboard made for you and it's being in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the process of being made and I was just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like yeah sure thinking that he was just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> going you know he was just going to send </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> something that he recommended and he was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like no we're gonna do the entire </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> process right like what kind of what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> kind of keyboard do you want you want </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like a hundred percent you want a 75 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> percent you want to like a fifty percent </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was just like what you are saying </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> numbers right now it's a keyboard what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> are you talking about I have a full </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> hundred percent keyboard keyboard and I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> want every part there yeah why would I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> only need 75 of the keyboard yeah I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> don't like the number pad and all that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] on the side I don't I used to not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> care but now that I have a keyboard that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> doesn't have a number pad I understand </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> why it's unnecessary to have it because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I realized I realized until it was gone </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I never [ __ ] used to know I know I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> know some people like go ham on it and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm out here I'm totally fine with the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> top thing yeah so I just want to save </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> room yeah I use number pads okay yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> mostly because when you huh you just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> mostly it's it's useful because it's all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> the numbers are just close enough yeah I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> recognize it's the superior way to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> handle numbers it is it is but I I just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> like with the amount of like two-factor </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> authentication I have yeah you know what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean like like I'm constantly using </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's not that it is it is it is this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> well I definitely had a moment where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like you know I was like you know I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> should probably start using the number </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> pad yeah my old keyboard because it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there but then I had a moment where I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> was just like damn it's so hard to use </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with my left hand I was just like doing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this and I'm like oh maybe I should just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> take my hand off for now so just do this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> why is it not on the left side it'd be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so much easier but then I was like oh I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> could just let go of the mouse and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> perhaps just do this before you implying </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> that your right hand was like on your </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> dick you're like jacking off for you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like let me put in my credit card </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> details well I'm like jacking up while </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like playing run </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean if you're like an accountant or </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> something right you got to be pressing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> numbers all day then yeah it should make </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> sense but like I should be used to that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> layout as well because it's like you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know every calculator is that layout </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right so it's like why is it so hard for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> me to use when it's on a keyboard yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> even though on a calculator it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> basically second nature yeah like I I I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> mean the the reason I like the number </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> pad is because buying a lot of things </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> online you've got to enter your credit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> card number a lot </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> um log into your bank account details </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> how much should you buying yeah it is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like actually beneficial to have that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> real estate taken up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um like I don't know like I just have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> enough I feel like I use it a lot </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because sometimes I need to log into my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> bank and you know you when is when </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're entering purely just numbers it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> not like a password that's when the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> number pad is useful and like when </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> you're like entering the numbers on a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> line marginally though marginally useful </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Mr optimization I thought I thought </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> you'd be one of me man listen you're </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> trying to optimize two things at once </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> how fast can you type stuff in but also </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> the the space in your desk you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right right I've got a lot of like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> on my desk because you know they've got </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like God knows how many I got like two </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> audio interfaces I got a bunch of other </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cables I will I will admit the aesthetic </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> looks better without them it's the the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> aesthetic looks better travels easier </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> you know trying to put a number you can </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> put a key like a uh what are they called </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a 75 half keyboards yeah 75 yeah 75 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> keyboard you can put that in the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> backpack you can't put a full one in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> your bag that's too big why would you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sometimes you're going somewhere maybe </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> you go into a lan event or something not </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> that I do anymore but you know what's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the last time you went to a lan event </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> University yeah I think like it was like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> high school for me but also like you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know what if you don't like the the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> keyboard on your laptop I get it because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sometimes the laptop keyboards suck and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then you want to bring them with you if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're going to be like having a remote </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> setup right packing a full-size keyboard </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in the backpack it's pain in the ass </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've never been that desperate I've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> never been like every time I've touched </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> you don't realize you don't realize how </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> how good having like things smaller and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> taking up less space is yeah but like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's not it's not like my laptop </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> keyboard isn't so [ __ ] detrimental to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> me where I'm like I gotta pack another </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> keyboard </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> without a number pad than just use the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> laptop keyboard if that makes less sense </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> more space now you take your more space </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm having like a remote setup yeah I'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> going to a place I'm going to be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> streaming and we're playing games I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> don't want to play games on the laptop </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh keyboard controller could bring in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> control but some games don't use </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> controller well then don't play those </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> games okay well but you're gonna play </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> these games Joe you're just being </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> pedantic now for no reason just just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> play a game that you can use I'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not alone I've seen people do this so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> many times people don't want to use the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] keyboard on the laptop I'm sure </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're not alone but it's done there's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> so many people who do this this is I've </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> never gotten to the point where okay I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have a remote setup right a remote setup </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is not like your permanent setup right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah but if if I really really really </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> need a keyboard I just buy like a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] five dollar keyboard or </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> something like that you know like it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah use the laptop one yeah no like I I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> like if if I really really wanted like a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> remote like a remote setup it's like the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> ergonomics you know like using a laptop </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> keyboard for hours like actually [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> hurts your wrists using a keyboard for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hours hurts my wrist </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that's why I'm trying to use controller </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> for everything a nice keyboard you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> good ergonomics doesn't doesn't hurt </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> your wrist yeah you bring the rest as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> well yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you got the rest too a lot just enough </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> rest you know my laptop it's amazing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> right but I I have to like it's just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there's no support or anything I'm just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> putting it I'll just bring the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> rest then I just feel like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> uh the [ __ ] track pad and [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah it just doesn't work it doesn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> work I just feel like the inside I've </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> got someone in the office understands </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> this point I just think like the whole </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> point of a laptop is to be portable no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> it is like and and like but at that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> point you might as well monitor if the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> keyboard fits in the bag it's portable </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know what I mean like you can't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bring a p the reason why laptop's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Portables because it's not a giant </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] case not because the keyboard is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like on him that's like one of the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> reasons if I'm whipping it out in a cafe </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah I'm gonna use the laptop keyboard </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right I'm replying it you know it's not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> a big deal if I'm streaming or gaming I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> want a [ __ ] keyboard but in how are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you like if you're at the point where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're bringing a portable setup yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right like in which so tell tell them </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> tell me this tell me this hypothetical </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> situation where you need to set up an </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> entire stream setup because I'll tell </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you it's not just a [ __ ] laptop you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> need to bring your if you're bringing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> your entire [ __ ] stream set up how </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> much are you bringing like what do you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> want to enter the UK last time I brought </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> it with me you know you just bring </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because if I want to film stuff anyway I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bring a camera anyway the camera has two </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uses I can film other stuff do you bring </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> lights no I don't bring lights you don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> need lights you know you can figure out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> lighting it's not a big issue right it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just having a good camera a good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> mic and then if you want to play games </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or [ __ ] you bring a keyboard on a map </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and a mouse you're not going to [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> use the uh the trackpad right no you're </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> not going to use </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> a trackpad is like totally different </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> than the mouse right right but I mean if </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you have a 75 keyboard it's not that big </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> but then like another thing is like are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you still gaming on the laptop or do you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> have like a monitor that you're using as </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> well uh on the laptop's fine the screen </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I have on my laptop is pretty good and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's not very ergonomic is it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like this desk over there my my other </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> keyboards here this one's there it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> further away because I have more room </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> now because the keyboard's not attached </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to the thing so I can place the screen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where I want it to so it is ergonomics </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> does this just sound very pretentious no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> this is not this is this is if I wanted </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like do it if you want to go portability </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> why not go for a 50 keyboard then or 50 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> what or 24. what is the 50 how can you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> remove less there is you would be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> surprised you would be surprised </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> smaller keys I already had fat fingers </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> too I need I need to like why don't you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> just invent a keyboard which is just the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> space bar and the arrow keys I don't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> know who who uses the arrow keys yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> well if you're playing games okay or </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> wasd I want all the letters you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's half of a pizza box you know what I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> mean it's like not even it's tiny it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> doesn't take up room and your clothes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are the padding it's it's this isn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hard why is this so crazy to you it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> like I'm bringing a [ __ ] like pet dog </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> in my bags is so unbelievable because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> because it's just like at that point at </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that point where you are not at that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> point where you're bringing a streaming </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> setup a number pad is not that much more </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> surface area okay but what I'm saying is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like that's just unnecessary like in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> general like uh in any keyboard setup </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> keyboard in your like check-in well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> technically if you get a 50 keyboard </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> you're removing unnecessary keys right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you know you know that's that's the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> entire life </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it's called a preference Connor it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> called a preference </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I would argue right the reason why 75 is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> no different from the 100 because you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> don't lose anything right you have you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just have numbers twice I don't need </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> numbers twice I see numbers once this is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> not why is this like you're saying like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> removing the second numpad is not equal </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to being like get rid of half of the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> alphabet this is not the [ __ ] same at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all why I can't believe this is an </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> argument you're making </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> imagine in the hotel you're stuck for a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> week yeah yeah you wanted you want the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> TV screen to be your second monitor yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> leave your laptop there and you can sit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> at your bed with your wireless 75 yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> every every Hotel every Airbnb I do not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> pack a keyboard wherever I go no that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> fine but why are you clowning on me this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is not like a clown thing to do this is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> a normal sounds incredibly pretentious </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and tedious how is it pretentious what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> because let me just get my 75 because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because everyone works differently I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can't go to a Starbucks and work like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's not I I'd be like why is it so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> pretentious gone you have to go to a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Starbucks to type you know what I mean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like work from home </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like like I don't see how this is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> potential I'm losing my mind it's the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> way that you're framing it as like this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> is the superior way to type this is the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> only keyboard that works </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> number pads irrelevant unnecessary </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all I'm saying is you preference I I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I use it enough and optionally for me to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> be able to justify that it is a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> convenience for me all right I like how </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> did this get to me being clowned on for </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> bringing keyboards how did this get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> trash days baby that's not that's not </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the reason you were clowning on me God </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the reason you were trying to clown on </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> me is because I brought keyboard places </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it's funny </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it's it's it's it's a lot okay it's it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a lot I'm just like there's ah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I understand it's a preference you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I understand it is a preference that you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> want to bring your keyboard have you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> never thought like when you're like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> trying to play games like you're like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> why are my hands so [ __ ] close to the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> screen no I've I've because here's the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> thing like I don't really I'm not a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> gamer yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> right right so why don't you just say </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> that in the first place instead of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> pretending like you were I never pretend </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like because because I told you what I'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> using the keyboard for and then you're </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> like no no that doesn't exist </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I also have a portable streaming setup </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> but I just don't need it I don't need a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> keyboard I don't think to myself I am I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I am a carthus Mane in League of Legends </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I have a one percent keyboard it's the r </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> key that's it okay that's you know like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah I just I like if I need to game </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> while I'm out and about I just bring a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] controller and just play games </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that use a controller yeah but like what </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if someone's like oh dude no you've </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> arranged a a game with someone the game </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> doesn't have controller then I'll use </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> the keyboard I'm not gonna [ __ ] have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> a hissy fit over and be like where's my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> 75 percent I wouldn't have a hissy fix I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> would have brought it [ __ ] with me so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they wouldn't have been yeah but even </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> what if you didn't I always bring it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> with me no it's not happening and if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just a waste of space it's not a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> waste of space it's it's thin it's small </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> how is the keyboard a waste of space </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just feel like you guys are just being </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> pedantic yeah because it's funny </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean I I feel like I feel like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> argument is are you a gamer are you not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> a gamer you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 100 games you know I want to write a lot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> of emails and stuff to the point of like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if I'm if I'm doing a lot of work you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> know I'm typing for a few hours like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah I'm just gonna bring my own I just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's because like for me it's like I I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> will be so much less efficient using the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> laptop long so I just won't be </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> comfortable </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> no I mean I'm I'm okay that's that is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> just that is just purely just you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> looking for any like I don't know like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> because I'm the scripter here I I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> actually write more than you Connor yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> actually he's right more than you it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> the same like because you work one way </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> everyone must work the same way and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> you've re like like so if someone writes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a lot they're the ones that we should </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ask like okay tell me about keyboard </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ergonomics and how well no that's not I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I I I are you saying that you can't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> write as efficiently if you don't have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the right keyboard and everything how do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you function how did you function before </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like the 75 keyboards got popularized </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> you know because it was writing with I'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> not doing wing dings I'm not right with </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a [ __ ] number pad can't what you want </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this is nothing to do with the 75 now </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what are you talking about and now we're </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> talking about the difference between </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> laptop and keyboards yeah I I am I'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> just I'm just like if also you know your </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> laptop doesn't have a number pad right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah I know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not saying that I'm not saying that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it doesn't matter </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> listen how you work is like totally up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to you right if you if you are a person </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> who gets really agitated by a certain </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> way and that's just like that bugs you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah I think that's just that's up to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you could you just knuckle down </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sometimes and get on with it yeah you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can but I mean at the end of the day </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's if you're doing something creative </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's something that you're Your Own </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Boss with you're probably gonna work as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> much as you want yeah and sometimes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Comfort is a factor in that and for me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> that's what I need yeah but you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> gaming you're right if I am working </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> though as well it's the same thing I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just don't want to use it right right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that was the most long-winded dumbass </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> argument we've ever had on trash days </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I just felt like I explained a very </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> valid point and then I got I got jumped </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> on it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> totally a reasonable Behavior to to not </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> want to use that okay okay because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because like maybe it's because I don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> have a custom keyboard yet but like I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> don't fully understand I don't take my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> main keyboard I take some like 50 ones </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I just needed one that's further away </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and that I can set up to be more like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> wait so you don't even take your your </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> optimize custom keyboard not like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> super expensive one no I just take like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> one that I do so you have several </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> keyboards yeah yeah well I learned my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> lesson because what my keyboard broke </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> one time I couldn't do any work or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> couldn't stream or anything right and I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you know I was [ __ ] and I was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> well this seems dumb so now I just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bought I have a spare keyboard </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah because like it's a good idea yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if your entire job revolves around doing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> like being able to use this one device </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah you should probably have backups of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> everything that could possibly break </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> that's fair enough but I don't think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I've ever broken a keyboard before </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> keyboards all the time you know maybe </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> you've had a key that was acting up that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was pissing you off or yeah maybe the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah yeah it happens all the time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah keyboards are like [ __ ] frail </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> things yeah yeah because to me like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> houses break all the time I've got like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> three backup mouses yeah because like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> maybe like this this comes down to the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> conversation like me and Tech like even </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> though I'm an engineer I'm I don't like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just need a job to be done you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> what I mean I don't really care about </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Aesthetics or like right stuff too much </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I just like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Aesthetics I don't care about that you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> don't well it's just about it's about </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> preference of like how I like it to work </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah you know yeah because like for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> example like headphones for example I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> literally don't like I I my preference </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with headphones is to buy like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> cheapest headphones I can possibly right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm the opposite with headphones yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah because I I know people are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> like really really really </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> India right in here yeah you don't use </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> headphones like clamshell headphones you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mean those are headphones right yeah oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> sorry earphones yeah I only use </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> earphones for like running yeah yeah I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> don't I prefer to use headphones every </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> other time I don't like yeah to me like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> headphones I don't know why </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um I think it might be because I have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like Jaw problems or something like if I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wear headphones for too long it just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like really starts to put pressure on my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> drone stuff but like yeah with with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> earphones and like this is going above </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> protect but like there are certain </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> things like earphones sunglasses where I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> try to buy the cheapest possible because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've gone through too many or you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like just sometimes you buy like you I I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> remember buying like at the end of every </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> day you're like track all right next one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> no yeah because like sometimes I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> misplaced them or something but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> especially with sunglasses right yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it's so it's so easy to misplace </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sunglasses especially because you wear </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> them out and sometimes utilize you don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> always have your case on you or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sometimes you you know you take it you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't have a bag or anything you take </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> them off you like clip them on your </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> shirt and they just fall off sometimes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like I've I've had that happen too many </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> times and with earphones sometimes you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> just get sometimes you replace them </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> misplaced them or you like forget that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they're in your jean Pockets or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> something </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> um so so the headphones kind of make you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> uncomfortable because they're like put </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> pressure on your head yeah yeah it's the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> same thing for me and the keyboard and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> the wrist though it just hurts my wrist </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if I if I if I have to use that flat </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thing for ages right because your wrist </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is like why why are we doing this also I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like paranoid about getting any </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> wrist injuries or carpal tunnels yes you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> know I want to get well you gain way </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> more than that yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I I'm very cautious about like wrist </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> injuries so I I want the most ergonomic </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> setup once again like those like wrist </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> guard things then but I've seen a couple </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> streams yeah I mean that's that's they </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> normally have that on when it's too late </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and they've already like done I know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> some people who have it on like to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> actually just prevent it I mean if you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> have a good setup you shouldn't need </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> that yeah but you know even people with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> good setups can sometimes you know game </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> a little too hard yeah but like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> headphones like for me it's like I can't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have the in-ear ones because any every </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> single in your headphones for some </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> reason wants to like excavate your ear </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah and get really in there yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> and that hurts the [ __ ] out of my ears </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> oh so I can't use those yeah it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> probably because you don't have like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right size buds right yeah I have one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that comes with a bunch of replaceable </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> ones but even then like airpods are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> unironically are the ones that I like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the most because they don't really go in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> your ear much yeah they kind of like sit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> on top of it that's what I like them </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> most but I don't use apple so I don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have them </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> um and that's why I use it like the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> ovary ones also the sounds way nicer I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> only use the over ear ones if it's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in the winter because it also like keeps </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> my head warm but like in the summer here </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> especially I'm just like nope headphones </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> go away I should always use them yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah I do like I've seen you like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> walking in like the Japanese some with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> headphones on I'm like bro that looks </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> bad that is dedication yeah that's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> dedicated listening that's the Comfort I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> mean you your headphones have taken a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] beating it's like it's like I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> remember seeing it just falling apart </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like falling apart man like holy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what's because it's because I'm waiting </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> for the right now I'm using the Sony WX </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> um 1003 the worst naming system of all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> time yeah yeah what the [ __ ] is going on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sort of string of numbers and letters </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and then like the the next one the fours </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I I there isn't really a significant </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> upgrade yeah and I'm hoping the fives </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> when they ever come out which I don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even know if they will I'm like a decent </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> upgraded I'm kind of in that weird spot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where it's like they're they're like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> broken and they're not working properly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah but but like because they're like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you know 300 headphones yeah I want them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to last like five years yeah of course </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> of course so if I buy the the fours now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and then the fives come out and they're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like the most best upgrades and you can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hear God through them yeah I'm gonna be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> really pissed off that I bought these </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> fours yeah and I just didn't wait a few </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> months actually but I don't know I don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even know if it's coming out I don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> even know they don't even answer </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> anything so I'm just waiting kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hoping you're waiting for something it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> works definitely the one side is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> completely broken so it keeps falling </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> out yeah [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_04> you're the gamer right you talked about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> keyboards all right 144 Hertz monitors </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> all right okay if you if you genuinely </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> think there's no difference </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> is there a point if you don't play FPS </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> because I genuinely like i j because we </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> have we have uh we have them in the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> office I've never used them I notice it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> more with FPS games but like even normal </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> games that that are not like locked to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> 60 look way better in 144. I think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's a problem I only play games that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> are locked to 60. because you're on the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> switch Yeah right if you actually game </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> on your PC 144 Hertz is way it looks way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> better than I don't know I'd rather have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> 144 Hertz than like a more like higher </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> resolution right it's way nicer and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> smoother and it looks good I don't know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> why resolutions milky after like 2K I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can't [ __ ] tell the difference like I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I I I I I I especially barely look any </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> different from 2K to me yeah I feel way </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> more different from 60 to 120 hertz 144 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Hertz yeah because I feel the difference </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with FPS I just don't play FPS you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> so I was just like what other game types </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> would really like really make me feel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the difference because I've already </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> craft any any game where you're you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you're moving around you're controlling </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> a character moving Minecraft's probably </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the only one where I've probably like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> somewhat slightly seen it right you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> might notice it's more fluid it looks </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> good you'll notice when you go back that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like not quite the same it's not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bad it's not like you know if if you you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> haven't got a lot of money right and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're choosing between like a better PC </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> or like a monitor that makes you like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> come instantly yeah just get a better PC </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> get better parts or something yeah right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like it's kind of like the cherry on top </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but there's no point buying a monster PC </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you're then not also going to get a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> good monitor right right because you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you're basically buying like an engine </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with a car that can't fit it like it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like okay well I mean it's a point you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know a lot of people will have like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 3080s and still use 60 FPS monitors and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you've put like rockets on a scooter </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like it's just too much yeah like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> you're overpowering it I don't know I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> mean I game a lot so I guess I yeah I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> mean I mean I I am that guy who has a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 3080 and uh and he's a 60 FPS but like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> that's because it's like a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> monster to render when I'm editing yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that's the only other like yeah yeah if </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> you're not gaming if you're doing I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> definitely use it like that more than </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> the gaming yeah like like I've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> definitely not noticed anything massive </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> massive difference rendering and editing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like that's like I I don't I don't need </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> 60 FPS if you're streaming it's also </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> very good yeah yeah it is uh the Nvidia </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> cards have dedicated video chips that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> are completely separate to the gaming </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah so you can you can game and stream </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> at the same time and it doesn't affect </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> the performance sure but it does a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> little bit no that's because of how </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> other things going on what do you think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about so so do you care about the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> keyboard thonk then like I mean the ASMR </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> yes I do I mean I I like what I have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> right now I maybe I should we don't can </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> remind me to record something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm on the fence right now because I'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> gonna be getting my custom keyboard </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> within like a few months so maybe I'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gonna be like man Conor was right this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> entire time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah yeah because like I remember </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> going on this video and just looking at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> the comment section and I'm just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've seen less horny comments on PornHub </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> comments you know like my God like you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I've I literally feel like everyone is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> coming from like the sound of these keys </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I'm just like yeah that's a nice </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> dining key I guess it's weird because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like it feels like almost like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Play-Doh at first because you're so used </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to the really harsh clicks yeah yeah the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> ones it feels like oh it's really like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> squishy and so wet yeah but then after a </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_02> do you want to be that [ __ ] on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Discord he's like yeah because I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> remember when mechanical keyboards got </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> popularized and that was like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> popular key because it was like it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like everyone bought the 30 uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> mechanical keyboard on Amazon because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> they thought mechanical equaled good </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> when in fact I just can't get over like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you describing like the sound of these </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> keys and you know it just sounds like </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_05> first time this is why we're gonna have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> flying cars they're the ones in this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah yeah I I I I've someone told </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> me on stream yesterday I was like they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are completely unrelated but you said </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ADHD so it came from my mind </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um I was like no no I checked because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Chad was accusing me of having ADHD and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I said no I don't know what I was like I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can like I can focus on things I get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really fixated yeah and they're like you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know focusing too much is a sign of ADHD </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right and I was like what yeah it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> apparently it is yeah so so I was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wait what if I if I concentrate too much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> on things you have ADHD but if I don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> concentrate enough I've had HD2 and I'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like wait wait but then wait hold up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> what is it what does that mean what is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it how does it work it's just I don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know it's like you can't be on too far </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> off the either side of the spectrum yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah because then you have a problem </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because it isn't specify that you can't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> pay attention it's attention </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> who's making these rules up huh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> people who are more informed uh than us </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> you know I was like oh damn these people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> coming up with these these definitions </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> that's crazy it's usually the person </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that says you have ADHD yeah like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> officially how do you test if someone </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> concentrates too much how do you I'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> genuinely curious it's nice to be like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you can't control yourself and you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> realize that oh [ __ ] it's like oh you're </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> gonna question something oh yeah yeah so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you get obsessed it's kind of repeat </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that yeah it is but at the same time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like you can't control it but I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> feel there's a lot of people like in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just this internet age that you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because we're so [ __ ] over sensitized </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and just overwhelmed with all this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] information right all at the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> same time right there are so many people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who are just like oh there's so much </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] [ __ ] to do on the internet do I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have ADHD I'm like no you're just on the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> internet this is also I wonder I'm like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't think like I have a problem I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> think there's just so much [ __ ] that's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> being shoved in my face yeah that's what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it is but that's why like I reckon </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> there's probably I mean like you have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> ADHD how does it feel I mean I got it is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> weird right because the the reason I I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> only like recently got diagnosed with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> ADHD and it was just like the most aha </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> moment of my life like of course I do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know it's like oh that's what that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was because like you know especially </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like growing up in Asian culture mental </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> health and mental conditions are very </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> like it's like literally that Meme image </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> of just don't be sad like yeah yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> cutting the water yeah cutting cutting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the water of like don't be sad don't be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sad so I I remember like because I have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> this like such a vivid memory in school </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right of uh I knew someone in school who </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> got diagnosed with ADHD and they got </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like some like advantage or something in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that in like a test that we were taking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> right I go like extra time or something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then you remember like describing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like what he what his experience of ADHD </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was and I was just like what a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> liar I he he like what a [ __ ] liar I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> do that and he's getting some free time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> on an exam what the [ __ ] and it's just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like it was like was like it just didn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it just for some reason it just never </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] occurred to me that uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> unfortunately I had the same symptoms </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I was raised not not even raised </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> but like a lot of people in my culture </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and the environment I grew up with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um it was just we it was put in our </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> minds that you know mental health just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> wasn't really like it was either like a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> very very serious thing or it just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was just didn't exist and you've just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> got to get on with it there's no such </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thing as a mild symptom yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like you either had it or you don't know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> so what made you think oh I should go </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and see if I have it like what was the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Turning Point what like what so this can </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> be awful </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> um enough comments on trash taste I am </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> actually wait why did you like fidgeting </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> with things huh because you were </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fidgeting with things honestly seeing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> myself on camera I'm just like damn man </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I do that [ __ ] what yeah like hey </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because like obviously I've never been </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on camera and especially with me yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> being on camera documented so much on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> trash taste I'm like damn I do a lot of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> people analyze yeah yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> habits because you're looking at </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> yourself through the third person </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um and then also you know there's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there's always going to be comments that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> are like psychoanalyzing and over </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> analyzing stuff yeah like we'll say some </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> really wild yeah yeah yeah but then like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> what I I saw some comments that are just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like [ __ ] they kind of make sense and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> then they Google it uh Google what they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> say I'm like damn that doesn't look like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's uh that doesn't look like it's just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> someone talking out their ass and then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like the final straw was uh meeting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> someone here who has ADHD and they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> describe their symptoms I'm like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay I need I need to go get diagnosed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right I need to go get checked out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> um and yeah it was thanks to trash taste </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I guess and thanks to random Youtube </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> comments well done guys you uh you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like it's like the one time in the world </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_04> bunch of like Reddit armchair </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> psychologists and Wild Ones yeah yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> it's in Wild diagnosis yeah I do I I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> have as a views of trash </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> that's not an excuse to psychoanalyze </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all of us okay a broken clock is right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> two times you know guys </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I remember my uh my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was growing up they everyone was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> convinced I'd like dyslexia yeah and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like I was like no I don't think I do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> because I don't really have from reading </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the word I just really [ __ ] hate </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> doing it right but because they would </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> describe the symptoms to me as like a uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know when I was like 10 or something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so just give some backstory to this uh I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know I went to a Welsh school I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> didn't like reading I liked gaming I was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> probably my parents my parents probably </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wish that nobody'd ever introduced me to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> gaming yeah but I I I was introduced to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> gaming very very young right yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> talking like four five six I found out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> about video games yeah I became like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> obsessed and I read the games I I mean I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've said this before I beat all of one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> of the first games I ever played with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Pokemon Gold in French and I beat the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> whole game in French I don't know how </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> even though you don't know any french </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah this must have been literally the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> birth of me bashing my head against the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> wall to figure out yeah video games yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> not reading so I've been doing this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> since like a young age not I I never </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> really like read stuff I just kind of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> did it this is probably like sounds very </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like monkey-esque already and not you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> know not very well it's very like a like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> a primeval like yeah it is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so and I went to a Welsh school so I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> didn't really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um read English like ever we learned </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everything in Welsh I spoke in Welsh in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> school so I never read English like ever </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the only thing I'd ever read is like we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> go to the store I can I can read the I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> would just read the [ __ ] right yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whatever like but like like when I would </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> be quizzed on like how to spell [ __ ] I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like wouldn't know they'd be like spell </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> said I'd be like oh yeah just said Zed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in it said </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah so when we started learning English </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> more and I was like yeah I just don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> don't read books ever yeah and they're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like what you didn't read books my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> parents were like yeah we tried to we </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> playing those goddamn video games </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> as much Pro my parents tried their </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> goddamn hardest to get me to read it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just not gonna happen like I was just I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> had absolutely zero interest in it yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so I was so so bad at English but like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> they knew I was very competent all other </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> subjects like I was I was very like you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> know maths and Science and all that </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> must have some uh dyslexia or something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right and they would tell me what the </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> with you as a kid yeah they would like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> try and spoon feed me the answers to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like set to like dyslexia right I would </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like to try and tell me I had symptoms </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that I didn't have until I get you to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> agree to it just because they wanted to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> have like that like so they can tick it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> off it's like oh we've figured it out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah we sort them out and then whenever </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I have an issues they'll be like oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> don't worry we don't have to put him </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> work he's just dyslexic yeah this is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> where you like I get it because the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> teachers they want an answer they want </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to read they want a solution right they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> want to know why and I can understand </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everyone wants a reason why but like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> unfortunately mental health and [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> like that and yeah and and learning is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like the most complicated [ __ ] known to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> men and there is never ever just a one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> solution that fits all yeah like just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because somebody sucks on something it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> doesn't mean there's an inherent problem </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> so I would like talk to my teachers and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> stuff and yeah and I remember talking to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> my English teacher and she like made me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like stay after class and she talked to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> me and she'd be like so you can you can </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> read these words right and I was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah I can read them and she's like they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> don't look like messed up or jumbled at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> all and I was like and I was like no not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> really and then she was like sometimes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the words are hard to read I'm like yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know the word sometimes I don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really know it so it's kind of hard to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> read because English is kind of funny </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and the pronunciation is weird and then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> so she was like okay okay so then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> another teacher came in a few weeks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> later and started asked me more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> questions about dyslexia and stuff and I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was like no no I I the words are not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] jumbled okay I've seen the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> movies they don't [ __ ] do that I know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's not how it works but I'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah I I do not have a problem I can see </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> all the letters in order they do not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> move I know what I'm reading I am just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] at this subject and I don't like it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because they start shaking your body </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like what about now yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it was literally like I had I'm thank </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> God I wasn't like uh I wasn't a kid they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> were just like I feel bad because like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kids are so easily like pushed into </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> saying yes or no yeah I'm so glad I was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a stubborn [ __ ] from like a young age </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where I was like no the words are not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> jumbled I don't have a problem reading </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the word I just just hate this shitty </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> subject yeah I hate English yeah and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> they were like no no no no no you have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> to be you have to be so you have to have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> a disability you must be you must be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah I'm very glad that Iris I don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> know where I got the stubbornness from </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah I was like because I I remember </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like I it was really annoying and they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> kept insisting I had it yeah no no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I do not have this I have no problem </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> reading Of Mice and Men I just don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like it I'd rather watch the movie </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> they're like trying to just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> brainwash you yeah okay so this is what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm realizing and I understand now why </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like you know this whole discussion </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about diagnosing kids is like yeah I get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> why it's like a a touchy subject and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> some parents are like my kids you can't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> diagnose them and then you know some </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people are so quick to jump to it it's a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really uncomfortable subject and kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> touchy because yeah the kids often can't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like I was a kid I couldn't fully </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Express that you know I can't just be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like listen I didn't really connect with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the subject I don't like it yeah they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can't fit for themselves right yeah I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can't really fully explain why I don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> want to why I don't engage with this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah but they you know they're just like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> well they're like no we're the adults we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> know more than you right yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so it's kind of a it's weird man and I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> think that's why like when you get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> parents that are super passionate about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it and stuff and then there's also the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thing of like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> some parents don't want to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> get their kids diagnosed with things </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> because they don't want to like be like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> my kid has a problem or has something </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right my parents didn't really give a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] they were like if he's got it he's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> got it whatever yeah just deal with it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but yeah yeah because I I think with how </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> mental health is now it's just like it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> feels like at least it feels like if </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you're diagnosed with something then </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> then the kind of feeling is oh there's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> something wrong with me obviously yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah you know there's something there's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something broken with me because like uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like with me and ADHD for example like I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't realize that I was abnormal you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> know because I would have I would I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> would do all these things to basically </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> basically be able to like seem like I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was able to function you know and I I'd </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> only learned recently that that was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my coping mechanisms for like my what it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was like my how my brain works you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah I'd figured out ways to live with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um and I thought everyone had to do that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> you know that's that's just what I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> thought and like especially like after </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> being diagnosed it hasn't like changed </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> my life or anything like that it's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the biggest thing that it's done for me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is like it's just helped me understand </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> myself and I think that's just I think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> that's like the most valuable thing yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> right definitely it's just like make </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sense of things that you were like why </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> why am I like yeah yeah exactly because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just helped me like deal with it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> even more because I I just remembered </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because it wasn't it wasn't just the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> YouTube comments as well I remember </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> specifically seeing this one YouTube </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> video and that was that was like the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> last straw where I was like where what </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> am I diagnosed no no where it was like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where it was like what ADHD feels like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and someone like someone like edited a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> video of their day and like edited it in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> a way to like to like show how they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> perceive the world yeah how they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> perceived the world and it was like such </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> a one for one copy of how I see the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> world I was just like oh my God so like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that was like the aha moment because I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> think I think that was one one scene in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> particular because uh he was going about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> his day and uh he was like being scolded </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> uh by his teacher or his mom or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> something and and uh he was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> fidgeting right he was fidgeting and uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and he would get told off for that for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> him because his mom always teacher I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can't remember who was exactly but he </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was just they were just like can you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> concentrate please I'm trying to tell </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you something serious yeah and you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> doing something else and I'm just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and he said oh but it helps me to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> concentrate and I'm just like that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> been my entire life that's been if like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I need to fidget with something in order </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to concentrate and if I don't I just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> lose like my trailer thoughts or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something right it's just like me yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah I was just like holy [ __ ] maybe </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> maybe I should [ __ ] go in and get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> this so how do they because I've always </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> been curious like when you go see a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> doctor right and you want to like you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know figure out if you are actually </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> diagnosed with it how does the doctor </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like check that well is that like a test </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> it just puts like a Ruby's Cube on the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> table he's like I'll be back in 15 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> minutes let's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> put fidget spinner </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> curious like you know how does the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> doctor like kind of determine whether </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you actually have ADHD or if it's just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like something similar to that that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> not necessarily ADHD right yeah I mean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> uh at the moment I'm at like I'm still </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like processing and learning and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> learning through it because at the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> moment at the beginning they uh take you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when they do like this uh this just uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's it's a survey at first so it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like the first test </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> um but then afterwards if you tick </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> enough boxes to be like okay there's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> there's you know there's there's a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> chance then you go into the psychologist </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you know they ask you like a bunch </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of questions for me at least I don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know because like uh another friend in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> England just recently got diagnosed with </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> ADHD as well and I think in England they </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> have a different kind of process yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yes I think it's different to every </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> country uh in England I believe there's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like a you have to go to like a group </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> session as well or something like that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's different in every country but for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> me it was more just a one-on-one talk </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> with uh with my you know with the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> psychology psychologist where they just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> ask me like very detailed questions </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about my experiences how I perceive </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> events and like I can't remember </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everything because there was like a lot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of [ __ ] questions yeah it was kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was basically like a therapy session </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where she's like so so tell me about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this week talking about this tell me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um and yeah I mean uh ever since being </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> diagnosed I've like like I said my life </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hasn't changed that much I just know now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like written in paper that's uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no no I I I got the plaque of just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> his </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how your brain works and here's why you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> your brain does this [ __ ] yeah and like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ever since known that I'm like ah that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> makes sense now I have like a word to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> put to how I felt for a lot of My Life </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> um and yeah that's it like like that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the thing I feel a lot of people uh a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> lot of people maybe have you know maybe </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have different different conditions or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> different mental conditions that they've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just never really thought about because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like Me Maybe you found a way to cope </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with it day to day you know because Like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Me Maybe you thought that hey maybe </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone's like this and you've just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> found a way to live normally because uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because you've grown up uh you've grown </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> up in an environment where you just need </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to like just get on with it basically </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and a lot of a lot of the times like not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> every mental condition is just like on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the extreme end sometimes it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really really subtle yeah but if you've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ever like had a thought that maybe maybe </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I do have this or maybe I do have that I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think it might be worth just talking to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> someone not like not to like have a like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> a life-changing aha moment but just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> learning more about yourself I feel like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is the most valuable thing that someone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> can someone can do yeah and uh doesn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> mean that doesn't mean that there's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> necessarily anything wrong with you you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> know I think people more people would </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> probably go if it was like easier to get </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> seen yeah yeah definitely most </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> definitely right it's like yeah yeah got </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to be either rich or have a lot of time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> on your hands yeah or both or both yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> to get anything done Health Care wise or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> mental health-wise I don't know I know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> in the UK it's not too great I know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they're like yeah trying to get better </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> at it but I know it's not adequate yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> in the UK it's like the waiting list is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> like [ __ ] this [ __ ] like huge yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> no kidding yeah because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um yeah because I feel like the biggest </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> problem especially like everywhere but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> America I can see is like the access to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Mental Health Care is it's difficult to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> sell especially in Asia in Japan dude </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like oh my God it's half the time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> it's just like non-existent yeah yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> mental health in Japan is the easy car </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> there is no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like go to the pub it could be a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> don't think about it I know why you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sad it's because you're not drunk right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> now go to an Izakaya have a couple of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> beers you'll be all right and then it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> just no I was like I I was walking home </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I saw a guy just like on the floor </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just crying in in Tokyo and I was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> why is like no one no one helping him </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like loads of people just walking past </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> him like why is no one saying like hey </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> are you okay this is so weird to me I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> was like what people are just like man I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> wanna don't wanna get involved yeah yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> they don't they don't that's the thing </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_05> they're like well that's not our problem </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we just gotta keep the call we're just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> gonna keep the system moving well the UK </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> isn't great but I think at least where I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was from if someone was like crying in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the street like everyone would be like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> you okay oh yeah yeah I think I'd say </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> most English-speaking countries they'll </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> definitely be at least a couple people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> be like hey you know yeah all right dude </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> what's up yeah at least like someone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> checking on them yeah exactly and you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> know not to say that Japan isn't you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know the [ __ ] Mistress of the world </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in that sense right like there's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> definitely people I've seen people you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> know go up to strangers </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I wanted to help but I was like I don't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> want this to be an awkward language </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> barrier situation where you actually </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> need help and I I'm just like oh hi you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> know yeah I felt so sad about that I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> couldn't do anything to help this dude </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_01> faking it but it's like how are people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> faking it I never see it as like a badge </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of honor in a way yeah what and even and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you know even if you be proud about it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> you can be proud about it and be open </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> about it yeah exactly is it like don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> be a dick about it you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> self-diagnosing so that you can then go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and brag about it online and it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what the [ __ ] yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but people actually have to deal with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this [ __ ] yeah yeah I know right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> actually it's I mean that whole argument </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> comes into like well we couldn't afford </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to go to a doctor and get actual </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> diagnosis and it's like yeah but you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> probably you still should never diagnose </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't think anyone ever would </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> recommend you self-diagnose no no no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> especially you'll be completely wrong </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> especially if something as delicate and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> as complicated as mental health like you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like like I said the mind is a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> complicated thing and people do weird </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] A lot of the times and uh you can </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> you can never know unless you really see </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like an expert you know and then it also </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> sucks as well because then you see an </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> expert maybe the expert was a [ __ ] of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> this job or something you know so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> there's always this like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Minefield yeah yeah like counter </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> arguments have you ever like had a bad </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> experience with like a doctor or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> anything like that yeah I've had doctors </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where I'm like yo this thing is actually </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> like [ __ ] hurting me and then he's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like oh no it's good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like some bad severe pains like no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're good and then another doctor's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> like oh holy [ __ ] man you gotta this is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like you gotta sort this out I've got a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> lot of instances where I go to like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> local doctor like a local GM and they'll </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> be like I'll refer you to a bigger </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Hospital yeah after looking at it for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like two seconds and then you go to the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bigger hospital and they're like oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> here's some drugs you can get anywhere </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like why did the guy at the local GM </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not do that instead of [ __ ] wasting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my time taking me to another bigger </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hospital that's way further away yeah to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> do the exact same job that he could have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> done yeah you know it's only the only </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> one I've had yeah because especially me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like right now I'm like I think my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> biggest 30s like Health thing that I've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I've found so much is like my jaw </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my jaw issue and so I've been like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> trying to get someone I've been trying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to find an expert to help me sort it out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so you know I go to uh I go to the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> dentist to try and like try and find out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what's wrong with my jaw right and so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like I mean I remember the first time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've tried to get it sorted out was uh I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> remember I went to like several dentists </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the UK and uh one of them said oh do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you still have your wisdom teeth and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they were like and I was like yeah I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> still have my wisdom teeth but like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they're not like the spacing in it isn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like it isn't bad or anything it's not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like hurting me or anything like that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they're like yeah we recommend you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> get that uh we recommend you get that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> taken out I was like okay do I that's a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's a big commitment you know yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because you know at the time I was still </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> a YouTuber </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> um so you know talk yeah you can't you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> can't you can't talk you can't talk so I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like I wanted to make sure that I needed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to go through this procedure uh so I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> went to a second dentist for a second </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> opinion and he was like no definitely </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't take your wisdom teeth out that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not the issue </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um here have this mouth guard and I was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like okay he gave me the mouth but I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> didn't like improved it a little bit but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I like the problems still persisted so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> uh uh he K I went back to him and he's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like yeah honestly uh maybe you need uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> braces or something uh that's gonna cost </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like 30 000 pounds or something I was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> okay let's uh if let's let's be sure I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> need to go through this and I guess so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like at this point I'd move to Japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah right and then come to come to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Japan go do the same thing go to the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> dentist and they were like you don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> need to take your wisdom teeth out but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe just take the top wisdom teeth out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just like I'm getting like a dude </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like every dentist I've gone to so far </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> has given me a different opinion about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what needs to be done so I'm like who do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I listen to yeah another one and it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like so you only need to remove half </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> your wisdom teeth just like the top half </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> just like shave it off yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> just shave the tall fall you'll be all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right yeah I'm just lying it's it's so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like I I want to get it fixed but I just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's it's scary because whatever I go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> through it's a big commitment obviously </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in time and cost and it's it's my body I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> want to make sure it's done right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um at the same time everyone know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everyone I say everyone I meet is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> telling me different things so I have I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> have no [ __ ] clue who to listen to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> basically I got like tonsil I just like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I used to get it like every year right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they were like just remove your </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> tonsils and I was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> God because I said they say there's a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> chance it can like affect your voice </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah and I was like I'd rather just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> be sick once a year and that's like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> lot of pain well you haven't had it in a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> while though right no luckily I haven't </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_00> they they just told me there's a chance </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it could change slightly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for me it's just not worth it I was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I'll just be sick every now and then </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_05> specials are yeah but uh yeah we have to </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_05> lot planned for trash taste yeah in the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> coming months if you miss just us I'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> sure there'll be some episodes sprinkled </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in there that are just the three of us </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah definitely yeah I know there's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a good uh a vocal Bunch on the summer </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> love the just us three episodes yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah and I guess they're so used to it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> now so yeah especially it's such like an </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> interesting divide though right because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like you know in my head it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah the [ __ ] guest episodes are like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> awesome because it's like a new person </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> New Perspective yeah whatever new topics </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> to talk about right but then there are a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> lot of people who just like who like you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> who this who this man I think we try to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> make the guest episodes so even if you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> don't know the guest you can kind of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> they can come on right yeah I mean we've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> had what three guest episodes before </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> this one right yeah so you know our </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> guest episodes aren't as personal so I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> understand that people might not enjoy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> them as much if that if that's what they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like most about trash taste yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah it's obviously we can't go into a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> lot about how we feel about things and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> our own life because it's like oh we're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> trying to make sure the vibe is good and </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> gotta start from the scratch again you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know yeah and you're just like not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> motivated at all yeah and that's just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> like it's just a complete like habit </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> killer I don't know I'm kind of picky </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like if the because some hotels are like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> we have a gym yeah and you rock up to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this gym and it is literally like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> treadmill from the 80s that like is is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just so [ __ ] yeah and you're like well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> okay I mean I guess I'll do that and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they got like no weights or anything you </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> just run and then you just like okay and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then you go to the next place and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they're like we have a gym oh gyms </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> closed or something like it's just like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's so hard to like can stay consistent </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> working out when you're traveling and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> stuff that's definitely impossible I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> didn't even try to pretend to try and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> keep up I remember when I was going to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> the gym crazy like when I lost the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> majority of my weight like before I came </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to Japan I was doing it while I was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> going to the conventions and it's so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] hard yeah waking up in the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> morning before a convention and going to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> the gym yeah oh my God it was so hard oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> my God and also bringing your Gym gear </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> with you yeah oh it's a pain in the ass </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> just bring your 75 dumbbells man yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's all you need man that's all you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> need you don't realize right in your </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> suitcase shoes take up a lot of room oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah shoes are a painless and then also </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> shoes get dirty so I want to kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like cover them up yeah just like pain </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> in the ass and you've got to bring gym </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> clothes which you're not gonna wear any </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> other time okay any other time like I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> remember before when I used to travel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I'd be like I'd have to use like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> weight limit to its [ __ ] maximum </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right of course like like you'd have to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> pack as much as you can and if you if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you don't then you could squeeze in more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> there but now like I want to pack as </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> light as possible right and like shoes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are the most like annoying things right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> it's so annoying they're like because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they're light but they take up the most </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> space what the thing is are they light </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> some sometimes shoes aren't like I mean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> if they're packing like boots like yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> you're back in like [ __ ] Doc Martens </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_03> like say wherever you are is raining for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> instance right your socks get wet you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't want to wear those wet socks for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> the rest of the day okay I'm doing my </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> underwear all right okay underwear for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> me if it's a five day trip I'm bringing </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_05> yeah on this video people are like eight </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> nine ten eleven and then like three </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah like one yeah whoa but like eight </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> what is happening are you bringing eight </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> pairs of under what has happened like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> double up right like I'm I'm sorry like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> unless like when you're working out it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a different story right because you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> playing the workout I get it because I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> when I work out I'm running through </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> socks and underwear yeah yeah of course </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm I'm not re-wearing that underwear </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah yeah it starts because she's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like [ __ ] I only got half a day out of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this underwear yeah I [ __ ] wash it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah it kind of sucks you know but like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> if you're if you're just going on a trip </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> why do you need more than five pairs </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> does it make any sense it also depends </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on the climate because if you're going </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to like especially like a Southeast </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Asian country you are sweating through </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that [ __ ] underwear man </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're taking like four showers a day </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah yeah the swamp ass man is just like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's on another level you need you need </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> those extra pairs of underwear man but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> like this is like in America yeah I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> think there's a single place in America </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we need more than five pairs of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> underwear I guess unless you're going on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a five-day trip to like Death </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Valley you know maybe like I just think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> that like you know whatever and I've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> been trying to like you know like I said </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm trying to minimize but also yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah did you ever try and uh do anything </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sneaky with your suitcase to the airport </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you would try to like get past the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> weight limit how so uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> one time I don't know which airport it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was in the the thing where the suitcase </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was yeah there was no other staff to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> this side yeah it was just the person </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there behind the desk yeah and uh I had </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the suitcase just like the suitcase I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> had was kind of like uh the wheels were </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> kind of like not centered not on the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> edge but like kind of sent going towards </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the center so the edge was leaning off </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah and so I'll just do that thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where you just like put your foot and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just like slightly lift it up to like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> get a kilogram or two off and then just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hold it like like some kind of nen user </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah you've got to have the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> conversation while just slightly holding </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it because it was it was going to go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> over yeah I knew it was over because on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> the way there it was over yeah on the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> way back how much was it like five </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> kilograms okay so you're not getting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> away with that so I no I did huh I got </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it down to like it was just 20 kg limit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right yeah it was going to like 24 25. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah who are you flying with mostly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Airlines have 20 kg on one bag limit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> it's another 23 normally 20 I actually </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> depends on the airline </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sometimes yeah something 15 as well okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so I I was like I I need to show you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> five off this bad boy right now and it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was solar cars dude it was so hard </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I'm like I'm like on the desk </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> like this trying to get my documents and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like I'm like my foot is like steel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> right yeah like lifting it up but you've </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> got to keep it even because if it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wobbling they know what you're doing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah yeah but like what I figure like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what are they gonna do they're gonna </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> kick me off the plane if they find out </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm doing it it just reminds me of like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> you know in JoJo where they put the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> chocolate under the water right so I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> changed the level of it while you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> just having a conversation because it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like I've been [ __ ] with you this in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> times you because I had to pay the fee </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on the way back yeah I have any other </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> way of taking it they charged me like 70 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or something yeah the flight was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> 300 yeah I was broke yeah yeah I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> couldn't afford 70. so I was like I'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> gonna do this bro yeah it was like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> JoJo like fight there I was like holding </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> it up with my like left foot yeah on the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> desk doing my passport getting the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ticket it was like no need </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> put it on and when I put it on I just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> kept talking to her yeah it seemed like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> nothing was I wasn't that close to it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> either but like this she because the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> desk was really tall yeah and there was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no one else </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's no one behind me and I'm scared </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that someone would call me out but no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> one did so yeah it all worked nicely so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if there was someone behind you they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> would have just been like damn yeah yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I I if somebody called me yeah I'd have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> been like what is wrong with you yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> let me you are you you want to be [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> over by them too come on but one time I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> will say uh when I was moving to Japan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and I had like three suitcases the woman </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was like my suitcases were like way over </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah because I had like my computer </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> gearing yeah so it was like it was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 10 15 kg over yeah and she just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> looked at me and I was like I must look </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really sad because I was like I was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm moving and she's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> all right I won't tell anyone don't you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> just let it off sometimes I love when </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> they do yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> because like they're so hard so because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like here's the thing like I I've had to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like do similar things but I tried to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> prepare as much as possible yeah before </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I go again so you you weigh it and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you're just like how much how much can </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you like physically bring on a carry-on </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> okay right like you push that to the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Limit because you have you have a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> carry-on and then sometimes you can have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like a bag which is not too big or it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> doesn't look too big you know you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but like you you push the limits about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> how much you can have on a carry-on and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> a personal personal item is that's what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's called right yeah right so you you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> have to spread things as equally as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> possible and I noticed like the magic </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> number is between like 0.5 and 1 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> kilograms right if it's between if it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> over by like less than like one kilogram </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or just like like I've met airlines that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is like if it's exactly one kilogram </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they will charge you but if it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> 0.9 they're just like we'll let it go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> we'll let it go the the the 0.1 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> kilograms makes a big difference I I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that just reminded me of like the time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when I got stranded in Canada right one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> time because I lost my passport right so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know if I've told this story in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> trash days but like like yeah like this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is like five six years ago I went I went </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to uh I went to a con in Montreal and uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and you know I was like hanging out with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a bunch of mates or whatever and then I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was flying back to Australia but I had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to stop buying Toronto first so I was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like Montreal to Toronto and then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Toronto back to Sydney right so then I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> got to Montreal Airport and I was like I </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_00> I've lost my passport let alone overseas </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right yeah which is [ __ ] terrifying </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah I find out later that my friend who </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was with me at the con the entire time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I'd accidentally put my passport in his </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> bag and he had already flown home back </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to like I think he lives in like San </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Jose or something right so he was </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_04> the contents of the bag so it doesn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> check her bag </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> there's like nothing else in the fair </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> was it just the passport in the back uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was my passport and my other like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> vaccine travel documents that I needed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> so basically all everything you needed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> so so everything I needed to travel out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> of Japan </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> so he was like empty aside from like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> front pocket which had like literally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like the one that everything I needed in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my life I'm your proof for existence </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah existence to Japan right and so I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and so we're like trying to like plan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this out to be like can I make this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> flight if I if we like do a frame </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> perfect like frame perfect drop of this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to like [ __ ] DHL right away like and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we're like what's the closest DHL okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so it's it's this place we can go home </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you can you can wake up tomorrow and go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> get it and then I realized unfortunately </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's America and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> um they don't they don't work on the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> weekends yeah so I'm like oh [ __ ] I have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> to wait two days before they can even </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> put the drop off even if even if DHL are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like super on point which they were </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> actually DHL were like very fast </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um I'm still not gonna get it in time so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I have to like uh if I want to go to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> America he's the Strat yeah I have to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like delay I have to like change the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> flight right uh so that was stressful </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> enough not having my passport on me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um so I remember phoning up a a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to be like look I'm I'm in the situation </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> now like I don't know if I don't know if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I qualify for a change of flight because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the thing is like I believe I I bought a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> flexible ticket right right so so I I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wasn't I wasn't I didn't buy one on like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I didn't I didn't buy a ticket on like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> some random [ __ ] website I bought it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> from a a itself right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um and so I thought paying like a bit of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a premium price as opposed to buying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> from like [ __ ] Skyscanner or whatever </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I you know there was a little bit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of wiggle room on that right yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> um because it wasn't a cheap ticket and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like like I don't know why flying to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> America right now is so [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> expensive from like everywhere because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was it was it was like the cheap the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cheapest economy ticket they had and it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was still like [ __ ] like almost like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a grand or like two grand I can't I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> can't [ __ ] remember it's like yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> one way yeah yeah yeah it was on one-way </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> flights they're weirdly expensive return </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> flights are like weirdly more like less </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> experience yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> something to do with how long you're </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> gone on and there's there's different </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> price points based on if you're flying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with the same carrier and how far apart </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're flying so yeah there's some </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> really strange rules for the ticket </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> prices yeah so I I find up a a and I'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like look here's his situation can I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> change my flights uh can I change my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> flight to you know a day a few days </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> after or whatever's whatever's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> convenient and they're like yes there's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a flight on X day uh that's still </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> available I still got seats and I'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> great can I change to that flight um how </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> much how much would it cost would it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cost anything and I remember her like </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> and then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> she pauses and she pauses and she's just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> um hold on can I I need to go see the </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_03> 400 000 years yeah so I was like uh my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> my again my my Japanese must be rusty </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I think I think there's I I must </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have missed that must have been some </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> static yeah because I think like is is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that what it is in Japanese I must have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> added an extra zero in my head because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that is that is not 400 000 Yen I must </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have heard forty thousand yen yeah and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh just misheard so I was like could you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> repeat that please and then they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> repeated that and now I was just like so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> to confirm in English that is 400 000 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Yen right because I'm like it's like I'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like Manny hunger is not Josie enough </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm coping right now mind hunger is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> definitely not josu enough right now I'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just hearing this right oh my God and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um and she was and and then she was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yes it is 400 000 uh Yen and I was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> how is this possible and and and and she </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was like uh I apologize </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um because because it's it's it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's a small change fee and like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> tax is different like I couldn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> understand like no matter what she says </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there is no justification for an </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> increase in four it performs like a flex </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> ticket and somehow it ended up costing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> more than the original ticket yeah yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like you're not you're not you didn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like upgrade to business class right no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> no no like that's that's the kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> prices this was economy and I was just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> like is that 4 000 Yen on top of the two </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like oh no so is that a thousand yeah is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that like 4 000 on top of the ticket </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I just already paid for and she was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like yes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wow so so so it's a five thousand dollar </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one week yeah yeah yeah and and so like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like there is no [ __ ] way this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> makes sense so I go on [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Skyscanner like I I as as they're on the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> call as we're on the call and I'm just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like I can see I can buy a ticket on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> your website for two thousand dollars </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a new ticket for two thousand </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> dollars how does it make sense that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're charging me four thousand dollars </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to change my ticket change it change it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right and she was like I apologize sir </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just that's just how the system </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> works it's the up charge for changing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> the tickets and I'm just like okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> so it's cheaper for me to buy a new </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> ticket even if it's like double the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> price at this point from what I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> originally paid can I get a refund for </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the original picadite for the original </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> ticket I paid </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for the original ticket I paid uh in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> order to get to get the refund back so I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> can buy a new ticket yeah and she was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> like oh yes uh the uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the cancellation fee or free 900 900. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> [Music] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> flexible tickets means you can change it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> you can't refund it some of them let you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> some of them you can change it some of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> them do and I was just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> am I talking to the circus right now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like that's I don't like that I didn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> say that but that's what I wanted to say </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> you're not the clown you want a whole </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> circus </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> oh my God so so my choices are either to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> pay four thousand dollars uh to change </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> my ticket or to to or to to like get 900 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> to pay 900 to cancel with tickets uh and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then buy a two thousand dollar ticket a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> new two thousand dollar ticket and I'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just like I am not doing this like at </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> for the first time in my life I was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can I speak to the manager </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like I like because the thing is I am </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> not the type of guy who goes Karen of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> course I am all the type of guy yeah but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> they were taking the piss I mean I think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> anyone in that situation would go Karen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> mode yeah that's [ __ ] ridiculous yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah like so I asked for the manager and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like it was the reasoning for like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> up charge of that much is because I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> wanted the flights within like if if I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if I had waited I believe like I thought </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I believe like eight days eight or nine </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> days then it would be a lot cheaper </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because there was this like window yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where I wanted to change the flight to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> even though there were flights available </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and the flight tickets which was cheaper </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to buy new changing to that changing to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> within that date range meant that they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> had to up charge the tickets right so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and there was nothing that which still </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> doesn't make sense yes which still </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> doesn't make sense so there was nothing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there was nothing I could do about it I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I talked to the manager I was like look </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> is there anything you can do at all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I like I'm not I'm not lying but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> this is ridiculous yeah you are not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> giving me any way out you you are not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> giving me a solution my solution is I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> pay 900 to pay two thousand dollars </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like like you you're not it's literally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like the enter the lottery to buy the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> tickets yeah yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um so so unfortunately I didn't get a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> solution I lost a thousand I I lost 900 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> uh to cancel my ticket and I flew to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> England for a fraction of the price for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> this headache to go to America Christ </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um so yeah unfortunately </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> um I don't know I don't know what's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> going on with flights to America it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> insane right now yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Flash from the UK to America as well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it's crazy expensive really wow [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah meanwhile flights to from Tokyo to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> London were like it was like one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> thousand dollars for business so what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the [ __ ] going on what's Happening no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one's wanting to go to the UK right I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> think no one wants to go from Tokyo as </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> well oh that's true yeah but okay I got </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because I got to ask now hey just remind </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> me have you guys ever gone full Karen </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> have you guys ever needed to like ask </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for the manager </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm not the kind of person to like go to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> a restaurant and be like wow my soup is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> 20 minutes late yeah yeah but I feel </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like I normally try to like I I when I'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> talking in those situations I'd only try </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to build up some rapport with the person </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm talking to yeah yeah I don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> normally be like yo listen uh you know I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> nothing can be done and I'll be like I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> mean I'll take your word for it yeah yes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like you know I feel there's like if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there is a problem with some kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> service or you know situation there's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> only so much that I know the manager can </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> do anyway so I'm just like don't just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't even bother like yeah I'll just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll fold I don't give a [ __ ] like it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> not it's not a life or death situation </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in that situation I I'd be tempted to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but even then I'm like I'm so lazy that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like all right I guess I also don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> want to cause a scene you know even </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> though I'm perfectly in the right to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cause a scene because I'm the one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> getting [ __ ] over like there's a part </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's a part of me that's just like no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't wanna I don't wanna like be the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] yeah you know so it's like yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know I don't think I've ever no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I never don't have but I mean I don't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> think like I don't know it's weird </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because like if you call the scene </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sometimes you get what you want yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah right because it's like I don't I'd </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just rather not I've I've been in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> situations where you just treat me like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> a human being yeah I've been in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> situations where I've been in like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> restaurant or whatever and I've seen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> someone else cause a scene they get what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> they want yeah I'm just like what an </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] yeah yeah because because the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> thing is like it's it's because I I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> hardly ever go full Karen </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um but I've seen I've seen it work I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> just like I could I I don't have the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> ability to do that myself yes because I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> remember like on this trip back to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> England uh there was this point where we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> were on it we're on a night out uh we're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with all our friends right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um and Sydney was tired and so like I I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> took her home like took her home like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> earlier everyone else went on drinking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and eventually they ended up in a casino </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right yeah uh and so I was like cool I'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not tired yet I'm is it cool if I go out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to you know continue with my mates and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> continue drinking have fun and then I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was like yeah uh Sydney was already </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> passed us I was like cool I'm just gonna </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> go please make noise </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> don't hear anything yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> absolutely and so there was a sizable </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> group </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um inside the casino yeah uh so I get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> there and I want to go in and uh there's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a bouncer at the door uh and he's just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like sorry you can't come in unless you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> remember and I was just like but I know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you've let uh plenty of other people in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because my entire my entire friend group </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is in there yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um and uh my entire my entire friend </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> group is in there and they weren't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> members uh so what's that what's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> happening with that and he was like oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know uh he was like sorry no members </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right now uh uh no entry right now until </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> unless you remember yeah and I was just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like oh I I know like I know he can let </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> me in you know like it's not like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> massive casino and the thing is I see </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> people walking out you know I I see like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> plenty of people walking out and I like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know when you can tell like that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's a bouncer who just wants to go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> on a power trip oh yeah like you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what I mean you know what I mean I like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I knew it wasn't like it wasn't like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> devote like it wasn't like the busiest </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> place in London or whatever it was it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was it was a place that I knew the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bouncer was just trying to be an [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because like I could clearly see there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> are people walking in and out yeah right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and there are people that were going out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and saying that they were leaving and so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I was just like okay what is the right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> angle to go for to try and get myself in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right if you want to see your friends </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah because I really because I'm like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> everyone see my friends uh because the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> night we wasn't even like that late </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> um </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> was it a Saturday or like a Tuesday </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um I believe it was a Sunday oh I can't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> understand maybe if it was Saturday it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> was really busy you know we want to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> limit it to customers then they were </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> going to spend a [ __ ] ton of money yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> it wasn't even like that busy right no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> it was it wasn't even that business </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because because like so I'm like I'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like okay I gotta at least try to get in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right yeah because uh if I don't get in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I gotta I didn't get to say goodbye to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my friends and like my night's over so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm at least like try to get in uh and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> of course I don't go full Karen I go I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> try to go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> so I go I go for the friendly approach </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> you know like start from at the moment </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> right yeah the the Rapport approach </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right the the Rapport approach the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> dieters approach there's nothing wrong </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> with like being like trying to explain </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like yeah you know maybe if there's not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> like a giant line behind you like listen </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I wanna I wanna see my friends </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> calmly explain </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_04> don't want like a big group of like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> strangers coming in or whatever at this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> time of the hour you know I get that you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> know you you're just like you got you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> got some rules that you need to follow </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and everything like that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um look I'll be honest I'm just one guy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not local around here because I've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> literally flown in from Japan just to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hang out with my mates and I don't get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this chance often yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> um and I was I was just I was just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the sympathy approach because I was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I was like dude I'm not here to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like ruin you now spend [ __ ] money </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah you know I I know you just don't </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_02> good I'm a good boy I'm a good boy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah that is very very well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> definitely like like I was trying to be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> as well [ __ ] spoken as possible it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was this was like me me like putting on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like The Tuxedo like it's the way it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> 100 but like but like [ __ ] you know this </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_04> they're not having it because because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the thing is he would not even like even </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> have a conversation like he was like no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I can I can get it because they probably </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> deal with like some really [ __ ] awful </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I I get it I get it at the same time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like sometimes you're like yeah </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_04> by talking YouTube yeah yeah exactly I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was just like look look you know and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> eventually I was just like you know find </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it you know fine I guess you know I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> guess I guess my night's over and then </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> one of my one of my friends comes out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and uh she sees what's going on she's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like what's going on here and I was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they have some rules and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um the balance is just like not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> communicating with me at all I don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think there's any way to get in and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> she's like bet she's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Karen mode actively </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like that was like an instant like 50 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like an instant switch to be like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> um excuse me yeah like do you know that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> he's getting married in a month awesome </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> she's just gonna be a lady do you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who he is yeah yeah he's the anime Zone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> the greatest YouTuber and she goes and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and she's able to just like go on this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> like some somehow yeah I just probably </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> want to get rid of her yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah yeah it's [ __ ] off it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this [ __ ] five minute rant right it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like you know it's it's like you know uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> when it's like Senator Armstrong is just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like standing there and you're like it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just like [ __ ] like pulling the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> punches and he's just it's not punching </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah he's not budging But like after </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about five minutes he's just like fine </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can go in I was just like stop what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that what I I thought I thought being </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like the nice guy would work but just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like [ __ ] like go like just like no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like just going full Karen and just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like hauling from the manager and just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like not letting up that works sometimes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that's but I think that's the thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right it's like I think the reason why I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> don't go Karen mode like ever is because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've been on the other side of that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> before like when I used to work yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah and like oh my God I still </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> remember this [ __ ] to this day but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like it was it was this absolute knob </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> head who like he came in I was working </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when I was working up at the ski Fields </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was working behind a bar some nights </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you know I had to pour like beers </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and [ __ ] and whatever yeah but then of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> course the this this [ __ ] this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] walks in with like 10 of his </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mates right and he was like and he said </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> could you come here for a second yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you love me for a second I was like oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you're talking to me all right yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> whatever that's a bit weird and uh and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then he's like can we get 20 B-52s </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> please </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and to explain what a B-52 is it's this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> liqueur shot that's three layers right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yes and so the layering [ __ ] I don't if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you've ever made layering stuff you've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> got to like slowly pour it at the back </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of a spoon otherwise it mixes right yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> so in other words making one of these </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> takes a long time yeah because you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you want to make it look nice right and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this [ __ ] was like 20 of them </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> please and I was like okay sure I was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the only one at the bar right yeah so I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was like all right I better start </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] slaving away at it then but you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> know because it's you know a restaurant </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right and like a bar I wanted to like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> look nice I'm not just gonna [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> pour it in right yeah I start pouring </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know a couple of them and then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> around like the third one that I'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> making this [ __ ] just walks into the </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_04> that [ __ ] yeah I'll wait but because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because like the part of the reason that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like because I got like slightly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> annoyed at the bouncer wasn't wasn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because of the fact that he wasn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> letting me in but because like he just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> refused to like engage with me yeah so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> because I wouldn't explain it to you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah he just wouldn't explain it to me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> because like I could like I could tell </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> he was just like he he probably had a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bad day or something or I don't [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know but like he was just he just wanted </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> to exert his power upon someone like I I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> could I could feel that energy because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like I've been to like places before </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> where you talk to The Bouncer and they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> explain to you like look look like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's nothing I can do you know like I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't I I don't feel like trying to help </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you yeah I'd be like I get it because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like I'm a human as well but like I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was like he was like nah gotta </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> prioritize our members and I was looking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> around I was like thinking what [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> members it's you and me I was like there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> is no line here there is no line there's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no line of people waiting to come up I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> know for a fact uh because after I went </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the casino was like 90 empty so I was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just like what I was just like you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this is an [ __ ] being an [ __ ] and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> this is like the only thing that could </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> beat an [ __ ] is a Karen and like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Unstoppable forces </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you know those YouTube videos where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> they're like yeah just like bribe your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> way into everything yeah yeah you want </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> an upgrade at a hotel room just slip the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> person 50 bucks yeah I've always thought </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about stuff like that because I'm like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'd love to be able to have the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> slickness and the coolness to pull that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] off but I'm just thinking like how </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> do I how do I discreetly just give you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like 10 pounds in a way that like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> doesn't make me look [ __ ] stupid yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what if you say no to me right and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like oh give me a second just pull </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> out 10 notes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I would have to preemptively give him </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> some money and that point what if no one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> else paid money to get in and I'm the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] who gave him 10 pounds yeah and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> alternatively what if you go to like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that whole I see all those [ __ ] tick </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> tocks just give your hotel checking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> person 50 bucks like it's like okay what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if the hotel should actually fall like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you actually just gave them 50 and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you're a dude I've seen that before </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> though where like I saw a guy at like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> club or like a bar or something yeah who </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like you know did like the whole </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] being like like pulls out at 20 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and like puts it into the you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bounces like pocket yeah and the bouncer </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> looks at it and he's like all right give </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> me a second I'm gonna go talk to the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> manager about it yeah and he goes in he </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> comes out and he's like sorry we're full </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and so and then everyone in the lines </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just starts laughing being like I want </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> to dig in I've seen it work and not work </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah I've seen when it doesn't work </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's hilarious yeah yeah but that's that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to me it's like all right the the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> benefits don't outweigh the the absolute </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> humility of getting rejected yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah trying to for money to someone to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> get into something it's like you not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> only lost money but you also didn't get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> what you wanted yeah yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there's some people who like have their </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I think they have the personality that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> matches up to that kind of behavior oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah I I'm not slick at all I can't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> remember this stuff I can't do that I've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> been with guys who are just like well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> let's uh let's come to a solution and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then they like [ __ ] give the 10. yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like just just say shut up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I've not seen Jen do it but I know Jen </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like like John has the energy that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> he could pull it off no Joanna's the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> energy he can pull it off without ever </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> getting his wallet out yeah he's just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> like let's talk Jen would do it get </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> rejected and then not care that he was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> rejected yeah just be like okay we'll go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> somewhere else yeah but to me it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that's crushing and bad yeah I can't I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> can't do that you tell me it's full I </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_04> are only very few points and some and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like yeah if if the service person is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> being an [ __ ] yes you should be a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> coward even though I still don't have it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in me even if there have been plenty of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> points where I'm like I should go for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Karen you know because there have been </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> plenty of points where they have been </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> the [ __ ] yeah and I'm totally within </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> my rights to go full character but like </SPEAKER_04>
