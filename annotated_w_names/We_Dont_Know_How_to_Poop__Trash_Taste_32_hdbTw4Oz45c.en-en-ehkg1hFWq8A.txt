<connor> - The most ghetto thing that I have </connor>
<connor> is that I'm actually using a bed sheet as a mattress cover. </connor>
<joey> - Wait, what? </joey>
<joey> (jaunty music) </joey>
<joey> How do you stretch that sheet over it? </joey>
<connor> - With a lot like the fucking power of Zeus. </connor>
<connor> I'm like... (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> (groans) </connor>
<connor> I'm, like pulling the red sea back together. </connor>
<connor> It's a zip, it goes all around my mattress. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh, you fucking zipped it around your mattress. </garnt>
<garnt> (soft music) </garnt>
<joey> - What's up, G Fuel enthusiasts. </joey>
<joey> Welcome back to another episode </joey>
<garnt> of the "Trash Taste Podcast." (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - That's what you came up with. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I don't know. - That is it? </connor>
<connor> - That is it. - Okay. </connor>
<connor> - That is it. - He literally just looked </connor>
<garnt> at the nearest thing </garnt>
<garnt> next to him (indistinct). - Yeah, I was like </garnt>
<joey> uh, G Fuel. - Oh my God. </joey>
<garnt> - He's just playing I Spy at this point. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<joey> - All right, welcome back. </joey>
<joey> I'm with the boys as usual, </joey>
<garnt> Connor and Garnt. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yes. - Did you see- </garnt>
<garnt> - I am Steve Hanjobs though. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, Steve Hanjobs, </joey>
<connor> you are, yes. - Bringing back </connor>
<joey> the Steve Hanjobs cosplay. (claps) </joey>
<garnt> - I am so glad that you're </garnt>
<garnt> making that a character. - What is this podcast. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<joey> - I am so glad, I was like- </joey>
<connor> - Every time I wear a turtleneck now- </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, you're Steve Hanjobs. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. - Why do you have </garnt>
<garnt> so many turtlenecks, Garnt? </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause it's fucking cold in Japan, okay? </garnt>
<garnt> - I never saw you wearing turtle necks until this year. </garnt>
<garnt> And suddenly this man's </garnt>
<garnt> got a fucking- - No, no, no, no, no. </garnt>
<garnt> He's always worn turtlenecks. </garnt>
<connor> - No he hasn't. </connor>
<garnt> - Yes he has. - Fuck off. </garnt>
<garnt> - Basically before, because I lived in Thailand, </garnt>
<garnt> so all the only winter clothes I had were turtlenecks. </garnt>
<garnt> And I would just, every time I come to Japan in the winter- </garnt>
<joey> - First time I met Garnt, he was wearing a black turtleneck. </joey>
<connor> - It's like, Garnt during summer, Neanderthal. </connor>
<connor> Garnt during winter, </connor>
<connor> big brain five head. (laughs) </connor>
<connor> I'm wearing the turtleneck mother. </connor>
<joey> - Not gonna lie, I've never looked good in a turtleneck, </joey>
<joey> so I've personally never worn it. </joey>
<joey> And I think Garnt is the only person I know </joey>
<joey> that actually rocks turtleneck. </joey>
<connor> - You have to be kinda skinny though </connor>
<joey> to pull off a turtle neck. </joey>
<joey> - Yes, you need to be skinny, </joey>
<joey> and you also need to have a neck. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> Like a long neck. </joey>
<joey> - Sorry, Ed. </joey>
<garnt> - Big Ed's swearing right now. (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> I just imagined big Ed in a turtle neck. </garnt>
<garnt> It covers his entire face. </garnt>
<garnt> - He'll just look like roll on deodorant. </garnt>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I'm sorry Ed. </connor>
<garnt> I'm sorry we're take cheap shots at you, man. </garnt>
<garnt> You're questionable Ed, but. (chuckles) </garnt>
<garnt> - Remember that was the thing in 2020, the big Ed thing. </garnt>
<garnt> - Big Ed. </garnt>
<joey> - So many good memes. </joey>
<garnt> - That was so good. </garnt>
<garnt> - Can we just all agree that back in 2020, </garnt>
<garnt> which is still when we're filming this by the way, </garnt>
<connor> that My Little Pogchamp was the worst meme of 2020. </connor>
<connor> Can we just agree? </connor>
<connor> I don't know what meme of the year was, </connor>
<connor> but that was the worst. - But it was definitely </connor>
<garnt> not that fucking meme. </garnt>
<joey> I should say that. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know, that meme kind of... </joey>
<joey> One, it came out of nowhere and two, it died so fast. </joey>
<joey> - Well because it was shit, </joey>
<connor> it was shit. - I know. </connor>
<connor> - And I'm so glad that it was animated, </connor>
<joey> so that the poor person who voiced it didn't get fucking </joey>
<joey> obliterated. (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Destroyed, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Can you imagine if that was like a person on TikTok, </joey>
<joey> it'd be like, oh my God, </joey>
<joey> it's the Pogchamp girl. - Oh God. </joey>
<joey> I guarantee there's a number of girls </joey>
<connor> who went on to TikTok and did the whole voice- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah there is. </connor>
<connor> Of course there is. </connor>
<connor> - I'm not gonna look. </connor>
<joey> - Have you had TikTok's of people voicing over your videos? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - So, she went and did </joey>
<joey> a lot of anime character stuff. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - There's loads and they fully dress up in costume. </connor>
<joey> - I've heard people doing that </joey>
<joey> of just me talking like normally. </joey>
<joey> Like they would take a segment of me from like an- </joey>
<garnt> - So, you just get a fandub? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. - That's just a fandub, </joey>
<garnt> extra steps. </garnt>
<joey> - I saw a bunch where someone took really old audio of me </joey>
<garnt> in like an answer me simp </garnt>
<garnt> or where I'm just fucking answering a question normally. </garnt>
<garnt> And they just like voicing over and acting over. </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, I mean there's- </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Content. </garnt>
<garnt> - There's lots of audio clips you could have taken </garnt>
<joey> that's a little more interesting, right? </joey>
<connor> - Do you ever get people impersonating your voice? </connor>
<connor> I get that a lot. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, but that's 'cause you have a distinct voice. </joey>
<connor> - I guess. </connor>
<joey> - I don't exactly have a distinct voice. </joey>
<connor> - There's a few videos out there of people like... </connor>
<joey> I think I mentioned this before on the podcast, right? </joey>
<joey> Where they like go around on discord, pretending to be me. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - And film the reaction. </connor>
<connor> - I don't have crazy fans like you, </connor>
<joey> so no. - Oh fuck. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<garnt> - And what, do they just do the most </garnt>
<garnt> broken English accent? - They're like, </garnt>
<connor> "Hello, I'm Connor." </connor>
<garnt> - Hello, hello. - And then everyone's like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh my God, its Cdawgva." </garnt>
<connor> (Joey laughs) And I'm like what? </connor>
<garnt> I'm like that is not me. </garnt>
<garnt> It doesn't sound like me. </garnt>
<garnt> Why are you believing this man? </garnt>
<garnt> - Hello, I'm Connor. </garnt>
<garnt> - Hello, governor. </garnt>
<joey> - Literally a terrible British accent. </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> It doesn't sound remote- - But with a deep voice. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, just doesn't even sound remotely like me. </joey>
<garnt> It's just British accent, </garnt>
<garnt> deep voice. - Oy, oy, oy, oy, oy, </garnt>
<garnt> what's going on here. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - They'll be like- - This is a Cdawgva video, </garnt>
<connor> this is. </connor>
<connor> Hello there. - Oh my God, </connor>
<garnt> its the real Cdawgva. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Meilyne] Imagine how Micheal feels. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh, yeah, poor Michael. </connor>
<connor> They'll like do... </connor>
<garnt> Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> People will impersonate Sebastian, </garnt>
<garnt> but not like the actual Sebastian. </garnt>
<garnt> They'll impersonate like my Sebastian. </garnt>
<garnt> - The Cdawgva Sebastian. - Yeah, Sebastian. </garnt>
<garnt> - But they'll be like in an American accent. </garnt>
<garnt> Oh how the fuck do I do this, </garnt>
<joey> 'cause I'm so ingrained to do this in British. </joey>
<joey> It'd be like, 'cause you know Sebastian's catchphrase. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - I'm simply one hell </joey>
<joey> of a butler, right? </joey>
<joey> There'll be like, "I'm simply one hell of a butler." </joey>
<joey> (laughing) And it'll be like... </joey>
<connor> And it was awful. 'cause it would sound like half English, </connor>
<connor> half American attempt, and it's like, what? </connor>
<garnt> And then- - That was like layered- </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - That was layered there. - That was hard to do. </garnt>
<garnt> I was like how do I break barrier. </garnt>
<garnt> - That took like 100% of your brain power to do. </garnt>
<garnt> - A British person impersonating an American person, </garnt>
<garnt> impersonating a British person. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - Then I'd be like, I would hear these voices they would do </garnt>
<connor> and I'm like, there's no way they're gonna believe that. </connor>
<connor> And then the moment they do it, they're like, "It's Cdawg. </connor>
<connor> "Oh, my God." (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> And I'm like what? </connor>
<connor> This isn't me. </connor>
<garnt> And then there was someone as well </garnt>
<garnt> who went on voice acting websites trying to be me </garnt>
<garnt> called It's Connor or something. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's Connor. </garnt>
<garnt> - And they would go around making references to my videos. </garnt>
<garnt> Like I fucking reference myself. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> Like I go around being like, oh yes, remember that time </garnt>
<garnt> I was Sebastian, good times. </garnt>
<garnt> Who the fuck references themselves? </garnt>
<garnt> That's something like Tommy Wiseau shit. (chuckles) </garnt>
<garnt> You know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> Who actually does? </garnt>
<garnt> - Like it's the only thing you have. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, it's like I've made it now. </joey>
<joey> I'm done making new stuff. </joey>
<joey> I'm just gonna reference myself until I'm entire... </joey>
<garnt> (indistinct) what? </garnt>
<garnt> Then people are like, "Shit, it's Cdawg." </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> He said the thing, so it must be him. </garnt>
<garnt> - It infuriates me to death, 'cause I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> if this is all it takes to get you to believe this is me </garnt>
<connor> I hope your credit card gets stolen. </connor>
<joey> You deserve it. (laughs) </joey>
<connor> Like you had a it coming if you think that's me. </connor>
<joey> I'm kidding. (laughs) - Yeah, true. </joey>
<joey> No, no seriously. </joey>
<joey> I haven't had people impersonating my voice, </joey>
<joey> but I've had people kind of trying to do it </joey>
<garnt> by just speaking in a shitty Australian accent. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - And sometimes the voice </garnt>
<garnt> is totally not me. </garnt>
<garnt> It's a completely different voice. </garnt>
<joey> But because they're speaking in a semi like- </joey>
<garnt> - [Connor] Right, right. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh, I'm fucking Australian, aye. </connor>
<connor> - It is pretty funny how much room </connor>
<garnt> people are willing to give-for interpretation. </garnt>
<connor> - [Joey] It's so crazy. </connor>
<connor> - I've not seen any TikTok's, </connor>
<garnt> but I've had exactly the same comments </garnt>
<connor> of like some random YouTuber </connor>
<connor> who is reviewing anime clips or something </connor>
<connor> in a slight British accent. </connor>
<connor> - Gigguk. - And they're like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh my God, it's Gigguk. </connor>
<connor> It's fucking Gigguk. (laughing) </connor>
<connor> The thing that annoys me more actually, </connor>
<connor> is not on YouTube or TikTok, but it's on Twitter, </connor>
<connor> where apparently anyone Southeast Asian </connor>
<garnt> who posts a selfie now who's also into anime, </garnt>
<garnt> it's just like, "Oh my God, you look like Gigguk." </garnt>
<joey> You do? </joey>
<joey> - Oh my God, I have so many photos fucking of people, </joey>
<joey> just like random Indian celebrities. </joey>
<garnt> (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<joey> And people are just like, "Yo, I thought that was Joey." </joey>
<garnt> What the fuck? </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> Like I had a guy, my sister even sent me one. </garnt>
<garnt> It was like, she found on TV there was this Bollywood movie </garnt>
<garnt> or I guess some Bollywood show. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right, right, right, right. - That they were promoting </garnt>
<garnt> on an ad or something. </garnt>
<garnt> And apparently one of the dudes just straight up </garnt>
<garnt> apparently looked like me. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm like, he's just a Brown man with a beard. </garnt>
<connor> That doesn't make (indistinct) - That's you. </connor>
<connor> - Apparently every Brown man with a beard is me. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I get that with white dudes. </joey>
<joey> Every white dude with a beard on TikTok, </joey>
<joey> is like, for some reason... </joey>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<connor> They say I looked like Cedar. </connor>
<joey> I'm like, what the fuck, no. </joey>
<connor> Come on. </connor>
<connor> - Is there like any moment where that kind of like, </connor>
<connor> oh, that you look like so-and-so person </connor>
<connor> has been kind of flattering? </connor>
<connor> I've only had one example of that, </connor>
<connor> and that's when people said that I looked like, what was it? </connor>
<joey> A cracked out Jason Momoa. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> It's like, oh, you look like Jason Momoa, </joey>
<connor> if he didn't work out. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - And I was like, yeah, I'll take that. </connor>
<connor> Jason Momoa's a fucking good looking dude. </connor>
<connor> - I think I had like Benedict Cumberbatch once, </connor>
<garnt> but I was like- - You had Benedict Cumberbatch </garnt>
<connor> - Right, right. </connor>
<connor> But I used to have really big curly hair </connor>
<joey> that looked similar to him, </joey>
<joey> so my parents just joked that I was like him. </joey>
<connor> And cool, 'cause I was also like- </connor>
<garnt> - British. - Yeah, British. </garnt>
<garnt> My parents are British too, Joey, </garnt>
<garnt> what do you mean? - Yeah, I know. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh he's British fucking aye. (laughs) </garnt>
<joey> - He's a British man, therefore, </joey>
<joey> he looks like Benedict Cumberbatch. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, fuck it, I was like, no, I don't. </connor>
<connor> I don't look like that fucking armature. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> No, he's nice, he's fun. </connor>
<joey> We like him. </joey>
<joey> We have fun. </joey>
<joey> - Do you have one Garnt? </joey>
<garnt> - I don't know. - Garnt's too distinct. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - Garnt has a very distinct- </garnt>
<connor> - 'Cause nobody really knows anything about Southeast Asia. </connor>
<connor> So, now it's just like we are like the new, </connor>
<connor> just like Japanese or Chinese people </connor>
<connor> right now. (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> 'Cause now there're like Chinese and Japanese culture </connor>
<connor> is been more like, and Koreans have been more- </connor>
<connor> - Pushed out, right? </connor>
<joey> - Globalized. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like all Southeast Asians we'll just sit here </joey>
<joey> in our own corner being like, </joey>
<garnt> well, there's more than one country here as well, guys. </garnt>
<joey> - It's gone from, I can't tell the difference </joey>
<connor> between Japanese, Koreans, and Chinese too. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - I can't tell the difference </connor>
<connor> between Thai, Filipinos. </connor>
<connor> - Malaysians. - Vietnamese. </connor>
<joey> - Vietnamese. - Malaysians. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. (chuckles) </connor>
<connor> - Fuck, I'd feel called out. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - But no, it's not like half the memes on our subreddit, </connor>
<connor> it's just like a different white person with a beard </connor>
<connor> and it's just like, oh my God it's- </connor>
<connor> - He is Connor. </connor>
<garnt> - Its Connor, I thought it was Connor. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's a monkey brain. </garnt>
<garnt> - I got no beard now, actually. </garnt>
<connor> Well, I just shaved it like two days ago. </connor>
<joey> - The amount of memes though of you with baby face </joey>
<joey> is hilarious. - Is it? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - I do look </joey>
<connor> like a 10-year-old without a beard. </connor>
<joey> - Someone fucking posted it on the subreddit </joey>
<joey> this old ass photo of me in a suit. </joey>
<connor> Have you guys seen that one? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah I saw that, that was funny. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I was like, why? </connor>
<connor> - How did they find that, it's on Google? </connor>
<connor> - It's on my Instagram, I think. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, okay. (chuckles) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it's like the second ever photo </connor>
<connor> I put up on Instagram. (laughing) </connor>
<joey> It was six years old or something. </joey>
<connor> - You do look so shad as a baby. </connor>
<joey> - I know. </joey>
<joey> I was like, fuck, how old was I? </joey>
<joey> Like 20, maybe. </joey>
<connor> - You just looked like the kind of kid who was like, </connor>
<joey> get me out of here. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I did, yeah. (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<connor> I regret putting that photo up- </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> It's not a good photo of me. </garnt>
<garnt> - For me, I feel like I haven't changed much </garnt>
<connor> my look apart from... </connor>
<connor> The only thing that's changed is the spikiness </connor>
<connor> of my hair over the years. (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> - You've calm down, you've calm down. </connor>
<connor> - You can tell the Gigguk years by the younger I am, </connor>
<joey> like the more spikes in the hair. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Like there are. </joey>
<joey> You look at some of my first videos </joey>
<garnt> and I look like fucking Sasuke, man. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm wondering, (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> how did you decide on that hair style? </connor>
<joey> 'cause that's a look, right? </joey>
<joey> - Is that hair you've had since we were young or? </joey>
<garnt> - No, I think, I can't remember. </garnt>
<garnt> I just remember... </garnt>
<garnt> Because I have hair that's really easy </garnt>
<connor> to be spiked up, right? </connor>
<connor> - Right. - So, I think ever since </connor>
<garnt> I was young- - What constitutes a hair </garnt>
<joey> that's easy to just spike up? </joey>
<joey> - Like light and- </joey>
<joey> - Oh, okay. </joey>
<joey> - Could you spike up your hair? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, easily. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, because of my hair, if I cut it short, </garnt>
<garnt> I put a bit of water in it </garnt>
<garnt> and it just immediately, naturally, </garnt>
<garnt> it's just like the fucking anime character spike- </garnt>
<joey> - A lot of Asian hair has that too. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause my hair is also quite strawry. </joey>
<joey> So if I put gel in it and it's just up forever </joey>
<joey> - Oh, I don't know. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, no, I get that. </joey>
<connor> (chuckles) </connor>
<connor> Then again, it's like, </connor>
<joey> just because your hair can do that, </joey>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<joey> doesn't mean you have to commit to it, right? </joey>
<connor> - Okay, was it inspired by anime? </connor>
<garnt> - No. No, </garnt>
<connor> it wasn't inspired by anime. - Fuck off. </connor>
<connor> What was it inspired by? </connor>
<connor> - It was inspired by the... </connor>
<garnt> There's only- - Sonic the Hedgehog? (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - There's only so many hairstyles I could pull off </garnt>
<garnt> and I had no idea what the fuck I was doing with my hair. </garnt>
<joey> Therefore, look, it was the hairstyle </joey>
<joey> that took the least amount of effort to do, </joey>
<joey> because all I would- </joey>
<joey> - No, no, no, no. </joey>
<garnt> - That look like a lot of effort. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was not. </garnt>
<garnt> Okay, it wasn't, because, like I said, </garnt>
<garnt> my hairstyle is just naturally spiky. </garnt>
<garnt> So, all I would need to do, just put a bit of water, </garnt>
<garnt> put a bit of gel and just go. </garnt>
<garnt> - And they were like peaks bro. </garnt>
<garnt> It was done. - You had like </garnt>
<garnt> fucking mountains. </garnt>
<garnt> - It naturally went to that shape. </garnt>
<garnt> - Naturally Sonic the Hedgehog. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, Naturally Sonic the Hedgehog. </garnt>
<joey> - I just woke up and I was Sonic. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> What can I say? </joey>
<joey> No, because I remember in some older videos, </joey>
<garnt> your hair is like so... </garnt>
<garnt> It looked like a wig. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - That's how perfect the spike was. </connor>
<connor> I was like, this man could pass off </connor>
<joey> as like a side character "Yuyo." </joey>
<joey> - It was like you'd been watching </joey>
<joey> too many David Bowie concerts. </joey>
<joey> (laughs) And you were like, </joey>
<joey> all right, I like that. </joey>
<connor> I'ma mimic that, basically. </connor>
<connor> That's what it looked like. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I wasn't trying to mimic anything. </connor>
<garnt> I just had no idea what the fuck </garnt>
<joey> I was doing with my hair. - It was like some guy </joey>
<joey> who was trying to bring back the '80s glam rock scene. </joey>
<connor> - Because, it's like whatever the Mr. Anime </connor>
<garnt> you talking about </garnt>
<garnt> that video pop ups- - Oh, my God. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's so funny watching that and seeing Garnt, </garnt>
<joey> with this teenage hair. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. - Which is really, really sad. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - I feel bad but 'cause obviously you're my mate </joey>
<connor> I'm like that's funny. </connor>
<joey> - If you didn't know the context </joey>
<joey> and you just saw the thumbnail, </joey>
<joey> it looks like those angsty fucking video. </joey>
<garnt> (chuckles) </garnt>
<garnt> - It is. </garnt>
<connor> It totally fucking is. </connor>
<connor> - I can't focus 'cause you're fucking hair </connor>
<connor> is like Sonic the Hedgehog where you're talking about- </connor>
<joey> - It's like 60% of the frame. </joey>
<joey> - You're talking about, </joey>
<joey> like argue the most serious thing ever </joey>
<joey> and you've got like this fucking Sonic hair, </joey>
<connor> and (laughing) I can't focus on it. </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause I'm just talking about, </garnt>
<joey> yeah, this guy just like </joey>
<joey> killed his family. - Killed his family. </joey>
<joey> - But bro, that fucking hair though, </joey>
<garnt> that fucking Sonic hair. - Meanwhile this man's hair </garnt>
<joey> has it's own orbit. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> Oh, my God. </garnt>
<joey> - Well yes, welcome to "Trash Taste" where we are- </joey>
<joey> - Trash on each other's haircuts. </joey>
<garnt> - Now we're trashing on each other's haircuts. </garnt>
<joey> - As good mates do. </joey>
<garnt> - That's what we do. - That's what constitutes </garnt>
<garnt> as a mirror. </garnt>
<joey> Can you really call your mate a mate </joey>
<joey> if they don't make fun of you after a haircut? </joey>
<garnt> - Okay, what age did you reach, </garnt>
<connor> where you actually paid attention </connor>
<connor> and gave a shit about what you looked like? </connor>
<joey> 'Cause I was really fucking late. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, same. - 'Cause literally the reason </garnt>
<garnt> I looked like that was because I didn't really give a shit, </garnt>
<garnt> about what I looked like. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right. - Until I got to my first, </garnt>
<garnt> second year of uni. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I was probably about the same. </garnt>
<connor> - Did you ever have any interest in dating </connor>
<connor> when you where in- </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<garnt> - You didn't never wanna date a girl in school? </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, I was on an all boys school. </garnt>
<connor> - I mean, of course I did. (indistinct) </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - I love my boys, but not like that. </connor>
<connor> - It's like, yeah, I invite them to Kiss X Sis </connor>
<joey> but we don't kiss. - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - We don't kiss. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> We'll have a session Kiss X Sis </connor>
<garnt> but I don't care what you look like, it's all right. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I guess maybe it's because </garnt>
<joey> I went to a boys school that, not to say that I didn't </joey>
<connor> hang out with girls. - Man I fucking </connor>
<connor> would have loved to have gone to a boys school, yeah. </connor>
<joey> Even get the pressure of having a fucking, </joey>
<joey> trying to get a girlfriend. - Impress. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, yeah. - And trying to get </joey>
<connor> a girlfriend 'cause everyone else is getting one. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I mean, not to say that I didn't </joey>
<joey> have any interest in dating </joey>
<joey> but it's just like, it wasn't a priority for me. </joey>
<connor> - Bro, I was speed running them in school, man. </connor>
<connor> I never had one that lasted more than two weeks. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - That was school relationships. </garnt>
<garnt> - I had one that lasted three months </garnt>
<joey> and the boys were like, "Damn, you lasted three months?" </joey>
<joey> - No, if you last more than- </joey>
<garnt> - Three months is a long time </garnt>
<connor> in high school. - In high school, </connor>
<joey> it's a long time. </joey>
<joey> - That's a dedicated relationship. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Anything beyond a month </joey>
<garnt> is like, okay, I am dedicated to this. </garnt>
<garnt> They're probably getting married, you know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> - Exactly (chuckles), it's like one step away </garnt>
<garnt> from marriage, right? </garnt>
<joey> We've passed three months, damn. </joey>
<joey> My life's set already after this. </joey>
<connor> - I think I must have started paying attention </connor>
<connor> to how I looked at maybe... </connor>
<joey> Okay, I say how I looked, the hair, basically. </joey>
<joey> Everything else was like, what am I gonna wear, </joey>
<joey> fucking school outfit? </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah. - My mum still bought </joey>
<garnt> all my clothes, so like I was- - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Not gonna lie, I didn't start buying my own clothes </garnt>
<garnt> until I moved out here. </garnt>
<garnt> - So, same. - Same here, same here. </garnt>
<garnt> - My mom was just like, yeah, I got this nice T-shirt. </garnt>
<joey> It was like some shitty $5 T-shirt from Target, </joey>
<joey> and I was like, yeah fuck, I'll wear that. </joey>
<connor> - My mom still buys me clothes and sends them. </connor>
<joey> - Really? - And it sucks that she has </joey>
<connor> fucking better taste than me. </connor>
<joey> - You know what's weird, Aki's mom buys me clothes. </joey>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> But my own mother doesn't anymore. </connor>
<garnt> - I remember us, we did a shoot a week ago, </garnt>
<connor> and I remember Joey had to borrow one of your T-shirts. </connor>
<connor> And just see Joey in one of your T-shirts, </connor>
<connor> I'm just like, this is such a Connor shirt. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - 'Cause it was just like </connor>
<joey> a plain T-shirt- </joey>
<joey> - It's literally that, but a different color. </joey>
<garnt> - It's a plain T-shirt </garnt>
<garnt> in a drab color. - Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I'm just like, (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> man, this just screams Connor, right now. </garnt>
<joey> - It's a color that I would never buy, </joey>
<joey> and it's a color that Connor would definitely buy. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, this is gonna be one of those </joey>
<joey> weird Connor things, right? </joey>
<garnt> - Right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Only like last year have I been open to the idea </garnt>
<joey> with owning shirts that have nothing but plain color. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right. </joey>
<joey> - For some reason, in my head- </joey>
<joey> - Is it because you don't like logos or? </joey>
<joey> - I hated logos and prints, they drove me insane. </joey>
<joey> - Why? - Really? </joey>
<joey> - I don't know, for some reason </joey>
<garnt> it just looked cheap to me and always... </garnt>
<garnt> I mean that it's kinda- </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh no, I get that. - It's kinda like </garnt>
<garnt> it costs me that 'cause normally they're cheaper </garnt>
<connor> these colors. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> No, I get that though. - It depends, </garnt>
<garnt> because some of them can look very tacky. </garnt>
<garnt> And I feel like there's a fine line </garnt>
<garnt> between having a cool print </garnt>
<garnt> and having a cool piece of artwork </garnt>
<garnt> that just looks tacky on a T-shirt. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> It's the whole concept of simple is best, right? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. - Sometimes... </garnt>
<garnt> That's like the whole reason why all of those </garnt>
<joey> high brand shirts and shit like that are so fucking simple. </joey>
<connor> - I think that's what changed my opinion </connor>
<joey> of fashion in general. </joey>
<joey> I have started to be more open to spending </joey>
<joey> a bit more money on clothes. </joey>
<joey> - Right. - 'Cause at the end of the day </joey>
<joey> it's like, all right, I'm wearing this shirt </joey>
<joey> for like how many months? </joey>
<joey> And I'm gonna be on camera as well, especially. </joey>
<joey> So, I wanna wear shirts, I know today I'll see. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> But, I've still got a little bit of the old me left. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. - Obviously, recently, </connor>
<connor> I've been like okay, I'm willing to spend like... </connor>
<joey> Oh, I might spend 80 bucks on T-shirt, </joey>
<joey> which is unthinkable to me through the years. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, yeah. Absolutely. - Because, bear in mind </joey>
<joey> in university, I used to go to Primark, </joey>
<joey> which if you don't know where Primark is in the UK- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I've been to Primark. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah so- - Primark's amazing </garnt>
<connor> by the way. </connor>
<connor> - It's basically- - If you bought shirt </connor>
<garnt> on Primark, I'm gonna fight you on that. </garnt>
<connor> - Well, I don't wanna question </connor>
<garnt> how they make their shirts so damn cheap. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm sure there's some ethical question. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> I remember, I specifically bought eight T-shirts </garnt>
<garnt> for 10 pounds, </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<joey> which is like $15. </joey>
<joey> - It's amazing. </joey>
<joey> - And I fucking love these shirts, </joey>
<joey> 'cause they were all plain. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Nothing on them. </joey>
<joey> And I wore them for like two years straight, these shirts. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, I- </joey>
<connor> - They were fucked by the end of it, right? </connor>
<garnt> - For real though, Primark is like one of the best </garnt>
<connor> low budget clothing brands I've ever seen globally. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, true, true. - Honestly the shit </connor>
<garnt> you can get for the price at Primark, </garnt>
<connor> which I don't know where Primark's available </connor>
<connor> internationally, 'cause i know- </connor>
<connor> - Its in Europe, I think. </connor>
<connor> - Is it in Europe? - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it's like, if you wanna budget place </connor>
<garnt> where you can just buy cheap clothes </garnt>
<garnt> that don't really don't look cheap. </garnt>
<garnt> You know what I mean? </garnt>
<connor> - 'Cause people said, Uniqlo here is cheap. </connor>
<garnt> And we have Uniqlo in the UK. </garnt>
<connor> - It's not cheap. </connor>
<joey> - Uniqlo compared to Primark is very cheap. </joey>
<connor> - Uniqlo is cheap for the quality that you get. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You'll pay a little bit extra for a T-shirt at Uniqlo, </connor>
<joey> but that shit is gonna last you like 10 plus years. </joey>
<connor> - I bought a whole suit from Primark for like $40, </connor>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> that I wore to- - 30 pounds? </garnt>
<garnt> The 30 pound set, yeah? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - Yeah, I did exactly the same </garnt>
<garnt> for my prom and everything. </garnt>
<connor> - My graduation I wore a $40 suit and actually, </connor>
<connor> I hate to say it, but it doesn't look that bad. </connor>
<connor> It's not bad. </connor>
<garnt> - It's not bad, that's the thing. </garnt>
<garnt> Primark basically, carried my university years. </garnt>
<garnt> You know what I mean? </garnt>
<connor> - But, there's a big but. </connor>
<connor> And a lot of people in the UK </connor>
<connor> tend to also have the same mindset, I think, </connor>
<garnt> where a T-shirt should never cost more than 20, 30 pounds- </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, Yeah, yeah. - Which I can understand, </garnt>
<garnt> because if you haven't got a lot of money, </garnt>
<garnt> spending that much on one T-shirt is it's quite a lot, </garnt>
<garnt> it's quite a lot. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. - But, as I started to... </connor>
<connor> I think that's where my hatred of prints started. </connor>
<joey> Is that I thought a lot of these Primark ones </joey>
<joey> are pretty fucking shit. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. - And they often </connor>
<joey> do look super tacky. </joey>
<connor> And I don't really like the collaborations. </connor>
<garnt> They have like SpongeBob and shit. </garnt>
<connor> And then they like, oh, we stuck a PlayStation logo on it. </connor>
<connor> - I think they're just starting to do anime, as well. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, they are. - Which is weird. </connor>
<garnt> I feel like, was it last year where they did </garnt>
<garnt> like a DBZ a one piece collaboration, as well? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, there's been a lot of stores like that </joey>
<joey> Like Forever 21, as well, before they went under, </joey>
<connor> they did this huge fucking thing with anime. </connor>
<connor> So every time I went to Forever 21, </connor>
<connor> there was always this entire section of anime. </connor>
<connor> But when you look at it, when you actually go over to it, </connor>
<connor> you're just like, all right, let's see what they have. </connor>
<connor> It's all like Sailor Moon, Dragon Ball Z, Naruto. </connor>
<connor> - It's always the fucking basics. </connor>
<connor> - It's all the basic shit. - And I'm like, </connor>
<connor> don't give me that. </connor>
<connor> I don't want- - And it's not even done </connor>
<connor> in a creative way either. </connor>
<connor> It's just like, let's just slap the logo </connor>
<joey> and the main character, boom! </joey>
<garnt> - Doing anime clothes is really hard. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm probably gonna about to call out </garnt>
<garnt> a bunch of our viewers by saying this, </garnt>
<connor> but the ones I hate the most are the ones </connor>
<connor> where it's just a T-shirt with a waifu on it. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, yeah. - You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> - Or the anime logo. </connor>
<connor> - Or like a anime logo. </connor>
<connor> Those kinds of clothes I call anime convention clothes. </connor>
<garnt> 'Cause it's a T-shirt or clothes that I would only wear </garnt>
<joey> to an anime convention, </joey>
<joey> but there's no way I would wear it </joey>
<garnt> (indistinct)- - You know what I call </garnt>
<joey> clothes like that? </joey>
<garnt> - What? - Pajamas. </garnt>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> This is the only time I'm fucking wearing it. </joey>
<joey> Is when I need to wear something in bed. </joey>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - But there's probably someone watching this right now </garnt>
<connor> in like a fucking Asuna T-shirt, </connor>
<connor> they'd be like, aw. </connor>
<connor> - But I like this. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> And then I think as well, </connor>
<garnt> going back to the whole cheap versus expensive stuff </garnt>
<garnt> for clothes, like it's only... </garnt>
<connor> I think 'cause I moved to Japan, I actually started seeing </connor>
<connor> some of the clothes that I really like </connor>
<connor> and it's kind of expensive. </connor>
<connor> But you're like, okay, I am gonna wear this a lot. </connor>
<joey> Like when I paid 350 bucks, fuck, for that Diavolo... </joey>
<joey> Sorry, King Crimson jacket. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - When I bought that, </joey>
<joey> that was the most expensive thing I'd ever bought, </joey>
<connor> clothes wise. </connor>
<connor> And I thought, oh my God, this is insane, but- </connor>
<connor> - This peak. (laughs) </connor>
<joey> - This is insane, $350 on a fucking jacket. </joey>
<joey> Okay, it's sexy, look on screen it's sexy. </joey>
<joey> - But now that I've been wearing it, </joey>
<joey> I wear it pretty much every day. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - I'm like, okay, </joey>
<joey> if I'm wearing it every day </joey>
<garnt> and I get maybe four or five years out of that, </garnt>
<garnt> that's like 20- - You're getting bang </garnt>
<garnt> for your buck, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - You know what I mean. - Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<joey> - And I understand that, </joey>
<joey> 'cause I always felt that way with tech, right? </joey>
<joey> Like to me it's like, don't buy a $20 headset, </joey>
<joey> buy a $100, at least, </joey>
<connor> 'cause you're gonna get your money's worth. </connor>
<connor> And I don't know why for some reason took me so long </connor>
<connor> to have that with fashion. </connor>
<connor> And I think going back to the whole topic, which is school </connor>
<connor> and why I didn't give a fuck, </connor>
<garnt> is 'cause I just didn't care for clothes. </garnt>
<garnt> I didn't really understand fashion at all. </garnt>
<garnt> - I just look like- - I mean, who does? </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean high school. </garnt>
<garnt> - There was always that one kid in your school, </garnt>
<connor> who somehow always fucking dressed amazing to shit. </connor>
<connor> Did you all have that kid? </connor>
<connor> - I didn't have that kid. </connor>
<garnt> - I did not have that kid. </garnt>
<garnt> I always, I don't know, </garnt>
<garnt> I had kind of a similar view of fashion, </garnt>
<garnt> which is just I didn't get it. </garnt>
<joey> - No I didn't get it. - I didn't understand anyone </joey>
<garnt> who would spend above like, yeah $20 </garnt>
<garnt> or like $30 on a T-shirt. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I think my mum would scoff </connor>
<connor> if an outfit was over a total $50. </connor>
<joey> She'd be like, (Joey laughs) </joey>
<connor> "Get a load of this scam." - Yeah. (chuckles) </connor>
<joey> - I think that's the thing though. </joey>
<connor> At least with me, there was this like, </connor>
<connor> because it was a boys school, </connor>
<garnt> but there was this whole, I guess stigma of- </garnt>
<garnt> - People who dress well. - Oh, if you dress well </garnt>
<connor> then your gay. (laughs) - Right. </connor>
<garnt> - Like that whole shit. - Right, right. </garnt>
<garnt> - So I think people just... </garnt>
<garnt> I'm sure there were boys who actually did give a shit </garnt>
<garnt> about fashion and didn't- - And didn't want it. </garnt>
<garnt> - But they didn't want to </garnt>
<garnt> because they were probably worried about getting beaten up </garnt>
<garnt> and I get that. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, yes, a fedora might seem quite fashionable, </garnt>
<garnt> in the common eye but why would you wear that </garnt>
<connor> if you don't wanna get bullied? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, true. </connor>
<connor> - I like wearing fedoras. </connor>
<joey> I think they look fucking cool with the right outfit. </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> But the problem is a lot of- </joey>
<garnt> - I'ma agree with Joey here. </garnt>
<joey> Really? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I feel like the big problem with fedoras </garnt>
<garnt> is that the fucking neck beard community just ruined, </garnt>
<garnt> completely ruined their image. </garnt>
<garnt> - This is like the Hitler mustache. </garnt>
<joey> You can't wear it because Hitler's ruined it. </joey>
<joey> - Well, exactly. </joey>
<joey> - It's the same thing with the fedora, you can't do it, </joey>
<joey> 'cause everyone's like incel </joey>
<connor> if they see you wearing it. - That's the thing. </connor>
<connor> That's the thing. </connor>
<connor> But that's the problem. </connor>
<joey> I feel that a lot of the reasons why fedora </joey>
<joey> is just commonly seen as that type of negative thing </joey>
<connor> is because the hat itself is fine. </connor>
<connor> It's what you pair it with that just makes it look </connor>
<joey> like absolutely dog shit. </joey>
<connor> - Well, you're either gonna look like a neck beard </connor>
<connor> or you're gonna look like a rip off Michael Jackson. </connor>
<joey> There's no in between. - Right. </joey>
<joey> - I'd rather look like a ripoff Michael Jackson </joey>
<joey> than a fucking neck beard, right? </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> But I've seen- </joey>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - Then you can truly enjoy your lonely life (indistinct). </connor>
<connor> I'm out. </connor>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - I've seen fashion magazines of dudes who wear a fedora </joey>
<connor> or a hat of some kind that's similar to a fedora </connor>
<connor> in a really nice suit. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - And they can match </connor>
<connor> that shit really well- - Yeah, but those are the most </connor>
<connor> fucking attractive men on the planet. </connor>
<joey> - But that's what I'm saying, right? </joey>
<joey> And that's the other problem, </joey>
<joey> is that there are no attractive men who wear fedoras. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> I'm just saying. </garnt>
<joey> I'm just preaching to the choir right now. </joey>
<joey> But you know that's true. </joey>
<garnt> - I'm not gonna lie and pretend I know how fashion works, </garnt>
<joey> you know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> But- - I'm no fucking fashionista. </joey>
<garnt> - We're not fashion experts here. </garnt>
<connor> - Thailand next top model. </connor>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Fucking Steve Hanjobs is like, </joey>
<joey> let me teach you about fashion. </joey>
<connor> - I feel like having that one kid in school, </connor>
<garnt> who elevated the game really fucking- </garnt>
<garnt> - Elevated the game. - He elevated the game </garnt>
<garnt> in school. - He was the bench mark. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> He was the trend bro- </garnt>
<connor> - He's really make me look fucking bad. </connor>
<connor> When he turns up with his jeans with holes in them, </connor>
<joey> I'm like, how can we compete? </joey>
<joey> I don't have holes in my jeans. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, wait, because- - What am I supposed to do? </connor>
<joey> - Wait, because you guys didn't wear school uniforms? </joey>
<connor> - No we did. </connor>
<joey> - We wore school uniforms. </joey>
<joey> - And we had some days where you would pay for charity. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - You would pay like a pound </joey>
<joey> to dress in normal clothes. </joey>
<connor> Why do we do that? - Right. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't know. (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> So yeah, we have this thing </garnt>
<garnt> in UK schools- - You had that as well right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, called own clothes day. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, that's it. - Right, own clothes day. </garnt>
<garnt> Where we have one day in the term or something, </garnt>
<joey> where we could just come in in our own clothes. </joey>
<joey> - I hated- - And we had to pay a pound. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, we had that. </joey>
<joey> - I was speaking to Sydney and apparently </joey>
<garnt> in her high school, they didn't have school uniform. </garnt>
<joey> - No. - Yeah, they just- </joey>
<connor> - 'Cause American high schools don't wear uniforms. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - School uniforms are big brain, </connor>
<joey> because you always wear the same shit every day. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Right, it's great. - You don't have to worry </joey>
<garnt> about like, oh, I wore the same T-shirt for three days </garnt>
<joey> in a row. </joey>
<garnt> Because, yeah. - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - That's a big reason why I didn't give a shit </joey>
<joey> about fashion until later in life. </joey>
<joey> Was just because most days of the year, </joey>
<joey> I was wearing a fucking school uniform. </joey>
<garnt> - You know what I mean? - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - Although I say that, the fashion... </joey>
<joey> Whoever designed my school uniform </joey>
<garnt> deserves a slap because... </garnt>
<connor> (Connor laughs) </connor>
<connor> Okay, so in our high school there's a set piece </connor>
<connor> that you have to wear from when you're seventh grade </connor>
<connor> to 10th grade. </connor>
<connor> And then when you enter 11th and 12th grade, </connor>
<connor> you're like senior. </connor>
<connor> So you get to wear a senior blazer and long pants </connor>
<garnt> and shit like that. </garnt>
<garnt> The senior uniform is fine. </garnt>
<garnt> It looks dope as fuck. </garnt>
<garnt> It's basically just a suit, </garnt>
<garnt> essentially. - Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - But the junior uniform is a little, </garnt>
<connor> because for one, everyone has to wear shorts. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Okay. </connor>
<connor> - Because, it's hot most of the year in Australia, </connor>
<joey> so you wear shorts. </joey>
<joey> But then on top of that, you have to wear long socks. </joey>
<connor> - Okay. - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> I'm talking like up to the fucking knee long socks. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like anime girl long socks, right? </garnt>
<connor> - Like anime girl longs, </connor>
<connor> these gray knitted long socks. </connor>
<connor> - Someone had a fetish. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, someone had a fetish. </connor>
<connor> So, basically there's just these seventh to 10th grade kids </connor>
<connor> running around with basically just only showing </connor>
<joey> their fucking knee. </joey>
<connor> - Was your school run by Herbert the pervert </connor>
<joey> or something? - I don't know. </joey>
<connor> I mean... </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm not gonna get into that. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> But yeah, so I fucking hated that. </garnt>
<joey> And, of course, because I went to a private school, </joey>
<connor> if you didn't wear your thing properly, </connor>
<connor> you get a fucking punishment. </connor>
<joey> So it was like you just- </joey>
<joey> - Look at this private school boy. </joey>
<joey> - It's like, oh, I can see your shins. </joey>
<connor> You're gonna get a fucking slap for that. </connor>
<connor> You pull your socks up. </connor>
<connor> Was like, yeah. </connor>

<connor> That's joinhoney.com/trashtaste. </connor>
<connor> - Back to the episode. </connor>
<garnt> (whooshing) </garnt>
<garnt> So in British schools it goes, secondary school... </garnt>
<connor> No, primary school, then secondary school, </connor>
<connor> then sixth form, right? - Which is part of </connor>
<connor> secondary school normally - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> Kind of, kind of. </connor>
<joey> So like our high school is secondary school </joey>
<joey> and sixth form put together. </joey>
<joey> That's like the same- </joey>
<joey> - Why does it skip from two to six? </joey>
<connor> - No, no, okay so, it's called secondary school, </connor>
<connor> 'cause it's the second school that you go to. </connor>
<connor> - Right. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And then you start at age 12 and then you can... </connor>
<connor> Oh, it's mandatory now, right? </connor>
<connor> You have to do sixth form now, right? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - So it used to be, you could leave at 16 </garnt>
<connor> and you could go and work or you can get an apprenticeship. </connor>
<connor> And then there's always an optional, </connor>
<connor> if you want to go to university, </connor>
<connor> you have to stay an extra two years. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. - Which normally has about, </connor>
<connor> at least in my school half the kids left at 16. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, so in Australia that would be junior high </joey>
<connor> and senior high. </connor>
<connor> - Right. - Okay, okay. </connor>
<connor> - So it's like we have high school... </connor>
<connor> So, we have primary school and high school, as well. </connor>
<joey> And high school's from seventh grade to 12th grade. </joey>
<connor> - Seventh grade when you're like age 12, 14? </connor>
<joey> - 13. - 13? </joey>
<connor> Okay, okay, okay. </connor>
<connor> - And then you can leave at year 10, </connor>
<connor> which is like I guess the end of secondary for you guys. </connor>
<connor> - Yes. - And then the last two years </connor>
<joey> is senior high school. </joey>
<connor> - And that's like 16 to 18? </connor>
<joey> - And that's 16 to 18 then you go to uni. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, so that's what it's like in the UK. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Okay, okay, okay, okay. </joey>
<joey> I get it. </joey>
<joey> - And when I was in sixth form, </joey>
<connor> so I was in my last two years, </connor>
<connor> they tried to introduce the school blazers, </connor>
<connor> 'cause we didn't wear blazers. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, we had blazers. </joey>
<connor> - But we were a public school, </connor>
<joey> so blazers were like, get a load of these (indistinct). </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> And there was outrage because they were like, </connor>
<connor> because, right. </connor>
<connor> Here's the thing, the school uniform, </connor>
<joey> you can only buy from a special place, right? </joey>
<joey> You can just get it on Amazon. </joey>
<joey> - Right, right, right. </joey>
<joey> - And they were charging 70 pounds for the blazer. </joey>
<connor> - [Joey] Right. - And obviously </connor>
<connor> this is a public school and 70 pound's like 100 bucks. </connor>
<joey> And for some parents it's like way too much. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. - So, they were like, </joey>
<joey> "What the fuck? </joey>
<joey> "No, we don't want a fucking blazer." </joey>
<joey> And there was a whole outrage about it. </joey>
<joey> And then eventually they were like, fine, fine. </joey>
<connor> Okay, because the older kids are leaving, </connor>
<connor> they don't need to wear blazers. </connor>
<connor> So, I didn't have to wear one. </connor>
<connor> So, it's very fun watching- - So wait, </connor>
<joey> it wasn't mandatory for you guys? </joey>
<joey> - It was mandatory. - So what was </joey>
<connor> your school uniform? </connor>
<connor> - It was just a tie- </connor>
<connor> - So in England, we call sixth form college as well. </connor>
<joey> Which gets a bit confusing when- </joey>
<joey> - Oh really, that's weird. </joey>
<garnt> - When we say college, we mean sixth form most of the time. </garnt>
<garnt> - But you can go to college? </garnt>
<garnt> - You can go to actual college. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, where college isn't college. </garnt>
<garnt> College in the UK is one or two years, right? </garnt>
<connor> Of a specialized thing that you can then use </connor>
<connor> to then go in the University. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh, we call that something different. </garnt>
<connor> - No, we have that college. </connor>
<garnt> That's college. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, but we have sixth form college </garnt>
<garnt> and then we have whatever preschool university. </garnt>
<connor> Is that called college, as well? </connor>
<connor> - I believe those two are the same institutions, </connor>
<connor> if I'm correct, or someone could (indistinct). </connor>
<joey> - Because in Australia, we don't even call it college. </joey>
<joey> We don't use that word. </joey>
<connor> - Well, what college is... </connor>
<connor> That's why when an American say, </connor>
<joey> "Are your going to college?" </joey>
<joey> No, no, no. </joey>
<garnt> We're going to university. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) - Yeah, we go to uni. </garnt>
<joey> - It's like the Winnie Poo meme where it's like, </joey>
<connor> college, university. - College, university. </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Because college is something entirely different </garnt>
<garnt> to British people. - Yeah, yeah. It is. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, anyway they were outraged. </garnt>
<garnt> So, half the school didn't have to fucking wear blazers </garnt>
<garnt> and half the young kids did. </garnt>
<joey> - Right, right, right. - So, that was fun. </joey>
<garnt> And you could just be like, </garnt>
<garnt> look at this fucking little 10-year-old </garnt>
<connor> wearing his little blazer. </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - No, we fucking loved the blazer. </joey>
<connor> The blazer was the bit. - I don't wanna wear a blazer. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause you weren't supposed to, </connor>
<connor> but the teachers got so fucking done with it </connor>
<garnt> that you can just wear hoodies of your school uniform. </garnt>
<garnt> - Really. - Oh, really? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. - Man, they must have like, </garnt>
<garnt> where are the rules in this school, man? </garnt>
<garnt> - For us in the winter, if it was just a regular </garnt>
<connor> white T-shirt underneath, it'd be way too fucking cold. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - So, sometimes you'd have </connor>
<garnt> to wear the blazer just to stay warm. </garnt>
<garnt> Because the other option we had was this like... </garnt>
<joey> Our school colors were black and red. </joey>
<joey> So, we had this- </joey>
<connor> - What are you, fucking like the evil school in Hogwarts? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, right? </joey>
<joey> So, it was black and red. </joey>
<joey> So we had this like, if you didn't wanna wear a blazer, </joey>
<joey> you had to wear this fucking bright red, white, </joey>
<joey> like woolen fucking sweater. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, we had something like that, but it was green, </connor>
<garnt> like moss green. - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - But like- - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> I know the exact color. </joey>
<joey> - But ours was bright red, </joey>
<garnt> like the reddest red you can think of. </garnt>
<joey> So you just fucking stick out in a crowd, right? </joey>
<garnt> - But at least you had pretty colors. </garnt>
<garnt> Ours was drab purple. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, but the problem was is that, </joey>
<joey> because it was like a wool thing, it was so fucking itchy. </joey>
<joey> It doesn't matter how many times you wash that shit. </joey>
<joey> You're just like, fuck, I'm warm, but, ow! </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> Fuck this! </joey>
<joey> So, people were just like, fuck it. </joey>
<joey> I'm just gonna spend the 100 bucks on the blazer, </joey>
<joey> 'cause I don't wanna wear this itchy ass </joey>
<joey> fucking like grandma's sweater shit. </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<garnt> - 'Cause I remember in my sixth form, </garnt>
<garnt> I knew I was a fucking grown up in my sixth form. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yes. (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - All right Garnt, all right. </garnt>
<garnt> - We went to the coolest sixth form, </garnt>
<garnt> because they let us wear our own clothes. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, wow. - Ooh la la. </garnt>
<garnt> - This was the big thing. </garnt>
<connor> We were allowed to call our teachers by their first name. </connor>
<connor> - Oh! - And that was like </connor>
<garnt> bringing you up to the next level, man. </garnt>
<joey> - Dude, we could only do that, </joey>
<garnt> but It was a fucking Kaigi gamble every time, right? </garnt>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> It was like, fuck, do I call you Mr. Smith </garnt>
<connor> or do I just call you James? </connor>
<connor> - Yes I remember one student did that in my class, </connor>
<joey> and he immediately like, "What the fuck did you call me?" </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> He basically said that- - I've heard that </joey>
<connor> so many times. (laughs) </connor>
<joey> It's basically towards the female teachers. </joey>
<joey> It's like, excuse me, Margaret. </joey>
<joey> And she's just like, what the fuck did you just call me? </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Holy shit. </connor>
<connor> Bro, I remember.... </connor>
<connor> I'm sorry, I just had this flashback to something. </connor>
<connor> - Okay. - I remember I did like... </connor>
<connor> So we had to do a presentation during... </connor>
<connor> Do you have registration in Australia? </connor>
<connor> - For what? </connor>
<joey> - Where you basically, when you get to school, </joey>
<joey> you'd had a separate class for registration </joey>
<joey> to say that you're here </joey>
<joey> and you've arrived in school. - Oh, like orientation, </joey>
<joey> stuff like that? </joey>
<joey> - I guess yeah, orientation for maybe Americans. </joey>
<connor> It's like a quick 15 minute thing </connor>
<joey> where everyone just goes and says </joey>
<connor> oh, I'm here. - Oh, yeah. </connor>
<joey> Oh fuck, I forgot what that was called. </joey>
<connor> It was called like... </connor>
<connor> - Is that registration? </connor>
<connor> - That's what we called it in my school. </connor>
<connor> - Home class? </connor>
<connor> - We had a (indistinct) for it. </connor>
<connor> - Right, right. </connor>
<connor> - Homeroom, that's it. </connor>
<joey> That's what it called it. - Homeroom? That's American. </joey>
<joey> Fuck Joey. - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> No, we called it homeroom, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - At my school, we just call it registration in English, </connor>
<connor> but we had word for it that I forgot. </connor>
<garnt> - Right. - So I don't fucking know. </garnt>
<garnt> But we just do like a short presentation. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] What? </garnt>
<garnt> - Between like... </garnt>
<garnt> It would always be one of the student's presentation </garnt>
<joey> each day. - Why would you have </joey>
<joey> to do a presentation? </joey>
<joey> On what? - Just about saying </joey>
<joey> you fucking learned. </joey>
<joey> It was just some (indistinct) pretentious bullshit. </joey>
<joey> - What is that, at the start of the day? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, you have to do a quick presentation, </joey>
<garnt> about something you've learned that day. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, my God, that sounds awful. </garnt>
<garnt> (chuckles) </garnt>
<garnt> - I was like 14, right? </garnt>
<garnt> And we all fucking hated it. </garnt>
<garnt> And this teacher was horrible. </garnt>
<connor> So my best mate in school </connor>
<connor> had a really bad stuttering problem. </connor>
<connor> He got a lot better now, but everyone loved this guy, </connor>
<connor> 'cause everyone just wanted to see him do well. </connor>
<connor> And this one teacher was so fucking rude to him, </connor>
<connor> about his stutter, and everyone was like, </connor>
<garnt> yo, all my homies hate that teacher. </garnt>
<garnt> So, we were all just like... </garnt>
<garnt> We all took it in turns trying to see how much </garnt>
<garnt> we could troll in these presentations. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - I did a pro gamer move. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> you know what I'm gonna present, </garnt>
<garnt> 9/11 conspiracy theories. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> I shit you not. </garnt>
<garnt> I shit you not. - What? </garnt>
<garnt> - And I dead ass think I got the teacher to believe me. </garnt>
<connor> - [Joey] Right. </connor>
<connor> - So, I came in. </connor>
<connor> I was like, moon landing, fake. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> But what is the biggest conspiracy theory? </connor>
<connor> I did like this, like Steve Jobs in a Ted Talk, right? </connor>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, listen, look at this. </garnt>
<connor> I did the Wingdings thing with the flight number. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. - And I was like, </joey>
<joey> look, it's two towers and the star of Israel, </joey>
<garnt> I rest my case. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> And everyone was like, "No way!" </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause everyone's like 14, </garnt>
<connor> and the teacher wasn't really smart. </connor>
<connor> They were like, what the fuck, this is insane. </connor>
<connor> Whoa! </connor>
<connor> It was just so fucking funny. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I never got told off for that. </connor>
<garnt> - Really? - No. </garnt>
<garnt> I think for some reason, I think, </garnt>
<connor> they thought I was super genuine about my belief of this. </connor>
<garnt> But obviously- - So, they didn't wanna </garnt>
<connor> crush on your belief? </connor>
<connor> - You just said it was enough conviction </connor>
<garnt> that they were like, he must be right. </garnt>
<garnt> He must be fucking right. </garnt>
<connor> - It wasn't just like the Wingdings. </connor>
<garnt> I think said a bunch of other stuff, </garnt>
<garnt> but that was the big piece of evidence where I was like </garnt>
<connor> (claps) look, Microsoft planned 9/11. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] That's so fucked. </connor>
<garnt> - Dude, I do not know how I got away with doing that, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause that is bad. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Fucking hell. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know how- - We didn't do anything </connor>
<connor> during homeroom. </connor>
<connor> - No? - I feel like the school </connor>
<joey> just implemented that to give the teachers </joey>
<joey> their 15 minutes smoke break before the beginning, right? </joey>
<connor> - 'Cause our teacher was the one who did it, </connor>
<connor> 'cause we didn't have any lessons with her. </connor>
<connor> She was always that one that goes like, </connor>
<connor> "You should be constantly learning and advancing yourself." </connor>
<connor> I'm like, hell no, I wanna play Modern Warfare Two at home. </connor>
<joey> I don't wanna fucking prepare. </joey>
<joey> - Dude, for us, homeroom was just coming together </joey>
<joey> and just fucking getting on our shitty iPhone 3S </joey>
<joey> and playing Doodle Jump together. </joey>
<joey> That was the only thing we did. </joey>
<joey> - I'm wondering if we... </joey>
<connor> I don't think I even had a homeroom segment or session. </connor>
<connor> - Segment of the episodes. </connor>
<connor> - This is a segment. - Segment of the fucking </connor>
<garnt> school day or whatever </garnt>
<garnt> you wanna fucking call it. - Garnt thinks it was </garnt>
<connor> life in episodes. </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - The homeroom mark. </connor>
<garnt> - Season one, season two. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh, my God. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I didn't have anything like that. </connor>
<connor> But yeah, let's talk about some current topics </connor>
<connor> that aren't just nostalgic trips back to high school, </connor>
<connor> right? - We talk about high school </connor>
<connor> and shit so much but we (indistinct) fucking funny stories. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's the prologue to our lives. </joey>
<connor> - It's great memories. </connor>
<connor> People listening to this </connor>
<connor> who are still in high school, wouldn't understand. </connor>
<joey> But once you're out of high school, you'll understand. </joey>
<garnt> You'll look back on them. </garnt>
<joey> - God, I was such a little shit. </joey>
<joey> - You sound like such a grandpa saying that. </joey>
<garnt> You'll look back to your high school </garnt>
<joey> one day. - I remember back in the day </joey>
<joey> when we only had three phones. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> No, but, what's the... </joey>
<connor> I guess the big news quote, unquote. </connor>
<connor> - Other than "Attack on Titan." </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, other than "Attack on Titan," of course, </garnt>
<joey> everyone's fucking- - Probably gonna be old news </joey>
<joey> by the time this episode airs. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, everyone's fucking loving that. </garnt>
<joey> But I guess like some news that is more industry-driven </joey>
<connor> is the whole Funimation and Crunchyroll thing, right? </connor>
<garnt> - Got bought up by Sony. </garnt>
<connor> Big cardy Sony. </connor>
<connor> - Sony buying out Crunchyroll. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - And basically having control </connor>
<joey> of most of the big anime companies. </joey>
<joey> - Basically, just monopolize the Western market. </joey>
<connor> - I mean, it is slightly worrying </connor>
<garnt> when you hear that initially, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - You're like, that's a lot </garnt>
<connor> of market share that Sony has. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - At what point would it be considered a Sony like, </connor>
<connor> I guess a monopoly if they had Netflix, right. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I feel like if they had Crunchyroll, </garnt>
<garnt> Funimation, and Netflix, then- </garnt>
<joey> - Then it would be like </joey>
<joey> game over- - Then it would be like </joey>
<joey> 99% basically. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause basically, I think the only other company </joey>
<garnt> is probably Sentai Filmworks who do Hidive. </garnt>
<garnt> And- - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Is Hidive still going? </garnt>
<garnt> - Hidive's still going. </garnt>
<garnt> - Shit. (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - Fuck, Hidive. </connor>
<garnt> I'm so sorry, I didn't know. </garnt>
<connor> I guess it's just not available outside the US, right? </connor>
<connor> So it's- </connor>
<garnt> - No, it's available in the UK, as well. </garnt>
<connor> - Is it? - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Fuck, I didn't know that. </connor>
<connor> - But the problem with Hidive is that I don't know how many </connor>
<connor> big exclusive titles that they have. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, how can you compete? </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause the only thing that I've watched, </connor>
<connor> the only big exclusive I've watched of Hidive </connor>
<joey> is probably "Legend Of The Galactic Heroes," </joey>
<joey> and that's like </joey>
<joey> a fucking old, old... - They did a new one. </joey>
<joey> - No, like the old one. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, the OG one, oh shit. - So the only service </joey>
<joey> they have licensed, the OG "Legend Of The Galactic Heroes." </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Oh, wow. </joey>
<joey> - And I feel like... </joey>
<joey> I don't how many other exclusives they have outside of that </joey>
<joey> that I can't get on. - I've never used Hidive, </joey>
<connor> so I couldn't tell you - Yeah, 'cause I know </connor>
<connor> "Made in Abyss," I watched that on Amazon Strike. </connor>
<joey> back when that was a thing. </joey>
<connor> - Amazon Strike. </connor>
<connor> - Remember Amazon Strike? (claps) </connor>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - Have Amazon stopped buying anime now? </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I don't know what anime they're getting anymore. </garnt>
<garnt> Have they got anything? - No, they're still getting. </garnt>
<garnt> - The problem with Amazon, is that they can- </garnt>
<connor> - They buy one big show. </connor>
<connor> - Like last year they had "Vinland Saga." </connor>
<connor> But the big problem with Amazon is that they sometimes </connor>
<joey> get big shows, but I fucking- </joey>
<joey> - They don't know how to market it. </joey>
<joey> - I fucking hate watching anime on Amazon, </joey>
<joey> because I don't know what shows they have half of the time. </joey>
<garnt> - Right, right, right. - They actually have </garnt>
<garnt> quite a lot of anime, </garnt>
<garnt> but nobody knows about this </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause nobody fucking watches anime on Amazon. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, not to mention that, I think, </joey>
<connor> the general problem with Amazon is that </connor>
<connor> they don't know how to market it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You find out, usually, second hand from someone </connor>
<connor> who's like, "Oh, I watch "Vinland Saga" on Amazon." </connor>
<connor> And you're just like, "Vinland Saga" is Amazon. </connor>
<connor> What the fuck? </connor>
<joey> I mean, Amazon is "Vinland Saga," what the fuck? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Actually, watching it isn't bad. </joey>
<joey> The play is really good. </joey>
<connor> And I don't know like what fucking conversion they're using, </connor>
<connor> but man, it looks crisp as fuck </connor>
<connor> when you play it. - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But God damn is it horrible to use their fucking platform? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Holy shit, dude. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, am I renting this shit or am I streaming it? </connor>
<joey> It's not clear half </joey>
<joey> the fucking time? - Exactly, exactly. </joey>
<garnt> - Is like, I didn't mean to rent "Bora." </garnt>
<garnt> Why am I watching "Bora." (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> I try to watch fucking anime. </garnt>
<garnt> What the fuck, Amazon? </garnt>
<garnt> And then also, because now obviously </garnt>
<connor> I'm using Amazon Prime in Japan. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Amazon did that fucking pro gamer move, </connor>
<connor> of being like, yeah, no subtitles for other languages </connor>
<connor> outside of this country. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah>
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So, if I wanna watch it, I have to buy Prime, </connor>
<connor> which I have in Japan, and Prime in the UK or the US, </connor>
<connor> which is just fucking stupid. </connor>
<garnt> - Does Prime even work for you here? </garnt>
<garnt> Like UK Prime work for you here? </garnt>
<garnt> - No, you can't do that. </garnt>
<connor> - 'Cause it doesn't work for me. </connor>
<connor> - No, no you need to use... </connor>
<connor> You have Prime, but it's probably Japanese Prime, </connor>
<connor> which doesn't offer any English subtitles. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And obviously, because their like, </connor>
<connor> we don't want people going on to other countries </connor>
<connor> and buying stuff, which kind of makes sense. </connor>
<connor> But also why, who cares? </connor>
<garnt> (scoffs) </garnt>
<garnt> - It's 2020, I don't know why licensing laws </garnt>
<joey> haven't caught up to the fact that </joey>
<joey> it's a global fucking media now. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - If you're gonna limit it to one country, </joey>
<garnt> people are gonna find a way to find other ways to watch it, </garnt>
<garnt> because people are gonna watch it whatever happens. </garnt>
<connor> - Like most people, cause I see these threads </connor>
<connor> on Reddit where they're like, </connor>
<connor> "Bro if you buy Netflix now in Turkey </connor>
<joey> "you can get it for like $2." </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, but that seems </joey>
<joey> like a lot of fucking effort. (laughing) </joey>
<connor> Do I really care that much </connor>
<connor> to go through all this (indistinct). </connor>
<connor> - I'm glad that if I put all that effort in, </connor>
<joey> I can save a whole $4. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - And then you gotta keep using a VPN when you log in </connor>
<joey> and do that shit anyway. </joey>
<joey> - So you're only pay for the VPN anyway. (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - And like it's not worth </joey>
<joey> the fucking effort, man. </joey>
<joey> Do I really need this? </joey>
<joey> No, I don't. </joey>
<joey> Who cares? </joey>
<connor> The country that I'm in, </connor>
<connor> I don't wanna have to fuck around with VPNs. </connor>
<connor> Don't make this hard for me. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And Amazon, obviously made it... </connor>
<connor> They're like, how do we make it as hard as possible </connor>
<connor> in every single (indistinct)? - So that no one use it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, how do we make it so that </connor>
<joey> you accidentally buy a dildo </joey>
<joey> instead of watching "Vinland Saga." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - That's basically like </joey>
<connor> every Amazon Prime experience. </connor>
<joey> - Do we have any like, I guess, </joey>
<joey> 'cause there is very little information </joey>
<joey> about the whole Sony acquisition, right? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's still very early days now. </garnt>
<connor> - Wait, Meilyne, how much was it for? </connor>
<connor> How much was, 'cause we don't know. </connor>
<connor> - [Meilyne] Funimation buying... </connor>
<connor> Sony buying Funimation or Sony buying Crunchyroll? </connor>
<garnt> - Both. - Both. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Meilyne] So Sony, when they bought 95% </garnt>
<connor> of Funimation in 2017 it was around 143 million. </connor>
<joey> - 143.- - Oh, that's right, </joey>
<connor> they did do that. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - 143? </garnt>
<garnt> - For Funimation. - Yes. </garnt>
<joey> - For Funimation. </joey>
<joey> - [Meilyne] For Crunchyroll it's around 1.2 billion. </joey>
<connor> - Fuck! </connor>
<connor> Wasn't Amazon only like 900 million when- </connor>
<connor> - Can you say that number again. </connor>
<garnt> - [Meilyne] 1.2 billion. </garnt>
<garnt> - $1.2 billion. </garnt>
<garnt> (indistinct) </garnt>
<joey> That's more than Amazon bought Twitch for. </joey>
<joey> - Twitch for, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Jesus Christ! </joey>
<garnt> - Wow. - Oh, my God! </garnt>
<joey> - The question </joey>
<connor> that I wanna know- - 143 for Funimation. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> That's already surprising, </joey>
<garnt> but the biggest question I have is like, </garnt>
<garnt> all right cool, Sony you have all this fucking money </garnt>
<connor> to spend on Crunchyroll and Funimation, that's fine. </connor>
<connor> But in my opinion, it's just like </connor>
<joey> what are you gonna do with it? </joey>
<joey> Is the question. </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] I mean, I guess- </connor>
<joey> - Because when Sony back in the day bought the 95% </joey>
<joey> of Funimation or whatever it was, </joey>
<joey> not gonna lie, they didn't really do much with it. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I haven't seen much of a change from Funimation. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know how well Funimation was doing back then. </garnt>
<joey> - Right. - But it seems like </joey>
<joey> they've just gone on business as usual, now. </joey>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - 1.2 billion for Crunchyroll, just kinda sees </connor>
<connor> how much they're investing in anime, I guess. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Because they must see the potential </garnt>
<garnt> in the anime industry to get to like </garnt>
<garnt> chill out this big of a market share. </garnt>
<joey> - I guess, maybe they're willing to throw that much money, </joey>
<joey> because they realized that </joey>
<joey> there is a massive competitor now, and that is Netflix. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I guess when you put it into perspective </joey>
<connor> of like Twitch was bought out, but that was like, </connor>
<connor> how many years ago was Twitch bought out by Amazon? </connor>
<joey> - Probably around the same time </joey>
<joey> that Sony first bought Funimation. </joey>
<connor> - No it was earlier than that. </connor>
<joey> - Was it? - I think it was </joey>
<joey> like 2016, right? </joey>
<joey> It must've happened, 2015. </joey>
<joey> - Really? - Yeah, but still- </joey>
<garnt> - When did they happen Meilyne, can you Google it? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - 2014. </garnt>
<connor> - 2014. </connor>
<connor> Okay to be fair- - But still Twitch was like </connor>
<garnt> the fucking big shit back then. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Meilyne] Twitch was 970 million. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, so Twitch was 970 million. </garnt>
<connor> - But I guess Twitch in 2014, </connor>
<joey> I understand it really makes sense. </joey>
<joey> Twitch nowadays is pretty worth like, five, six times. </joey>
<connor> Is that right? - Oh, easily. Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I would say that, you know- </garnt>
<connor> - Twitch at that point is- </connor>
<connor> - Comparing Crunchyroll now to Twitch back then- </connor>
<connor> - Twitch is still bigger I'd say. </connor>
<connor> - I would say Twitch was a whole property, </connor>
<connor> 'cause everyone was expecting YouTube to buy Twitch. </connor>
<connor> I remember back in the day </connor>
<connor> where it was just like- - Yeah, that's right. </connor>
<joey> - Where it was just like, yeah, </joey>
<joey> everyone's like, well, Google is gonna buy Twitch, </joey>
<joey> that's just a natural move, </joey>
<joey> right? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And it was a big surprise when Amazon </joey>
<joey> kind of stepped in. - And then Jeff Bezos </joey>
<garnt> was like, "JK. </garnt>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> "I'ma step in." </joey>
<garnt> - That's been great for creators, though. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - That, that happened. </joey>
<garnt> But I'm curious as to why... </garnt>
<garnt> Do you have any thoughts of might why </garnt>
<connor> this might be good or bad for anime fans </connor>
<connor> in general? (Joey sighs) </connor>
<garnt> - It just- - I mean, I'd say </garnt>
<garnt> as a consumer, it would probably be better. </garnt>
<garnt> Because, okay- </garnt>
<connor> - For more money in the industry is always better. </connor>
<garnt> - Well, it's not only that, </garnt>
<garnt> but I remember I would say the golden age </garnt>
<garnt> of anime streaming was... </garnt>
<connor> Remember when you could get every anime </connor>
<connor> you could conceivably want to watch on one platform, </connor>
<connor> which was Crunchyroll back in the day? </connor>
<connor> And then it kinda just like got spread out </connor>
<connor> to different streaming companies. </connor>
<connor> - I mean that was inevitable </connor>
<connor> that it was gonna happened. - It was inevitable. </connor>
<connor> The biggest thing I find annoying, </connor>
<connor> isn't just the fact that I have to pay </connor>
<connor> for different streaming companies. </connor>
<connor> It's just the fact that nowadays </connor>
<garnt> when I go through an anime char, </garnt>
<garnt> I literally have no idea which anime </garnt>
<joey> is gonna be in which platform. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - That's true, that's true. </joey>
<joey> - Unless it's specifically says like Prime, </joey>
<garnt> for example. - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> I just want to log onto one service </garnt>
<garnt> and be like, okay, I just wanna... </garnt>
<garnt> Don't care how much I'm paying for this service, </garnt>
<garnt> I just want to watch all the anime I want to watch </garnt>
<garnt> in that one service. </garnt>
<connor> - Well, it's confusing 'cause I thought "Jujutsu Kaisen," </connor>
<joey> is that correct? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Was on Netflix. </joey>
<garnt> - No, that was on Crunchyroll. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's on Crunchyroll. - But it is on Netflix. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Is it? </garnt>
<garnt> - In Japan? (chuckles) - No, in Japan. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh, in Japan. </joey>
<joey> - So, it's really confusing living in Japan. </joey>
<joey> 'cause I'm like, wait, who owns what? </joey>
<joey> Because of Japan and like... </joey>
<joey> Because obviously it's pretty much Japan, rest of the world. </joey>
<joey> That's how the anime market works, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Obviously. </joey>
<joey> And it's really confusing. </joey>
<garnt> So I'm like, wait, where do I watch it though? </garnt>
<joey> I realized Netflix doesn't offer English subtitles </joey>
<joey> probably for that reason </joey>
<joey> with the licensing, right? - Yeah, yeah yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Fuck, it's a mess though. </joey>
<joey> It is a mess. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's like, how do I know where to fucking watch </joey>
<joey> and what? (Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> - And then everyone's just laughing being like </joey>
<joey> (laughs), "Piracy." </joey>
<joey> Like TDXT. - Yeah, of course. </joey>
<connor> - I wanna pay, I want an easy service. </connor>
<garnt> - I want a convenience service. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm willing to pay for a convenient service, </garnt>
<garnt> which for the longest time it was until it wasn't. </garnt>
<garnt> And now it's like I wanna support the industry, </garnt>
<garnt> but at the same time, </garnt>
<garnt> if I'm having trouble finding which service </garnt>
<garnt> has got which anime, I literally have to... </garnt>
<garnt> There is a dedicated search engine for this. </garnt>
<garnt> I think the name is like Because Moe or something, </garnt>
<garnt> that's the name of the website. </garnt>
<garnt> That's literally a dedicated search engine </garnt>
<garnt> to search which anime is on which streaming service. </garnt>
<joey> - I love that someone had to make that. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I know, right? </garnt>
<connor> - That really is telling- </connor>
<connor> - It's like this fucking pre-order like a spreadsheet. </connor>
<joey> Like what do you get in what pre-order </joey>
<connor> it's like a fucking know what's on what. </connor>
<connor> Fuck me. </connor>
<connor> - Well then would you say then in that instance that, </connor>
<joey> I guess a full monopoly of the Western market </joey>
<joey> onto one service is a benefit. </joey>
<connor> - I mean it's not the monopoly though, is it really? </connor>
<connor> Because Netflix is. </connor>
<joey> - Right, but that's what I'm saying though. </joey>
<connor> Like if, for example- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, monopoly is always bad. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, but that's what I'm saying. </connor>
<connor> But for example, if Sony, hypothetically is like, </connor>
<connor> hey, we wanna buy the anime side of things </connor>
<connor> from the Netflix's, right? </connor>
<connor> That would truly, I would say, turn it into a monopoly </connor>
<garnt> at least in terms of the Western market. </garnt>
<garnt> - That'd be awful. - That would basically </garnt>
<garnt> be a monopoly at that point. </garnt>
<garnt> - That'd be awful for anime fans though. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, it'll be awful for anime fans, </connor>
<joey> but at the same logic that Garnt was saying, </joey>
<joey> it would all be on one platform too. </joey>
<garnt> - That's kinda like the fucking Disney argument, </garnt>
<garnt> now, isn't it? - Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like, yes, all my characters </garnt>
<garnt> now are gonna be in the MCU. </garnt>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yay for monopoly, right? </connor>
<garnt> - [Joey] (scoffs) Oh my God. - Because (indistinct), right? </garnt>
<connor> It's like with the whole Disney shit </connor>
<connor> it's worrying because if everything's on fucking Disney, </connor>
<connor> we only get Disney ass products. </connor>
<connor> - Right. - I don't want </connor>
<connor> fucking Disney shit. </connor>
<connor> I fucking hate Disney movies. </connor>
<joey> - That remind me of other day when I was streaming, </joey>
<joey> I don't know how true this is, </joey>
<joey> so take this with a grain of salt. </joey>
<joey> But somebody was saying that there's a rumor </joey>
<garnt> that Disney might be acquiring "Shonen Jump." </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, my God. No, no. - Please no, please. </garnt>
<garnt> No, seriously. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know how true that is. </garnt>
<connor> - Fact-check this Meilyne. </connor>
<connor> - Please, can you fact check this because- </connor>
<garnt> - Fact check. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because he sounded pretty fucking convincing </garnt>
<garnt> when people in the chat were talking about it. </garnt>
<garnt> But apparently, Disney is thinking to acquire it </garnt>
<garnt> because they want to do a collaborative thing </garnt>
<joey> between "My Hero Academia" and the MCU. </joey>
<connor> - No. - No. </connor>
<joey> - And I'm just in my head- </joey>
<joey> - That's gotta be a fucking troll though. </joey>
<joey> No way. - If it is a troll, then- </joey>
<garnt> - That's gotta be a troll. - That sounds like a meme. </garnt>
<garnt> - If it's a troll than I've fallen for the bait. </garnt>
<garnt> But at the same time, I wouldn't be surprised </garnt>
<joey> if Disney actually wanted do that. </joey>
<connor> - I cannot stand Disney. </connor>
<joey> - Because, think about it. </joey>
<joey> It's like MCU, super heroes, </joey>
<connor> "My Hero Academia," super heroes. </connor>
<joey> It's a match made in Heaven according to Disney, right? </joey>
<garnt> - Right, I can't wait for when fucking Omai </garnt>
<garnt> shows up in "Avengers Five" </garnt>
<joey> or something like that. - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Oh my- - I don't see it. </connor>
<connor> - You don't see it? </connor>
<connor> - All right Joey's bullshitting. </connor>
<connor> It is bullshit. - Maybe I'm using </connor>
<garnt> the wrong keywords. </garnt>
<connor> - Okay. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh, my God, you know what that would mean though? </garnt>
<garnt> The fucking Thanos versus Goku memes like become real. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> And become like a legitimate talking point. </garnt>
<joey> - It would be horrible for like a realistic standpoint. </joey>
<garnt> But my God the amount of shit post and memes </garnt>
<garnt> that would come out of this will be fucking epic. </garnt>
<connor> Again, take it with a grain of salt. </connor>
<connor> It might be a troll. </connor>
<connor> It might just be- - Joey's talking </connor>
<garnt> out of his ass. </garnt>
<garnt> - I might be talking out of my ass. </garnt>
<joey> I don't know. - You are. </joey>
<garnt> - That just means every MCU conversation, </garnt>
<garnt> would end with, both Goku could beat. (chuckles). </garnt>
<joey> - But Goku could beat Captain America. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> - But could Goku beat HIV. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> I already liked the way Disney does things with properties </connor>
<connor> and it's worrying that they're acquiring so much. </connor>
<connor> - Right. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - They have so much control over things, </connor>
<connor> because yeah, Disney movie is streamlined and it's nice, </connor>
<connor> but you don't get the weird shit from Disney. </connor>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<connor> - You don't (indistinct) shit. </connor>
<connor> - That's what I'm saying. </connor>
<joey> When I heard about that supposed rumor, or bullshit, </joey>
<joey> or whatever it was, I wasn't immediately, </joey>
<connor> oh, that's bullshit. </connor>
<connor> That's never gonna happen. </connor>
<joey> Because there is a very likely chance </joey>
<joey> it very much might happen. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - And if it does happen, </joey>
<joey> then it's gonna be really bad for anime. </joey>
<joey> Anime is gonna get fucking boring when that happens. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, what I would saying now is that </garnt>
<garnt> so we can basically break down the main plays to be, </garnt>
<garnt> Crunchyroll, Funimation, Netflix of... </garnt>
<garnt> Crunchyroll, Funimation and Netflix, </garnt>
<garnt> and there's Sentai Filmwork doing their own thing. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - But I will say that </garnt>
<garnt> putting those two together, </garnt>
<connor> they do have very different brands. </connor>
<connor> Sometimes you watch an anime and you're like, </connor>
<connor> yeah, this feels like a Netflix show. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> - "Beastars" felt like it belonged to Netflix. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - "Devil May Cry" maybe felt </connor>
<connor> like it belonged on Netflix. </connor>
<joey> What I always say when it was Crunchyroll versus Funimation </joey>
<joey> is that they have exact same branding. </joey>
<joey> So, I'm just like, oh, "Kaguya-sama" is on Crunchyroll, </joey>
<joey> then on Funimation like what? </joey>
<garnt> Season two is on Funimation. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause they were both trying to acquire the same show. </garnt>
<joey> - It's the same type of consumers, I feel, </joey>
<connor> that use both Funimation and Crunchyroll. </connor>
<connor> And not to say that Crunchyroll users don't use Netflix </connor>
<connor> and vice versa. </connor>
<connor> But I feel that, yeah, as you said, </connor>
<garnt> there's a certain, I don't know what the right word </garnt>
<garnt> for it is. </garnt>
<garnt> Edginess when it comes to shows on Netflix? </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] I don't know. </garnt>
<joey> - I don't know what the right word for it is. </joey>
<joey> - Netflix is that cooler older brother </joey>
<connor> who comes in and is like, hey, you ever played a game boy? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean, like that vibe. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - We've obviously done work with Netflix, so. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - But this is totally separated from that. </connor>
<connor> But I mean their service is the best, man. </connor>
<connor> I mean, obviously the Netflix jail stuff fucking sucks. </connor>
<connor> Sometimes, at least in Japan, the subtitle differences, </connor>
<connor> again, those we obviously know. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Right, right, right. </connor>
<connor> - That sucks, but you use that player </connor>
<joey> and it's like, you can't beat that shit. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] No, no. </joey>
<joey> - You can download it, </joey>
<connor> and now you can do audio only on a mobile, </connor>
<connor> which I love. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause you used to have to keep... </connor>
<connor> When I used to listen to stuff on Netflix, </connor>
<connor> I used to keep my phone open in my pocket, </connor>
<connor> like the screen going. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - But now you can just do </connor>
<connor> audio only. </connor>
<connor> And it's like, oh, my God! </connor>
<connor> It's like they know what I fucking want </connor>
<joey> before I do it. - Okay, but the question </joey>
<joey> is then, what would you watch? </joey>
<joey> What kind of content would work for audio only stuff. </joey>
<joey> Like documentary's. - It's not about that. </joey>
<connor> It's just sometimes I'm in a situation where I- </connor>
<garnt> - I couldn't do that for anime, honestly. </garnt>
<connor> - No, I'm in a situation where I can't look at my screen </connor>
<connor> for like just two minutes, </connor>
<connor> 'cause maybe I'm getting off the train, </connor>
<connor> maybe I'm walking around real quick. </connor>
<garnt> I just wanna lock my phone. </garnt>
<garnt> But I wanna keep listening, </garnt>
<garnt> I just got my headphones on. </garnt>
<garnt> - I get you. </garnt>
<garnt> - So it's just, quick little moments </garnt>
<garnt> where you just wanna turn it off, </garnt>
<garnt> but you don't want content to just stop. </garnt>
<connor> - Right, right, right. - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> Honestly, the big thing for me for Netflix </garnt>
<garnt> is the skip opening button. </garnt>
<garnt> - Skip opening. - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - They've also just added the two times speed, 1.5- </joey>
<joey> - Oh, really? - So now you can decide </joey>
<garnt> if you wanna be a bastard and watch anime </garnt>
<garnt> at two times speed. (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - I know it's a fucking cardinal sin to say </garnt>
<garnt> you could skip opening anime openings, but- </garnt>
<garnt> - I skip them. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's made it so much more easier </garnt>
<garnt> to watch some of the anime. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause let's be honest, let's be honest. </garnt>
<connor> - They do it automatically for endings. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - You can physically tell them, no, no, don't. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause every time "The Great Pretender" ended </joey>
<joey> I'm like, no, let me listen. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] I love this song. </garnt>
<connor> - I fucking love this. - No, no, no. </connor>
<connor> Sometimes you do watch the ending, </connor>
<garnt> and sometimes you do listen to the opening. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - But let's be honest, </garnt>
<garnt> most of the time you wanna skip the opening. </garnt>
<joey> You watch the opening ones and it's another generic </joey>
<joey> J-pop opening. </joey>
<joey> - It's a binge. - Especially if you're </joey>
<joey> like binging. - If its a binge. </joey>
<joey> - And I love binging anime. </joey>
<joey> I don't watch anime weekly. </joey>
<joey> So for me, unless it's a fucking banger of an opening </joey>
<joey> which is there's always one or two shows every season </joey>
<joey> but it's not every fucking show. </joey>
<joey> For me "Beastars" was one. </joey>
<joey> I always fucking listen </joey>
<joey> to the "Beastars" opening. - "Beastars has a </joey>
<joey> fucking amazing opening, </joey>
<garnt> "Mob Psycho" as well. - I was like, no, no, no, </garnt>
<joey> don't skip it. </joey>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> Just leave it, Netflix, come on. </garnt>
<garnt> - Just let it play. - Yeah, come on, </garnt>
<joey> I wanna watch this. </joey>
<garnt> Yeah, it's great. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, like, you said, "The Great Pretender" ending </garnt>
<connor> which is like... </connor>
<connor> You've always got time </connor>
<connor> for Freddie Mercury. - Come on. </connor>
<connor> - Come on, you've always got time- </connor>
<garnt> - Never skip Freddie Mercury. </garnt>
<garnt> - What time is it? </garnt>
<connor> I've got time, regardless. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? (laughing) </connor>
<connor> And you can download episodes. </connor>
<connor> I know you could do that on Crunchyroll now, I think, </connor>
<connor> if you pay extra. </connor>
<connor> - You can pay extra to download in Crunchyroll. </connor>
<connor> I have never tried it so I don't know how good </connor>
<joey> the services is. </joey>
<garnt> 'Cause I know you can do it on Funimation, </garnt>
<garnt> but it didn't work that good. </garnt>
<connor> - That was always the biggest complaint in Funimation, </connor>
<garnt> is that the website was garbage. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - As far as I wouldn't know, </garnt>
<connor> I can't use it downloading the US. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. (chuckles) </joey>
<joey> - What do you think the plan is with Sony? </joey>
<connor> Why do you think they decided- </connor>
<connor> - That's a good question. </connor>
<connor> I have no fucking idea. - 'Cause that's what </connor>
<connor> I've always wanted to know, again, right? </connor>
<joey> It's like, what is it about Crunchyroll and Funimation </joey>
<connor> that Sony was like, "We'll drop a billion bucks on this?" </connor>
<joey> - Sony has a movie division. </joey>
<joey> - Right. - It's pretty, </joey>
<connor> I think a big part of their business. </connor>
<joey> - So do you think we'll start to see maybe like funding </joey>
<garnt> Sony Original anime on Crunchyroll and Funimation maybe? </garnt>
<garnt> - Maybe, I don't know. </garnt>
<joey> - 'Cause they have to compete with Netflix Originals, right? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, right now Sony already own the production committee </garnt>
<connor> to a lot of anime. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Including like big animes </connor>
<connor> like I think isn't it like "The Demon Slayer?" </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah, they could be. - Kinda funded "Demon Slayer" </connor>
<joey> because that's Aniplex, right? - I have no idea. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Actually I might be talking out of my ass here. </connor>
<connor> - Which company does Sony own? </connor>
<connor> Is it Aniplex? </connor>
<joey> - Aniplex, yeah. - Yeah Sony owns Aniplex. </joey>
<connor> - Oh, Aniplex is a lot of (indistinct). </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - I'm pretty sure Aniplex </garnt>
<connor> was with "Demon Slayer." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - They're usually </connor>
<connor> with the majority of the big shonen. </connor>
<connor> - It only makes sense so they'd wanna </connor>
<connor> get a big grip on the Western market. </connor>
<connor> I mean, if you're funding this shit, </connor>
<connor> you already have a lot of say over it, right? </connor>
<garnt> - I think right now, I don't know what their plans are, </garnt>
<garnt> but I think the amount of money they threw at it, </garnt>
<garnt> just shows how much potential they see </garnt>
<garnt> for the anime market, right? - Yeah, for real. </garnt>
<connor> - Cause. - It's a gold rush right now, </connor>
<connor> I think really. </connor>
<connor> I think all the companies are fighting to get control </connor>
<connor> over the Western market 'cause they realized </connor>
<connor> this shit's big. </connor>
<joey> - It's like an IP race, right? </joey>
<connor> To see how many IP's they can grab, essentially. </connor>
<connor> - While it's still young and it still hasn't fully settled, </connor>
<joey> which is now. </joey>
<connor> Why wouldn't you just throw money at the shit </connor>
<connor> and try and get all the IP's, </connor>
<connor> get all the foundation set up? - True, true. </connor>
<garnt> - Do you see anime becoming as big as, </garnt>
<connor> say gaming or like other things </connor>
<garnt> in a few years? - I do, I do. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Maybe not like hentai, but- </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, maybe not- - Hey man, hey man. </joey>
<garnt> You just wait, you just wait boy. </garnt>
<garnt> You just wait. - You just wait. </garnt>
<joey> You just wait till I drop my original hentai </joey>
<connor> and then we will see how big it gets. </connor>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Listen, right? </joey>
<joey> Everyone watches porn, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - But there isn't no like </joey>
<joey> Avengers of porn. </joey>
<joey> No, one's discussing like... </joey>
<joey> There's no podcast about porn. </joey>
<joey> I don't think, actually, maybe there is. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. (chuckles) </joey>
<connor> There's no big discussions about porn and like, </connor>
<connor> oh my God, who's Johnny Sins gonna fuck next </connor>
<connor> on the next episode? - Johnny Sins </connor>
<joey> is the Captain America of porn. </joey>
<connor> - It's not gonna be that Garnt, </connor>
<connor> get your hopes down now, all right? </connor>
<garnt> - I don't know man, isn't like Pornhub in like the top 20 </garnt>
<joey> most used sites. - Well, they just gutted </joey>
<garnt> their library. - Yeah they just destroyed </garnt>
<garnt> like 60% of their library. </garnt>
<garnt> (whooshing) </garnt>
<joey> This episode is sponsored by EJ Anime Store. </joey>

<connor> - Additionally today we have a bit </connor>
<connor> of a special introduction. </connor>
<connor> As some of you may know, over the span of three days </connor>
<connor> at the end of November, we released a series of streams </connor>
<connor> on each of our Twitch channels </connor>
<connor> as part of a speed run competition </connor>
<connor> in which we had to put together one of the EJ Anime Store </connor>
<connor> plastic model kits, which is this box here. </connor>
<connor> And we had to see who could do it the fastest. </connor>
<joey> - Also known as the "Sword Art Online" </joey>
<joey> Figure-rise Standard Asuna Dengeki </joey>
<joey> pearl color limited version. </joey>
<joey> I said that in one take, </joey>
<garnt> let's go. - Oh, my God. </garnt>
<garnt> - And if you've already watched the streams, </garnt>
<garnt> you already know who won and lost. </garnt>
<joey> - Absolutely getting destroyed. </joey>
<joey> I thought I was fast, </joey>
<joey> and then Connor was like, no, no, no, no. </joey>
<joey> - Hold up. </joey>
<garnt> - Hold it. - Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> So I didn't know this before, but we have a forfeit </garnt>
<garnt> that the loser had to do, </garnt>
<garnt> and Meilyne, is about to present to me </garnt>
<garnt> my forfeit. - I've seen it. </garnt>
<garnt> I've seen it and it's gross. </garnt>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<connor> So that's a black- - Oh, that stinks. </connor>
<connor> - It's a black cobra chili. - Meilyne, what the fuck </connor>
<joey> did you buy for me? - No it's not a chili. </joey>
<connor> - What is this Meilyne? </connor>
<joey> - [Meilyne] That's a black cobra chili. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that is a black cobra chili, </joey>
<garnt> right there. - Meilyne, this is not </garnt>
<joey> what we agreed to. </joey>
<garnt> - (chuckles) What is this thing? </garnt>
<garnt> - That's a giant water bug. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<joey> - You should have gotten good. </joey>
<joey> - I'm not gonna fucking forget this. </joey>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> This is Meilyne's idea, by the way. </garnt>
<garnt> Wasn't our idea. </garnt>
<garnt> Look at this shit. </garnt>
<garnt> Oh fuck, it's fucking awful. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, it just flipped over. </garnt>
<connor> - Can you hold one up to the camera, </connor>
<connor> Joey? - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - That's disgusting. - Oh, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I would not wanna eat that. </connor>
<connor> Good luck Garnt. </connor>
<connor> So, while Garnt enjoys on his fantastic meal </connor>
<connor> for the evening, EJ Anime Store will be giving away </connor>
<connor> one lucky winner an Asuna figure set </connor>
<connor> with a wall scroll signed by the three of us for free. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, shit, look at that. </joey>
<joey> - [Connor] What? </joey>
<connor> That's pov. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] It's got our signatures on it. </connor>
<connor> - I have to act excited now. </connor>
<connor> - Look, it's the loser's signature. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Oh yeah, right in the corner. </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] All you simply have to do guys </connor>
<connor> is follow their Twitter @ejanimestore, </connor>
<connor> like and retweet their tweet that contains </connor>
<connor> the TTAsunaSpeedRun, </connor>
<connor> and then retweet the post. (whooshing) </connor>
<garnt> - It literally smells like swamp. </garnt>
<connor> I was trying to figure out what this smells like. </connor>
<connor> - You know what it smells like? </connor>
<joey> It smells like licorice. </joey>
<connor> - And once you do all that </connor>
<connor> you will have the chance to win the Asuna plastic model </connor>
<connor> with the signed wall scroll, gentlemen. </connor>
<connor> - [Meilyne] Tear off it's head, rip off it's wings </connor>
<joey> and squeeze it like a tube of. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - Wait, say that again. </garnt>
<joey> - So, how do you eat this Meilyne? </joey>
<joey> - So you tear off it's head, </joey>
<joey> do you want me to do it for you? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - You tear off it's head. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, no. </garnt>
<garnt> - And then you take off it's wings. </garnt>
<garnt> (screaming) </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh! - Oh! </garnt>
<garnt> - And then you just- - Oh, there it is. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, fuck! (claps) </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm gonna fucking puke. </garnt>
<garnt> What the fuck. (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - You just give it a suck and that's it. </garnt>
<garnt> - What the fuck is that? </garnt>
<joey> - Just give it that good suck. </joey>
<joey> Wait, can I smell it? </joey>
<connor> Ooh, that's strong, isn't it? (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - So, if you missed the stream, </connor>
<connor> watch the archive on our Twitch channels </connor>
<connor> as a reference to build your own model. </connor>
<connor> Both the regular version and the special bonus </connor>
<connor> wall scroll set set will be available </connor>

<connor> So, check the links in the description </connor>
<connor> to speedrun it yourself. </connor>
<connor> Please try and beat our times. </connor>
<connor> How is it Garnt? </connor>
<connor> How does it taste? </connor>
<garnt> - He just spat it out? </garnt>
<garnt> - It has the worst fucking after... </garnt>
<garnt> (banging) </garnt>
<joey> I need some... </joey>
<joey> Gimme this G Fuel, man. </joey>
<joey> - Wait, do you wanna- - That is disgusting. </joey>
<joey> - Do you wanna eat the cobra chili instead? </joey>
<joey> There you go, eat that. (laughs) </joey>
<garnt> - [Meilyne] That whole thing is 60,000 units. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) - I'm fucking dying. </garnt>
<garnt> (dramatic music) </garnt>
<garnt> What the fuck? </garnt>
<garnt> Why did I just do that? </garnt>
<garnt> - That's what you get from moseying around in a speed run. </garnt>
<connor> - I wanted to get honestly- - Oh God, I can smell </connor>
<connor> the chili from here. </connor>
<garnt> - Honestly, the chili is like a fucking breath of fresh air, </garnt>
<connor> compared to what I tasted. </connor>
<garnt> My mouth is on fucking fire right now, </garnt>
<garnt> but it feels better than that fucking water bug, man. </garnt>
<joey> - I don't know why, but I kinda wanna try it. </joey>
<joey> Am I allowed to just try it? </joey>
<joey> - [Meilyne] Go for it, there's three of them. </joey>
<joey> One for you- </joey>
<joey> - Oh, hey Connor, there's one for you as well. </joey>
<connor> You want one? - Oh, I'm okay, I'm okay. </connor>
<joey> I wouldn't - So, what do you do? </joey>
<garnt> You rip off the head. </garnt>
<garnt> - Rip off the head, take out the wings. </garnt>
<connor> - So, wait, what is this used for? </connor>
<connor> What is this fucking thing- - For food. </connor>
<joey> Oh God, that's very juicy. </joey>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> (whines) </garnt>
<garnt> It's like salty- </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, God, look at that. </garnt>
<connor> - [Connor] I don't wanna look at that. </connor>
<connor> Don't show me, don't pry it's asshole open in front of me. </connor>
<connor> - Wait, let me try. </connor>
<connor> (soft instrumental music) </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Oh, God, Joey. </connor>
<garnt> - [Garnt] It literally tastes like salty swamp. </garnt>
<garnt> That's literally what it like. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> Did you spit it out? </garnt>
<connor> Where did you spit it out? </connor>
<joey> - In the (indistinct). - I just swallowed it. </joey>
<connor> - [Meilyne] Do you want a purin? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, actually, you know what. </joey>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Well, thank you EJ Anime Store </connor>
<connor> for sponsoring this episode of the podcast. </connor>
<garnt> - Fuck you Meilyne. </garnt>
<connor> - Back to the episode. - Fuck you! </connor>
<connor> - Back to the episode. - Fuck you! </connor>
<connor> (whooshing) </connor>
<connor> (whines) </connor>
<connor> - I'm fucking bored talking about anime. </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> Fuck anime. </connor>
<garnt> - We're not even an anime podcast anymore. </garnt>
<garnt> - Imagine talking about anime on "Trash Taste" guys. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Ew! </garnt>
<connor> - I feel like I'm attempting to be the Winnie The Pooh meme, </connor>
<joey> like the high class one when I talk about anime. </joey>
<joey> I'm trying to form opinions. </joey>
<joey> I don't have opinions Joey. (Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> I don't have well formed- - I just watch that shit. </joey>
<joey> - I don't have well formed opinions about things. </joey>
<joey> - What, you think we do? </joey>
<connor> - I just say what I feel, okay? </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, you don't have well formed opinions </garnt>
<connor> about anything- - Fuck off, Garnt! </connor>
<garnt> Fuck off! </garnt>
<garnt> - Anime, food, gaming. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, no. - Let's be honest here, </garnt>
<garnt> let's be honest here. </garnt>
<connor> - I went on a little run on my stream the other day, </connor>
<garnt> just being like, Garnt is actually like, </garnt>
<connor> your parents didn't beat you enough. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) - What? </connor>
<joey> - Because, right? </joey>
<joey> Listen, he was allowed to get away with </joey>
<joey> not eating crusts, right? </joey>
<joey> If I didn't eat my crust- </joey>
<joey> - Oh, I think I saw you talking about that. (chuckles) </joey>
<joey> - If I didn't eat my crust right, </joey>
<joey> you know what my parents would do? </joey>
<connor> They'd be like, "That's fine, Connor, </connor>
<connor> "You have dinner ready for tomorrow now." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And I'll be like, but mom, I don't want them. </connor>
<connor> She's like, "No Connor, you're eating fucking crust. </connor>
<garnt> "You're not wasting food?" </garnt>
<garnt> - Who says that I didn't get my ass beat </garnt>
<garnt> for not eating my crust? </garnt>
<garnt> - Did you? </garnt>
<garnt> Were you like fucking Spartacus, </garnt>
<garnt> like, mother I will not bow to the crust. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because I had gone my entire fucking childhood </garnt>
<garnt> having to being forced to eat my crust. </garnt>
<joey> So as soon as I was a fully grown adult, who can make my own </joey>
<joey> fucking decisions. - This is what I'm saying. </joey>
<garnt> - I was like, mother, I do not care what you think anymore. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm going to not eat my crust. </garnt>
<garnt> - I pay my own rent. </garnt>
<garnt> - I pay my own bills. </garnt>
<garnt> I buy my own food. </garnt>
<garnt> Fuck you mother. </garnt>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - All I'm saying is you should've got a backhand </connor>
<garnt> a little bit more. </garnt>
<garnt> You know what I mean? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> It should have been a little harder. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - That's such a bad joke, I'm so sorry. </connor>
<garnt> - There is something that I didn't fully appreciate as a kid </garnt>
<garnt> or like I didn't fully- </garnt>
<garnt> - Crust. </garnt>
<connor> - No, not crust. (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Good food. - Not crust, but like- </connor>
<connor> - We're not getting into food by the way. </connor>
<connor> - We're not getting into food again. </connor>
<connor> But I was yesterday fucking cleaning the house </connor>
<connor> and I fucking hate cleaning the house. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> I don't think anyone in their entire life </connor>
<connor> likes cleaning the house. </connor>
<garnt> And I didn't realize why my parents fucking... </garnt>
<garnt> Basically just every parent manipulates their kids </garnt>
<connor> to be like their personal slaves. </connor>
<connor> - Do my job slave. </connor>
<garnt> - When it comes to cleaning the house. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, that's the reason why they used </garnt>
<joey> to have so many kids, right? </joey>
<joey> And it was like, they got to plow the fields, right? </joey>
<joey> I intend to keep that British philosophy alive </joey>
<connor> when I have a kid. </connor>
<joey> - You need seven kids. </joey>
<connor> - He needs to plow the fields, and clean the house, </connor>
<joey> and prepare the food. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, Connor's gonna like mean max that shit. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. - All right, my house </connor>
<connor> has six rooms. </connor>
<joey> So that's six children, I need to have, at least. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> One per room. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm not gonna beat my kids Valerie. </connor>
<connor> That was a distasteful joke. </connor>
<connor> Just saying that now. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, 'cause why is the activity of cleaning </garnt>
<garnt> just so awful. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> Does anyone... </garnt>
<connor> Who actually enjoys cleaning the house? </connor>
<connor> - When you get rid of a lot of dirt, </connor>
<connor> that's why I let it build up. </connor>
<connor> I let it get gross. </connor>
<connor> - Right, right - 'Cause when you clean </connor>
<connor> that shit, it's like peeling off a good scab. </connor>
<connor> - All right, - Its like, oh. </connor>
<joey> Oh, it's so clean. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, but- - I need to see </joey>
<connor> a physical layer of dust </connor>
<connor> in order for me to be like, yes. </connor>
<connor> - Dude when you swipe a whole layer of dust off </connor>
<connor> with like a wet wipe or something, </connor>
<connor> damn that feels good. </connor>
<connor> That takes that (indistinct) - I get like a quarter chub, </connor>
<connor> at least. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - But I don't like cleaning. </connor>
<connor> - No. - No, because like, </connor>
<connor> yeah, that is a satisfying feeling. </connor>
<garnt> But my problem with is that cleaning just... </garnt>
<connor> Shit I never knew as a kid how much fucking time and effort </connor>
<connor> it takes to clean. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Oh yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, when you're a kid, </connor>
<joey> you just clean your own fucking room. </joey>
<joey> You hoover the living room. - I didn't even do that. </joey>
<joey> - Or whatever- - I did that. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, you lucky motherfucker. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - You lucky motherfucker. </garnt>
<garnt> - I would, but then five minutes later </garnt>
<joey> it'd be back to where it was. </joey>
<joey> So my parents were just like, whatever. </joey>
<garnt> - Like I still have fucking Vietnam flashbacks </garnt>
<garnt> of my mom calling me like, </garnt>
<garnt> I know she's about to ask me to hoover the living room, </garnt>
<garnt> I know it. (chuckles) </garnt>
<garnt> I don't wanna come down right now. </garnt>
<connor> - This time I'm having Vietnam flashbacks. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - But yeah, I realized as an adult </connor>
<connor> the act of cleaning just like, it takes you all day. </connor>
<connor> And the reason I hate it is because it feels like, </connor>
<joey> you know when you do something productive, </joey>
<joey> you do a hard day of work or something, </joey>
<joey> or like even playing a video game, </joey>
<joey> you feel like you're making progress with your life. </joey>
<joey> - I don't know about the video game thing, but- </joey>
<garnt> - No, no, like when it... </garnt>
<garnt> Like for me, whenever I'm playing like a first person game, </garnt>
<joey> like a single-player game, making progress with this story. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, okay, okay, okay. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah something like that, - I don't know about that. </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - This guy. - Like a JRPG, right? </joey>
<joey> - They're like a JRPG. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> I feel you, I feel you. </joey>
<joey> - I love wasting my time. </joey>
<joey> - With cleaning, the whole.. </joey>
<joey> The entire concept of cleaning is that </joey>
<garnt> you're working towards making things zero again. </garnt>
<garnt> You're working towards zero. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - You're working towards making things normal again. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh! </connor>
<connor> - Oh, what happened? </connor>
<connor> - Oh, it switched off? </connor>
<connor> - Sorry, Joey laptop is shit. </connor>
<garnt> - But yeah, you're working towards making </garnt>
<garnt> the default state zero again. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right. - And I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> this doesn't feel good, </garnt>
<garnt> yet it takes so much time and energy to do it. </garnt>
<garnt> And no one prepared this for me as a kid. </garnt>
<joey> - It's like shoveling snow in a blizzard, right? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, right. </garnt>
<connor> - It's gonna form back up again. </connor>
<connor> So it's like, what's the point? </connor>
<connor> - I only used to clean on like... </connor>
<connor> This is how I would decide if I'm gonna clean this day. </connor>
<garnt> Is somebody coming to my house? </garnt>
<garnt> No, I'm not cleaning. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) Is somebody coming to- </garnt>
<garnt> - That is still my stay. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, is somebody coming to my house? </connor>
<connor> Fine, I'll clean. </connor>
<connor> You know what the best adult purchase I ever made </connor>
<connor> while I was in the UK? - What? </connor>
<connor> - What? - It was a good vacuum. </connor>
<connor> I was like, you know what? </connor>
<connor> What's all this hype around here's Dyson things? </connor>
<joey> What is all that hype? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I lived with a friend- </joey>
<joey> - It's just a brand. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I lived with a guy and his dad worked </joey>
<connor> for the Henry Hoovers. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. - You know those </connor>
<connor> like the fucking... </connor>
<connor> The ones with a smiley face. (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Little smiley face? </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know if these are in America, </garnt>
<garnt> but their everywhere in the UK. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right. - These things </garnt>
<garnt> they're like tanks, they don't die. </garnt>
<garnt> But they also kinda suck. </garnt>
<garnt> They don't suck good. </garnt>
<garnt> They should be sucking good. </garnt>
<garnt> (indistinct) (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm like, this guy in my house, </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, I wanna get a Dyson. </garnt>
<garnt> And he was like, "No, no, no mate. </garnt>
<garnt> "No, no. </garnt>
<garnt> "All you need is this thing." </garnt>
<garnt> And he fucking slaps it. </garnt>
<garnt> He's like, "It's a fucking unit, this thing is." </garnt>
<garnt> And I broke it within two weeks. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> That's my own thought there. </garnt>
<garnt> - What the fuck did you suck up? </garnt>
<connor> - The border. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Well, that'll do it. </connor>
<connor> - I was like, oh no, I have to get a new one. </connor>
<joey> Oh no. - Oh, no there's a puddle, </joey>
<joey> quick grab the hoover. </joey>
<joey> - Oh no, I have to get a new vacuum. </joey>
<joey> Fuck. (laughing) </joey>
<joey> No. </joey>
<joey> So I bought a Dyson, dude. </joey>
<connor> That shit cleaned up... </connor>
<joey> It could have, oh my God! </joey>
<joey> The carpet was a different color. </joey>
<connor> I was like, what have I been doing </connor>
<joey> my whole life? - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - I never believed in that Dyson shit too, </joey>
<connor> until I bought one a couple of years ago. </connor>
<connor> - Bro, it changes the game. </connor>
<connor> - Lets see how good these are? </connor>
<connor> And I do it, I was like, all right. </connor>
<joey> Not buying anything else anymore. </joey>
<joey> This is the one thing. - You crank that shit up </joey>
<joey> to max suck and like, oh, my God. </joey>
<joey> - It gives the good suck. </joey>
<garnt> - The shit. </garnt>
<garnt> - The max suck. - The max suck. </garnt>
<garnt> - Here's how I could... </garnt>
<garnt> Okay, this Dyson has all this bullshit </garnt>
<garnt> about rotating fucking things like 10 cylinder. </garnt>
<connor> It's a load of shit. </connor>
<connor> Let me say why it's good, right? </connor>
<connor> You know that one piece that always sticks </connor>
<connor> to the fucking carpet </connor>
<connor> that doesn't come off. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Dyson never has an issue getting that one crumb </connor>
<garnt> out of the carpet. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - That shit always comes out. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause the normal vacuums they don't get that shit out. </garnt>
<garnt> - No. - There's always that </garnt>
<garnt> one thing that for some reason won't come out. </garnt>
<joey> you gotta fucking- </joey>
<joey> - It's just like clinging onto the carpet </joey>
<garnt> with dear life, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - And then you're like, how many roll overs </garnt>
<garnt> am I gonna do this thing until I just admit defeat, </garnt>
<garnt> bend over, pull out of the carpet, like an animal, </garnt>
<connor> and feed it into the vacuum like it's some budget dog. </connor>
<connor> I'm like here you go, here you go. </connor>
<connor> Come on, take, take. </connor>
<connor> I don't like doing that. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - I don't wanna do that. </connor>
<connor> I'm not a peasant. </connor>
<connor> I shouldn't have to touch my carpet with my hands. </connor>
<connor> That's disgusting. </connor>
<joey> - Okay. (laughs) - So yeah, </joey>
<joey> that's how I can sell it to you. </joey>
<joey> You will never have to bend over. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - You'll never have to bend to the knee. </joey>
<joey> - Dude, it's amazing, dude. </joey>
<joey> And that was my gift to my parents when I went to Japan. </joey>
<garnt> Obviously I couldn't bring it with me. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right. - So I was like, parents, </garnt>
<garnt> you can have my priced possession. </garnt>
<garnt> - Here's a vacuum cleaner. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Here's a vacuum. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm like bending over, like giving them </garnt>
<connor> like the sword of Camelot. </connor>
<connor> Like, fucking here you go mother. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) Take it. </connor>
<connor> Take my Dyson V12 max suck edition. </connor>
<connor> All right. (chuckles) </connor>
<joey> To be fair, she thought it was all nonsense, </joey>
<joey> but she tried it. </joey>
<joey> She was like, "All right Connor, </joey>
<joey> "this is a pretty fucking good gift." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I get you. </joey>
<joey> - She was converted. </joey>
<connor> - You're welcome mum. - She was converted. </connor>
<connor> - Which is a lot like the biggest reason </connor>
<connor> I don't cook or I don't like cooking, </connor>
<connor> is because cooking... </connor>
<connor> I like cooking. </connor>
<connor> Cooking's great, I like the food, </connor>
<connor> Cleaning up, man. </connor>
<connor> It's like the ratio of time it takes to clean up, </connor>
<connor> versus eating good food, nice home cooked food, </connor>
<connor> it's not optimal. </connor>
<connor> It's so sub-optimized. </connor>
<garnt> The entire activity of cleaning </garnt>
<garnt> is just sub optimized in life. </garnt>
<connor> - You've become like me, I swear, recently. </connor>
<garnt> - No, no, no. </garnt>
<connor> - You're caring about the splits, the efficiency. </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Cleaning for me has always been suboptimal. </connor>
<garnt> I don't know why this is the one activity in life </garnt>
<garnt> that it's just like, this needs to be balanced. </garnt>
<garnt> There needs to be like a balanced patch in life </garnt>
<garnt> that just makes cleaning less effort. </garnt>
<joey> - It's like doing a 20-minute side quest </joey>
<garnt> to get to a two-minute main question. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah because it- </garnt>
<joey> - It just doesn't make sense. </joey>
<garnt> - It takes more like... </garnt>
<garnt> it's a side quest that takes more time and energy </garnt>
<garnt> than the fucking main quest. </garnt>
<garnt> You finish cleaning (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> and you're like, all right, time to get down to work. </garnt>
<joey> - It's like cool, I'm glad I spend 30 minutes </joey>
<joey> cooking this thing that took me two minutes eat. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Exactly, exactly, right? </garnt>
<joey> - I order a lot of Uber Eats, obviously. </joey>
<joey> And I caved and in Japan they have an Uber Eats pass, </joey>
<joey> where if you pay $9 a month, </joey>
<connor> you get free delivery fee. </connor>
<connor> So there's no delivery fee </connor>
<joey> which is like two bucks each time. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And I was like, fuck dude </connor>
<joey> am I really ordering this much fucking take out? </joey>
<joey> And I was like, yeah, I am. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. - And then I did it </connor>
<connor> in my head, right? </connor>
<connor> I did this thing where for three times when I cooked, </connor>
<joey> I timed it. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I didn't speed run it or anything. </joey>
<joey> I wasn't doing splits or anything. </joey>
<joey> I wasn't like- </joey>
<joey> - Expendedicts, 80%. - Yeah, I was... </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> This is the onion split. </garnt>
<garnt> Oh, I got a gold onion split. </garnt>
<connor> No, I wasn't doing that. </connor>
<connor> I just had a timer and I timed genuinely </connor>
<connor> how long it took, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - And then I timed </connor>
<connor> cleaning up, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Because I wanted to know, </connor>
<connor> based on my average earnings </connor>
<connor> for a month, right, (laughing) </connor>
<connor> is this technically, am I losing money by cooking myself? </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Right, right, right. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause I was like, this is how I can scientifically </connor>
<connor> justify to myself ordering takeout. </connor>
<connor> - Right, right. - Right? </connor>
<connor> So, I split it up, right? </connor>
<connor> I did the average... </connor>
<connor> No, I knew you guys would fucking laugh at me for this. </connor>
<garnt> - It's just hilarious that you went to this effort. </garnt>
<joey> - This is big brain. </joey>
<joey> - All right, well. - Do it yourself, right? </joey>
<joey> Go home now. - No, I don't have to </joey>
<joey> 'cause you've done it for us, right? </joey>
<garnt> - I do not enjoy cooking. </garnt>
<garnt> So that whole factor of enjoyment is gone. </garnt>
<connor> That's not a factor of my decision. </connor>
<garnt> - But do you enjoy the end result? </garnt>
<garnt> - I enjoy Uber Eats more. </garnt>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Bro you- </joey>
<joey> - No, there is something about a home cooked meal. </joey>
<joey> I don't know what it is. </joey>
<joey> - Okay to be fair- - 'Cause you can cook it </joey>
<garnt> exactly the way you wanted to. </garnt>
<joey> - There's a charm about a home cooked meal </joey>
<garnt> if you know how to cook. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. (laughing) </connor>
<connor> My cooking's mixed. </connor>
<garnt> - If you don't then its just like punishment. </garnt>
<joey> - You should try it sometimes Joey. </joey>
<connor> - No, no, I'm good. </connor>
<connor> - Just tell Akie to be like, yo. </connor>
<connor> - I only make like curry and Mexican. </connor>
<connor> That's all I make, </connor>
<connor> right? - (chuckles) Right. </connor>
<connor> - Honestly, that's all you need in my book. </connor>
<connor> - Right, right, right. - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> So Mexican food, </connor>
<connor> I can't really like make enough to store, </connor>
<connor> 'cause it's really expensive, the ingredients as well. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But curry, I can only make like enough for like six meals. </joey>
<joey> And that's just pretty nice </joey>
<connor> 'cause then that like the like time </connor>
<connor> versus money effort is fine. </connor>
<connor> But I don't cooking anything else, </connor>
<connor> because when I did this thing, </connor>
<connor> I found out that I was like wasting, </connor>
<garnt> if you did the time to money conversion </garnt>
<garnt> on my earnings to like... </garnt>
<garnt> It was like 40% less efficient to cook my own meals. </garnt>
<garnt> - Connor's got like a fucking Spreadsheet (indistinct). </garnt>
<garnt> - Because it was driving me insane, </garnt>
<garnt> because I was speaking to some people </garnt>
<garnt> who were like this fucking entrepreneur people. </garnt>
<connor> They're like, "I never cook or clean or any thing. </connor>
<connor> "I hire a maid, I get Uber Eats. </connor>
<connor> "I don't do any of that shit. </connor>
<connor> "It's a waste the time. </connor>
<connor> "I'm on that grind 24/7." </connor>
<connor> In reality, I would like an extra hour to play video games </connor>
<garnt> I'm not gonna lie. (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> Because in my life, an extra hour to play video games </garnt>
<garnt> it's quite a lot of time. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - So if I can get </garnt>
<garnt> an extra hour playing video games </garnt>
<garnt> and then I can then later on spend an extra hour working </garnt>
<connor> it's like, okay, it makes sense to just get Uber Eats </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - It's just Connor the podcast </connor>
<connor> trying to justify his spending. </connor>
<connor> Is that what this is? - No, no, no, no. </connor>
<connor> - Is this rich people problem? </connor>
<connor> I'm kidding, I'm joking. (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - It's entrepreneurial problems. (laughs) </connor>
<garnt> No, I completely- </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, this is why we became </garnt>
<garnt> fucking entrepreneurs, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - I've never fucking enjoyed </garnt>
<garnt> cleaning in my life. </garnt>
<garnt> - No. - I never will enjoy cleaning. </garnt>
<garnt> And- </garnt>
<joey> - You know what's the only, I guess housework quote, unquote </joey>
<joey> that I really enjoy? </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Doing the laundry. </joey>
<connor> - Okay, laundry is nice. </connor>
<connor> There's something about laundry, it hits man. </connor>
<connor> - I really like it. </connor>
<connor> It's like, I just put some music on, I'm outside- </connor>
<connor> - Oh, you still clean. </connor>
<garnt> You still clean. - Yeah, usually </garnt>
<garnt> it's a nice day and I'm just hanging up my clothes, </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm just like, hey, you know what? </garnt>
<garnt> - No. - Stress free. </garnt>
<garnt> - Bro- - Sub-optimize. </garnt>
<joey> - Listen, listen. </joey>
<garnt> (laughing) - No. No, no, no. </garnt>
<garnt> - This is why Sydney does the laundry. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my God. - Thank you Sydney by the way. </garnt>
<garnt> - This is why I get a woman to do it. </garnt>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<connor> I laugh sometimes, 'cause my mom's like, </connor>
<connor> "You're gonna need to learn how to do </connor>
<joey> "the laundry someday, someday." </joey>
<joey> And then Sydney come- </joey>
<garnt> - Formigation family bond. (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - And then Sydney comes along and it's like, I love laundry. </connor>
<garnt> Laundry is so relaxing. </garnt>
<garnt> - It is, it is. </garnt>
<joey> - I'm like, you- </joey>
<joey> - I'll think of thing of like your old school teacher </joey>
<joey> being like you're not gonna carry a calculator </joey>
<joey> with you every day. </joey>
<joey> It's like (laughs), about that? </joey>
<connor> - I'm gonna say it dude, </connor>
<connor> when you have fresh sheets not only is that sleep the best. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's the best wank you'll have in like </connor>
<connor> a whole month dude, (laughs) </connor>
<connor> in fresh sheets, dude. </connor>
<connor> - You're disgusting. - Wait, you wank away. </connor>
<joey> - Why am I disgusting Meilyne. </joey>
<joey> - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, </joey>
<joey> time out, time out. </joey>
<connor> - That was... </connor>
<connor> Sorry, you can (indistinct). </connor>
<joey> - Are you like wanking onto your sheets. </joey>
<joey> Are you like jizzing on to it? </joey>
<joey> - I'm outside on the fucking... </joey>
<joey> No I'm kidding. </joey>
<joey> Now, when you put them on, it's so fresh, </joey>
<garnt> the room smells nice, and it feels comfortable. </garnt>
<garnt> You're like, ah, time to wank. </garnt>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - That was the biggest they had us in the first half </connor>
<connor> I've ever had on this podcast. </connor>
<garnt> 'Cause I was gonna be like, yeah I know exactly what you... </garnt>
<connor> Wait, what the fuck. </connor>
<garnt> What are you saying? - Are you saying </garnt>
<garnt> you don't like that. </garnt>
<garnt> Come on, Garnt. - I don't jerk off in my bed. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I don't jerk off in my bed, </garnt>
<garnt> so that's probably why. - Okay, well if you have sex </garnt>
<connor> in it as well, its also great. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, that's not what you said though. </garnt>
<garnt> You said fucking (indistinct). </garnt>
<joey> - If you would have said that, </joey>
<garnt> then we would be like, yes I agree Connor, but- </garnt>
<connor> - Same thing, same thing. </connor>
<connor> The same climax in the bed, fresh sheets, </connor>
<connor> all the same thing, dude. </connor>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - No, I love fresh sheets. </garnt>
<garnt> I hate the process of getting fresh sheets. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, like putting on bed sheets- </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, you've seen my setup. </garnt>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Wait, what's your setup? </joey>
<joey> - Connor. (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Okay wait. (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Connor has like... </joey>
<joey> Okay, you look at Connor's gaming setup, </joey>
<joey> it's like perfect. </joey>
<joey> Everything is like optimized. </joey>
<joey> Then you see his bed, </joey>
<joey> and it's like, one of those Reddit reacts </joey>
<garnt> to some of the worst fucking gaming setups you've ever seen. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like a $2 bed set up. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - You just have like a fucking towel </connor>
<connor> on your fucking mattress. </connor>
<connor> - No, no. </connor>
<connor> - So there's literally nothing in my bedroom except a bed. </connor>
<connor> And there's like, literally nothing. </connor>
<connor> There's like this- - Why not? </connor>
<connor> - I don't know, it's for my fucking bedroom, </connor>
<joey> I just sleep in there and do anything else, </joey>
<garnt> that's worth it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, your bed frame is like broken, </garnt>
<connor> isn't it? - Yeah, it's broken </connor>
<connor> as well, yeah. (Joey laughs) </connor>
<garnt> 'Cause I bought the cheapest one on Amazon </garnt>
<connor> when I moved here. </connor>
<connor> - Right. - Cause, moving is expensive, </connor>
<connor> right? - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And it was so expensive that I was like, </connor>
<connor> fuck I gotta cut cost. </connor>
<connor> But I regret it because I bought a $200 bed </connor>
<connor> and that was the mattress combined. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - And this shit fucking awful. </connor>
<connor> All the Springs are fucked, the beds broken. </connor>
<joey> - It's literally- </joey>
<joey> - You were talking so much about like, </joey>
<joey> yeah, why would you buy a $20 headset, </joey>
<joey> when you can just buy a $100 one </joey>
<connor> and you get your money's worth? </connor>
<joey> - Here's the thing, here's the thing, </joey>
<connor> I had that philosophy, but again moving kind of like </connor>
<connor> distorts your price range. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Because you're spending like... </connor>
<connor> I got to put down like a fucking 4K deposit on this shit, </connor>
<joey> the flights are this much, I had to pay shipping for my PC. </joey>
<joey> Like I was spending a lot of money. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, fuck! </joey>
<joey> I'm kinda losing a lot of money. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I've gotta start saving costs. </joey>
<joey> I can't buy a 10K bed frame. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right, right, right. - So I bought </joey>
<joey> the cheapest one on Amazon, </joey>
<connor> which I regretted within about two weeks. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> Actually no, immediately when I built it, </connor>
<connor> 'cause building it was a pain in the fucking ass. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I could tell when I was building it, </connor>
<connor> I'm like, oh no, this isn't even like budget plywood. </connor>
<connor> This is like the throw away plywood that they would use- </connor>
<garnt> - This is like the foamy plywood. </garnt>
<connor> - It's the worst. </connor>
<connor> - I remember seeing the exact bed frame </connor>
<garnt> you bought on Amazon, and it was like two and a half stars. </garnt>
<connor> And that's when I knew that- </connor>
<connor> - Listen. (laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - Mistakes were made. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - I just wanted something </garnt>
<garnt> and I wanted it now, and I've regretted it so much. </garnt>
<garnt> But anyway, what happened was, </garnt>
<connor> the most ghetto thing that I have </connor>
<connor> is that I'm actually using a bed sheet </connor>
<connor> as like a mattress cover. </connor>
<connor> - Wait what? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. (laughs) - So what happened was, right- </joey>
<joey> - How do you stretch that sheet over it? </joey>
<joey> - Okay, actually with a lot like the fucking power of Zeus, </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> I'm like (groans). </joey>
<connor> I'm like pulling the Red Sea back together </connor>
<connor> when I'm trying to put these bed sheet. </connor>
<connor> It's a zip. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - It goes all around </connor>
<garnt> my mattress. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh, you fucking zipped it around your mattress. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You like put it in? </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> - Right, right. </joey>
<joey> - You just fucking like condomed your mattress. </joey>
<connor> - What the fuck did you do? </connor>
<connor> - I'm like fucking Spartacus, when he's kicking the guy. </connor>
<connor> I'm like doing that to my mattress </connor>
<connor> every time I wash it. </connor>
<garnt> (groans) - Wait, </garnt>
<garnt> you have to do that every time you wash your mattress </garnt>
<connor> as well, sorry, wash your bed sheet? </connor>
<connor> - So I wash my bed sheet as well, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - So I have- - So you have to fucking </joey>
<joey> strip this thing out and then wash it, </joey>
<garnt> and then condom it back in. </garnt>
<connor> - Because- - I feel so sorry </connor>
<connor> for your bed sheet, man. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Its very stretch. </connor>
<connor> Okay, but also I do avoid that annoying thing. </connor>
<connor> This is like the only plus in this. </connor>
<connor> I've gone to the many negatives. </connor>
<connor> The only plus is that, you know that fucking annoying thing </connor>
<connor> when you're sleeping and the bed sheet comes off </connor>
<connor> in the corner? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You can never get it back on </connor>
<connor> unless you actually get off the bed. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I fucking hate that, that sucks. </connor>
<connor> Never have that issue. </connor>
<joey> - Because the entire thing is wrapped. (laughs) </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, its zipped up around it. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no. </garnt>
<garnt> I can see like the benefits of it, </garnt>
<joey> because the best bedsheets are the ones that are like </joey>
<joey> super tight, they're firm. - Firm, firm. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - If I see wrinkles </connor>
<connor> on that sheet, </connor>
<garnt> (sighs) </garnt>
<garnt> that's like instant- </garnt>
<joey> - You know it's soft too because sometimes you'll wake up </joey>
<garnt> and on your body you have imprints. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, I hate that. - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - And then I'm just like, what the fuck is that? </joey>
<connor> - Instant soft sheet right there. </connor>
<garnt> - I do have a backup bed sheet, </garnt>
<garnt> which is actually like proper, but I refuse to use it </garnt>
<joey> unless I'm desperate because I love this one, </joey>
<connor> and I like even putting it back on. </connor>
<joey> - You love fucking turning your mattress into a beanbag. </joey>
<connor> - So here's how I ended up with bed sheet as my duvet </connor>
<garnt> and it goes all around my mattress. </garnt>
<garnt> I fully put it all around my mattress and zip it up </garnt>
<garnt> all around. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - So when I moved here, I went to Nitori, </connor>
<connor> which is kinda like Japanese Ikea, </connor>
<connor> which I think we mentioned before. </connor>
<connor> I go there, right. </connor>
<connor> So I buy the pillows, the pillow sheets. </connor>
<connor> I buy the duvet and I go to the staff member, </connor>
<connor> and I ask him. </connor>
<connor> And like I'm making sure I've got Google translate, man. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, duvet or like whatever they're fucking called, </connor>
<connor> blanket, whatever? </connor>
<connor> I did not say fucking futon. </connor>
<connor> I did not say futon. </connor>
<joey> I'm showing him, I'm like this. </joey>
<joey> I even showed a picture. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, I want this. </joey>
<joey> - Like a matrix, </joey>
<joey> like a couple of matrix. - This part. </joey>
<joey> Which one is this? </joey>
<joey> Then like broken Japanese with Google translate. </joey>
<joey> It's like, oh, no problem fam. </joey>
<joey> I got you. </joey>
<joey> Points me to this, I buy it. </joey>
<joey> I get home, what do you think it is? </joey>
<joey> It's a fucking futon. </joey>
<joey> And he saw me buy the futon, another futon, </joey>
<joey> it wasn't even in the same section as well, </joey>
<joey> so that's where I was confused when I got home, </joey>
<joey> so I'm like, wait, this was in a different section. </joey>
<joey> Why don't we have two different futon types? </joey>
<joey> What is this? </joey>
<connor> So I have two fucking futon covers. </connor>
<joey> So I have the bed sheet and then I have, </joey>
<joey> yeah, the mattress. (Joey laughs) </joey>
<connor> So I got home and I needed to sleep. </connor>
<joey> So I'm like, well, fuck it. </joey>
<joey> It's going in one way or another. </joey>
<joey> It's going over my bed. </joey>
<connor> I think Garnt helped me the first time get it on. </connor>
<joey> This was a two-person- </joey>
<connor> - It was a two-person job. </connor>
<connor> - Like how the fucking do you get that on yourself? </connor>
<garnt> - So, the stuff we got... </garnt>
<garnt> Okay. - I thought- </garnt>
<connor> - Do you like cold, Garnt every time? </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - You Just assumed that you've got a duvet now? </garnt>
<connor> - I've mastered the technique of doing it, right. </connor>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<connor> Okay, this is what I do. </connor>
<connor> To get it off it's easy. </connor>
<garnt> 'Cause it's like you're letting- </garnt>
<garnt> - It wants to get off. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like letting a pig out of clothes. </garnt>
<garnt> That sheet wants to come up. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. - Get it back on, right? </connor>
<connor> Okay, first of all, this is the setup. </connor>
<connor> I flip my mattress to the side. </connor>
<joey> So it's upright. </joey>
<joey> And then I fucking pull over half. </joey>
<joey> And I flip it upside down the other end, pull it up. </joey>
<connor> And then this basically, what happens is that </connor>
<connor> it's up to here, right? </connor>
<connor> So this is horizontal way, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. - I've got to basically force </connor>
<connor> this sheet together. </connor>
<connor> Grab it together and hold it. </connor>
<connor> And it hurts my hands 'cause it's tight. </connor>
<connor> I gotta like slowly pull a little bit by little bit. </connor>
<connor> And if I let go, it all goes back. </connor>
<connor> So I have to keep grabbing a little bit and zipping, </connor>
<connor> grabbing a little bit and zipping. </connor>
<connor> It's a pain in the fucking ass and I hate it. </connor>
<garnt> - Why don't you just get a fucking duvet? </garnt>
<connor> - It's like putting on the world's largest condom. </connor>
<connor> - No, no dude. </connor>
<garnt> (indistinct) is the bed sheet. </garnt>
<connor> - Just get a proper bed sheet. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, just get a proper bed sheet. </connor>
<connor> - Because, you know what? </connor>
<connor> I love the firmness of it. </connor>
<connor> I love how tight it is around my bed- </connor>
<joey> - Just get a fucking bed sheet. </joey>
<joey> - At this point, you might as well </joey>
<joey> not even have a fucking bed sheet. </joey>
<joey> - Why, why? </joey>
<garnt> I like it. - No, no, no. </garnt>
<garnt> - There's a difference between having no bed sheet </garnt>
<garnt> and having a firm bed sheet. </garnt>
<connor> - I sweat like a motherfucker. </connor>
<connor> I need a bed sheet. - Right. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. - So then just buy </joey>
<joey> a fucking bed... </joey>
<joey> It's like a thousand yen. </joey>
<connor> - I don't know, I've kind of gotten used to it now. </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> I kinda like it now though- </connor>
<garnt> - Its not a struggle to him obviously </garnt>
<garnt> - This man literally made a Spreadsheet </garnt>
<garnt> trying to optimize cooking </garnt>
<garnt> and he can't even buy a fucking bed sheet. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well. (roars) (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> Because then I gotta optimize that. </garnt>
<garnt> That's another thing I would optimize. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm sick of it man. </garnt>
<garnt> Well, to be fair, </garnt>
<garnt> that whole organization with the Uber Eats </garnt>
<garnt> was just to justify to myself why I can have </garnt>
<garnt> pad thai three times a week. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right, right. - To be honest. (chuckles) </garnt>
<connor> - I like the final result of cooking </connor>
<connor> and cleaning fucking bedsheets. </connor>
<connor> But like having to change your duvet, </connor>
<connor> do you find it annoying? </connor>
<garnt> It's like fiddliest fucking thing ever </garnt>
<garnt> to like take the duvet off and like putting it back on, </garnt>
<garnt> and having to make sure every corner </garnt>
<garnt> is perfectly situated on every- </garnt>
<connor> - If you have a zipped up one </connor>
<garnt> every corner will be. - No, no, no. </garnt>
<connor> - It doesn't have a choice. </connor>
<garnt> - Not the bed sheet, the actual fucking blanket part. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh, that's easy, 'cause the ones in Japan, big brain. </connor>
<joey> They come with the holes at the end, </joey>
<joey> so you can just flip it up inside, out, </joey>
<joey> grab the thing, and then. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that's what I always do. </joey>
<joey> - Did you know you could do that? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - No. </joey>
<joey> What? - That's what I've done </joey>
<joey> ever since I was little </joey>
<joey> - So you turn it inside out. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I do that. </joey>
<garnt> - And then you, like a little ghost, you put it over you- </garnt>
<garnt> (indistinct) with both hands. - Yeah, I do that. </garnt>
<garnt> - And you grab the ends of the futon, </garnt>
<garnt> and then you just like flip it over, </garnt>
<joey> and then shake it down. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah then shake it down. - And then release. </joey>
<garnt> - But like for me, I don't know if- </garnt>
<garnt> - Isn't that that what hotels do? </garnt>
<connor> Yeah, 'cause they gotta speedrun it, </connor>
<connor> 'cause they're doing like a hundred rooms. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know if my like... </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I think I have like my fucking nightmare </connor>
<connor> where my duvet is not the same size as my blanket. </connor>
<connor> It's slightly bigger. (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> So I always have like left- - I hate that, I hate that. </connor>
<joey> - So you have like a little bit of fabric </joey>
<joey> left over. - Oh my God, </joey>
<garnt> It triggers me so much, man. </garnt>
<joey> - I hate the ones like... </joey>
<connor> Our old fucking duvet it was the perfect size. </connor>
<connor> But the problem was is that it would... </connor>
<garnt> The duvet inside would move around. </garnt>
<garnt> - I hate that. - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - So like one end of the duvet would just have like, </garnt>
<garnt> just fucking scrunched up </garnt>
<garnt> so that you try and pull it over, it's just sheet. </garnt>
<joey> And I'm just like fuck, where the fucking duvet go? </joey>
<connor> - This why I think you are most likely </connor>
<connor> to have a mental breakdown when you're doing your bedsheets, </connor>
<connor> or putting your duvet on. </connor>
<garnt> I don't know what it is- </garnt>
<garnt> - That's why I fucking hate it, man. </garnt>
<connor> That's why I fucking hate it. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know what it is about putting sheets on, </connor>
<garnt> but what if it just doesn't work? </garnt>
<garnt> You're like, fuck it. </garnt>
<garnt> I just wanna cry and just be like, why won't it work? </garnt>
<garnt> Why won't it work? </garnt>
<connor> Why is my day going bad. </connor>
<garnt> - I used to work in a hotel lodges </garnt>
<garnt> in like ski fields and stuff, </garnt>
<garnt> and I had to do that shit every fucking day. </garnt>
<joey> - Really? - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> So I basically- </joey>
<connor> - Do you shovel shit out of the drains </connor>
<connor> and then you gotta go do that? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - I was basically- - That sounds like </garnt>
<garnt> my nightmare. - Yeah, so at first </garnt>
<garnt> I fucking hated it. </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, oh- </garnt>
<connor> - And then he came to adopt the sheet. </connor>
<connor> - There's 30 rooms in this hotel, </connor>
<connor> that doesn't seem too bad. </connor>
<connor> Five rooms in and you're like, </connor>
<connor> fuck man, I wanna go home. </connor>
<joey> Just fucking around with the duvet. </joey>
<joey> It's just like not going in. </joey>
<garnt> I have 25 rooms left to do this. </garnt>
<connor> - I would actually have a mental breakdown </connor>
<joey> if I just do like five sheets in like one hour. </joey>
<connor> I would actually be like, no, I don't think life </connor>
<connor> is for (indistinct). - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - I'm like, I'm not getting paid enough for this shit. </garnt>
<garnt> - I would actually work in- - I'd rather shovel shit. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, I'd rather shovel shit </joey>
<garnt> and like fucking get shouted at McDonald's </garnt>
<garnt> than do five duvets in a row, man. </garnt>
<joey> - So now I'm just used to it </joey>
<joey> 'cause I've lived through that fucking Vietnam war. </joey>
<connor> - What didn't you do at this job, Joey? </connor>
<joey> Jesus Christ. (Joey scoffs) </joey>
<joey> - I didn't work in the kitchen, that's for sure. (laughs) </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, because there's something fucking special </garnt>
<garnt> about hotel duvets. </garnt>
<joey> Getting in like a hotel bed </joey>
<joey> and just feeling like you're in a fucking straight jacket, </joey>
<joey> I don't know, man. </joey>
<garnt> I fucking love that feeling. </garnt>
<joey> - I don't like it when hotels do that, </joey>
<connor> when they fucking- - Yeah, because you get </connor>
<connor> in the bed and you're like, what is this, </connor>
<connor> the world's fucking strongest man for weight pulling? </connor>
<joey> - You just have to fucking like shimmy yourself into it. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. - I love that feeling. </garnt>
<garnt> You feel like fucking safe. </garnt>
<garnt> You feel covered. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, I feel like I'm in a straight jacket. </garnt>
<garnt> - This is my safe zone right now </garnt>
<garnt> and no one can fucking touch me. </garnt>
<connor> I feel like a moth. </connor>
<connor> I feel like a fucking caterpillar </connor>
<connor> who is like about to fucking- </connor>
<garnt> - No! (laughs) - Okay, what about... </garnt>
<connor> I hate it when they tuck half the fucking duvet </connor>
<garnt> under the front of the bed. </garnt>
<connor> So you're getting in and it's like you're trying </connor>
<connor> to fucking tow a car when you're pulling this sheet out. </connor>
<connor> You're like this on the bed. </connor>
<garnt> (groans) </garnt>
<garnt> - I just shimmy myself in and I'm just like, ah. </garnt>
<joey> I feel like I'm back in my mom's room right now. </joey>
<garnt> Nothing can harm me. </garnt>
<garnt> - I can't even shimmy myself in. </garnt>
<joey> It's like I'm trying to get into pants five sizes too small. </joey>
<connor> It's just like, fuck I gotta get in. </connor>
<connor> - I feel bad as well when they put like a cloth on the bed, </connor>
<connor> I don't know, like that sheet they put </connor>
<connor> on the front of the bed. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, get rid of that. </connor>
<connor> Get that fucking out of here. </connor>
<joey> - Oh the thing at like the end? </joey>
<connor> - It's like a linen thing or something. </connor>
<joey> I don't know what it is. </joey>
<joey> - You know what that's for? </joey>
<connor> - What is that for? - It's for... </connor>
<connor> Apparently it's an American thing. </connor>
<joey> Apparently it's so that you can wear shoes on the bed. </joey>
<joey> (gasping) </joey>
<joey> - Oh! </joey>
<joey> - I'm about to leave right now. </joey>
<garnt> - So, you probably seen it before in hotels </garnt>
<garnt> where there's just like this one weird </garnt>
<connor> like fucking tablecloth size- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah I hate that thing. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] At the end of the bed, right? </connor>
<connor> - That's for shoes? </connor>
<joey> - That's the shoes. </joey>
<connor> - But they do that in Japanese hotels </connor>
<connor> where you have to take your shoes off at the front. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, that's what I don't understand. </joey>
<garnt> - Why? (laughs) </garnt>
<joey> - Okay, okay. - I understand </joey>
<joey> in American hotels- </joey>
<connor> - As the only white person here- </connor>
<connor> - No, no, no. (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> Don't put this on me. </connor>
<connor> - I need your opinion. - I was raised correctly. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - Shoes on sofas and beds. </garnt>
<connor> - No, it- </connor>
<garnt> - Does that trigger you, </garnt>
<connor> as it should? - Yes, yes. Of course. </connor>
<connor> My parents would hit me if I did that. </connor>
<connor> You kidding me? </connor>
<joey> - I've never understood. </joey>
<joey> I always thought, you know when you'd watch </joey>
<connor> "The Simpsons" or like American TV shows or whatever, </connor>
<garnt> how they would take their shoes off before going to bed. </garnt>
<garnt> They would like keep their shoes on the side of the bed, </garnt>
<garnt> and then when they wake up the first thing they would do </garnt>
<joey> is put shoes on. </joey>
<joey> I just thought that was like parody. </joey>
<joey> I didn't actually think Americans did that. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, it's not just America, </garnt>
<garnt> it's most of the fucking West. </garnt>
<joey> As an Asian, I'm just like, </joey>
<garnt> why did the West just normalize </garnt>
<joey> war cries? - I'm like, why your like </joey>
<joey> dirty fucking gross ass shoes on the carpet? </joey>
<joey> That shit's gross. (laughs) </joey>
<connor> - That's what blows my mind. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, you are literally dragging </connor>
<joey> daily shit into your carpet by bringing your shoes in. </joey>
<joey> It drives me insane. </joey>
<joey> - And then people complain being like, </joey>
<garnt> oh man, I hate carpet because it's so dirty. </garnt>
<joey> I'm like, well, yeah cause you're put your own shoes. </joey>
<joey> - Whenever I would go to a friend's house </joey>
<joey> and they would be like... </joey>
<garnt> And I go to his house and he would be like, </garnt>
<garnt> "It's okay, you can keep your shoes on." </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, motherfucker, tell me to take my shoes off. </garnt>
<garnt> I want to take my shoes off, man. </garnt>
<garnt> - I would actually (indistinct). </garnt>
<garnt> I'm not a fucking animal. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm not gonna bring dirt into the house, all right? </garnt>
<connor> - I don't know what it is, </connor>
<connor> but when I'm shitting with shoes on in somebody's house, </connor>
<joey> it feel so weird. (Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> I feel like I'm in a public restroom. </joey>
<connor> I don't wanna shit with my shoes on. </connor>
<connor> I wanna be comfortable, man. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, this shit drives me insane. </connor>
<garnt> And there's people... </garnt>
<garnt> There'll be people call me and be like, </garnt>
<garnt> "I wear my shoes in bed." </garnt>
<garnt> Stop. - Stop. </garnt>
<garnt> - Stop. - For your own sake, </garnt>
<connor> please stop. - It's gross. </connor>
<connor> - Please. </connor>
<joey> If you wanna go against the Geneva Conventions, just do it. </joey>
<joey> Do it in your own fucking- (Joey laughs) </joey>
<garnt> - It goes against basic human rights. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I know right. (laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - To wear shoes in bed. </joey>
<connor> - I love all our fans except for the ones </connor>
<connor> that wear shoes to their bed. </connor>
<connor> I'm kidding, I'm kidding. (laughing) </connor>
<joey> - All my homies hate people who wear shoes in bed. </joey>
<connor> - My God. </connor>
<connor> I went to fucking... </connor>
<connor> Jesus, my editor Evan, </connor>
<connor> I went to his house and that was disgusting. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> He had like a five inch thick carpet. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Right? </connor>
<connor> - I don't know what color this carpet was supposed to be, </connor>
<connor> but it definitely wasn't the color that it came as. </connor>
<connor> This shit was vile, dude. </connor>
<connor> Evan, fix that fucking carpet man. </connor>
<connor> And they all will wore like the dirtiest shoes inside, </connor>
<connor> and I was like, Evan, I can't, I can't. </connor>
<joey> - Right, I'm like have you not heard of house slippers? </joey>
<connor> - I know right? - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - If you have to wear something, </connor>
<connor> just wear slippers. - Why? </connor>
<connor> What's wrong with bare feet, man or socks. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, but even if, dude slippers, it's fine, </joey>
<joey> it's clean. - Okay. </joey>

<garnt> - Going back to the topic of beds and everything. </garnt>
<garnt> Opinions on pajamas. </garnt>
<garnt> Do any of you guys wear pajamas? </garnt>
<garnt> - I sleep naked. </garnt>
<joey> - Specifically like pajamas. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, just pajamas. </joey>
<joey> - No, for me it's just like underwear </joey>
<joey> and some random T-shirt. - All right, good. </joey>
<garnt> I don't understand pajamas at all. </garnt>
<garnt> And some people- </garnt>
<connor> - Do you wear a T-shirt to bed? </connor>
<connor> I don't wanna wear... </connor>
<connor> Why would you wear a T-shirt To bed? </connor>
<joey> - Unless it's like fucking stinking hot, </joey>
<joey> like in the summer, I'll wear no shirt. </joey>
<garnt> But most of the time </garnt>
<joey> I have to wear a shirt. - Max comfort </joey>
<joey> is the least amount of clothes </joey>
<connor> you could wear, basically. </connor>
<connor> And you basically only wear boxers </connor>
<garnt> so you're fucking dangly bits don't go everywhere. </garnt>
<connor> That's pretty much </connor>
<garnt> the only reason though. - I like the freedom though. </garnt>
<joey> Let them loose. (laughs) </joey>
<connor> I'm sleeping, I wanna be comfy. </connor>
<joey> - No like, I don't know. </joey>
<joey> I like wearing a T-shirt because sometimes in the morning </joey>
<connor> the weather can completely change. </connor>
<connor> Especially nowadays in the winter, </connor>
<connor> I'm a little bit too cold if I don't wear, </connor>
<connor> at least a T-shirt, even with the heater on. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But yeah, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> - What about when you stay like a friend's house? </connor>
<connor> Do you wear a T-shirt when you sleep? </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I'm just like immediately, I'm like, </connor>
<connor> right I'm stripping. </connor>
<joey> I'm getting- - It depends how close I am </joey>
<joey> to that friend, really? </joey>
<connor> - It doesn't matter who they are, right? </connor>
<connor> If I'm staying in your house, I'm sorry. </connor>
<joey> I'll sleep with boxers on, I'll humor you. </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> I won't get my junk everywhere. </joey>
<joey> I'll sleep with boxers on. </joey>
<joey> - So like you can just not wear a shirt. </joey>
<joey> - I can't sleep with the T-shirt on. </joey>
<joey> - Why? - Why? </joey>
<connor> - I don't know, I feel like I'm outside still? </connor>
<connor> When I take the T-shirt off, in my head it signifies, </connor>
<connor> okay we're going to bed or I'm going in the bath. </connor>
<joey> - Are you the type of person who like </joey>
<connor> when doing a serious heavy shit, </connor>

<joey> I've had moments where the shit's been so powerful </joey>
<joey> and stressful where I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> I have to take my shirt off. </joey>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - And I don't know if it's like- </garnt>
<connor> - I don't do that, but I know people who do. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I don't know if it's like placebo, but it works. </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>

<garnt> on this shit. </garnt>
<garnt> (screaming) Just like. </garnt>
<garnt> (groans) </garnt>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - The only time when I'm like- </connor>
<connor> - I can't believe </connor>
<connor> this is real. - If I'm ever vomiting, </connor>
<connor> I wanna be naked. </connor>
<connor> - What? </connor>
<connor> - Because I don't wanna get that shit anywhere </connor>
<connor> or smell my clothes. </connor>
<connor> So I'm like, I'll just get naked </connor>
<connor> and I'll hug this toilet bowl until I'm done. </connor>
<joey> - But if your hugging it, then there's no way </joey>
<joey> you're gonna fucking blah onto your shirt, right? </joey>
<connor> - I just don't want in my clothes at all, man. </connor>
<connor> - Right. - I'm like, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> And also, it feels better. </connor>
<connor> I don't know why. </connor>
<garnt> I need to get like... (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> This is restrictive, I'm getting stuffy in these. </garnt>
<garnt> I just wanna vomit. (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> (roaring) </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know, when i was to have like- </garnt>
<connor> - How did you vomit without your clothes? </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> 'Cause every time I've seen you vomit you have clothes on. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yeah, true. </garnt>
<garnt> I was (indistinct) drunk. (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> But, when I'm like... </garnt>
<connor> If you're really sick, like when I had food poisoning </connor>
<connor> back in like whenever, </connor>
<connor> when they thought I had the rona, </connor>
<connor> I was vomiting and I had to be naked. </connor>
<connor> 'cause I was like, otherwise, </connor>
<connor> I felt like it'd get off my clothes. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, that's gross. </connor>
<joey> It's so fucked. - Little did you know </joey>
<joey> that during the chess tournament, </joey>
<joey> every time you went to take a shit, </joey>
<connor> he just fucking rip off his suit. </connor>
<joey> - That was awful when I was taking shit with the suit on. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, please, please don't get it on the suit. </joey>
<joey> - That's the worst timing to take a shit. </joey>
<joey> Is when your in a full suit. </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<garnt> You're like, ah. - I'd like tuck it in, </garnt>
<garnt> belt it up. - It's like, ah. </garnt>
<garnt> It's gross. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause for me wearing a T-shirt in bed </garnt>
<garnt> is just like, sometimes, especially in the winter </garnt>
<garnt> you wake up and it's like a cold fucking morning. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - I love that. </garnt>
<garnt> - And like how do you escape your duvet at that point? </garnt>
<connor> - It's like, I don't know, being branded. </connor>
<joey> You're like just fucking do it. </joey>
<connor> Just do it. - No. </connor>
<connor> For me it's just like gravity has increased tenfold </connor>
<connor> in this bed. (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<garnt> I'm like experiencing 10 G's in this bed right now. </garnt>
<joey> It's like, I actually can't get out. </joey>
<garnt> - It literally takes me like an hour </garnt>
<garnt> to get out of bed in this case. </garnt>
<connor> - I have like the fucking "Call of Duty" text </connor>
<connor> popping up on my screen, mission, get to the shower. </connor>
<connor> Like that's what it's like for me. </connor>
<joey> - I have to do like one limb at a time to be like, </joey>
<connor> all right, let me just get my right arm out </connor>
<connor> and once that's like room temperature </connor>
<connor> then I'll get my right leg out. </connor>
<joey> It's like, all right, now I can go. </joey>
<connor> - I used to have like a heated thing </connor>
<connor> that you could put under your bed. </connor>
<connor> But that just made me lazier, so I got rid of it. </connor>
<joey> - (chuckles) What do you mean? </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause I never wanted to leave the bed. </joey>
<joey> - Like a heated bed. </joey>
<joey> - Like a heated thing under the mattress </joey>
<joey> so that it was always warm. </joey>
<joey> But then I was like, this is also a fire hazard </joey>
<connor> and yeah, I just don't... </connor>
<connor> I can not get out of bed with this thing. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah that's true. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, okay, have we talked about a kotatsu before? </garnt>
<joey> - I don't remember. - I don't think we have. </joey>
<connor> Explain them to the audience Garnt. </connor>
<connor> - So they watch anime, you watch anime, </connor>
<connor> you know what a kotatsu is. (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> If you don't know what a kotatsu is, </connor>
<connor> it's basically like a heated coffee table </connor>
<garnt> where it's like a little coffee table </garnt>
<garnt> that has blankets around it and you put your legs in it </garnt>
<garnt> and you put them under, </garnt>
<garnt> and it's all nice and cozy, and warm. </garnt>
<garnt> And it is amazing. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't know about amazing. </connor>
<garnt> - I think it's fucking amazing. </garnt>
<joey> - There's a few logistical issues </joey>
<joey> that crop up with kotatsu. </joey>
<connor> Well, how many legs can fit under there? </connor>
<garnt> - Depends on how big the table is? </garnt>
<garnt> - Depends on how big the table is? </garnt>
<garnt> - It's normally not that big. </garnt>
<connor> You can comfortably probably fit two people's legs. </connor>
<garnt> - No. </garnt>
<connor> - Are you comparing this to my kotatsu </connor>
<garnt> which is fucking tiny? </garnt>
<connor> - No, no, no, like a normal kotatsu. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I wanna stretch my legs fully out </connor>
<connor> underneath that thing. </connor>
<connor> You can only really fit like two before you start </connor>
<joey> touch people's legs. </joey>
<joey> I don't wanna touch Joey's legs, </joey>
<joey> their disgusting. - Why not? </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Disgusting. - All my homies touch legs. </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<garnt> - I don't wanna play footsie with Joey under the table </garnt>
<garnt> when I'm playing Uno. (laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - I want to. </connor>
<connor> - Fucking stop. </connor>
<connor> - I wanna twiddle toes while I call Uno. </connor>
<connor> - What if you don't know them super... </connor>
<joey> Oh you pretty do know the (indistinct). </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<garnt> - If you sharing a kotatsu. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm not sharing a kotatsu with a fucking stranger. </garnt>
<connor> - Why not? - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - That's weird. </joey>
<joey> - That should be in a restaurant. </joey>
<joey> - That's weird. (laughs) </joey>
<garnt> - It's nice, but then also I find that it's like... </garnt>
<garnt> I know you can turn it up and down, </garnt>
<garnt> but it's either like I would rather the room be hot </garnt>
<garnt> than my legs be hot. </garnt>
<garnt> Does that make sense? </garnt>
<connor> - No, I would not rather that. - No? No? </connor>
<garnt> - Okay, I literally had this problem recently </garnt>
<garnt> which is why I get reminded why I really </garnt>
<connor> don't fucking like winter, right? </connor>
<garnt> So unlike these boys, I fucking hate the cold </garnt>
<connor> and I hate winter. - I love the cold. </connor>
<connor> - I love the cold. - And the reason </connor>
<connor> I hate it is because, you're in a cold room </connor>
<connor> and you wanna get comfortable, </connor>
<connor> so what'd you do, you put it on the heater, </connor>
<connor> but I hate the feeling of a stuffy room. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Right. </connor>
<joey> - Like this room's getting bit- </joey>
<garnt> - Have you considered- - You're from a </garnt>
<joey> stuffy country though. </joey>
<connor> - Have you considered wearing </connor>
<garnt> another item of clothing? (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> Perhaps a jumper or a hoodie? - No, no, no. </garnt>
<garnt> Because there's a problem because if you wear </garnt>
<garnt> a fucking jumper or something and the room is cold, </garnt>
<connor> then your fucking hands are cold. </connor>
<connor> And like I'm just trying </connor>
<connor> to work. - It is not that cold. </connor>
<joey> - No, it can get that cold sometimes in winter. </joey>
<joey> - Does the blood circulate to your fingers enough or? </joey>
<garnt> - My fucking feet... </garnt>
<garnt> Before we turned on this heater, </garnt>
<garnt> my fucking feet were ice cold, man. </garnt>
<garnt> I am not joking. </garnt>
<connor> - It's really not that cold. </connor>
<garnt> - I get cold limbs. - Are you a fucking lizard </garnt>
<connor> with your body. </connor>
<connor> What the fuck. (laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - No, my body was just not built for the cold </garnt>
<connor> and there's nothing more uncomfortable for me- </connor>
<connor> - Built different in the opposite. </connor>
<connor> - Than just a stuffy room. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause sometimes I'm like, maybe I'm getting ill. </connor>
<connor> And then I realize I go outside </connor>
<garnt> and it's because the room's so stuffy </garnt>
<garnt> that I haven't realized how uncomfortable I'm feeling- </garnt>
<joey> - But that's why I very rarely turn on the heater, </joey>
<connor> unless it's like a seriously cold. </connor>
<connor> Because for me it's like, if I'm cold, </connor>
<connor> I'll just wear another layer of clothing. </connor>
<joey> And then A, the room isn't stuffy and B, I'm warm. </joey>
<connor> - But also it's really easy to make a room not stuffy. </connor>
<connor> You just open a window for like one minute </connor>
<garnt> after you've heated the up. </garnt>
<garnt> It won't be cold </garnt>
<garnt> after one minute. - Yeah, but then after </garnt>
<connor> you open the window, </connor>
<connor> then it gets cold again. </connor>
<connor> - And then like one minute- - And then </connor>
<joey> the cycle continues- </joey>
<joey> - Not in one minute. </joey>
<joey> - There is never a perfect temperature </joey>
<joey> that I'm like happy with when it's winter. </joey>
<garnt> Because if I need to like artificially warm it up, </garnt>
<garnt> then either it's gonna be too stuffy </garnt>
<garnt> or I'm gonna be too cold. </garnt>
<garnt> There is no between. </garnt>
<connor> - But there's something so nice about being in a warm room, </connor>
<joey> knowing it's freezing outside. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I agree. - There's something </joey>
<connor> that's so magical about that. - It's like going to bed </connor>
<connor> in a thunderstorm, right? </connor>
<connor> There's something comforting about it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't if you guys relate to that. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - I just gave you like the thousand yard stare. </garnt>
<connor> You were like, "Yeah, you guys know what I'm talking about." </connor>
<joey> - No, I like it, I like it. </joey>
<joey> I know what you mean. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - It's just like white noise outside </connor>
<joey> (indistinct) - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> There's something comforting about outside </joey>
<joey> is fucked right now, but I'm safe inside dry and warm. </joey>
<connor> - Some of the best sleeps I've had </connor>
<connor> I've been like camping on the floor, </connor>
<connor> but because it's so fucking freezing outside </connor>
<connor> and you're in your little like worm cocoon, </connor>
<connor> it's so nice. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, I agree, I agree. - It's, oh yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Oh fuck. </joey>
<joey> - I just like being comfortable existing, I guess. </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> I don't want to do anything </joey>
<joey> to make my existence more comfortable. </joey>
<garnt> I just like being in a room and being like, </garnt>
<garnt> okay, I can do whatever I want. </garnt>
<joey> - I think you just spoke on behalf of all humanity. </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> I just want a comfortable existence- </joey>
<connor> - I just wanna be- </connor>
<connor> - He just wants to wear a fucking turtleneck in his room </connor>
<connor> and be a happy boy. (Joey laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - Honestly, what's wrong with that? </garnt>
<garnt> I don't wanna put on a heater- </garnt>
<joey> - Okay, to be honest, the only reason why I... </joey>
<connor> Okay, two reasons why I don't wear turtlenecks, A- </connor>
<connor> - You look like an asshole. </connor>
<connor> - I look like a dick. </connor>
<connor> B, my neck- - Yo, Steve Hanjobs </connor>
<garnt> here though, come on. - No, no, </garnt>
<garnt> you can make it work. </garnt>
<garnt> I can't make it work. </garnt>
<garnt> I look like a fucking weirdo with a turtleneck. </garnt>
<joey> But B, my neck for some reason, I don't know what it is, </joey>
<joey> it exerts so much fucking heat that... </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> Like legit. </joey>
<joey> That's the reason why I can't wear a scarf, either. </joey>
<connor> Because when I wear a scarf, my neck gets so fucking sweaty. </connor>
<connor> - Bro, I fucking love wearing scarfs. </connor>
<connor> - I know, I- - Scarfs are great. </connor>
<connor> - I love wearing scarves too, </connor>
<joey> but only if it's like really, like I'm talking like, </joey>
<garnt> - 10, -20 degrees. </garnt>
<garnt> - Literally the reason why I started wearing turtle necks, </garnt>
<joey> had nothing to do with like me thinking, </joey>
<connor> turtleneck looks nice. </connor>
<connor> I just remember the first time I put on a turtleneck, </connor>
<connor> I'm like, oh, this is like permanently wearing a scarf </connor>
<connor> that I'd never have to take off. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - This is like perfect for me. </connor>
<joey> - Exactly. - 'Cause I fucking love </joey>
<joey> the feeling of wearing scarfs. </joey>
<joey> - Exactly, but it doesn't matter how cold it is for me, </joey>
<joey> I don't know why I get so sweaty around my neck. </joey>
<connor> - Who needs renewable energy </connor>
<joey> when we can just use Joey fucking neck to power the planet? </joey>
<connor> - You can just all hurdle around my neck like this </connor>
<connor> and just warm your hands up on my neck. </connor>
<connor> I don't know what it is. </connor>
<connor> My neck is always so fucking hot. </connor>
<connor> Which sucks, because people have always told me, </connor>
<connor> "Oh yeah, you look really good in a scarf." </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, yeah, I like wearing scarfs </connor>
<connor> that I like the feeling of it. </connor>
<joey> But I can only wear for maybe like- </joey>
<connor> - Wait, you say that you're fine </connor>
<connor> but you're not really fine. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. (chuckles) </joey>
<joey> It's like, I like wearing a scarf </joey>
<joey> and I think I look good in a scarf, </joey>
<joey> but the problem is I can't wear a scarf </joey>
<garnt> for more than two minutes. </garnt>
<joey> 'Cause then I'm like, fuck this, it's so hot. </joey>
<garnt> I can't. </garnt>
<joey> - Overheating, overloading. </joey>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Kinda on topic... </connor>
<connor> Okay, go on Garnt. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, going back to why I like kotatsus </garnt>
<garnt> is that kotatsus is like, I can feel warm in a kotatsu </garnt>
<connor> and not feel stuffy. </connor>
<connor> So it's like one of the few spaces where I'm just like, </connor>
<garnt> if I'm getting hot, I can just roll on the kotatsu and- </garnt>
<joey> - But that's the problem I have with kotatsu, </joey>
<joey> is this exact same problem I have with beds in winter? </joey>
<joey> Is that the moment I enter the kotatsu </joey>
<joey> the G's jerk up like 10 G's and I can't leave it. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, I feel the same way. </garnt>
<joey> - Also how are we look sitting on the floor? </joey>
<joey> Sitting on the floor isn't that comfortable for me. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right. </joey>
<joey> - And kotatsu you normally have to sit on the floor. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I need some like back support, man. </joey>
<joey> - But there's those chairs. </joey>
<garnt> - There's the back support. (indistinct) </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, those are pretty good. </garnt>
<garnt> But, most of the time they don't really have those, do they? </garnt>
<connor> It's just kinda like, you just sit, </connor>
<connor> and you've gotta put your hands back </connor>
<connor> if you wanna lean back a little bit. </connor>
<joey> - You can lean back on the couch. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, if there's a couch there, it's nice </connor>
<joey> but (indistinct) people don't have that. </joey>
<joey> I mean, (indistinct), right? - Right. </joey>
<joey> - But, I'm being nitpicky. </joey>
<joey> - You should just bring your own fucking foldable chair. </joey>
<joey> It's like if you have kotatsu, I'm coming. </joey>
<connor> - I'm like that guy with the camping chair, </connor>
<joey> like flips it out with hand. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, I'm ready for the kotatsu. </joey>
<connor> - [Joey] Exactly. </connor>
<garnt> - I'm ready to be comfortable. </garnt>
<garnt> - Exactly. - Yeah, honestly kotatsu... </garnt>
<garnt> I remember the first time I tried out a kotatsu </garnt>
<garnt> here in Japan and it was like instant life-changing moment. </garnt>
<connor> - What do you mean? (Joey laughs) </connor>
<garnt> It's just a warm table. </garnt>
<garnt> What are you here like, (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<connor> how is it life-changing? - Come on, come on, </connor>
<garnt> come on, come on. - Fuck off! </garnt>
<garnt> - Like you have some of those moments </garnt>
<garnt> where you're just like, </garnt>
<joey> how did I go my entire life without this? </joey>
<joey> Like okay, heat- </joey>
<joey> - It is pretty fucking likable. </joey>
<joey> - Heated toilet seats. </joey>
<connor> The first time I went to Japan </connor>
<connor> and tried a heated toilet seat, I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> how is the rest of the first world fucking... </connor>
<garnt> Other first world countries haven't caught on to this. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I won't lie, </connor>
<garnt> I think I have actually ruined toilets myself. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause whenever I go to a toilet now </garnt>
<garnt> that doesn't have a bidet, I legit feel like </garnt>
<joey> I'm bored. - I have a panic attack. </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - I legit feel like, how am I supposed to wash my ass clean? </joey>
<joey> Wipe it, are you kidding me? </joey>
<joey> I'm not an animal. </joey>
<joey> I don't touch that area. </joey>
<joey> If I ever move back to the UK, no joke, </joey>
<joey> I'm 100% like- </joey>
<joey> - Invest in a bidet. - Even if the suitcase </joey>
<connor> is empty, dude, I'm making room </connor>
<connor> for the premium $1,000 bidet, </connor>
<connor> because I'm using that shit daily. </connor>
<connor> I wanna shit like a king. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. And like I remember Prosey D, </connor>
<garnt> I was talking to him, as well one time. </garnt>
<garnt> He was like, dude when he came back from Japan </garnt>
<garnt> the one thing he brought was a bidet. </garnt>
<garnt> - Really? - 'Cause he was like, </garnt>
<garnt> I insist. </garnt>
<garnt> - I feel him </garnt>
<garnt> - He has taste, man, he has taste. </garnt>
<garnt> - He was arguing like, I insist that I shit like a king. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm like, honestly, (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> I completely understand it. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause once you get used to a bidet </garnt>
<garnt> and you get the heated seat, </garnt>
<joey> you get a little pressure washer </joey>
<joey> you can have it set to like boom, boom, boom, </joey>
<garnt> that go back and forth on your ass cheeks, it's nice dude. </garnt>
<garnt> My ass feels permanently clean. </garnt>
<garnt> Why wouldn't I wanna shower for my ass every time shit? </garnt>
<connor> Are you kidding me? </connor>
<connor> Sometimes I don't even shit, but I do it </connor>
<connor> 'cause I'm like, why not clean my ass. </connor>
<connor> Why not? (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> I got time. </connor>
<connor> - I got some time. </connor>
<joey> - I got time. - I wanna make my ass </joey>
<connor> feel refreshed. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause sometimes right, man, </connor>
<connor> you have those days where like it's a hot day. </connor>
<connor> you get like swamp ass, you know what I mean? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Where you're ass </joey>
<joey> just gets kinda sweaty. </joey>
<joey> It's not even bad, but just a little bit, right? </joey>
<joey> You're like, why not just clean it. </joey>
<joey> - You're butt cheeks get a little (indistinct). </joey>
<joey> - Why not clean my cheeks? </joey>
<joey> - Okay, I completely missed on this. </joey>
<connor> So you're not talking about </connor>
<connor> it's heated seat. - The heated seat </connor>
<connor> is also amazing. </connor>
<garnt> - But you're talking bidet? - Yeah, the bidet and... </garnt>
<garnt> But the heated seat is part of the bidet package, right? </garnt>
<connor> Even the cheapest ones have that. </connor>
<garnt> - Okay, I don't use the ass washing function </garnt>
<garnt> of the bidet at all. </garnt>
<garnt> - Why not? </garnt>
<garnt> - It just doesn't feel clean. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know. - It's clean. </garnt>
<joey> - I don't know. - It's the cleanest thing </joey>
<joey> in the toilet. </joey>
<garnt> - It does not and like I- </garnt>
<garnt> - You are kidding me. </garnt>
<connor> This is like going to space and being like, </connor>
<garnt> yeah, I never look out the window. </garnt>
<connor> Why would I ? (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> Why would I look at the window? </connor>
<connor> - So you bidet your ass, right? </connor>
<connor> You got the water shooting up your ass </connor>
<garnt> and then you stop it, and then you just got wet ass cheeks. </garnt>
<connor> - So you get some of the toilet paper </connor>
<connor> and you just dry it a little bit. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, you dry it off. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, because like you need the toilet paper, </garnt>
<garnt> but it doesn't feel clean without that wipe. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's why you have to wipe. </garnt>
<garnt> - Some of them have dryers and those are pretty good. </garnt>
<connor> - No, no, no. </connor>
<garnt> - Have you tried? </garnt>
<garnt> Have you tried Garnt? - I have you tried. </garnt>
<garnt> - Fuck off, you haven't tried. - I have tried. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no, no. </garnt>
<connor> Okay, because there is a difference between wiping to dry... </connor>
<joey> Why are we talking about this (indistinct)? </joey>
<joey> There's a different in wiping to dry your ass </joey>
<joey> and wiping to get the shit out. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - They're very different types of wipes, right? </joey>
<joey> - One is like a deep wipe </joey>
<joey> and the other is like a shower wipe. </joey>
<garnt> - One is just- - One is an excavation, </garnt>
<connor> the other is a pat down. </connor>
<garnt> - Look, toilet papers were not designed to wipe wet asses. </garnt>
<connor> - No, because your ass isn't the fucking Amazon River, dude. </connor>
<connor> It's a little moist. </connor>
<garnt> You just wipe that shit dry. </garnt>
<garnt> - What I hate is When you have a wet ass after a bidet, </garnt>
<joey> you go to wipe it and the toilet paper </joey>
<joey> just fucking disintegrates on your hand. </joey>
<joey> - Bro are you using one ply? - How much water </joey>
<joey> are you fucking using? </joey>
<connor> - Okay, how much water can your asshole </connor>
<garnt> in vertical position contain? (laughs) (claps) </garnt>
<garnt> - It doesn't matter. - And second of all- </garnt>
<garnt> - Its fucking toilet paper. </garnt>
<garnt> - What ply are you using Garnt? </garnt>
<garnt> What ply are you using? </garnt>
<garnt> One ply, fucking sandpaper? </garnt>
<garnt> What are you using to absorb this? </garnt>
<garnt> - You gotta use the double though, </garnt>
<garnt> at least - Bro, double minimum. </garnt>
<garnt> Come on. </garnt>
<connor> - Toilet paper- </connor>
<garnt> - What ply are you using Garnt? </garnt>
<garnt> Answer real quick. </garnt>
<garnt> - What's a ply? </garnt>
<connor> - (chuckles) It's how many sheets of paper is used in it. </connor>
<joey> - Bro, okay. - Are you using one square </joey>
<garnt> and be like shit I'm allowed. </garnt>
<joey> - It doesn't fucking matter, man. </joey>
<garnt> Anyone who lives in Asia- - No, no, it does matter. </garnt>
<garnt> - Anyone who lives in Asia knows that toilet paper here </garnt>
<connor> is weak as fuck. </connor>
<connor> It is flacid. - That sounds broke. </connor>
<connor> That sounds broke as fuck. </connor>
<garnt> You sound broke right now Garnt. </garnt>
<connor> I can't believe how much of a peasant joke this is. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause I thought it was just a Thai thing </connor>
<garnt> where toilet paper was just like fucking flacid, no. </garnt>
<garnt> I moved to Japan and toilet paper here </garnt>
<garnt> is like fucking weak as fuck. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, you can't buy the good shit. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, you get the double ply shit </joey>
<connor> and then you do maybe like one wrap around your hand. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - That's more than enough to absorb any amount of liquid </joey>
<connor> that's down three. - Yeah, you would pile on </connor>
<joey> three little sheets. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - That's a nice </joey>
<joey> thickness to it, right? </joey>
<joey> They're two-ply (indistinct). </joey>
<connor> - At least that thick, and then just get under there </connor>
<connor> it won't rip. </connor>
<connor> - Good. </connor>
<connor> - And your ass is clean and it's dry. </connor>
<connor> - I cannot believe you would come here... </connor>
<garnt> 'Cause honestly, bidet is in the top three things </garnt>
<garnt> about Japan, if I'm gonna be honest with you. </garnt>
<garnt> - Heated toilet seats. </garnt>
<garnt> Bidet's okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - The whole shitting experience is top three. </garnt>
<joey> - The whole toilet experience. </joey>
<joey> - It's like a top three Japanese thing for me, man. </joey>
<garnt> Like it's just great. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, another thing- </garnt>
<garnt> - I look forward to shitting. </garnt>
<garnt> - Another thing about bidets as well, </garnt>
<connor> it shoots up right up your asshole, right? </connor>
<connor> - That's exactly what I want. </connor>
<garnt> - And then you just feel like </garnt>
<garnt> you're fucking shitting out water and so like- </garnt>
<garnt> - How gaped is your asshole? </garnt>
<joey> - Do you like goatse? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, he's like this. (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> He's like. (grunts) </garnt>
<garnt> Like just sit down on it, man. (claps) </garnt>
<garnt> - That's just fucking water stuck in your asshole, man. </garnt>
<joey> - A bidet- - No. (laughs) </joey>
<garnt> - Are you like giving yourself </garnt>
<joey> a prostate massage on a bidet. </joey>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<joey> - It's just not- </joey>
<connor> - Do you got water stuck in your anus? </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<connor> - How do you do that? </connor>
<garnt> What is your asshole like? - Unless I'm fucking like. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - Are you putting your asshole over the bidet thing. </connor>
<garnt> Are you putting it in? - With the hose. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, are you putting the hose in? </garnt>
<garnt> What are you doing? - No, the stream of water </garnt>
<garnt> is fucking strong enough- </garnt>
<garnt> - Put that down, put it down. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> You probably set it to like fucking pressure hose. </garnt>
<joey> - Well, that's how- - He's got it to like </joey>
<garnt> public fountain display. - No, no, no. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because if its not strong, </garnt>
<garnt> then it's just a fucking trickle on your ass, </garnt>
<connor> and that's no cleaning up shit. </connor>
<connor> - That is called medium. </connor>
<connor> - You need the fucking pressure </connor>
<garnt> to fucking clean that shit off your ass. </garnt>
<garnt> But if it has enough pressure </garnt>
<garnt> to clean the shit off your ass, </garnt>
<joey> then you're getting water stuck in your asshole. </joey>
<garnt> There's no in between. - No, you're not. </garnt>
<connor> No you're not. </connor>
<garnt> - My bidet is on the fucking max pressure and it's perfect, </garnt>
<connor> because you can feel the shit coming off and, </connor>
<garnt> I mean, I don't know about you, </garnt>
<garnt> but my asshole is normal. - Fucking ironclad asshole </garnt>
<joey> right here man. - Yeah, just clench it a bit </joey>
<garnt> and you're all right. - I clench up a little bit. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause if you clench then your not </garnt>
<garnt> fucking cleaning it properly. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yes you are. </garnt>
<connor> - When you're shitting, what do you mean? </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> Wait, you're not cleaning it properly when you clench? </connor>
<connor> Of course you are. - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - What do you mean like clench? </garnt>
<garnt> Wait you clench when you fucking bidet that shit? </garnt>
<connor> - A little bit. - Pucker up your asshole. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, pucker up a little bit. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> (claps) </garnt>
<connor> - Garnt is like relax my anus. </connor>
<connor> Allow the water to flow in. </connor>
<joey> What are you doing? - You're giving yourself </joey>
<connor> a fucking bidet anima. </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - That's what it feels like. </garnt>
<garnt> It obviously feels like I'm taking a fucking bidet anima </garnt>
<connor> every time. - You're doing this </connor>
<connor> totally wrong Garnt. </connor>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my God. </garnt>
<garnt> - Wait, because like I don't clench when I shit. </garnt>
<joey> - What do you mean? </joey>
<garnt> You're just like, I let gravity do its work. (laughs) </garnt>
<joey> - What is this, a fun slip and slide you're asshole? </joey>
<garnt> How is the shit coming out? </garnt>
<garnt> - How lubed up is your asshole? </garnt>
<garnt> - What do you mean by clench? </garnt>
<garnt> You just mean push? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah, punch. </connor>
<garnt> It's the same thing, normally. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, okay, that doesn't how with the bidet is. </garnt>
<garnt> Still goes up the fucking asshole </garnt>
<garnt> even if you push that shit out, man. </garnt>
<garnt> - We need an anatomy of your asshole in display. </garnt>
<joey> Can we get an X-ray of your asshole </joey>
<connor> so we can see what's going on. - Can we get like a bidet cam </connor>
<joey> just to see how fucking loose your asshole is </joey>
<joey> when it gets bidet. (laughs) </joey>
<garnt> - I just don't like the feeling of water on my ass </garnt>
<connor> and I don't know, it just- </connor>
<connor> - So wait, what about in the shower? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, what do you cleaning your ass with? </connor>
<garnt> - No. </garnt>
<garnt> Okay, so you know when- </garnt>
<connor> - Do you clean your ass Garnt? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I clean my fucking ass. </connor>
<joey> - How do you clean your ass? </joey>
<joey> - You talked about the sweaty feeling </joey>
<joey> in your asshole. - Swamp ass. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, swamp ass. </garnt>
<garnt> If I get swamp ass, I just take a fucking shower, man. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't even bidet that shit. - A whole shower, </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah I fuck-. - That's so unnecessary. </connor>
<connor> - I can take three showers a day </connor>
<garnt> if I need to. - Garnt takes one shit </garnt>
<connor> and goes home, he's like fuck gotta shower now, man. </connor>
<garnt> - Honestly, sometimes if I wanna feel clean </garnt>
<garnt> after a shit I just take a fucking shower, man. </garnt>
<garnt> Quick five minute. </garnt>
<connor> - What are you doing in this toilet? </connor>
<connor> Garnt is that one dude when you leave some public restrooms </connor>
<garnt> it's like a fucking war zone. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - That must be Garnt. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no, no. </garnt>
<garnt> - The shit everywhere, </garnt>
<garnt> shit on the wall. (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<joey> It's like, that is Garnt. </joey>
<joey> It's Garnt going in the rest room- </joey>
<connor> - It's like shit in places </connor>
<joey> you didn't think shit would end up. </joey>
<garnt> - It's the fucking opposite, man. </garnt>
<connor> My shit- - Why would I use a bidet </connor>
<garnt> when it can't reach the wall. (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - My shits are like the cleanest shits. </garnt>
<joey> - Fuck off! </joey>
<joey> - Fuck off! - They are. </joey>
<joey> - There's no such thing as a clean shit. </joey>
<connor> - Okay, have you never had the perfect shit. </connor>
<connor> - The no wipes, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, the perfect shit, which is just like </connor>
<connor> you just shit out a log and it's like one solid clean log. </connor>
<garnt> And then you look at it and it's like, no wipe, </garnt>
<garnt> you look at it and you're just like, </garnt>
<garnt> man, that's a fucking piece of art right there. </garnt>
<joey> - In my family, we call that the swish, </joey>
<connor> because it doesn't touch the sides. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I hope no one's eating during this episode. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> - Yo, I just did a swisher over there, man. </joey>
<garnt> - You don't need a fucking bidet </garnt>
<garnt> after you did that fucking swish, man. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, I still like it though. </joey>
<joey> I still do it anyway because it feels good. </joey>
<connor> - To me, that is like the equivalent of coming to Japan </connor>
<connor> and just being like, yeah man, </connor>
<connor> I just ate only KFC and Burger King. </connor>
<connor> It's like, you've wasted the true potential of Japan. </connor>
<connor> Like what have you done? </connor>
<connor> It is on pearl honestly with food talking about Japan. </connor>
<connor> Like food is amazing and the shitting experience </connor>
<connor> is also God like. (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> I actually look forward to taking a shit. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. - I can't wait </garnt>
<garnt> to crack open the bidet </garnt>
<garnt> and just feel amazing. (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Crack open the bidet. </garnt>
<connor> - Crack open the. </connor>
<garnt> - Crack open the bidet with the boys. </garnt>
<connor> - Crack open the bidet and just have a great fucking time. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - (laughs) You shit for pleasure. </garnt>
<connor> - Honestly, I do. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Honestly, I used to shit 'cause it was a bodily function. </connor>
<connor> now I look forward to my shits 'cause it's Japan. </connor>
<connor> And they've figured out how to make shitting </connor>
<connor> an enjoyable experiences. </connor>
<garnt> - I look forward to shitting for other reasons. </garnt>
<joey> Like if the bidet is just like </joey>
<joey> not one if it. - What's the other reason? </joey>
<joey> Do you have a warm ass? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, one, I have a warm ass </joey>
<joey> and there's like two fucking sacred places for me, </joey>
<joey> and one is the shower and the other one </joey>
<garnt> is when I'm taking a shit. </garnt>
<garnt> Probably like my channel wouldn't exist </garnt>
<joey> if I couldn't shit or shower. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause where the fuck am I gonna get my ideas from? </joey>
<joey> - You're having fucking existential crisis on the toilet. </joey>
<garnt> - Fuck, yes I am. </garnt>
<garnt> Who doesn't, do you not? </garnt>
<joey> - No, because taking a shit for me is enjoyable. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I have a great time. </connor>
<connor> - That's the reason... </connor>
<connor> People think that I take such a long time to shit, </connor>
<garnt> because I'm having like a mental breakdown time. </garnt>
<garnt> No, I'm just having a fucking great time. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just like, why would I leave early </garnt>
<joey> when I'm having this much fun right here. </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<garnt> It's so fun. </garnt>
<garnt> - I fucking love shitting. </garnt>
<garnt> Bidets are just- </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know, in Thailand we have like an even worse thing </garnt>
<garnt> which is like... </garnt>
<garnt> It's like a self bidet, right? </garnt>
<garnt> So in like most Southeast Asian countries, </garnt>
<garnt> we don't have like the auto on your ass bidets. </garnt>
<garnt> We have like a little, like a shower head. </garnt>
<garnt> Like a mini shower head </garnt>
<garnt> that you have to put between your legs. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh, some European countries have that too, right? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. - With the little bowl? </connor>
<connor> The thing that... </connor>
<joey> Like the little bowl next to it </joey>
<joey> or you do it in the toilet itself? </joey>
<garnt> - In the toilet. - Its like the little </garnt>
<connor> bowl thing but without the bowl. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, okay. - And at that point, </connor>
<connor> I don't know, I've always hated that feeling </connor>
<garnt> 'cause then you just get wet balls. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's too much, (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<connor> because the bidet is precise with where it's aim is, right? </connor>
<joey> And when you've used your own, bidet long enough, </joey>
<joey> you know where to aim. - The bidet's like </joey>
<joey> sniping, you're asshole. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah you know where to aim your cheek </joey>
<connor> and you know the radius of which it'll spread. </connor>
<connor> So you've got it down or not, right? </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God. (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - We talked about fucking- </connor>
<garnt> - How long have we been talking about it? </garnt>
<joey> - Showering our assholes. </joey>
<connor> - I've always wanted to talk about it on the podcast </connor>
<connor> 'cause it's one of the, no joke, </connor>
<connor> the most enjoyable parts of Japan. </connor>
<joey> - I know what to call this episode, now. </joey>
<joey> The Japanese toilet experience. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> The shitting Japanese experience. </joey>
<connor> - I know where golden requiem experience comes from now, </connor>
<connor> and it's when you're on the fucking toilet. </connor>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - Were you a bit like worried when you first saw </garnt>
<garnt> how to operate the bidet when you first came to Japan? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I think a lot of British people are, </connor>
<connor> 'cause it's like, the thought of spraying your ass </connor>
<connor> is so foreign to us. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah (indistinct) - What was that thing </connor>
<joey> that you and Allen did again, </joey>
<joey> the first time you went to </joey>
<joey> the fucking hotel bidet? - We were curious at how </joey>
<connor> the bidet knew when you were sitting on it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - The bathroom was like a wet room. </connor>
<connor> So we were like, okay, well it doesn't matter </connor>
<connor> if this bidet sprays everywhere? </connor>
<connor> So we had like a few drinks. </connor>
<connor> We were like, let's figure out how the bidet works. </connor>
<connor> So we figured out the bidet won't spray, </connor>
<connor> unless there's pressure on the seat </connor>
<connor> which is pretty fucking cool. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, and then it was like spraying on the wall. </connor>
<joey> 'Cause no one was sitting on it. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> - You were just like pushing it. </joey>
<joey> - Bro, this thing was going far. </joey>
<garnt> It was spraying on the wall, it was crazy. </garnt>
<connor> - That's the pressure that goes </connor>
<connor> up your asshole, man. - And that's what I want </connor>
<joey> going on my ass. </joey>
<joey> - That's the pressure that goes up </joey>
<garnt> your fucking asshole. - I had a traumatic story </garnt>
<garnt> of 'cause... </garnt>
<garnt> In our house in Australia, we always had a bidet </garnt>
<connor> 'cause my mom was like, "I can't live without a bidet." </connor>
<connor> - Because she's Japanese and she shits like a King. </connor>
<connor> Why would she go back to shitting like a peasant. </connor>
<connor> - She's like, let me teach you. </connor>
<connor> Let me teach you Australians how to shit like a King. </connor>
<connor> So we had it in our house. </connor>
<joey> But of course when I was little, I didn't use the bidet </joey>
<joey> because I didn't know what the fuck it was. </joey>
<joey> I was just like, oh, buttons, </joey>
<joey> but I didn't fucking press any of them. </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, I remember first time seeing a bidet </garnt>
<joey> and I'm just like, yo, do I need a license </joey>
<joey> to operate this shit? </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - A bidet license? (laughing) </joey>
<joey> So it was like, I feel like if I pressed the wrong button </joey>
<joey> this toilet's gonna take off. </joey>
<garnt> - Here is like the fucking operating system of the bidet </garnt>
<joey> that you can see on screen right now. </joey>
<joey> Especially like going to Japan the first time, </joey>
<garnt> and it's somewhat in the different language as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - When I was little, like I never knew how to use the bidet, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I was just learned to just make sure to wipe </garnt>
<garnt> and wash your hands and then you'll be good. </garnt>
<garnt> But, when you get to around age six or seven, </garnt>
<garnt> you start to get a little bit curious </garnt>
<garnt> what these buttons are. </garnt>
<garnt> You're just like, I wonder what this is. </garnt>
<garnt> So, I did the fatal mistake though. </garnt>
<garnt> So I pushed the bidet, like start bidet button. </garnt>
<garnt> But I made the fatal mistake of getting up off my seat </garnt>
<connor> and looking down at the toilet bowl. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, no, it spray you in the face? </connor>
<connor> - So it fucking sprayed me in the eye </connor>
<connor> (laughing) - Oh God. </connor>
<connor> - And there's just water going everywhere, </connor>
<connor> and I'm like, I don't know how to stop this, </connor>
<connor> what the fuck's happening. </connor>
<joey> I actually thought I broke my toilet. </joey>
<joey> So, I called my mom and I was just like, </joey>
<joey> mom, come here. </joey>
<joey> So, she came in, fucking bidet water going everywhere </joey>
<joey> in this toilet. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> So it's just like, what the fuck? </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> And then the last thing she said, </joey>
<joey> like she finally stopped it and she's like, </joey>
<connor> "You could have at least flushed your shit, man. </connor>
<connor> "I didn't have to see that." (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> - But also, the bidet water is also warm. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. - So it's literally </joey>
<joey> like a warm shower. </joey>
<joey> - It is like a warm shower. </joey>
<joey> - Only, W's, only W's. (Joey laughs) </joey>
<connor> - And you know thing is right is that, </connor>
<joey> if you're an American or your just a Westerner in general </joey>
<joey> and you come and you see this toilet, </joey>
<joey> yeah, it can be daunting, right? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause, normally things don't go near your ass. </joey>
<joey> You're not used to that. </joey>
<joey> - No, no. - Just embrace it. </joey>
<joey> It feels good. </joey>
<joey> It's scary. </joey>
<joey> - It's scary. (laughs) - But once you admit </joey>
<joey> the thing feels good when they spray your ass... </joey>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<connor> That could be so out of context. </connor>
<connor> - It's like discovering a new fetish. </connor>
<connor> - It's like, you now what- </connor>
<joey> - Just give it a go. </joey>
<connor> - Does it feel a little erotic after... (laughs) </connor>
<garnt> It feels fucking- </garnt>
<connor> - It does. </connor>
<connor> But it feels good. </connor>
<connor> The wet ass afterwards just doesn't feel good. </connor>
<connor> - Dry it, just dry, man. </connor>
<connor> - Just dry it man. - It's not that hard. </connor>
<connor> - Then it doesn't feel clean. </connor>
<garnt> I don't know, my asshole doesn't feel properly clean </garnt>
<garnt> unless I soap that shit. - There is no proper clean. </garnt>
<connor> Like I don't feel properly clean after a wipe. </connor>
<connor> I feel like 90% clean after a wipe. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - 'Cause you know </connor>
<connor> there's always gonna be a little bit left. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Right, right. </connor>
<connor> - You know that bidet is scraping that shit off. </connor>
<connor> Just pressure washing it. - It's like washing your hands </connor>
<connor> without soap. </connor>
<joey> You might feel clean, but you don't really </joey>
<joey> until you use that soap. </joey>
<garnt> - I know, I need to physically feel my asshole being clean </garnt>
<garnt> and not like getting it washed. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> I need to feel that shit, man. </garnt>
<garnt> I need to confirm with my own hands. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - Well then, that's what you should do. </garnt>
<joey> You should use the bidet and then wipe it with your hand </joey>
<joey> and see if it's still there. </joey>
<garnt> - No, because it doesn't feel properly clean to me </garnt>
<garnt> unless I fucking shower. </garnt>
<garnt> Like my asshole never feels clean unless I shower </garnt>
<garnt> and I have probably soap in it. </garnt>
<joey> - This man is like wasting fucking buckets of water </joey>
<joey> to clean his ass, when he can just be using a bidet. </joey>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - You can never take too many showers. </garnt>
<garnt> I love the feeling </garnt>
<garnt> of taking a shower. - I'm pretty sure you can take </garnt>
<garnt> too many showers. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, (laughs) - I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> - Your skin has natural oil that if you shower too much </garnt>
<connor> you get rid of it (indistinct). </connor>
<garnt> - I don't know, for me, I love the feeling. </garnt>
<garnt> especially in summer when it's hot. </garnt>
<joey> Just taking like a nice- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that's different. - A nice cold shower. </joey>
<garnt> - That's a little different though. </garnt>
<joey> That's a bit different. </joey>
<garnt> - But even now in the winter I take like three showers. </garnt>
<joey> Like I get a bit cold- - Three showers? </joey>
<joey> - You take three showers? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, sometimes. </connor>
<connor> - Why? </connor>
<connor> - Not like- - No wonder you don't </connor>
<connor> fucking upload videos, </connor>
<connor> you're always in the fucking shower. </connor>
<garnt> - Not like properly long showers, </garnt>
<garnt> just like sometimes I get a bit cold- </garnt>
<garnt> (indistinct) </garnt>
<garnt> Like I said, my mind- </garnt>
<garnt> Like either I'm too stuffy or I'm too cold. </garnt>
<garnt> So sometimes I can't be bothered to wait </garnt>
<joey> for the fucking heater to go on. </joey>
<joey> Just pop in the shower, get a bit of warm water on me. </joey>
<garnt> All right, I'm back up to warm. </garnt>
<joey> - This man spends more time in the shower thinking of ideas. </joey>
<joey> Than actually committing to the ideas. (laughs) </joey>
<connor> - This man is not the clown, he is the whole circus. </connor>
<connor> You know what's also fucked up as well about you Garnt? </connor>
<garnt> - What? (chuckles) </garnt>
<garnt> - Hate to bully you this episode but, </garnt>
<garnt> you don't use your bath at all, do you? </garnt>
<garnt> - You and Sydney don't take baths. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't either though. - Sydney... </connor>
<connor> No, I mean, okay. </connor>
<connor> I don't like taking a bath in like... </connor>
<connor> it feels like I'm in like </connor>
<connor> a prison cell bath, you know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> I feel like I'm taking... </connor>
<connor> Okay, so Japanese baths are fucking tiny. </connor>
<connor> - They're not that... </connor>
<connor> Yours isn't that bad. </connor>
<connor> You can, sit in there. </connor>
<connor> - If I can't stretch legs out in the bath, </connor>
<connor> then it's not even a bath to me. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't need to stretch them out fully? </garnt>
<garnt> - It's a glorified sink in that point. </garnt>
<garnt> - No. (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> (indistinct) </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> The point is you have to take a bath like this. </garnt>
<joey> You do the fucking- - It's not that bad. </joey>
<joey> - The L thing. - You do the fucking </joey>
<garnt> L position. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like. - No. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay. (chuckles) </garnt>
<garnt> - So like- - It's not that bad. </garnt>
<connor> - I take like, I would say 90% baths, 10% showers. </connor>
<garnt> - Really? - No, no. </garnt>
<garnt> - Honestly, honestly. </garnt>
<garnt> Because in Japan, the best thing is is that </garnt>
<connor> you can like reserve your bath. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - As it says. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Which is like, if you know what time you're waking up, </connor>
<garnt> you can set the bath to be full and hot by that time. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Which, why the fuck </garnt>
<joey> do we not have this in any- </joey>
<joey> - It's the biggest brain move. </joey>
<joey> - Would they have like NASA in the US </joey>
<joey> but they haven't figured out how to fucking schedule a bath? </joey>
<joey> I know what time I'm gonna wake up. </joey>
<joey> I know what time I need to be in that bathtub. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Why can I not do </joey>
<joey> this basic fucking function? </joey>
<joey> - Right, right right. - Right? </joey>
<joey> And then also you have one button, </joey>
<joey> 'cause in the UK, what you had to do </joey>
<connor> is just turn the tap on and keep checking on it </connor>
<connor> every five minutes. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Pain in the ass. </connor>
<connor> In Japan there's one button that fills up </connor>
<connor> to the perfect amount of the amount that you set </connor>
<connor> at the exact temperature that you set. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - This is the future man. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> Why wouldn't I take a bath every day? </connor>
<garnt> - I just feel like for me baths </garnt>
<garnt> are not ergonomically designed for me. </garnt>
<connor> 'Cause I feel like I'm too tall to properly appreciate </connor>
<connor> a good bath, right? </connor>
<connor> - You're not that much taller than Connor. </connor>
<connor> - You're not that much tall than me. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, 'cause I love onsens, right? </connor>
<connor> The reasons I love onsens is I'm submerged in water </connor>
<connor> and I'm in a comfortable position. </connor>
<connor> I can never get in a comfortable position </connor>
<connor> in any of any of the baths I've ever owned in my life. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause here's the issue, right? </connor>
<connor> So I wanna stretch my legs out, </connor>
<connor> but then my body is above the water. </connor>
<connor> So you gotta submerge yourself and then you unsubmerge, </connor>
<garnt> and then your body just gets cold, right? </garnt>
<connor> - Peak bath position is like the water's up to like here. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Your arms out of the tub, </connor>
<connor> maybe watching something there. </connor>
<garnt> That's the best. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - Maybe got a beer as well </garnt>
<garnt> if you wanted. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause then your upper body is cold. </garnt>
<garnt> I like- - No way, </garnt>
<garnt> it's the perfect temperature control </garnt>
<garnt> because your head is free, </garnt>
<connor> you've got this bit getting cold, </connor>
<joey> and then you got the rest </joey>
<joey> of your body boiling. - Also because the bath water </joey>
<joey> is so hot, the steam from the hot water </joey>
<joey> makes the room warm, as well. </joey>
<connor> - I feel like you just haven't given baths </connor>
<garnt> the true shot they deserve Garnt. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, I- (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - Again, you're wasting another potential of Japan, </connor>
<connor> which is how fucking good the bath are. </connor>
<garnt> - No, the bath's are way too small here. </garnt>
<connor> - No, no. - I don't wanna be sitting. </connor>
<connor> - They're deep. - If my legs are curled, </connor>
<garnt> then that's not a bath to me. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, you know we're doing- </garnt>
<joey> - You're not fucking daddy long legs in this (indistinct). </joey>
<garnt> You're not that much taller. </garnt>
<connor> - Next time I'm going to your house- </connor>
<garnt> - Baths are meant to be relaxing </garnt>
<connor> and I need to be in a comfortable position </connor>
<connor> to be relaxed. - I don't fucking believe you. </connor>
<connor> - That's why I love onsens and I just don't take baths. </connor>
<garnt> Showers to me are just more relaxing. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't believe you. </connor>
<connor> Next time I'm going to your house, </connor>
<connor> I'm forcing you to get in the bath </connor>
<connor> with your clothes on. (Joey laughs) </connor>
<joey> You just sit there, </joey>
<connor> I wanna judge this position, that's bullshit. </connor>
<connor> I don't believe you. - We have one. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, we have one in the studio, go in this one. </joey>
<connor> - Okay, after this episode we'll- </connor>
<joey> - That ones tiny as well. </joey>
<joey> That one's too- - Okay, that one </joey>
<garnt> is actually smaller than normal, </garnt>
<garnt> but we'll get Garnt in there and we'll vote what's going on. </garnt>
<connor> We'll post the screenshot. </connor>
<connor> - The other thing of like I have... </connor>
<garnt> - The only times I've had baths is in my home in England, </garnt>
<garnt> and I don't know, the way, okay... </garnt>
<connor> When you're in a bath, do you put your legs towards the top </connor>
<connor> or do you put like your back towards the tap? </connor>
<connor> - Legs toward the tap always - Legs toward the tap, </connor>
<connor> of course. - What animal puts their back </connor>
<connor> towards the tap? </connor>
<connor> - Because the tap is always like, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> I always have like... </connor>
<connor> I don't know if it's just me but sometimes </connor>
<connor> I accidentally hit the tap, </connor>
<garnt> and it's either too hot or too cold. </garnt>
<garnt> And it just like ruins the entire vibe for me. </garnt>
<garnt> - You want the legs there </garnt>
<connor> 'cause you don't wanna burn your back. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - (chuckles) I've actually done that before, </garnt>
<connor> and I think that's just </connor>
<garnt> completely- - You're a clown. </garnt>
<connor> You're a clown. - Fucking mighty brain move </connor>
<garnt> right here. </garnt>
<garnt> - Also, I saw your bath at your parents' house. </garnt>
<garnt> It wasn't that nice. </garnt>
<garnt> Come on Garnt, come on. </garnt>
<garnt> You can do better than that. </garnt>
<connor> - I mean. (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Come on, come on, come on. - Even if I'm in </connor>
<garnt> a fucking nice hotel I'm like, I don't take </garnt>
<connor> a bath in this. - Bro, there is nothing </connor>
<connor> better than a hotel that has </connor>
<joey> a big ass bath. - Yeah I agree. </joey>
<connor> - That shit's amazing. - That's the only time </connor>
<joey> where I'm exclusively like, fuck showers, </joey>
<garnt> I'm going in that bath. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> Always, always, always. </connor>
<connor> - Also, I like the feeling of just having water </connor>
<joey> spraying on you. </joey>
<joey> I don't know, it's just like a nice </joey>
<joey> zen feeling. - Well, then go out </joey>
<joey> into the rain. (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Honestly rain in Southeast Asia is fucking great, okay? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause when we think of rain we think of like cold </joey>
<joey> fucking depressing British rain, just fucking... </joey>
<joey> It's like God blew up a fucking raspberry on you </joey>
<joey> and I hate that feeling, </joey>
<connor> right? (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> But in Thailand, when it rains it fucking pours. </connor>
<connor> - Right, right. - And it's probably like... </connor>
<connor> And it's warm as well. </connor>
<connor> It's like taking a warm shower </connor>
<joey> - Doesn't it feel like you're just getting pissed on? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, also it's so fucking humid </connor>
<connor> 'cause it was doing that in Japan. </connor>
<connor> In the summer, it was raining. </connor>
<connor> And it was deceiving 'cause I'm like, </connor>
<joey> finally I'll be cold. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - But no, it was just </joey>
<connor> more fucking heat directly applied to my skin. </connor>
<joey> - That's what I hated about when I went to the Philippines </joey>
<connor> for the first time and it was like May. </connor>
<connor> So it wasn't even like properly hot yet. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - But because </connor>
<connor> this is Southeast Asia, it's still fucking hot in may. </connor>
<connor> And the moment I got outside, my hair just fucking turned </connor>
<connor> into an afro because of the amount of humidity. </connor>
<connor> And then there was a pool where we were staying. </connor>
<connor> So I was like, oh, thank God. </connor>
<connor> I can finally jump in the pool and I'll call myself off. </connor>
<garnt> No, because it was so humid outside, </garnt>
<garnt> it was like walking into a fucking puddle of piss. </garnt>
<garnt> It was horrible. </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, I like heated pools and I like regular pools, </garnt>
<garnt> but the temperature of this pool </garnt>
<garnt> is like halfway in between of that. </garnt>
<joey> And it was just like lukewarm kinda what I was just like. </joey>
<connor> - That makes makes you feel like someone shit in it. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, right. (laughs) </joey>
<joey> It doesn't make the water feel clean. </joey>
<connor> - It's like perfect bacteria temperature. </connor>
<connor> - Yes. (laughs) - Makes you feel real gross. </connor>
<garnt> - Exactly, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Bro that's why cold showers are like </garnt>
<connor> fucking amazing. - No, they're good. </connor>
<garnt> - They're amazing. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's why when I used to swim in public pools, </garnt>
<joey> the best ones are like the ones that are initially cold </joey>
<joey> but you get warm as you swim. </joey>
<joey> - Exactly, yeah. - Because that's like nice. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause then it also forces you to keep swimming. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And you don't get to comfortable. </joey>
<joey> - That's the ones where you're just like </joey>
<joey> you feel the water and you're like, oh, that's cold, </joey>
<connor> but I'm just gonna commit and just fully jump in </connor>
<connor> and submerge my body all at once. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - And then </connor>
<joey> you're fine after that. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, (indistinct). - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Fuck, I can't believe you're jus an animal Garnt. </connor>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> You can take the peasant out of Thailand </connor>
<connor> but you can't take the peasant... </connor>
<garnt> Sorry, Sorry. </garnt>
<garnt> The Thailand out of a peasant. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> Fuck! </garnt>
<connor> I messed that up. - Nailed that. </connor>
<connor> - I have the superior taste. </connor>
<connor> (scoffs) </connor>
<connor> I'm just- - Mr. don't eat crust. </connor>
<garnt> - I just want to exist happily, you know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> That's all I wanna do. </garnt>
<connor> - I want you to exist correctly, Garnt. </connor>
<garnt> I want you to use the bidet when you can, </garnt>
<garnt> and I want you to take a bath every night. </garnt>
<garnt> Treat yourself Garnt. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, treat yourself. - You deserve it, come on man. </garnt>
<connor> - You're better than that. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't want a wet fucking ass. </garnt>
<joey> - You don't have to be, wipe. </joey>
<garnt> That's what the toilet paper was invented for. </garnt>
<garnt> - Then I don't want wet fingers after a wipe. </garnt>
<garnt> That's just- </garnt>
<garnt> - How fucking weird is your ass. </garnt>
<connor> - Are you clawing your ass out with your bare hands? </connor>
<connor> What are you doing? </connor>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - Have you- - Meilyne, your hands </garnt>
<garnt> don't get wet when you use a bidet, </garnt>
<garnt> do they? - That's disgusting. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, right. - Right? See. </garnt>
<garnt> - It is disgusting, that's why I hate it. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Meilyne] You're not using toilet paper, are you? </garnt>
<connor> - No, I am using toilet paper. </connor>
<connor> - (laughs) Seriously, he's just using his hand. </connor>
<joey> - He's using the- </joey>
<joey> - He's like, ah, fuck! </joey>
<joey> - He's using the heat of friction to warm his back up </joey>
<joey> to evaporate the water off his cheeks. </joey>
<joey> What are you doing Garnt? </joey>
<joey> - He's ass cheeks are just like. </joey>
<connor> - Okay, you know what? </connor>
<connor> I wanna watch you shit after this. </connor>
<connor> I wanna see what you're doing. </connor>
<connor> I need to judge your technique. </connor>
<connor> You're doing it all wrong. </connor>
<connor> - Let's fucking do it, I'm ready. </connor>
<garnt> Shit review, let's go. </garnt>
<connor> - Can we get a GoPro inside of the toilet bowl </connor>
<joey> and see what's going. - Yeah, I want a bidet cam </joey>
<joey> just to see. (laughs) </joey>
<connor> - I need to see what's going on. </connor>
<connor> I need to see what you're doing in this fucking bowl, Garnt. </connor>
<joey> (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Next special. </joey>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - The bidet special. - The bidet special </connor>
<joey> Will Garnt be able to learn how to use a bidet correctly? </joey>
<connor> - Needless to say, I am 100% bringing back a bidet </connor>
<garnt> if I have a house- - I am bring back a kotatsu. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm bringing back a heated toilet seat and a kotatsu. </garnt>
<connor> - Well, you don't need the table. </connor>
<connor> You can just get the heated element and screw it on. </connor>
<connor> It's just a box that makes heat. </connor>
<connor> That's basically it. </connor>
<garnt> - A box... (chuckles) </garnt>
<garnt> No, 'cause you need the heated element, </garnt>
<garnt> you need the table, and you need the cover </garnt>
<joey> on top of the table </joey>
<joey> to place the blanket. - Well, you can just </joey>
<garnt> get another. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because the good thing about a kotatsu is that </garnt>
<garnt> in the summer you can still use it </garnt>
<garnt> because all you have to do is just take the sheet off </garnt>
<garnt> and then it turns back into a regular table. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, okay. True, true. - So it's like a </garnt>
<garnt> specially made table, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - Kotatsu is a bomb. </joey>
<garnt> - Kotatsus are like the best thing in Japan. </garnt>
<connor> - No (scoffs) best. </connor>
<connor> - One of the best things. </connor>
<connor> - Bidet. - Heated toilet seats are- </connor>
<connor> - Bidet, all my homies </connor>
<joey> love bidets. - Heated toilet seats </joey>
<joey> are a close second. </joey>
<connor> - I'm on team bidet in this instance, I think. </connor>
<connor> I love my kotatsu but, man, </connor>
<joey> there's nothing more disgusting than a gross asshole. </joey>
<connor> (laughs) </connor>
<connor> I'm just saying right there. </connor>
<joey> - How dirty is your... </joey>
<garnt> I don't even wanna imagine. </garnt>
<garnt> - Maybe you guys are just shitting wrong. </garnt>
<connor> - No, we're not sitting wrong Garnt. </connor>
<joey> You are- - What's the wrong way </joey>
<connor> of shitting? </connor>
<joey> Like shitting on the wall? </joey>
<connor> - How is it wrong if I have a great time, </connor>
<connor> I end up perfectly clean, I'm very happy, </connor>
<connor> and my ass isn't wet? </connor>
<connor> I'm doing it the right way, as far as I'm concerned. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, you're sitting wrong if you end up </joey>
<joey> with a fucking swampy asshole. </joey>
<connor> - Garnt's like, instructions unclear, I dropped as a child. </connor>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> What are you doing on this toilet, man? </garnt>
<connor> Sort your fucking life out, bro. </connor>
<garnt> - I'm thinking of fucking bomb-ass videos on the toilet </garnt>
<garnt> and in the shower as well. </garnt>
<connor> - Clearly you're not thinking about personal hygiene </connor>
<connor> or staying dry. (Joey laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - I am very happy with </garnt>
<garnt> my personal hygiene. - Men I have a poppy asshole </garnt>
<joey> but I got a great video idea. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - That's exactly it, man. </garnt>
<garnt> That's exactly it. (claps) </garnt>
<connor> - Garnt's like literally stinky poo poo. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, oh stinky. </joey>
<joey> But Hey look at all these lovely Patreons </joey>
<joey> who are helping to support the show. </joey>
<joey> These Patreons of team bidet. </joey>
<connor> - A question to you Patreons this time, right? </connor>
<garnt> See what I did there, little reference, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause Garnt loves to say that. </garnt>
<garnt> That's the joke. - Question to you. </garnt>
<garnt> - We boys we'd love to do a tour or something in the US. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yeah, we gotta talk about that, don't we? </garnt>
<garnt> - We have- - Would you guys be interested </garnt>
<connor> in us maybe doing "Trash Taste" live across the US? </connor>
<connor> Would that be something that maybe- </connor>
<joey> - It's just a very brief idea, of course. </joey>
<joey> We can't do it now because of the state of the world but- </joey>
<connor> - But maybe in like a year or something, </connor>
<connor> maybe doing it like that. </connor>
<connor> - Whenever the US gets its shit back together, I think. </connor>
<connor> We'll definitely be open to that idea but, </connor>
<connor> are you guys open to that idea is more of the question. </connor>
<connor> So, I guess let us know. - Yeah, we wanna </connor>
<connor> gauge interest if that's something </connor>
<connor> you guys wanna do. - So definitely let us know. </connor>
<connor> And if you'd like to support the show, </connor>
<connor> then of course go over to patreon.com/trashtaste. </connor>
<connor> Also follow us on Twitter. </connor>
<joey> Check out our subreddit, give us some memes, </joey>
<joey> and listen to us on Spotify </joey>
<joey> if you don't wanna see our faces. </joey>
<connor> But yeah. - But why wouldn't you? </connor>
<connor> - Why wouldn't you. </connor>
<connor> - I want you to see in H, no, 4K, sorry, </connor>
<connor> me shouting at Garnt, about him being </connor>
<joey> a little uncultured - About having a poopy </joey>
<joey> butt hole. (laughs) </joey>
<garnt> - About being a little stinky poopy poo poo. </garnt>
<garnt> - About our shitting technique. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> which I can't believe that we've... </garnt>
<garnt> I think half the podcast. </garnt>
<connor> - You are literally fucking gone Prenen when you shit, </connor>
<connor> and I'm like Netero with all my eight hands, </connor>
<connor> slapping my ass clean dude. </connor>
<connor> You're so inferior, you can't even fathom the level </connor>
<connor> that I am on, man. (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> That's all I'm gonna say. </connor>
<connor> Thank you for watching this episode of "Trash Taste." </connor>

<joey> If you're eating this with food, I'm sorry. </joey>
<garnt> - We should probably have a warning </garnt>
<garnt> at the beginning now that- </garnt>
<joey> - No, no, no. </joey>
