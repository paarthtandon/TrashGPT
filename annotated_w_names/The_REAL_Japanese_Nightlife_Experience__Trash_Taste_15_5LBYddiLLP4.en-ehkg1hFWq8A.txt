<garnt> - I'm ambidextrous. </garnt>
<connor> When I'm jacking off. </connor>
<connor> - I need to use both
hands for my massive cock </connor>
<joey> (laughing). </joey>
<garnt> - We're recording this
you guys, this is gonna... </garnt>
<garnt> - You guys need more practice. </garnt>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Switch hands. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<connor> - Have you tried to jack
off with the other hand, </connor>
<joey> and it's like... </joey>
<joey> - It's like workout, </joey>
<connor> - No nothing happens. </connor>
<joey> - I drilled. </joey>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - I throw the hands to one hand. </joey>
<garnt> - This is not the conversation
I wanted to discuss. </garnt>
<connor> - Leave, leave Trash
Taste now while you can. </connor>
<connor> (upbeat music) </connor>
<connor> Welcome to this episode of Trash Taste, </connor>
<garnt> I'm the boy... </garnt>
<garnt> Why you laughing I haven't
said anything funny? </garnt>
<connor> - You sound so robotic. </connor>
<connor> - You would, I don't know, </connor>
<connor> It was like such low energy </connor>
<garnt> and I was just expecting
you to project your voice </garnt>
<joey> and you're like, welcome.. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah like your cadence
is really uplifting, </joey>
<joey> but just the volume you said it out </joey>
<joey> was just so unenthusiastic. </joey>
<connor> - Welcome to Trash Tastes podcast! </connor>
<connor> - There we go, </connor>
<joey> there we go.
- I'm the monkey brain </joey>
<connor> and today I'm in my mirror, when </connor>
<connor> (screaming) </connor>
<connor> I'm today with Joey and Conner of course. </connor>
<connor> how are you guys doing this? </connor>
<joey> - I mean much better now. </joey>
<garnt> I'm awake after that scream. </garnt>
<garnt> - I needed that scream to wake
me up, to get in the zone. </garnt>
<connor> - It works man, it works. </connor>
<garnt> I don't know if my neighbors, </garnt>
<connor> pretty wakes them up as well actually, </connor>
<connor> pretty hurts them actually. </connor>
<joey> - They don't need an alarm clock anymore </joey>
<connor> they just hear.. </connor>
<connor> (yelling) </connor>
<joey> (Garnt yelling) </joey>
<garnt> - You got this Conner, you've got this. </garnt>
<connor> - It's time to wake up. </connor>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Conner snoozed that alarm. </joey>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<joey> - Oh my good God, oh my God! </joey>
<connor> So have you guys been this week? </connor>
<connor> - Good.
(all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. Pretty good. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<connor> - We fucking see each other all the time. </connor>
<joey> Why are you asking me? </joey>
<joey> What am I up to? </joey>
<joey> - No I mean, because
we all the three of us </joey>
<garnt> went on trips this week. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - You wanna talk about that? </joey>
<joey> - Yes, sure. </joey>
<garnt> We went to rafting. </garnt>
<garnt> It was not white water rafting. </garnt>
<garnt> It was like playing a cut scene. </garnt>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> That's basically what
our rafting was like. </joey>
<joey> (laughing)
It was like we had to paddle, </joey>
<joey> the maximum was three times
- Right. </joey>
<joey> - And then the rest was just floating </joey>
<garnt> downstream in the river. </garnt>
<connor> - It did feel like a shitty
house of the dead cut scene. </connor>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> - Asks secrets where
you press the gun once, </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - And you just can't skip it. </connor>
<connor> - We have like the quick turn of events </connor>
<connor> where you had to press X three times </connor>
<garnt> (laughing)
And then </garnt>
<garnt> that was like the interaction
with the cut scene. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - One point they were like, yeah, </connor>
<connor> you can jump in the river, </connor>
<connor> and then they were like, yes </connor>
<connor> so you always put your foot in me and God </connor>
<joey> just fucking jumped in head first? </joey>
<joey> But then I didn't realize
it was like this deep. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> So I immediately was
like, yes, it's my time. </joey>
<joey> And I just jumped in </joey>
<garnt> and fucking slam my helmet into the floor. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - At least you were wearing a helmet. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, we'll see. </connor>
<connor> - I'm pretty sure what
they were gonna warn us </connor>
<connor> that it was too shallow, </connor>
<garnt> but the moment they said you can jump in, </garnt>
<joey> before they could explain anything else, </joey>
<joey> me and Connor just like jumped head first- </joey>
<joey> - Monkey brain just like yeeeh! </joey>
<garnt> - 'Cause it was so hot and we
were just dying to jump in. </garnt>
<connor> - I really, really wanted
to jump in the water </connor>
<connor> the whole time.
(laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> - But Joey went on vacation
with his other friends. </connor>
<connor> Can you believe Joey's
friends outside of us too? </connor>
<connor> - What the fuck?
- No. </connor>
<connor> - The fuck Joey? </connor>
<joey> - They're acquaintances </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Now, I went up to Hokkaido, </joey>
<garnt> to Hakodate.
- Fuck you. </garnt>
<garnt> (laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - So careless </garnt>
<garnt> - Without the boys I know,
was absolute blasphemy, </garnt>
<garnt> but it was so fucking nice because </garnt>
<joey> actually, speaking of which I've got </joey>
<garnt> like a bunch of like
presents for the boys. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay. This is a surprise. </garnt>
<garnt> - While Joey is getting his presents out, </garnt>
<garnt> we have a new camera angle </garnt>
<garnt> and that's because we need-
- Hello? </garnt>
<joey> - The space behind it, </joey>
<connor> and if you hate it, that's tough shit, </connor>
<garnt> you're gonna have to get used to it. </garnt>
<garnt> - This podcast studio is
actually relatively small. </garnt>
<garnt> I remember the first thing Chris said </garnt>
<connor> when he came into the podcast was like, </connor>
<connor> it looks a lot bigger.
- It was like a casing room. </connor>
<garnt> - But all our camera used
to be right in the back, </garnt>
<connor> and we basically couldn't use the center </connor>
<connor> of the room with half of it. </connor>
<garnt> - There's just like a lot of empty space </garnt>
<garnt> that we couldn't use if
we use the old camera. </garnt>
<joey> - Hey, if you'd like to
see the behind the scenes </joey>
<joey> then follow us on Twitter. </joey>
<joey> But, okay here. </joey>
<joey> - Thank you very much. </joey>
<connor> - So this is one of the gifts... </connor>
<connor> - I did not get you a gift,
this is kind of awkward. </connor>
<connor> (Conner laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I feel bad now. </connor>
<connor> - This two trips you've been
and all you brought me a gift </connor>
<joey> and I have been on one and... </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> - The first time I got you guys gifts, </joey>
<joey> the fucking snacks expired
before you even ate it. </joey>
<connor> - You never told me I
should eat them quickly. </connor>
<joey> - Okay, eat these quickly then. </joey>
<garnt> - We'll just eat these now. </garnt>
<joey> - I guess, so this is a type of a cookie. </joey>
<garnt> - You know what? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah just, just rip it open. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm monkey brain, what am I doing? </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm gonna be civilized. </garnt>
<joey> - So this is the type of.. </joey>
<joey> (laughing) </joey>
<joey> You're like a five-year-old. </joey>
<joey> Yeah. So this is the type of cookie </joey>
<joey> that you can only get in.. </joey>
<joey> Hokkaido it's kind of
known for it's called, </joey>
<connor> Shiroi Koibito which means white lover. </connor>
<connor> (laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - I'm civilized. </garnt>
<joey> - It's so well wrapped. </joey>
<joey> I just needed to bust that shit open. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. So this is a type of cookie </joey>
<connor> that you can only get in Hokkaido. </connor>
<connor> It's called Shiroi Koibito </connor>
<joey> - Thank you very much Joey. </joey>
<joey> - Really, really nice. </joey>
<joey> It's white chocolate, like milk cookies. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause you know, Hokkaido
is known for its milk. </joey>
<garnt> - Hokkaido is known for a lot of things. </garnt>
<joey> - Dude, Hoikkaido is-
- Milk, I've heard- </joey>
<connor> - But Hokkaido has like perfected food. </connor>
<connor> That's the only way to describe it. </connor>
<connor> Everything I had in Hokkaido </connor>
<joey> tasted so much fucking better- </joey>
<connor> - It's like a cream pie.. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, kind of. </connor>
<garnt> - Don't say that. </garnt>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laughing)
- No, it's every.. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, wow! </joey>
<joey> - Is it melted? </joey>
<garnt> - No no no, it's all good. </garnt>
<garnt> - Is it good? </garnt>
<joey> - Hoo, hoo
- Where did you get that? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. Which like... </garnt>
<garnt> When I heard you say like
Hokkaido has amazing food </garnt>
<joey> I'm thinking man, anywhere
in Japan already has </joey>
<joey> amazing food. </joey>
<joey> I can't imagine somewhere
leveling up that- </joey>
<joey> - Fuji? If it's just like the seafood, </joey>
<joey> even just for the seafood, right? </joey>
<joey> Because where I was in Hakodate </joey>
<connor> its a coastal town- </connor>
<connor> - [Conner] That's really good. </connor>
<connor> - So they catch all of the seafood there </connor>
<connor> like fresh at the fucking port and it's... </connor>
<connor> Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> They have a fish market there </connor>
<connor> that we went to in the morning </connor>
<connor> and all of the seafood
that they sold there, </connor>
<connor> they caught that morning. </connor>
<connor> So it's the freshest seafood
you can ever get, legit, </connor>
<joey> think of the best seafood you had, </joey>
<joey> and imagine that is just trash. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> because that's what-
- It's garbage, </joey>
<joey> it's useless.
- It's garbage </joey>
<joey> compared to what you can have in Hakodate. </joey>
<joey> So I got you another
thing as well because.. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, wow! That's kind of funny. </joey>
<connor> - So there's this... </connor>
<joey> - You got a wishlist on Amazon </joey>
<joey> or something I can like. </joey>
<joey> (Conner and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<connor> - I wanted to get you... </connor>
<connor> I wanted to get this for you guys </connor>
<joey> because I feel it's very indicative </joey>
<joey> of a kind of a vibe that we go for. </joey>
<joey> - All right, okay.
- Okay. </joey>
<joey> - It's clown juice </joey>
<joey> (all laughing)
- What? </joey>
<joey> - Here's some clown juice for the boys. </joey>
<joey> - Hamburger-
- Hamburger Pierrot, </joey>
<garnt> Lucky Pierrot. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. So there's this hamburger joint. </joey>
<joey> That's specific only to Hakodate, </joey>
<joey> not even Hokkaido </joey>
<joey> and it's called Lucky Pierrot, </joey>
<joey> and they have their own
branded energy drinks. </joey>
<connor> - Right? </connor>
<connor> - Because, do you guys
know what, like guarana is? </connor>
<connor> Like the fruit that they use </connor>
<connor> in Red Bull and stuff like that? </connor>
<connor> - Oh yes.
- Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - They grow Guarana in Hokkaido, </joey>
<connor> and so, I guess they just took that </connor>
<joey> and it's literally just clown juice. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - You literally just send
us an IRL clowney motive. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. I was like, he's a clown cod, </joey>
<garnt> drink up boys. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Anytime one of us has a shit take, </garnt>
<joey> we gotta take a drink. </joey>
<joey> - Yes, just take a sip of the clown juice. </joey>
<connor> How is it though? </connor>
<connor> - Tastes like an energy drink. </connor>
<joey> - Honestly, for me it kinda tastes like, </joey>
<joey> some weird as it's to say,
it's like a healthier Red Bull. </joey>
<garnt> - It's like a Red Bull
with a stronger aftertaste. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know, it's definitely got that- </garnt>
<joey> - I think that's definitely
the Guarana you are tasting. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I can't decide if it
tastes cheap or expensive. </garnt>
<connor> - I'll tell you,
(Conner laughing) </connor>
<connor> this was 150 yen. </connor>
<garnt> So I'll tell you.. </garnt>
<joey> - I'll tell you what, </joey>
<garnt> It actually tastes like a tire Red Bull. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh really? </joey>
<joey> - And to explain what
tire Red Bulls are like, </joey>
<joey> so, Red Bull actually
originates from Thailand, </joey>
<connor> - Oh Really? </connor>
<connor> - And yeah.
- I didn't know that. </connor>
<joey> - So Red Bull actually
originated from Thailand, </joey>
<joey> but the version they have in
Thailand is not carbonated. </joey>
<joey> It's like a thick syrup. </joey>
<joey> And whenever like... </joey>
<joey> The only people who really
drink Red Bull in Thailand, </joey>
<joey> it's truck drivers, it's
like you need to stay up </joey>
<joey> because you drink one and
last like drinking five... </joey>
<joey> The equivalent of five Red
Bulls you get anywhere else. </joey>
<garnt> - Jesus Christ-
- One American breakfast. </garnt>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, but I think this
has probably the same amount </connor>
<connor> of caffeine as like a regular Red Bull, </connor>
<connor> but I think.. </connor>
<garnt> - We're gonna be loaded on this podcast. </garnt>
<garnt> - But yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> But they also have the
non-carbonated stuff as well. </garnt>
<joey> So they have like Guarana juice </joey>
<joey> which is just beer
basically, it's as you said, </joey>
<joey> it's like a non-carbonated
Red Bull essentially. </joey>
<joey> And I had that, </joey>
<joey> and actually it tastes
really fucking good. </joey>
<joey> And I think it works better
than a coffee, in my opinion. </joey>
<joey> Even though it has just as
much caffeine as a coffee. </joey>
<joey> So suffice it to say that </joey>
<joey> for the rest of this episode, </joey>
<joey> we'll all just fucking
had a coffee as well. </joey>
<joey> - You gonna see </joey>
<joey> when this energy drink hits.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Cause we're gonna be like- </joey>
<joey> - You'll be able to see
the heart palpitations </joey>
<connor> through the screen.
- I need like a beer </connor>
<connor> to like downer. </connor>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - We definitely gonna kill
ourselves this episode. </garnt>
<garnt> But yeah, I just wanted to
get you guys some gifts. </garnt>
<garnt> - Thank you very much. </garnt>
<joey> - Now I feel super bad </joey>
<garnt> that we didn't give anything.
(Joey laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - No it's okay. </joey>
<garnt> - Although we didn't really
get any souvenirs either </garnt>
<garnt> for ourselves. </garnt>
<joey> - That's all right. </joey>
<joey> But hopefully, it will actually be able </joey>
<connor> to take like a proper
boys' trip up to support </connor>
<joey> 'cause I know you guys have been saying </joey>
<joey> how much you wanna go
up to the North, right? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. I really do. I really, really do. </garnt>
<joey> - I really wanna go in the winter, </joey>
<joey> 'cause it seems like
really a lot of things </joey>
<joey> happening in the winter.
- Oh yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I wanna hit up the onsen in the winter. </joey>
<garnt> - That's gonna be so nice.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Just wanna get naked. </garnt>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - I just wanna get naked with the boys. </garnt>
<connor> - We haven't talked about onsens </connor>
<garnt> on this podcast publicly, have we? </garnt>
<connor> - I've seen your guy's dicks so much now </connor>
<garnt> that I don't even question it, </garnt>
<garnt> going to the onsen with you. </garnt>
<joey> It's like it used... </joey>
<joey> I don't know...
- Are you mad? </joey>
<connor> - The first time we used to go... </connor>
<connor> First time went to the onsen together </connor>
<joey> I was like, well, we got
to like see each other's </joey>
<joey> - Penises?
- Penises. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<connor> - Do you know how Joey
cares? It's kind a loot. </connor>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<connor> But now it's just like whatever, </connor>
<connor> we're getting naked with the boys. </connor>
<garnt> - Another day with the boys. </garnt>
<connor> But I feel like a lot of people are afraid </connor>
<connor> to go to onsens for the first time. </connor>
<garnt> Because of that barrier, </garnt>
<garnt> where you just have to be naked </garnt>
<joey> in front of the boys- </joey>
<joey> - I mean, in a lot of countries
it's not very normal, is it? </joey>
<connor> - Some people have been like, yeah, </connor>
<connor> you wanna come to the onsen with me? </connor>
<connor> And immediately it's no, </connor>
<connor> I don't wanna do that. I'm like why? </connor>
<connor> And they're like, oh, cause
I don't wanna get naked. </connor>
<joey> And I'm like, it's just that... </joey>
<joey> It wasn't even like a
decision, it was in the head. </joey>
<joey> It was like, of course it's
no, I'm not getting naked. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - But it's like, but
everyone around you is naked. </connor>
<connor> - So you're not gonna be
the only one that's naked. </connor>
<joey> - Most European countries, </joey>
<joey> it's like we're naked.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> But that's surprising though, isn't it? </joey>
<joey> Is that like I've tried
to convince so many </joey>
<connor> of my European friends to go on an onsen </connor>
<connor> because in my head, it's just like, </connor>
<joey> oh bathing together is like a
very normal thing in Europe, </joey>
<joey> in a lot of European countries. </joey>
<joey> So I'm like, Oh, well, if
it's normal in their country </joey>
<connor> and their culture, then must be easy. </connor>
<connor> - [Conner] Yeah.
- Yeah </connor>
<connor> - So many times I'm like, hey,
you wanna go to the onsen? </connor>
<joey> They're just like, no. </joey>
<connor> - I think, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> Maybe our generation, it's less of a thing </connor>
<connor> than it was like 20 years ago? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, it could be the older generation. </connor>
<garnt> 'Cause I remember trying
to convince my cousin </garnt>
<joey> to go to the onsen when he visited Japan, </joey>
<joey> and it was just like
breaking down layers, right? </joey>
<joey> So first I'm just like, yeah, it's kinda </joey>
<joey> like how can these... </joey>
<joey> 'Cause he is the biggest
norm you can imagine, </joey>
<joey> so how do I explain the cultural
significance of an onsen </joey>
<garnt> and a hot spring to someone
who has never watched an anime? </garnt>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> - This is the same cousin
that watched the live action </joey>
<garnt> a title in time? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yes, yes, yes.
- Okay, Okay. </garnt>
<joey> - That's right. </joey>
<garnt> And he's like seven,
eight years older than me, </garnt>
<joey> So he's from the older generation as well. </joey>
<garnt> So, had to be like, okay, so
it's kinda like a hot tub, </garnt>
<joey> but it's like a public hot tub </joey>
<joey> - [Conner] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And then he was like,
oh yeah, that sounds fun, </joey>
<joey> you know, so he was like, Oh yeah- </joey>
<joey> - That's it? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, so real, </joey>
<joey> so you wear a bathing suit
and everything, right? </joey>
<joey> And I was like,
(Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> okay, so, here's the thing, </joey>
<joey> you just... </joey>
<joey> Everyone's naked, and you know, </joey>
<garnt> it's just a really relaxing experience, </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> and it's a really cool experience. </garnt>
<garnt> And I mean, his voice tone
just completely changed, </garnt>
<garnt> he was just, oh yeah, it's true. </garnt>
<garnt> I won't know about that one chief. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - I love how you had to go
in such a roundabout way. </joey>
<joey> It wasn't just like, yeah, we get naked. </joey>
<joey> It was like, well, I mean... </joey>
<connor> - We've got bathing suits.
We just take them off. </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<joey> Just take them off. </joey>
<garnt> - You can wear bathing
suits until you enter. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause what was the
first onsen experience </joey>
<joey> for you guys like? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I remember-
- I was with you guys. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - I think it was when we all went with... </joey>
<joey> I think it was us three and Allen. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that's first time. </joey>
<joey> - In the old onsen, </joey>
<joey> in old diver.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> I'm pretty sure. </joey>
<garnt> Which is like a massive,
it's like a super sento, </garnt>
<joey> super onsen as it's called, but- </joey>
<garnt> - And I remember the fact of knowing that </garnt>
<garnt> we're gonna get naked
in front of each other, </garnt>
<garnt> that was just like... </garnt>
<garnt> I think I had just built
it up in my mind so much </garnt>
<joey> 'cause I'm just like, </joey>
<garnt> it's about to happen,
it's about to happen. </garnt>
<joey> - I remember that day, like
we all stepped into the onsen </joey>
<connor> and Allen was like all
right lads, whip them out. </connor>
<connor> (Conner and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> Let's just get it out of the way. </connor>
<connor> Let's just all- </connor>
<connor> - Put them on the table,
get the mojos out. </connor>
<connor> - Gather around in a circle,
and we'll just look it up, </connor>
<connor> ditch our sticks, </connor>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> and then just be over it. </joey>
<joey> And we're like, all
right, three, two, one, </joey>
<garnt> we'll look at the dicks
like okay, we good? </garnt>
<garnt> No, one's popping a fart? </garnt>
<joey> All right we good. </joey>
<joey> (Conner and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. And then it just
literally took five minutes </garnt>
<garnt> and then I was completely comfortable. </garnt>
<garnt> And then it was an amazing experience. </garnt>
<garnt> Then i feel like people who are so afraid </garnt>
<joey> to go off that barrier, are missing </joey>
<garnt> such a good experience
of going to an onsen. </garnt>
<joey> - It's an experience you
can't really get anywhere else </joey>
<connor> I feel, like even I've
been to kind of, you know, </connor>
<connor> public bathing places in Europe as well. </connor>
<connor> But this just, I don't know. </connor>
<joey> It's just, I don't wanna
say it hits different, but.. </joey>
<joey> (Darnt laughing) </joey>
<garnt> You know, there's something
that's not quite right- </garnt>
<joey> - There's the vibe, is just different. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's definitely like vibe check. </joey>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Hey y'all onsen check. </joey>
<garnt> - Onsen check, yeah bro. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't think we have public
bathing places in Europe. </connor>
<joey> Do we? But we have like
the saunas, which are... </joey>
<joey> - But it's kind of similar, right? </joey>
<joey> - There's a similar. </joey>
<joey> - I guess, Yeah. You don't
really bathe together, </joey>
<connor> you just get into the sort of naked </connor>
<connor> and some people are like,
they'll cover themselves. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't know, because for me, </garnt>
<garnt> it's not just the onsen experience. </garnt>
<garnt> It's everything around
is the onsen experience. </garnt>
<garnt> Like getting out of the
onsen when you're like... </garnt>
<joey> Especially in the winter, </joey>
<joey> sitting out in in a public onsen </joey>
<joey> when it's really cold
or sometimes raining, </joey>
<joey> and it's I thought when it's snowing, </joey>
<joey> it's amazing as well.
- It's so good. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. That's like... </joey>
<joey> I put it's proper anime where
there's mist in everything. </joey>
<joey> I want to experience that one day. </joey>
<joey> But after coming out and
having that drink of cold milk, </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - That's like the most refreshing- </joey>
<joey> - Hand on the hip. </joey>
<joey> - Hand on the hip here. </joey>
<joey> So what you do, you have to
put your hand on the hip, </joey>
<garnt> drink the milk and wine and
it's the most refreshing </garnt>
<garnt> glass of milk-
- You don't have to. </garnt>
<garnt> - But it's like vibra,
you've got to do it. </garnt>
<garnt> And then having an
izakaya beer afterwards, </garnt>
<garnt> it's just fucking incredible. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It makes you... </connor>
<connor> When you're in an onsen, </connor>
<connor> for some reason it makes
you wanna just be a CEO </connor>
<connor> and talk business. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> Like I don't even have
business to talk about </connor>
<garnt> but I'll be like, gentlemen let's discuss, </garnt>
<garnt> the topic at hand, and
they're like animated issues. </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> It just makes you wanna
talk about important things </garnt>
<garnt> to get in a bath with three other people. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's exactly the same kind of vibe, </garnt>
<garnt> but a different kind of vibe. </garnt>
<joey> So we went to the... </joey>
<joey> The other day, went to a cigar bar, </joey>
<joey> I don't know what it is
about having a fat cigar </joey>
<garnt> on your hand, you just
wanna talk business, and- </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - You take a puff, you're like, </connor>
<connor> we have a problem. </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<joey> We need to eliminate someone. </joey>
<joey> - We're right in the groove. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> We got exterminated. </joey>
<connor> - I remember we went for
cigars with PewDiePie, right? </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And he was like, damn, </connor>
<connor> your voice got even deeper with the cigar. </connor>
<joey> (Joey and Darnt laughing) </joey>
<connor> I was like, I was made for this field. </connor>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> - First time I had that cigar, </joey>
<joey> I was like, Oh my God, I
could finally understand why </joey>
<joey> mafia bosses is still so powerful </joey>
<connor> with a cigar in their hand. </connor>
<joey> because it's like- </joey>
<joey> - It's got an energy to it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- There is, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I don't... </joey>
<connor> I never smoke at all. But for
some reason the idea of cigars </connor>
<connor> like that sounds good, I like that. </connor>
<joey> - Well, because unlike a cigarette, right? </joey>
<joey> You don't inhale the cigar smoke, right? </joey>
<joey> So, I mean, don't get me
wrong, it's still bad for you. </joey>
<garnt> - It's still terrible. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's still terrible for you. </garnt>
<garnt> - And you come out of
the bar smelling like </garnt>
<joey> you've just like puffing exhaust pipe. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- You know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> That's kind of the smell </joey>
<joey> of that
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> But man, you feel so powerful </joey>
<joey> just with that aura of cigar around you, </joey>
<joey> like yes, I just came out
of the cigar bar wide open. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Mind your business
what are you looking at? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, you do have a different
aura around you, don't you? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - You just feel powerful. </garnt>
<connor> - It's like when you
order a drink at a bar, </connor>
<connor> it's like you're the virgin. </connor>
<connor> When you order a drink at the cigar bar, </connor>
<connor> it's like, they used to chat, </connor>
<connor> but then you're like name a
cocktail, any cocktail? A vodka. </connor>
<joey> - What do you always get
again is Espresso martini. </joey>
<connor> - Espresso martini, if you haven't had it, </connor>
<connor> it's an amazing drink. It's just coffee. </connor>
<joey> Just with a vodka.
- Yeah, pretty much. </joey>
<connor> - It's amazing, it just </connor>
<connor> tastes right.
- It's just </connor>
<connor> coffee with attitude really. </connor>
<connor> - I love my- </connor>
<joey> - Coffee with attitude? </joey>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> What a terrible way to describe it. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's a coffee with attitude. </garnt>
<connor> - That's like-
- It is. </connor>
<joey> - Describing anything with attitude- </joey>
<joey> - Why are you booing me, am right. </joey>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Because it's such like... </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know, that sounds like it. </garnt>
<connor> How a Disney character is
introduced in a short, oh yeah... </connor>
<connor> He's the bully with attitude. </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<joey> - After we go to the
bar, I'll take a coffee </joey>
<joey> with attitude please, hold the attitude. </joey>
<connor> - Well, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - I hate it here. </joey>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> I hate it here. </garnt>
<connor> - It's like shit. </connor>
<garnt> Today when you got a frappuccino </garnt>
<garnt> and you're like, no, I didn't
just get a frappuccino, </garnt>
<garnt> I got an espresso frappuccino. </garnt>
<joey> (Conner and Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> - I was like, Oh my God, </joey>
<connor> you couldn't love Santa anymore white? </connor>
<joey> - It's like 35 Celsius. </joey>
<connor> I want an ice cream and a drink in one, </connor>
<joey> but I also want a coffee. </joey>
<joey> So yeah, I don't... </joey>
<joey> I normally think frappuccinos are awful, </joey>
<joey> but I bent my own morals. </joey>
<joey> - So you best still got a
frappuccino with attitude, right? </joey>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<joey> - I hate it here, I hate it here so much. </joey>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<joey> - Just add anything with attitude </joey>
<joey> and I'll just make it sound
bad and much more horrible. </joey>
<joey> - All the fucking comments
now are gonna be like, </joey>
<joey> damn, that was something with attitude. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> Oh my God. </joey>
<joey> - I love that, I love that to be a meme. </joey>
<garnt> That's gonna be a meme now. </garnt>
<joey> - Now I'm gonna describe everything </joey>
<joey> with something with attitude now. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah it's something with attitude now. </joey>
<connor> - But-
- You're welcome. </connor>
<garnt> - Speaking of cigar bars,
I think the topic for today </garnt>
<joey> that we wanted to discuss was
nightlife in Tokyo, right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Or in Japan in general. </joey>
<joey> - Just take japan in general. </joey>
<joey> - True, true. </joey>
<joey> I mean, I wouldn't know
I haven't been at night </joey>
<joey> outside of Japan for a while. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<connor> - For a while, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I miss her. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> I miss the English. </connor>
<joey> - 'Cause I mean, what is a
typical nightlife for say, </joey>
<joey> UK or Thailand or Australia? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I don't know what the
nightlife is in Thailand. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean the nightlife in
Thailand is, I mean it's- </garnt>
<joey> - Okay, let me ask the
question, does it exist? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, of course. </garnt>
<joey> - That's all Thailand is. </joey>
<garnt> - It definitely exists
and there's different </garnt>
<joey> kinds of vibes you can go for, </joey>
<garnt> you can go for a disgusting cheap like </garnt>
<joey> my life in Bangkok or you can go </joey>
<garnt> for some more extravagant
bars and everything. </garnt>
<joey> It's very varied but I don't know </joey>
<garnt> if I would say that there
a significant culture </garnt>
<garnt> that pertains all of Thailand, </garnt>
<garnt> but I feel like with Japan, </garnt>
<garnt> there's definitely like
the izakaya culture, </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Which I fucking love. </garnt>
<garnt> You talk about nightlife in Thailand, </garnt>
<garnt> whenever I'm in Thailand,
I just go to izakaya. </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I like the vibe that much, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah that's the thing right, </joey>
<joey> I feel an izakaya is just, I mean, </joey>
<joey> should we explain what an izakaya is </joey>
<joey> just in case people don't know? </joey>
<joey> - Sure. </joey>
<joey> - For those who are uncultured, </joey>
<joey> it's basically a Japanese pub. </joey>
<garnt> - Basically, but like... </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like... </garnt>
<joey> - It's a restaurant and a pub combined. </joey>
<joey> - It's 75% pub and 25% restaurant. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- That's what I would say. </joey>
<garnt> But like in a pub in the UK, </garnt>
<garnt> I thought-
- But it's not depressing. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. It's depressing, </garnt>
<garnt> and also for some reason,
I always feel pressured </garnt>
<joey> to live in the UK or just
drink, not sit down and eat. </joey>
<joey> But I have this pressure
that's like drink, </joey>
<joey> you're not here to eat, </joey>
<joey> 'cause when you go out with
your friends to the pub, </joey>
<connor> I'm always that asshole whose like, </connor>
<connor> I'm getting a meal, you
wanna ask for a meal? </connor>
<garnt> - Because it's just really inconvenient, </garnt>
<connor> 'cause you're there with
a table for the pints- </connor>
<connor> - Tiny table molded. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And then there's this guy he just orders </connor>
<joey> a three-course meal, </joey>
<joey> and you're like where
are we meant to fit this? </joey>
<joey> - I don't give a shit
about us to hold out this- </joey>
<joey> - I would like slowly notch
the 12 beers out of the way </joey>
<joey> to make room for my extravagant
curry from Wetherspoons. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> Under the tables like
down here just like this, </joey>
<connor> you're like this. </connor>
<joey> - Its like bombing out. </joey>
<joey> - Do you like pubs? </joey>
<connor> - In the UK? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I loved them in London. </connor>
<connor> I thought London had great pubs. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't know, I really don't like pubs. </garnt>
<garnt> Pubs are the one thing
about the UK that I... </garnt>
<garnt> Anytime I go out the UK, I'm like, yes, </garnt>
<garnt> this is a much better drinking
establishment than a pub, </garnt>
<connor> 'cause it's just... </connor>
<garnt> I don't know what it is
about pubs in the UK, </garnt>
<garnt> I just find it so fucking depressing, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause
- Yeah I can see that. </garnt>
<garnt> - It depends which ones you go to. </garnt>
<connor> London has ton of bar like
pubs that are really lively </connor>
<connor> and really great atmosphere. </connor>
<connor> But there are also equally as bad. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, you guys took me to one. </joey>
<connor> It was like a gaming pub, right? </connor>
<joey> - That's shut down now. </joey>
<joey> - Oh really? </joey>
<joey> (Conner and Joey laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - That pub was a mess there. </garnt>
<garnt> - I wouldn't even call that a bar, </garnt>
<connor> - I wouldn't even call it a ... </connor>
<connor> - That was like a gaming bar, </connor>
<connor> but like the dirtiest gaming bar. </connor>
<connor> - And what was it called again? </connor>
<connor> - Meltdown. </connor>
<connor> - Meltdown.
- Meltdown. </connor>
<connor> - It was a gaming bar with five PCs, </connor>
<joey> one dirty old, WeYou- </joey>
<joey> - No it wasn't even a
WeYou, it was just We. </joey>
<joey> - We, a WeYou, and
there'll be the same people </joey>
<connor> who'd hog the PCs and there's
no clement or anything, </connor>
<connor> so it was just awful, it was terrible. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, that's quite right. </joey>
<joey> - You know, you compare a
gaming bar anywhere else </joey>
<connor> and you're like, dude, they've got games. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. They got real games. </connor>
<connor> - The way I would describe Meltdown is </connor>
<joey> it's basically like a uni-bar. </joey>
<joey> - Hmmm. </joey>
<joey> - But the charges-
- They charge more </joey>
<garnt> than the uni-bar. </garnt>
<garnt> - But it was just like a run down bar, </garnt>
<garnt> and like every single bar in London </garnt>
<joey> that is even remotely interesting, </joey>
<joey> I feel is sort of run down, unfortunately. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. I can see that. </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause I don't know the
thing about pubs that I hate is </garnt>
<connor> that for some reason,
they just seem so dark. </connor>
<connor> I don't know. It's... </connor>
<connor> - I don't know what pubs you go into man, </connor>
<connor> there's so many in London and it's so fun. </connor>
<joey> - Anytime I go to a pub style
bar, like anywhere else, </joey>
<joey> the first thing I notice is,
man, it's so bright in here. </joey>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> This is nothing like British pubs. </garnt>
<garnt> This is nothing like British pubs, at all. </garnt>
<joey> - Are you going to the pubs
that are down the alley? </joey>
<connor> - I just go into like the
proper light local pubs, </connor>
<connor> 'cause in the UK, there's
the pubs that anyone goes to </connor>
<joey> and then there's the pubs that have </joey>
<joey> the exact same 30 people go to. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Right. </garnt>
<connor> - And those are the
depressing and dark ones. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't know, 90% of
Wetherspoons I'd say </garnt>
<garnt> fit on the backend story. </garnt>
<connor> - That's just... </connor>
<connor> Yeah okay, most Wetherspoons are... </connor>
<connor> Wetherspoons is a brand of pubs in the UK. </connor>
<joey> It's just like this ultra treat brand. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, you took me to one. </joey>
<garnt> - I did take you to one,
I think it's I liked it. </garnt>
<connor> - And the reason people go there </connor>
<garnt> is 'cause of the very, very cheap drinks </garnt>
<joey> and cheap food they eat together. </joey>
<joey> - Or was this five pounds
for a full course meal </joey>
<connor> or something with a beer? </connor>
<joey> - You basically like a full course meal </joey>
<connor> with an alcoholic drink
for seven pounds, like $9, </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> in London which is... </connor>
<connor> In London the drinks
alone normally were $8, </connor>
<connor> which I'm pretty people
in California are like, </connor>
<connor> Oh, that's cheap, in the UK that's... </connor>
<connor> bear in mind where I grew up, </connor>
<connor> a drink that's over three
pounds, which is like $4, </connor>
<joey> it's like wow, get low to this guy. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah because if you
go to a pub in Australia </connor>
<joey> for a pint it's nine bucks. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. I mean where... </connor>
<connor> The Wetherspoons, which is the cheap areas </connor>
<connor> of where I grew up, it was
like their main selling point </connor>
<connor> was two pound pints, </connor>
<joey> and sometimes some of the
special brews were one pound 60. </joey>
<joey> - Wow.
- So that's </joey>
<joey> like $2 something for a pint. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - No wonder that there's... </joey>
<connor> People are in there from 2:00
PM until 9:00 PM to dead. </connor>
<garnt> - Getting their money's worth. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. 'Cause to me, </garnt>
<garnt> pubs are just the place
where you pre-drink </garnt>
<joey> before you actually go out </joey>
<joey> to the establishment you
want to go to, right? </joey>
<joey> That's how I see it. </joey>
<joey> Whereas with izakayas,
I can fucking stay there </joey>
<garnt> from the beginning of the
night, to the end of the night. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You don't feel pressured to leave </connor>
<connor> and you don't really have like... </connor>
<connor> They're normally cordoned off decently </connor>
<connor> while when you feel like
it's just you and your mates. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Whereas sometimes the
pubs having to see everyone </connor>
<connor> around you is a little
like, Oh my God, it's busy. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah that's one thing
I don't like about, </joey>
<connor> I guess UK style pubs and
there are a few of those </connor>
<connor> in Japan as well. </connor>
<connor> There's a place called the Hub </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> Which I'm sure you boys are aware of. </connor>
<joey> It's a... </joey>
<joey> Don't go there by the way, </joey>
<connor> because it's like going
into a UK pub, but in Japan. </connor>
<connor> So why the fuck would you do that? </connor>
<connor> - But brighter?
- [Conner] Okay. But- </connor>
<joey> - But it's a little bit brighter. </joey>
<joey> - I've heard there, if you're a foreigner </joey>
<joey> and you really wanna pick up some people </joey>
<joey> who are really into foreigners, </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Oh yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - They are probably there </joey>
<connor> because they know that
foreigners go there. </connor>
<joey> - If you have the yellow
fever but can't be bothered </joey>
<connor> to go the traditional
route, go to the Hub. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. But like.. </connor>
<connor> - The Hub at Shibuya, you'll just be fine. </connor>
<connor> - But every time I go
into a Hub, it's just... </connor>
<connor> Well, first of all, it's
like 99% foreigners. </connor>
<garnt> - It's also very depressing. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's also very depressing because </garnt>
<garnt> it's kind of structured like- </garnt>
<garnt> - That's what I'm saying, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - It's structured like a UK pub where </garnt>
<garnt> the seats are kind of sporadic </garnt>
<joey> and then everyone is standing around you, </joey>
<joey> so you just feel really close to her. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. I don't mind
standing and drinking. </connor>
<garnt> Sometimes standing is fun. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know, it's like I need a table. </garnt>
<connor> It definitely needs to be a table there </connor>
<connor> where I can leave my drink. </connor>
<connor> If I'm just standing in a corner, </connor>
<connor> which sometimes on like a
Friday or Saturday night </connor>
<joey> in England where some pubs are crowded </joey>
<joey> and you just have to stand there </joey>
<joey> in the middle of the floor,
just with your mates, </joey>
<joey> I'm just like, this is not
the vibe I want to go for. </joey>
<joey> - My legs hurt, I want to sit down. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. The thing I like
about izakaya is that </joey>
<joey> you're always sitting down, </joey>
<joey> you have your own sanctioned corner </joey>
<joey> where you can just sit
and talk to your mates. </joey>
<garnt> And it's just the perfect
kind of catch up vibe </garnt>
<garnt> I look for when I just wanna
just chill with my mates </garnt>
<joey> and just chill-
- That's also so cheap, </joey>
<joey> like you can go to any izakaya here </joey>
<joey> and the most you'll
pay for a beer is what? </joey>
<garnt> Like 400 yen? Maybe, that's
a pretty expensive one. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's an expensive one. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. I'm saying like
the max you'll pay. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. Normally you pay
between 200 and 300 yen </joey>
<garnt> for a beer, which is like $23 dollars. </garnt>
<joey> - I went to an izakaya that
where it was at 50 yen beers. </joey>
<joey> - What's the point? </joey>
<joey> - 50 yen. </joey>
<garnt> - How do we even compete? </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause one thing that
doesn't make sense to me, </garnt>
<garnt> is that sometimes it's
cheaper to drink in an izakaya </garnt>
<connor> than it is to go to a family
market or konbini and buy- </connor>
<connor> - A can of beer. </connor>
<connor> - Buy a can of beer, which is like... </connor>
<joey> Can you imagine if that
was the case in the UK? </joey>
<connor> Like if going to Tesco's is more expensive </connor>
<joey> than going to your local Wetherspoons? </joey>
<joey> I'm just like, nobody would drink at home. </joey>
<garnt> Everyone would just be
out constantly drinking. </garnt>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I think the UK economy would just stop. </connor>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> I think the country would fail. </joey>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. But like... </connor>
<connor> I think the one thing I
like about izakayas is that, </connor>
<joey> again, even people who don't drink </joey>
<connor> can still go to an izakaya
and have a good time. </connor>
<connor> Because as you know, we've
established it's mostly </connor>
<connor> drink based, but the
food a lot of the times </connor>
<connor> is also so freaking good and
cheap, that you could be... </connor>
<connor> Probably one of as much
fun if you want drinking, </connor>
<connor> but, you can easily take your friend </connor>
<joey> who doesn't drink at all, </joey>
<joey> and they'll probably still
have a decent time, right? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, 'cause like the food there, </garnt>
<joey> you can easily order a
lot of snack kind of food, </joey>
<joey> it's not like you have to order a meal, </joey>
<joey> you know what I mean? </joey>
<garnt> - So like a giant fucking pub burger? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </joey>
<garnt> - I will say that I do feel
the food is a coin flip </garnt>
<joey> sometimes at the izakayas,
like you can normally tell </joey>
<joey> which ones are gonna have bad food, </joey>
<joey> but sometimes the food is just really bad. </joey>
<joey> - Are you only saying that </joey>
<connor> because you got food poisoning? </connor>
<connor> - No, I did get food poisoning, </connor>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<connor> I did get food poisoning very
recently from the izakaya, </connor>
<connor> but then, the more I've
been living in Japan </connor>
<joey> and the more I've been eating
out at restaurants in Japan, </joey>
<joey> the more I realized like my God, </joey>
<joey> this food is so much better
than the izakaya food. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I'm like, yeah, it's fine, </connor>
<connor> and you know, normally just
taking the Carnegie and, </connor>
<connor> which is like the Japanese
boneless fried chicken. </connor>
<joey> - I mean yeah, don't get me wrong, </joey>
<connor> the izakaya food is good </connor>
<connor> but there's definitely like... </connor>
<connor> If you want proper food, </connor>
<connor> - There's somewhere... </connor>
<joey> - You need to go to a
proper establishment. </joey>
<joey> - There's sometimes
that I'm in an izakaya, </joey>
<connor> I'm eating and I'm like,
God, this food is depressing. </connor>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> It's like really? </garnt>
<garnt> There's one Nero while we're
filming this, that like... </garnt>
<connor> You know the one, it was
the underground place. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And they had the driest
chicken I'd ever seen in my life. </connor>
<joey> You think of like they'd
have let this chicken out </joey>
<joey> to die in the Sahara desert
before they harvested it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it was pretty anemic, was it? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Everything on it was just kinda like, </joey>
<connor> all right, I guess you just
didn't love your job today. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. The food... </joey>
<joey> That one is definitely like... </joey>
<joey> It's not horrible. </joey>
<connor> - Do you know its gonna be that bad? </connor>
<connor> When like the menu, everything is 150 yen? </connor>
<garnt> - Oh yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, you get what
you pay for, sometimes- </garnt>
<connor> - Right, right. </connor>
<connor> - But like comparing
Izakaya food to some of </connor>
<garnt> the pub food that I'm used to, </garnt>
<connor> I don't know, I feel like- </connor>
<connor> - I think pub food's really
fucking good in the UK. </connor>
<connor> Am I-
- Really? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, maybe I'm too white
to make this point, but- </connor>
<garnt> - I don't know, 'cause if I had a choice, </garnt>
<garnt> pub food is where I go if
I have no other choice, </garnt>
<garnt> so I can't be bothered to cook for myself. </garnt>
<garnt> - I promise right, hand on heart, </garnt>
<joey> If I had to choose between izakaya food </joey>
<joey> and English pub food, I'd
go with pub food, no joke. </joey>
<joey> - Well, I'm gonna go with izakaya food. </joey>
<joey> - Joey's fucking biased. </joey>
<joey> - No, I'm not. </joey>
<joey> - He is never gonna admit that. </joey>
<joey> - Not at all. </joey>
<connor> - I don't care about your opinion Joey. </connor>
<connor> - No. Okay shut up for a second. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Okay, fine. </connor>
<connor> - Okay. 'Cause it's the
kind of the same thing </connor>
<connor> with Australian pub food as well. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know man, I can't comment. </connor>
<connor> Yours is a wild card. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause Australian
pubs is kind of the same </connor>
<connor> as the UK pubs right? </connor>
<joey> Where most people just go to drink </joey>
<joey> and usually it's very fucking depressing </joey>
<connor> 'cause it's just a bunch
of middle-aged dudes, </connor>
<connor> who've been sitting there
since 2:00 PM, right? </connor>
<connor> Just wasting their life away. </connor>
<connor> But like a lot of pubs in Australia, </connor>
<connor> they have really fucking good food. </connor>
<joey> But the problem is that you
only get a set portion of food, </joey>
<joey> for a stupid amount of money. </joey>
<joey> - [Conner] Right. </joey>
<connor> - Right. And so sometimes- </connor>
<connor> - So it's like a cost thing. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. Yes, cheap- </joey>
<connor> - The only thing is that I smell broke. </connor>
<connor> Joey's broke. </connor>
<joey> (Conner and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<connor> - You will be once you... </connor>
<joey> After you go to an
Australian pub, you will be. </joey>
<garnt> It's 25 bucks for a fucking pizza. </garnt>
<joey> It's just not worth it, but like... </joey>
<joey> But the thing is that
with Australian pub food, </joey>
<connor> a lot of it's good, but
there's just like you know, </connor>
<connor> even before you go into the pub, </connor>
<connor> what food is gonna be there? </connor>
<joey> - [Conner] Yeah, yeah- </joey>
<joey> - There is just so little variety... </joey>
<garnt> And you know, same thing
could be said with izakayas, </garnt>
<joey> but I feel that- </joey>
<connor> - It's always the same shit in izakayas. </connor>
<joey> - I don't know, man, different izakayas </joey>
<connor> have different things that
they specialize in I feel. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah but then, but yeah.. </connor>
<garnt> - But pubs are always
just like burgers, pizza- </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no. The reason
I love izakaya food is </garnt>
<joey> they're designed to go well
with the beer or alcohol </joey>
<joey> that you're drinking. </joey>
<joey> - It's just the perfect... </joey>
<joey> It's the synergy you were
talking about, the pizza synergy. </joey>
<connor> - I was right about that by away. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> - It just synergizes so well together, </connor>
<garnt> whereas with pub food,
it's the same kind of meal. </garnt>
<joey> - It's just like put this in your stomach. </joey>
<connor> - I think yes, sometimes it
is, but not all the time. </connor>
<connor> There's been plenty of
izakayas we've been to </connor>
<garnt> where I'm like, this is just weak, </garnt>
<connor> this is mid as you would say Joey. </connor>
<connor> - I mean I wasn't even gonna say that- </connor>
<garnt> - But even like the mid
izakayas are still better </garnt>
<garnt> than some of the best pub food. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know... </garnt>
<garnt> I just don't like pubs, I'm sorry England, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't like pubs. </garnt>
<joey> - You know what though? </joey>
<joey> I do really like Irish
pubs for their food. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I feel that at
least with Irish pubs, </joey>
<connor> unlike UK pubs, there's a
little more variety in the food, </connor>
<connor> and there's I feel, at
least from my experience, </connor>
<connor> I feel less- </connor>
<connor> - I took you to shitty pubs there. </connor>
<connor> - But I feel less pressure
to get out of an Irish pub, </connor>
<connor> than I do in a UK pub </connor>
<joey> if I'm not just sitting there drinking. </joey>
<connor> - Hold that-
- Yeah, I like Irish pubs. </connor>
<joey> - It's normally... </joey>
<connor> Where were you drinking? In Dublin or? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. Dublin and I'd
went to something like </joey>
<connor> Limerick and stuff like that </connor>
<connor> but they were all around Ireland. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. I mean the norm in
the UK, apart from England </connor>
<connor> 'cause I think a lot of
England is just depressing </connor>
<joey> outside of the big cities, no offense. </joey>
<joey> In the small towns, in Wales and stuff, </joey>
<joey> there's some really fun pubs
'cause it's just like 20- </joey>
<joey> - I'm not gonna go to wales. </joey>
<joey> - No, no, you are not. </joey>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> There's no reason to go to Wales charity. </joey>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> I'm sorry Wales. </joey>
<joey> I'm sorry. </joey>
<joey> I'm sorry Wales, it's true, </joey>
<joey> We have to accept that
fact unless you like- </joey>
<joey> - I like sheep? </joey>
<joey> - Do you like nature Joey? </joey>
<joey> - I like sheep. </joey>
<joey> - Do you like rundown
castles? Do you like those? </joey>
<joey> - It's just hit or miss for me. </joey>
<joey> - All right. You have love what... </joey>
<joey> (Conner and Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> - That's all it is. </joey>
<connor> - That is not really too much to do. </connor>
<joey> - I wanna go to that fucking Lake </joey>
<joey> that has the longest name in the world. </joey>
<connor> - I know, that's sort
of like that's a town. </connor>
<joey> - Oh It's a town. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. And it's </connor>
<connor> Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliagogogoch. </connor>
<joey> is the town named Joey. </joey>
<connor> How dare you not tell that? </connor>
<connor> - Honestly you could have
completely made that up. </connor>
<connor> I'd probably be like, yes. </connor>
<joey> - Is that true? </joey>
<joey> - Yes, that's right.
- Correctly. </joey>
<joey> I actually was gonna make a video </joey>
<garnt> or I went to that place. </garnt>
<connor> I actually filmed it, I filmed it all. </connor>
<garnt> - Was that the town where the news anchor </garnt>
<joey> pronounced imperfectly,
- Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - And that just went viral? </garnt>
<garnt> - Just up the road from </garnt>
<joey> Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliagogogoch, </joey>
<connor> the temperature you got at 21 Celsius. </connor>
<connor> - It's like 6 millimeters. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. So I went there and
I filmed a video actually, </connor>
<connor> but I have all this
footage though, and like I- </connor>
<joey> - So wait, so what's in it? </joey>
<connor> - It's just me going around this place. </connor>
<joey> Just checking out. </joey>
<joey> - No but I mean, what's the town like? </joey>
<connor> - It's fucking dead. </connor>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> it was fucking rotten dead. </joey>
<joey> - Is it dead because no one
can pronounce the place? </joey>
<joey> - Maybe I don't... </joey>
<joey> So it's about... </joey>
<joey> It was like two hours
drive from where I grew up. </joey>
<joey> So I asked one of my mates, I was like, </joey>
<joey> hey, can we go over here and
just film a bunch of shit? </joey>
<connor> I don't know why I was like, fuck it, </connor>
<connor> maybe something fun will happen. </connor>
<joey> Though nothing fun happened obviously. </joey>
<joey> But there was also a climbing
place that we wanted to go to, </joey>
<joey> so we'll just go there after
we are done with filming. </joey>
<joey> - Climb you mean the hill? </joey>
<connor> - No, no, no, like a climbing gym. </connor>
<connor> - Ooooh, climbing gym, </connor>
<connor> I get.
- It's huge, </connor>
<connor> huge warehouse, pretty cool. </connor>
<connor> So if you wanna go there,
there's a climbing gym </connor>
<connor> inside there, </connor>
<connor> but I went there, and it was just a bunch </connor>
<joey> of tourists from England, </joey>
<joey> - All right. </joey>
<joey> - They were old, very, very
old, like sixties plus, </joey>
<joey> just hanging around, just checking it out, </joey>
<joey> there's a gift shop, tiny. </joey>
<joey> And then there's a bunch of stores, </joey>
<connor> and I went in there, you know, asking... </connor>
<connor> 'Cause we were in a
really West part of Wales, </connor>
<connor> and they normally could speak Welsh. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, Oh, well,
maybe I'll ask around </connor>
<joey> and see if anyone could speak Welsh. </joey>
<joey> No one could speak fucking Welsh. </joey>
<joey> - Really? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. I was surprised, </joey>
<joey> 'cause normally in that far West, </joey>
<joey> I think that County is the
one with the highest rate </joey>
<joey> of welsh literacy as well. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Right.
- [Garnt] Right. </joey>
<joey> - So, yeah, nothing there. </joey>
<joey> - Nothing there? </joey>
<joey> - So if you've ever wondered
what's there, nothing. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Nothing. </joey>
<joey> - Just a really comically
large train sign. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- It's actually like- </garnt>
<connor> - How do they fit in? </connor>
<garnt> Is it on size two font? </garnt>
<connor> - No no on, you know the normal... </connor>
<connor> So normally in the UK, </connor>
<joey> each one has like a standard size of font. </joey>
<joey> It's quite big. </joey>
<joey> They literally just add it on. </joey>
<joey> They're like they drill it on by hand. </joey>
<joey> - There is a really funny image </joey>
<connor> of a guy standing next to
it and it's 10 meters long. </connor>
<connor> - It's really, really... </connor>
<connor> I'll have some footage
up from the video that </connor>
<joey> Meilyne Tran can just
show on screen right now. </joey>
<joey> it's fucking huge and
- [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - It's sad 'cause none of the
trains stopped there either. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<joey> There's a really... </joey>
<joey> Train that goes direct to
London but that doesn't </joey>
<joey> stop through that, and I
think it's only local trains. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, at least you have
plenty of time to read it </garnt>
<joey> as you go past it. </joey>
<joey> - I wanna hear how the
train lady pronounces it. </joey>
<joey> Is it an automated message that... </joey>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - So it's shortened to like San vide PG or </connor>
<joey> (speaking foreign language) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. Oh yeah. I got it. </joey>
<joey> - Which is still awfully long. </joey>
<joey> - It just sounds like you
got a lot of flame circles. </joey>
<joey> - Right, right, right, but it... </joey>
<joey> Okay, the problem is even with Wales, </joey>
<joey> if you look around the rest of that map, </joey>
<joey> all the town names are just as bad. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Really? </joey>
<joey> - Around that area to pronounce. </joey>
<joey> I can't pronounce some
of them without taking </joey>
<joey> three minutes to look at it and be like </joey>
<joey> (speaking foreign language) </joey>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> (speaking foreign language) </joey>
<joey> it's kind of hard, it was a nice tangent, </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Like cute little town of Wales. </joey>
<joey> Don't go there, nothing there. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Don't go there. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, I live next to some </garnt>
<garnt> weird sounding places as well. </garnt>
<joey> I remember when Joey came to visit, </joey>
<joey> I took him and Aki to this
place called Devil's Dyke. </joey>
<joey> - Devil's Dyke. </joey>
<joey> - I remember saying that, oh yeah, </joey>
<joey> I'm gonna take you guys to Devil's Dyke. </joey>
<garnt> Aki's face was just like </garnt>
<garnt> (speaking foreign language) </garnt>
<garnt> - What did you just say? </garnt>
<joey> - Because do you guys like, is Dyke... </joey>
<connor> Does the word Dyke-
- Yes. </connor>
<connor> - Have the same meaning? </connor>
<connor> - Yes.
- Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - So most of it is like a hill. </joey>
<joey> - But there's tons of
fucked up names in the UK. </joey>
<joey> That's like... </joey>
<joey> There's places called White
Knight and stuff like that. </joey>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, there's another place
I live next to or close to </garnt>
<joey> called Cuckfield, </joey>
<joey> - [Conner] Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Every time I drive... </joey>
<connor> Every time I'm on the train
and it goes past that, </connor>
<connor> I just have a little laugh to myself. </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - There's a Cockfosters as well in London? </connor>
<garnt> - Cockfosters. </garnt>
<garnt> - Cockfosters. </garnt>
<joey> - One of the main trains
stops at Cockfosters finally. </joey>
<connor> So it's like, this is
the train to Cockfosters. </connor>
<garnt> - I feel like a five-year-old
every time I go on that line. </garnt>
<joey> I can't remember what line it is, </joey>
<joey> - It's Piccadilly line. </joey>
<joey> - Piccadilly line, the dark
blue line. Every time I... </joey>
<joey> Because I haven't lived
in London for a few years, </joey>
<garnt> every time I go on there and I hear it, </garnt>
<garnt> I just have to laugh. </garnt>
<connor> - Burst a little smirky like none. </connor>
<joey> - I completely forgot. </joey>
<joey> - Should be those cock
fielders fucking a lot. </joey>
<joey> - There's so many that
are just like sly words. </joey>
<connor> I don't know how this is a thing. </connor>
<connor> How did we get this? How did this happen? </connor>
<joey> - We just like in Australia, </joey>
<connor> we don't have anything like
that, it's kind of sad. </connor>
<connor> We just have a lot of life. </connor>
<connor> - Special new. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. Honestly. </connor>
<connor> And like a lot of the
names are just named off </connor>
<joey> the indigenous names. </joey>
<joey> So they sound funny, but
they're not like Cuckfield. </joey>
<connor> - I always learned by
talking to you about this </connor>
<joey> I was like, why is
there a New South Wales, </joey>
<joey> like South Wales was
never good to begin with? </joey>
<joey> Why are we making another one? </joey>
<joey> - I don't know. </joey>
<connor> - Maybe you start up from the
ground up making a good one? </connor>
<connor> - Honestly I don't know. </connor>
<joey> The only funny named place in Australia </joey>
<joey> that I know is Banana. </joey>
<connor> - Oh. </connor>
<joey> - This is a town in
Queensland called Banana, </joey>
<joey> and it has this thing
called The Big Banana, </joey>
<joey> which is the Guinness little record </joey>
<joey> for the largest banana
statue in the world. </joey>
<garnt> - Why? </garnt>
<garnt> - Did they just name a
town after that one statue? </garnt>
<joey> - Almost because also every banana </joey>
<connor> in Australia grows in Banana, Queensland. </connor>
<connor> - That part it makes more sense. </connor>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> You should have lied with
that before you told us... </joey>
<joey> I have no idea why it's called banana. </joey>
<garnt> But they just grow a lot
of bananas. It's weird. </garnt>
<joey> - There's a place they grow bananas. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> And that makes a lot of it, </joey>
<joey> it's like now that you've
explained the context, </joey>
<joey> that makes a lot more sense. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> So we just have stuff like that, </garnt>
<joey> but wish I fucking lived in
a place called Cuckfield. </joey>
<connor> That would be hilarious.
That'd be the best. </connor>
<connor> That would be the best
fucking conversations- </connor>
<connor> - Feels like you'd grow tired after all. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. But it's like, where are you from? </connor>
<joey> Cuckfield and you immediately get along, </joey>
<joey> and it's like I've already
blended in with the conversation. </joey>
<joey> - I wish you just go to a town
in Japan when they're like </joey>
<joey> (speaking in foreign language) </joey>
<connor> - Sundei it's like you where you live now. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And you'll be like Cuckfield. </connor>
<joey> - Cuckfield.
- Cuckfield. </joey>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<joey> - Getting back to </joey>
<joey> - Izakayas-
- Izikayas </joey>
<joey> and Japanese matters, </joey>
<connor> - How do we come from
izakayas to Cuckfield? </connor>
<joey> - Wales, wales man. </joey>
<connor> - To me like I... </connor>
<connor> Izakayas is my number one
kind of drinking establishment </connor>
<connor> that I enjoy throughout the world, </connor>
<garnt> like anywhere else-
- I mean, </garnt>
<garnt> it's the easiest, it's the chillest- </garnt>
<garnt> - It's the chillest you know. </garnt>
<garnt> - You always... </garnt>
<garnt> It's always nice, all foreigners love it </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause it's so easy. </garnt>
<garnt> You press the little button-
- [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Sometimes it's all you can drink- </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh yeah, 'cause you don't
have to order at the bar. </garnt>
<connor> - Never have to order at the bar. </connor>
<garnt> - Never order at the bar. </garnt>
<connor> - I will say that is 100
times better than in the UK. </connor>
<connor> - You all order all your food
and drinks from a tablet. </connor>
<connor> There's no pressure to
get order at the bar </connor>
<garnt> and they just bring it to you. </garnt>
<joey> - 'Cause there is a... </joey>
<joey> One of my favorite izakayas I go to a lot </joey>
<joey> with my other friends is a... </joey>
<joey> it's one unique biko, </joey>
<joey> I don't know what it's called anymore. </joey>
<joey> It used to be called Kobayashi. </joey>
<joey> So I think I took you guys there. </joey>
<joey> I don't remember, but basically, </joey>
<joey> it's on the West side of Ikibuka, </joey>
<joey> and it's underground </joey>
<joey> and it's exactly like in izakaya, </joey>
<joey> so it has food and everything but </joey>
<joey> you pour your own drinks. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, I think I've
been to that one as well. </joey>
<garnt> - And there's a huge tub, </garnt>
<garnt> it's like a fucking
barrel full of miso shiro, </garnt>
<connor> miso soup, and it's just
all you can drink miso soup, </connor>
<connor> as well as the best fucking thing ever, </connor>
<connor> 'cause it's just like... </connor>
<connor> 'Cause miso soup is the ultimate
hangover drink in my life. </connor>
<joey> - Yes. </joey>
<garnt> - Another thing I wanna
talk about when it comes </garnt>
<joey> to Japanese drinking culture is nomihodai. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Which is all you can drink, </joey>
<joey> which anytime someone from England </joey>
<joey> (Conner and Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> or America or someone comes
here and they see how many... </joey>
<joey> They learn about the way
you can drink culture, </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's like, </joey>
<joey> (Garnt clapping) </joey>
<garnt> boys, I'm moving here, I'm
coming out every night. </garnt>
<joey> - Every Australian I've
taken to a nomihodai </joey>
<joey> has always either been like,
so is there a drink limit? </joey>
<garnt> (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> Or they're like, Oh, it's
only for 10 minutes, right? </garnt>
<garnt> It's like happy hour, right? </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, no, you can do
it for as long as you want. </garnt>
<garnt> They are just like- </garnt>
<garnt> - How much is a typical nomihodai? </garnt>
<connor> - That's 1500 for 30 minutes, is it? </connor>
<joey> - No.
- No. </joey>
<joey> - It's cheaper than that. </joey>
<joey> - It depends with which one you go, </joey>
<connor> either it's like- </connor>
<joey> - I've seen like 2000 yen for two hours. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. I think it's about... </garnt>
<garnt> So it's about 20 bucks for two
hours of all you can drink. </garnt>
<connor> - It depends where you go. </connor>
<connor> But generally it's around that price. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, around that price. </connor>
<garnt> And compared to everywhere
you see in England </garnt>
<garnt> and everything, that's
like a massively good deal. </garnt>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Exactly. It's like, why would you not... </joey>
<joey> Even if you can't drink that much, right? </joey>
<joey> Why would you not take that? </joey>
<connor> - Even if you'd like,
I'm not at a brisk pace, </connor>
<joey> It's still good value for money. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause even like say, you
know, it's 500 yen for a beer, </connor>
<joey> - [Conner] Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Even if you drink four
beers in the two hours, </connor>
<connor> you still getting your money's worth. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- [Conner] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So it's like every time I'm just, Oh, </connor>
<joey> I don't really feel
like drinking that much, </joey>
<joey> but let's do nomihodai, its much- </joey>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> - I remember when... </joey>
<connor> 'Cause obviously when you move here, </connor>
<joey> you kind of stop wanting
all you can drink. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause you're like it wears off. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - But for the first few
times I visited here, </connor>
<connor> I remember thinking like... </connor>
<connor> Treating it like an Olympic event. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, all right, how
many times during the- </connor>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - No. 'Cause that's what it
would be if there was no way </garnt>
<connor> you could drink in England, right? </connor>
<garnt> - Would be, yeah. That's how we think, </garnt>
<joey> 'cause that's how we're wired. </joey>
<joey> - You're like 80 percent
speed running izakayas. </joey>
<joey> - I was yeah, I was like
get the clock ready guys. </joey>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Time. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I remember, I allege
she had this dilemma, </connor>
<joey> I was drinking a beer and the
first one I smashed it back, </joey>
<joey> no problem, that's easy. </joey>
<joey> Second beer I was like shit,
I'm two seconds off pace. </joey>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> but I remember... </garnt>
<garnt> I actually remember being like
I'm one minute off the pace </garnt>
<garnt> I struck myself. </garnt>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Exactly the same. </connor>
<joey> You were like, how many beers do I need to </joey>
<joey> drink to make this worth?
Then how many can I go over? </joey>
<joey> You were calculating this
in your head to be like, </joey>
<joey> okay, if I drink one beer
every five to 10 minutes, </joey>
<garnt> then I can smash this many beers </garnt>
<garnt> and I'd be earning back
this amount of money. </garnt>
<garnt> You know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> - [Conner] Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - You treating it like stocks. </connor>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause this is what it is, 'cause we... </joey>
<joey> I can't remember this. </joey>
<connor> I first came here as a tourist. </connor>
<joey> We visited a bar that had 200 yen beers. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I thought, okay, that's my new baseline, </joey>
<joey> for all you can drink. </joey>
<joey> I need to make sure I
get more of my money. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> I need to make sure it's better
value than 200 yen a beer. </joey>
<joey> So I think we went to one that
was 2000 yen for two hours </joey>
<joey> and I was like, okay, in my
head, I'm working it out. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, okay.. </joey>
<joey> - So that's 10 beers in 10 hours. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I need to get
at least 10 beers, yes. </joey>
<joey> I got to get 11 just
check, just to get it under </joey>
<joey> so I feel this was worth coming to, </joey>
<joey> and I remember I was
in so much fucking pain </joey>
<joey> on the ninth beer. </joey>
<joey> Kinda got... </joey>
<joey> 'Cause we were eating as well, </joey>
<connor> and my stomach was like, </connor>
<joey> (Conner panting) </joey>
<joey> - Because I think it was eight
beers in where I was like, </joey>
<joey> I don't know if I forgot to tell you </joey>
<joey> but you can get other drinks too. </joey>
<joey> It doesn't have to be just- </joey>
<connor> - But I knew that
getting all you can drink </connor>
<connor> like spirits was playing with fire. </connor>
<connor> And I would have been on the floor. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> So I'm like, now I'll stick with beer </connor>
<connor> 'cause beer is the natural pace. </connor>
<connor> - Now I'm gonna take you guys
to the 50 yen beer place, </connor>
<garnt> because it's not an all you can drink, </garnt>
<garnt> but it's 50 yen- </garnt>
<joey> - I'm in this 50 yen
so you might as well be </joey>
<joey> all you can get.
- Yeah, right. </joey>
<joey> - Because I feel like
that's just the difference </joey>
<joey> in mindset between
anyone from like the West </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> and people in Japan. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause when anyone in the West comes over </joey>
<joey> and here's all you can
drink, all you can eat, </joey>
<joey> it's the same mindset
where it's just like, </joey>
<joey> I've got a fucking speed, run this. </joey>
<garnt> I've gotta optimize this. </garnt>
<garnt> What is the optimal speed versus trucks </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey and Conner laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> for all you can take? </garnt>
<garnt> And Japanese people are just like, </garnt>
<garnt> no we just drink however
much we feel like. </garnt>
<connor> - That's the pressure
of not having to know </connor>
<connor> how much you're gonna earn. </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause I think it works
on the trust system. </garnt>
<connor> 'Cause I remember... </connor>
<connor> - We trust you not to
be a fucking alcoholic. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - That's why this would never work </connor>
<connor> in any other country, but Japan. </connor>
<joey> - Because I remember I went
to this kind of like... </joey>
<joey> It wasn't a wine bar, what's
the place that they make wine, </joey>
<joey> what's that called? </joey>
<joey> - Winery? </joey>
<joey> - Winery, that's the place. </joey>
<joey> So I went to this winery with
Sydney, just outside of Tokyo, </joey>
<joey> and they basically had a cellar of about </joey>
<joey> a 1000 different wines. </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> - And basically you could
sample as much you like, </joey>
<garnt> for 10 bucks, 10 bucks you
had a cellar of a 1000 wines. </garnt>
<connor> - That's gotta be some
really wrong catastrophe, </connor>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, if you actually go greedy </garnt>
<garnt> you gonna get killed. </garnt>
<garnt> - You going into the cellar. </garnt>
<garnt> - No no, it's totally right. </garnt>
<connor> - So you can drink as much of
it, as you want for 10 bucks? </connor>
<connor> - Okay. So you can sample as much of it. </connor>
<connor> So every </connor>
<garnt> (Conner laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Sample? </garnt>
<garnt> - Every- </garnt>
<connor> - No, British people don't sample shakes. </connor>
<garnt> - That's exactly the point. </garnt>
<garnt> That's exactly the point
I'm trying to make. </garnt>
<garnt> So I... </garnt>
<garnt> So me and Sydney went to being like... </garnt>
<connor> The exact same mindset where it's like, </connor>
<connor> there must be a catch,
there must be a catch. </connor>
<connor> This competition- </connor>
<connor> - One of them is poison. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<joey> - We go down there and they
give us this little cup, </joey>
<joey> it's the super small
cup, where you can pour, </joey>
<joey> I'd say a third of a
glass of wine into it. </joey>
<joey> - And these Japanese
people were just pouring </joey>
<joey> one little drop, like
two little drops now, </joey>
<joey> just like letting the
drop sit on their tongue. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And then we were just
like, but we can draw... </joey>
<joey> We can pour however much we want, right? </joey>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> 'Cause that's the thing, it's
based on the trust system. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But you know, if you
want to, you can just pour </joey>
<joey> however much you want for
as many wines as you want </joey>
<garnt> and no one's going to stop you, right? So- </garnt>
<joey> - There's something similar to that, </joey>
<connor> that I saw in, oh fuck, where was it? </connor>
<connor> I think it was in Nagano,
when I went for a trip, </connor>
<connor> it was a sponsored trip
and at the station, </connor>
<joey> because Nagano is kind
of known for its sake, </joey>
<joey> there was exactly the same thing. </joey>
<joey> It was like 50 to like a 100 barrels </joey>
<connor> of all sorts of different sake, </connor>
<connor> and it's like yeah, again like- </connor>
<connor> - It was like water of everything? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, it was a thousand
yen for all you can test. </garnt>
<garnt> - All you can test. </garnt>
<joey> - All you can test. </joey>
<joey> It's not all you can drink,
it's all you can test. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - All you can sample. </joey>
<joey> And I'm just like, hell yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - But there's nothing
stopping you from sampling </garnt>
<joey> as much as you like, right? </joey>
<garnt> - I was 20 tier in and I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm only a fifth of the way through </garnt>
<joey> so I'm about to fucking faint. </joey>
<joey> - Imagine if you can ask for a free sample </joey>
<joey> but there's no one stopping you </joey>
<joey> from asking for unlimited free samples. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> You get unlimited free samples. </joey>
<joey> That's basically the mindset. </joey>
<joey> (Joey and Conner laughing) </joey>
<joey> So it's like we're here as a westerner, </joey>
<garnt> thinking we got the
fucking cheat code to this. </garnt>
<joey> So, we can just like- </joey>
<joey> - It's like bottomless fries </joey>
<joey> but if you can go up
and get your own fries. </joey>
<connor> - It's like having a buff in this country. </connor>
<joey> It's like being British, the
alcohol, it's like oh shit. </joey>
<joey> - What's another establishment
that's very specific </joey>
<joey> to Japanese nightlife? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I like to think
that the karaoke nightlife? </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, karaoke nightlife
here is just good as done. </garnt>
<joey> It's the perfect kind
of place for karaoke. </joey>
<joey> - Because I didn't realize until recently, </joey>
<joey> but the karaoke in Japan,
is so much different </joey>
<connor> to the perception of karaoke
in Western countries. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I remember when
you, me and Felix got... </connor>
<connor> When we took Felix to a
karaoke for the first time, </connor>
<joey> he didn't wanna go. </joey>
<joey> He was kinda like, Oh, karaoke, </joey>
<connor> - Sort of cringe. </connor>
<connor> - It sounds cringe. </connor>
<connor> Because I think in his mind, </connor>
<garnt> his idea of karaoke is
an open bar karaoke. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah I have- </garnt>
<joey> - Which I think a lot of people think- </joey>
<joey> - I think a lot of people think, </joey>
<garnt> 'cause in Japan I feel like
after the Izakaya, you know, </garnt>
<joey> or after going to a pub in England, </joey>
<connor> the precedence is after the
pub, you basically go clubbing. </connor>
<connor> There's no other place to go. </connor>
<connor> But in Japan, </connor>
<connor> - We'll go home and watch fun animations. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah exactly right? </connor>
<joey> But in Japan, you can just go to karaoke </joey>
<joey> and just continue the session there. </joey>
<joey> Also just hang out with your mates </joey>
<joey> and sing a bunch of songs as well. </joey>
<joey> - And it's all you can drink again. </joey>
<joey> - And again, it's all you can drink, </joey>
<garnt> everywhere you go in Japan
you can get all you can drink. </garnt>
<garnt> It's fucking great. </garnt>
<joey> - It's all you can drink and
the karaoke establishment </joey>
<connor> is open 24 hours. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- [Conner] Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Which is just like a power move. </joey>
<connor> - Although I swear
whichever brand is offering, </connor>
<connor> 'cause not all of them
do all you can drink. </connor>
<connor> And some of them do it for way
more expensive than others. </connor>
<connor> And I never know which fucking one it is, </connor>
<connor> so I just walk in and I'm
like, please be the cheap one. </connor>
<joey> - But that's it yeah,
that's the thing though. </joey>
<joey> You have to kind of go
around to each brand </joey>
<connor> of karaoke chain, and be like, okay, </connor>
<connor> this is the cheapest one
for all you can drink, </connor>
<connor> this is the most expensive
one for all you can drink, </connor>
<connor> so, you have to kind of be like, okay, </connor>
<joey> do I take value over
price or price over value? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Because you know that if
you go to the cheap ones, </joey>
<joey> the food is probably
gonna be not that great. </joey>
<garnt> - 'Cause I've never like my entire life, </garnt>
<garnt> I've never really enjoyed karaoke </garnt>
<joey> until I experienced karaoke in Japan. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause it's not only
having a private room, </joey>
<joey> so to explain Japanese karaoke, </joey>
<joey> you have this private room, </joey>
<joey> where you can just sing as many songs </joey>
<connor> as you like that you choose, </connor>
<connor> there's no one watching you
apart from your room mates, </connor>
<connor> and you can just have fun </connor>
<connor> and sing whatever the hell you want </connor>
<garnt> in the comfort of your privacy. </garnt>
<connor> - They also have like
every single Western song. </connor>
<garnt> So they have a selection that is like... </garnt>
<joey> clips is everywhere else I've been to. </joey>
<joey> They have English songs, Chinese songs, </joey>
<joey> Korean songs and obviously Japanese songs. </joey>
<joey> - Anime songs, they got
all about anime songs. </joey>
<joey> - I was about to say
man, singing anime songs </joey>
<joey> while you're plastered as a week, </joey>
<joey> that was like... </joey>
<joey> I remember my first
experience was with Joey </joey>
<garnt> and it was one of the
funnest experience ever. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like seeing that list
of all the anime songs, </garnt>
<garnt> it's like opening Pandora's box. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> You're like, </garnt>
<garnt> - Which one? </garnt>
<joey> - Which one do I sing? </joey>
<joey> - It's like... </joey>
<joey> And then the moment he selected </joey>
<garnt> fucking Tell Me Why by The Penpals. </garnt>
<joey> I was just like, okay, this is my boy. </joey>
<garnt> - The original Berserk, </garnt>
<joey> - With the shittiest
guitar riff in existence. </joey>
<garnt> I'm like, yeah, hell yeah. </garnt>
<connor> Well, it's already bad in the original </connor>
<connor> but then the karaoke version was like, </connor>
<garnt> oh this is so much worse,
but it's so much better. </garnt>
<garnt> - I was embarrassed at 3:00 AM </garnt>
<garnt> and we fucking destroyed that song more </garnt>
<garnt> than it already destroyed itself. </garnt>
<garnt> - We sang that song like three times. </garnt>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> So you once source an outpour
like, let's do it again. </joey>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> Oh my God. </joey>
<joey> I fucking miss karaoke, man. </joey>
<joey> Ever since the Rona, we
haven't really been able to- </joey>
<connor> - Go shut down for a while. </connor>
<connor> - I think it's back open though right? </connor>
<connor> From what I understand. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. But Oh man, </connor>
<connor> - It's hard to get into
that mood, you know. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah I know just like, I don't know, </connor>
<connor> I feel now that we've all
kind of been established here, </connor>
<connor> it's become a little bit more
difficult to just be like, </connor>
<connor> hey, do you wanna stay up
till 4:00 AM to go to karaoke? </connor>
<connor> - I think it's, maybe 'cause I get... </connor>
<garnt> I go to bed at 12 now, </garnt>
<garnt> I think I get really fucking tired early. </garnt>
<garnt> - My sleep schedule is
a lot healthier now. </garnt>
<joey> Okay. To explain another thing about </joey>
<joey> Japanese drinking culture is that </joey>
<joey> you have this ticking clock, </joey>
<joey> and it's called the last train. </joey>
<joey> And if you miss the last train, </joey>
<joey> you're staying out until 5:00 AM. </joey>
<joey> There's no... </joey>
<joey> There's basically no in-between, </joey>
<joey> either you choose to go home at like what? </joey>
<joey> 11:00, 12:00? </joey>
<joey> - 11, 12ish yeah. </joey>
<joey> - 11, 11:30, which to me is like... </joey>
<joey> if it was just one hour
later or two hours later, </joey>
<joey> it would be perfect, because
after about one o'clock, </joey>
<joey> I'd be like, okay, I've
had my fun, this is cool. </joey>
<joey> I'm gonna catch the last train now. </joey>
<joey> But having to choose
between going out at 11:30, </joey>
<joey> when you were just about
getting to that point of drunk, </joey>
<connor> this that you just want to keep going, </connor>
<connor> to staying up till 5:00 AM, </connor>
<connor> which we've done it several times, </connor>
<garnt> and every time I just
feel more dead inside, </garnt>
<joey> the night after that. </joey>
<joey> - There's nothing worse... </joey>
<joey> I think the only thing that is worse </joey>
<joey> than going home while
you're buzzed at 11:00 PM </joey>
<connor> is catching that first train at 4:30. </connor>
<joey> It's just fucking like </joey>
<joey> (Joey yelling) </joey>
<joey> - It's like sunny outside and then </joey>
<joey> this businessman next to you, </joey>
<connor> you're clearly a fucking mess. </connor>
<joey> - You just turn into a fucking vampire. </joey>
<joey> Just like, the sun, no. </joey>
<connor> - I fucking fell asleep one time </connor>
<joey> and missed my stop by an hour. </joey>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> I woke up at 6:00 AM, so fucking north. </joey>
<garnt> - Like the end of the line, right? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. I think I was
an hour and a half from Tokyo. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> I tell far I'd gone and
I was like get back. </joey>
<joey> And I was so fucking done. </joey>
<joey> It was 6:30 AM when I
realized and I was like, </joey>
<joey> nooooo. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<connor> So one of the sleep. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I Mean, that's the tough thing, man. </connor>
<connor> I mean, that's the thing like back when </connor>
<joey> I was still single and kind of going out </joey>
<joey> and doing a lot more of
the 4:00 AM 5:00 AM stuff, </joey>
<joey> It would be a little bit
easier because, you know, </joey>
<connor> say like a couple of my
friends will be like, </connor>
<connor> it'd be like, you know, one or 2:00 AM. </connor>
<connor> I'd be like, ah, maybe we
shouldn't continue anymore. </connor>
<connor> It was really easy because you
could just go to Ammonia Cafe </connor>
<connor> and just book a fucking
room for two, three hours, </connor>
<joey> you just fucking sleep in
there until the first train. </joey>
<joey> And that's it so, but
we haven't done that, </joey>
<joey> we should do that more often. </joey>
<joey> Instead I'll just be
like let's call up a taxi </joey>
<joey> and spend a hundred bucks to get home. </joey>
<connor> - I've always known that
you can do the Mung cafes. </connor>
<connor> I just don't wanna have that
conversation at 3:00 AM, </connor>
<connor> smashed to some Japanese
dude and I'm like, </connor>
<connor> (speaking foreign language) </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<joey> - It should just be like,
sleep two hours, let me in. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> It's a monkey brand and they'll be like, </joey>
<connor> okay we get it, we understand. </connor>
<connor> - Maybe, every single time was like </connor>
<connor> I'll just wait until 5:00 AM. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, we should just
do that from now on. </joey>
<connor> If we're having like a boys' night, </connor>
<connor> we'd just be like, I don't want it. </connor>
<joey> 'Cause sometimes I don't
wanna spend a hundred bucks </joey>
<connor> to fuck-
- Coffee? </connor>
<connor> - If we are all going back the same way. </connor>
<joey> It's not split in two ways. </joey>
<joey> - I mean, yeah, I guess, still it's like </joey>
<joey> you still feel like shit, my heart. </joey>
<joey> - What is wrong with my side? </joey>
<connor> What is this clown destroying me? </connor>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> - The clown is just getting to you. </joey>
<connor> - Fuck. It's fighting my monkeyness. </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<joey> - The clown is taking over. </joey>
<garnt> - This video is sponsored by Express VPN. </garnt>
<garnt> - I know most of you
are probably thinking, </garnt>
<connor> why don't I just use incognito mode? </connor>
<connor> Wrong gun, you can't watch Hentai in </connor>
<connor> incognito mode, or clear
your browser history </connor>
<connor> as many times as you
want. It doesn't work. </connor>
<garnt> - Well, you mean people actually know </garnt>
<joey> what Hentai I am watching? </joey>
<joey> (Conner laughing). </joey>
<connor> - They can see? </connor>
<connor> - The FBI possibly knows
if they have an entrance. </connor>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<connor> Your Internet Service Provider can see </connor>
<connor> every single website that you visit. </connor>
<connor> That's why I never go online

<connor> It's this is just a single button press in </connor>
<joey> my little monkey brain, works great. </joey>
<garnt> - Do you notice it when it's on? </garnt>
<joey> - No, never. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughing) </joey>
<connor> I use it all the time
and I do often forget </connor>
<connor> that I've put it on as it
doesn't really affect much. </connor>
<joey> - I use it a lot actually to
get around geo restrictions </joey>
<connor> for Netflix and stuff like that. </connor>
<connor> Sometimes there are some
movies you just can't watch </connor>
<joey> on Japanese Netflix, so I
just pop, press a button, </joey>
<joey> it's on, and you get around that shit. </joey>

<garnt> - Now back to the episode. </garnt>
<connor> - You know what I love about
karaoke the most though. </connor>
<joey> (Joey burping) </joey>
<joey> - Sorry, the clown juice. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - Fucking ulcers? </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh it's hidden. It's hidden. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - So, on top of the all you can drink, </connor>
<joey> sometimes they have like
other stuff that you can have, </joey>
<garnt> like drink and eat, unlike soft drinks, </garnt>
<connor> but they might have like soup, sometimes- </connor>
<garnt> - What? </garnt>
<garnt> - An ice cream. </garnt>
<garnt> - I know the ice cream, I
don't know about the soup. </garnt>
<joey> - You know that fucking time when you guys </joey>
<connor> were kind of stopped eating
so much fucking ice cream? </connor>
<joey> - 'Cause they came back
with like two fucking </joey>
<joey> packets of ice cream. </joey>
<joey> - So they had like small,
tiny cups and bowls </joey>
<joey> for this ice cream, and I
was like, no, I'll take one </joey>
<connor> of the big cup glass and fucking pull </connor>
<connor> all the ice cream in there. </connor>
<connor> Must have refilled it
like three or four times. </connor>
<joey> - That's so much ice cream. </joey>
<joey> - But I was just sitting
there the whole time </joey>
<joey> at karaoke, sitting there, </joey>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<connor> just, oh I'm good, you go next. </connor>
<garnt> - I remember when I saw
the ice cream machine next </garnt>
<joey> to the soft drink machine, </joey>
<joey> - Who the fuck would get that? </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> - But I remember that I'm
thinking like I'm a... </joey>
<joey> We don't need that, we need alcohol. </joey>
<joey> And then two hours
later, fucking plastered. </joey>
<garnt> I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> (sipping dry air) </garnt>
<garnt> cock fluid, cock fluid,
that was amazing right now. </garnt>
<garnt> - That ice cream looks so good right now. </garnt>
<connor> - It is pretty garbage
vanilla ice cream bar. </connor>
<connor> But when you're that drunk, it's like- </connor>
<connor> - You can drink anything. </connor>
<connor> - But anything that's
bottled at that point. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<joey> You know what I'll say like in Japan, </joey>
<joey> it just goes along with the nightlife. </joey>
<joey> It's the UConn drinks. </joey>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt nodding) </joey>
<garnt> - John explained that
UConn drink because that.. </garnt>
<connor> - So I should have
bought one in preparation </connor>
<connor> if we can talk about this, </connor>
<joey> but there's these tiny little things, </joey>
<joey> like 200 milliliter cans. </joey>
<joey> - It's like that big. </joey>
<joey> - It's like a medicine bottle. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah yeah and it tastes like bubble gum </garnt>
<garnt> and it's apparently like
ginger, like it's ish ish. </garnt>
<joey> - That it taste bubble gum
I think it tastes like, </joey>
<connor> - I think it tastes- </connor>
<joey> - I think it tastes great. </joey>
<joey> - [Meilyne] Turmeric. </joey>
<connor> - Turmeric.
- Turmeric. </connor>
<joey> - Just like ginger.
- Thank you Meilyne. </joey>
<joey> - But yeah, it tastes like- </joey>
<connor> I liked the taste- </connor>
<garnt> - [Conner] Do you like the taste? </garnt>
<garnt> - I like the taste. </garnt>
<garnt> - Felix liked the taste. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, but Felix is fucking weird. </garnt>
<garnt> - It reminds me of Calpol,
that's why I like the taste. </garnt>
<garnt> - So essentially, what
this drink is advertised </garnt>
<garnt> as is prevents hangovers, </garnt>
<joey> and everyone of the Western world is like, </joey>
<joey> that doesn't seem right. </joey>
<joey> - Well, I first saw it- </joey>
<joey> - That was like a scam. </joey>
<connor> - When I first saw it, I was like, </connor>
<connor> I'm pretty sure if it
worked, we would have like... </connor>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - That was my thoughts
as well. Like how... </garnt>
<garnt> If it really works, why
has England not used it? </garnt>
<connor> - Don't you think the
entire budget of the NHS </connor>
<connor> would be spent on buying this </connor>
<connor> because then all of the medical
problems would be solved? </connor>
<connor> I'm pretty sure we would
have it right here, </connor>
<connor> but then I thought, one
day on a whim, I was like, </connor>
<joey> all right, fine, I'll try it. </joey>
<joey> And then it was like having
a shield on your liver, </joey>
<joey> not like none of the drinks got me drunk. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And it was like that
for the first few times </joey>
<joey> until I really drank way too much. </joey>
<joey> And then it was like, not
drunk, not drunk, not drunk, </joey>
<joey> absolutely unable to sleep, like not. </joey>
<connor> It's so weird. </connor>
<connor> - It was just like the 2020 economy. </connor>
<joey> It was just like the Coronavirus tank, </joey>
<garnt> and then you're fucking
drunk in like an instant. </garnt>
<connor> Because I never tried it
until tried it with you, </connor>
<connor> because every time I
saw it, I was like, no. </connor>
<joey> Maybe that will work for like one drink, </joey>
<joey> but I don't go to an
izakaya and have one drink. </joey>
<joey> So I'm like, no, this won't work for me. </joey>
<joey> But then yeah, I had it and
it tastes awesome, like great. </joey>
<connor> This is already good stock. </connor>
<joey> And then yeah, I think I was
like four or five drinks in, </joey>
<garnt> - And you don't feel like anything. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I'm just like, Oh my God, </garnt>
<joey> - It's weird. </joey>
<joey> - The immunity. </joey>
<joey> - So it's advertises it like
you don't have a hangover, </joey>
<joey> but really I think it's
like format alchemists. </joey>
<joey> It's like lava equivalent exchange, right? </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> - I know what I'm talking about. </joey>
<connor> - So you drink it and you
lose your fucking mother. </connor>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - You drink it and you get
less drunk when you drink it. </garnt>
<garnt> So you have to drink more to get drunk. </garnt>
<garnt> But the day after, if you did
completely destroy your body </garnt>
<connor> I feel like it doesn't help the hangover. </connor>
<garnt> - If you go too hard, it doesn't help. </garnt>
<joey> But you know there's
times where maybe you've </joey>
<joey> had quite a bit, you're quite tipsy, </joey>
<garnt> you're not absolutely shit-faced, </garnt>
<garnt> it completely stops any hangovers. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. Please stop saying hangover, </garnt>
<garnt> but for me it stops that
tipsy feeling as well. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. In my mind, when it
comes to whether it gets rid </joey>
<joey> of the hangover the next morning, </joey>
<joey> I feel like a lot of it is just placebo, </joey>
<joey> where it's just like if I drink this, </joey>
<joey> it'll probably stop it. </joey>
<garnt> - I definitely feel an effect. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. Because at the hangovers, </connor>
<connor> the worst hangovers I've had in Japan, </connor>
<connor> is when I haven't drank that. </connor>
<connor> So now I've pretty much
like you'll never see me </connor>
<joey> go drinking without drinking it now, </joey>
<joey> which I don't know if
it's a good thing or not? </joey>
<connor> Is my body gonna get
dependent on it to drink? </connor>
<connor> 'Cause like anything? </connor>
<connor> - I always drink it when
I know I have something </connor>
<garnt> to do the next day. </garnt>
<connor> - It's not bad for you by the way. </connor>
<garnt> It's literally just like turmeric </garnt>
<garnt> or ginger.
- If anything </garnt>
<joey> it's very healthy by the way. </joey>
<joey> - It's just a bunch of
fucking minerals and shit, </joey>
<joey> I fucking know it, like I... </joey>
<joey> Look at me, I'm a monkey brain, </joey>
<joey> like I know what's in it,
I don't question this shit. </joey>
<joey> - Just look it up and you'll find it, </joey>
<connor> but yeah, from what I understand it, </connor>
<joey> it's very healthy, it's
like a health drink. </joey>
<connor> - Someone's gonna call it
and be like, actually it's- </connor>
<connor> - Actually, it destroys your liver. </connor>
<connor> It's like as if the
alcohol doesn't already </connor>
<joey> destroy the liver. </joey>
<joey> - Actually, hidden health benefits, </joey>
<joey> hidden health benefits of course. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> - What do you... </joey>
<joey> How do you boys feel about clubbing? </joey>
<garnt> Because I've not been to
a club in Japan before. </garnt>
<garnt> - Have you been to a Koch club? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. I've been to a few, but
I've never enjoyed clubbing. </joey>
<joey> Even back in Australia, it
was just never really a thing. </joey>
<garnt> I like bars, but I don't like clubs. </garnt>
<garnt> - I really like bars,
but I don't like clubs. </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like, okay, here's my theory. </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like clubbing is
this place that everyone's </garnt>
<joey> convinced themselves they enjoy </joey>
<joey> when they really don't enjoy. </joey>
<joey> Like it's... </joey>
<joey> clubbing is one massive lie. </joey>
<joey> I don't know anyone who
actually enjoys clubbing, </joey>
<garnt> 'cause the only time you enjoy clubbing </garnt>
<garnt> is if you're massively plastic. </garnt>
<joey> - If you actually enjoy clubbing, </joey>
<joey> you're someone I don't wanna talk to. </joey>
<connor> - The people I know who enjoy clubbing </connor>
<connor> are normally the ones who I just don't </connor>
<connor> like hanging out with. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> I know I'm not gonna like... </connor>
<joey> - They are like the epitome of oh my God. </joey>
<joey> They always talk like that. </joey>
<joey> - It's like clubbing is like... </joey>
<garnt> clubbing is great when
you're young, I guess, </garnt>
<garnt> but then you reach a certain
point until a few years past, </garnt>
<garnt> then you realize, man, I
never really enjoy clubbing, </garnt>
<connor> I was just lying to myself. </connor>
<connor> All I do when I go to a club,
is go in, see the dance floor, </connor>
<connor> order a drink, go dancing
for like five minutes, </connor>
<connor> realize I'm still too sober,
go order another drink, </connor>
<connor> and then that cycle repeats. </connor>
<joey> - When to repeat, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Until you're fucking drunk enough </connor>
<connor> to not remember the night. </connor>
<connor> And if you do remember the
night it's a shit night. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, why? </connor>
<joey> - And it hurts 'cause
you gotta pay entry fee, </joey>
<joey> and then you gotta pay
double the price for a drink. </joey>
<joey> So if you're not drunk
enough, it's like fuck, </joey>
<joey> not only am I having a shit time, </joey>
<connor> my wallet is taking a financial beating. </connor>
<joey> - Clubs are fuss, man, they're a lie. </joey>
<garnt> - I'll tell you the only
times clubbing is fun, </garnt>
<garnt> But can I tell the story
about the last time </garnt>
<connor> we went clubbing? </connor>
<connor> - Sure, sure. Go ahead, go ahead. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, I gotta hear this. </connor>
<connor> - I feel like the only time
clubbing is actually fun </connor>
<connor> is when the night is unplanned. </connor>
<connor> When you don't plan to go to a club, </connor>
<connor> I feel like the spontaneous
clubbing nights are the best </connor>
<connor> 'cause you're already really
drunk and in the mood, </connor>
<connor> when you just suddenly
decide to go to a club. </connor>
<garnt> So last time I actually went
clubbing was over a year ago, </garnt>
<garnt> with a... </garnt>
<garnt> And it was with Conner and
two of my mates, right? </garnt>
<garnt> And it was just a spontaneous
kind of clubbing nights </garnt>
<garnt> where we didn't even plan to go clubbing, </garnt>
<garnt> we just wanted to go hit up some bars, </garnt>
<garnt> and then we got massively twice. </garnt>
<connor> - Did we? I think we were
just sitting at your house </connor>
<connor> and we were just gonna do that, </connor>
<connor> and then I think something boiled up </connor>
<connor> and you were like, clubbing? </connor>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - I think we were like... </garnt>
<garnt> We were sitting in the
house and we were just going </garnt>
<garnt> to have it like a chilled night. </garnt>
<connor> - And you were telling
stories about clubbing. </connor>
<connor> We were telling stories
about clubbing and I think </connor>
<connor> eventually we were like,
should we just go clubbing? </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. 'Cause I remember
we hit up a bar before hand, </garnt>
<joey> and we were pretty married at that point. </joey>
<joey> We weren't super drunk, </joey>
<connor> and then we got to the bar, I think it was </connor>
<connor> Absolute VOD Green Brighton or something, </connor>
<connor> and we just ordered three
of those 14 shot trays, </connor>
<garnt> - Oh my God! </garnt>
<garnt> - And we got drunk very, very fast, </garnt>
<garnt> but the person who got drunk
the most, was this guy. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt pointing at Conner) </garnt>
<connor> - I think I had like one of
the whole 14 shots to myself. </connor>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<connor> And like, bear in mind
I think I was just... </connor>
<connor> Excuse us sweetheart. </connor>
<connor> At the time, I'd just broke up with my ex </connor>
<joey> and I was like, I just wanna go out. </joey>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> I just wanna do something,
I wanna get out of here. </joey>
<joey> I was like I just want to party
and then when I went away. </joey>
<garnt> - So what was the last
memory you had of that night? </garnt>
<connor> - I remember waiting in line for the club. </connor>
<garnt> Alcohol abusive badge by the way. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, we don't condone this. </garnt>
<garnt> This is a story, not condoning... </garnt>
<connor> - We're laughing about it
but we don't condone it. </connor>
<garnt> - I've rarely... </garnt>
<garnt> Rarely do I get that drunk where </garnt>
<garnt> I don't remember exactly what happened, </garnt>
<connor> which I always speak to
Americans like that sounds scary. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, yeah, I'm in
the company of my mates, </connor>
<connor> you know they'll take care of me. </connor>
<connor> - So, after the bar, </connor>
<garnt> we clearly realized how drunk
Conner was, but we still... </garnt>
<joey> It was still pretty early in the night, </joey>
<joey> it was like 10 o'clock, 10:30. </joey>
<joey> (Conner and Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> The club had just opened. </joey>
<joey> That's kind of the timing
we're talking about. </joey>
<joey> And we just kind of... </joey>
<joey> We were like, okay, before the
alcohol gets Conner anymore, </joey>
<joey> we gotta fuck again this
club, as soon as possible, </joey>
<joey> so we line up just as
the club was opening... </joey>
<connor> - Someone said fucking
Wednesday or something. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> No one was clubbing. No one, just us. </connor>
<garnt> - We all worried about how
Conner was gonna get in, </garnt>
<connor> 'cause he was clearly
over the fucking limit. </connor>
<joey> And if you know UK clubs, if
you look like you're too drunk, </joey>
<joey> they're just not gonna
let you in, bouncers... </joey>
<joey> Bouncers in UK are like the school bully, </joey>
<joey> they're like... </joey>
<joey> They will take advantage
of any power they have. </joey>
<joey> So we were fucking worried. </joey>
<garnt> So, somehow Conner... </garnt>
<garnt> We managed to get Conner in this club. </garnt>
<connor> - This is the best heist by the way. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. So we must get
Conner in and we're like, </garnt>
<garnt> Oh, that's this is it, we've done it. </garnt>
<joey> - The mission impossible thing- </joey>
<joey> - We've done mission impossible. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> So, then we go over to the bar, </joey>
<joey> as you do in the clubbing experience </joey>
<joey> the first thing you go to is the bar. </joey>
<joey> - Of course. </joey>
<garnt> - And then we go to order our drinks. </garnt>
<garnt> And so I'm here with two of my mates </garnt>
<garnt> and we each order a drink,
and then we look around </garnt>
<garnt> and Conner is just not there. </garnt>
<garnt> We are like, wait, if
you're not with Conner, </garnt>
<garnt> and you're not with Conner
and I'm not with Conner, </garnt>
<garnt> then where the fuck's Conner? </garnt>
<garnt> And then we turn around, and
look at this empty dance floor, </garnt>
<garnt> and Conner is just standing
there, at a 90 degree angle. </garnt>
<garnt> He's like this. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt bending at 90 degree angle) </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey and Conner laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey clapping) </garnt>
<garnt> All right, and we are like,
oh shit we better get him </garnt>
<garnt> off the dance floor. </garnt>
<connor> And then like as a walking over, </connor>
<connor> he starts fucking Fortnite
dancing by himself </connor>
<connor> on the dance floor. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<joey> - You know you gotta do, you gotta do it. </joey>
<joey> - And so the bouncer
sees this and obviously, </joey>
<joey> Conner's way over the limit. </joey>
<joey> So, he gets kicked out and
so, we also have to follow him </joey>
<joey> out of the club. </joey>
<joey> So we're like, do we attempt another club? </joey>
<joey> It's only like 10:30. </joey>
<connor> Let's try and attempt another club, </connor>
<connor> thinking we're not gonna get in. </connor>
<connor> Somehow, Conner by pure instincts, </connor>
<garnt> he's like, he can't even
walk to this next club. </garnt>
<connor> But as soon as he's standing in line, </connor>
<connor> he's like, yes gentlemen. </connor>
<garnt> - I did a why when I'm drunk. </garnt>
<garnt> For some reason I can
just like for 30 seconds, </garnt>
<joey> I can be like, </joey>
<joey> (Conner inhaling and
flexing his back muscles) </joey>
<joey> yes of course I am. </joey>
<joey> (Joey and Darnt laughing) </joey>
<connor> Like I dunno why, its super power. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. When you're... </connor>
<connor> When he's in front of the bouncer, </connor>
<joey> he just turns it to proper Seadog VA. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> - The monkey brain
unlocks into human brain. </joey>
<joey> - Somehow we... </joey>
<connor> We somehow get him into the second club. </connor>
<connor> And the same fucking thing happens again. </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Conner laughing) </connor>
<connor> We go into the bar, and
then we take our eyes </connor>
<connor> off Corner for one second, order a drink, </connor>
<connor> I look around, look to my
left, look to my right, </connor>
<garnt> if you're not with Conner,
and if you're not with Conner, </garnt>
<garnt> and then we turn around, and once again, </garnt>
<garnt> Conner on an empty dance floor </garnt>
<garnt> is just Fortnite dancing by himself. </garnt>
<joey> - Is that just like an
instinct for you to dance? </joey>
<connor> - I think so, I think it
must be I like dancing. </connor>
<connor> I don't know why Fortnite
dancing must be my go-to. </connor>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<garnt> (joey and Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - And so we get kicked out of that club </garnt>
<garnt> and that was the end of the night. </garnt>
<connor> - It's Good night. </connor>
<garnt> It's Good night. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's Good night.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> He woke up snug.
- Don't get drunk. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. We got him back home. </connor>
<garnt> I took him on the bed and he
just slides snuggling side </garnt>
<garnt> the saggy pillow and yeah,
that's what he woke up with. </garnt>
<connor> All the instincts giving you a lockdown. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. I woke up and I was like, </joey>
<joey> where is my phone and wallet? </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> Where is it? And it
was just under the bed. </joey>
<connor> But I was like... </connor>
<connor> That was the first five
minute panic of mine. </connor>
<joey> I was like, where is this? </joey>
<joey> - Oh my God. </joey>
<joey> So you don't remember any of that? </joey>
<joey> - I remember some of it, but not much. </joey>
<joey> I mean, that was pretty
the most drunk I've gotten </joey>
<connor> in a very long time. </connor>
<connor> I'd rarely ever get that drunk, </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But you know, sometimes
you fuck up and do a lot </connor>
<connor> of vodka and yeah. </connor>
<joey> - It happens, man. </joey>
<connor> 'Cause it's like, you've been
clubbing in Japan, right? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah I have. </joey>
<connor> - What's that like? </connor>
<garnt> How is it compared to
the rest of the world? </garnt>
<connor> - It's just like... </connor>
<connor> At least compared to the UK, and the UK </connor>
<connor> I felt like everyone in
the club is very drunk. </connor>
<joey> And in Japan I felt like everyone </joey>
<joey> was in the same situation
of, I need to be drunk, </joey>
<joey> which makes a pretty
shitty club environment </joey>
<connor> 'cause everyone's kind
of sober and it's weird. </connor>
<connor> Like it's... </connor>
<joey> - No one wants to like step out of line. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, it's weird. </connor>
<connor> Like no one's doing anything fun except </connor>
<connor> for somehow, everyone
is really well-behaved. </connor>
<connor> And somehow the moment
you step into the toilet, </connor>
<connor> it was like a war zone in that toilet. </connor>
<joey> I don't know what happened. </joey>
<joey> There was a dude who was like pissing, </joey>
<joey> and he was not even aiming in the urinal. </joey>
<joey> He was aiming at the wall next to it. </joey>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> and he was spraying, and
I walked in and I'm like </joey>
<joey> I'm not getting blamed for this. </joey>
<joey> I'm walking out, 'cause I
know this guy was Japanese. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, I'm not fucking with it. </joey>
<joey> I don't want to be blamed for this. </joey>
<joey> I'm not doing it. </joey>
<joey> - I'm the minority in this club. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<connor> - I'm like, I'm the foreigner here. </connor>
<connor> I looked at him, I'm
walking out right now. </connor>
<connor> But yeah, there, it was so filthy, </connor>
<connor> but the rest of the club was just fine. </connor>
<connor> It was whatever, it was
just a depressing situation. </connor>
<connor> I'd rather have been smashed
Fortnite dancing alone, </connor>
<connor> any day of the week. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. That's kind of a
similar experience I had. </joey>
<joey> I went to one club in Japan. </joey>
<joey> And that was enough for
me to be like, yeah, </joey>
<connor> I mean, I never really enjoyed clubs </connor>
<connor> when I was like, you know what? </connor>
<joey> I'm living here, I might
as well give it a go. </joey>
<connor> I just wasn't it. </connor>
<connor> - I felt like everyone was doing it </connor>
<joey> 'cause they've seen it
in the movies there. </joey>
<joey> I don't know what. I was
like, this is cool, right? </joey>
<connor> We cool right now. </connor>
<joey> Like, wait, we've seen
this in the movies, right? </joey>
<garnt> - This is exactly how
we're supposed to behave. </garnt>
<joey> - 'Cause I think the most different </joey>
<joey> clubbing experience I've
had is probably in Thailand. </joey>
<joey> Well, they have like, I don't like... </joey>
<joey> I like their clubbing culture even less. </joey>
<joey> Because they don't even
have a dance floor. </joey>
<joey> So, some clubs in Thailand, </joey>
<joey> it's you go in and there's no dance floor </joey>
<joey> but everyone has their own tables. </joey>
<joey> But the music is just as
loud as any other club. </joey>
<joey> (Conner laughing) </joey>
<joey> So try and so... </joey>
<joey> So you're sitting around- </joey>
<connor> - Such a loud restaurant. </connor>
<connor> - This is the wild bar. </connor>
<connor> - So you're sitting at... </connor>
<connor> Everyone has his private tables. </connor>
<connor> So you can't even like... </connor>
<connor> It's not a social
environment where you can go </connor>
<connor> meet other people or even
interact with other people, </connor>
<garnt> you're with your mates, but
it's so loud that you can't </garnt>
<garnt> communicate with your mates, </garnt>
<garnt> So all you're doing is sitting
in this loud fucking room. </garnt>
<garnt> I must sound like such an old guy now. </garnt>
<garnt> The music was too loud, this was awful. </garnt>
<garnt> But no, </garnt>
<connor> - No, too far. When the music is too loud, </connor>
<connor> it's like my biggest pet peeve. </connor>
<connor> - I've been in some clubs in Australia </connor>
<joey> where the bass is so fucking bass boosted </joey>
<connor> that you can actually
feel your chest going </connor>
<connor> (Joey clutching his chest) </connor>
<connor> dude like this while you're sitting there. </connor>
<joey> I was like, hey, how are you? </joey>
<connor> - That voice is so bassy
as well than in clubs, </connor>
<joey> I could just cannot communicate like- </joey>
<joey> - It's just extravagant. </joey>
<joey> - I remember university, if I
ever tried to hit on someone, </joey>
<connor> they'd just be like, what
are you saying, you know, </connor>
<joey> are you talking to me? </joey>
<joey> - Do you have that thing
where you're trying </joey>
<joey> to say something to your
mate, but it's so loud, </joey>
<joey> or your mates trying
to say something to you </joey>
<connor> and it just sounds like
a blah, blah, blah. </connor>
<connor> And you're like sorry,
can you say that again? </connor>
<connor> You do it three times as the magic number, </connor>
<connor> and then the third time you are like, </connor>
<connor> Oh yeah, yeah, definitely. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I'll be like yeah, I
don't know, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<garnt> I have nothing to say. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's just yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> That's just the clubbing
experience, I guess. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, we personally don't
recommend clubs in Japan, </joey>
<connor> but I mean... </connor>
<connor> - I mean, if that's your
stick that's your stick. </connor>
<joey> - But we don't... </joey>
<joey> I think we've made it clear
that we don't really like </joey>
<garnt> clubbing anyway, so why
don't we gonna enjoy clubbing </garnt>
<connor> in Japan? </connor>
<connor> - The reason I like izakayas </connor>
<connor> is that 'cause it's the
perfect social environment, </connor>
<connor> because I like talking to people. </connor>
<connor> I like house parties, I
like house parties a lot. </connor>
<connor> And I've always... </connor>
<connor> In university, if there was a
choice between a clubbing... </connor>
<connor> Going clubbing and going to a house party, </connor>
<connor> I'm like a hundred percent of the time </connor>
<connor> I'm choosing the house party, </connor>
<connor> 'cause I like talking to people and I feel </connor>
<connor> like the izakaya vibe is
just that perfect vibe </connor>
<connor> that just like you, it allows
you to talk to your mates. </connor>
<connor> - There's also that
element of a house party. </connor>
<connor> It's like, are they gonna
fuck up their own house? </connor>
<connor> If so, I wanna be there to watch this. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - What's like the craziest house parties </garnt>
<connor> you guys have been to? </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I've got like two and they
were both in university. </connor>
<joey> Of course they were. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah of course they were. </connor>
<connor> - Do you have one? </connor>
<joey> - I can only really think of like- </joey>
<connor> - I have one if you want me to go first. </connor>
<joey> - There's a lot of like poop stories </joey>
<connor> but I'm like, </connor>
<garnt> - More poop? Noooo! </garnt>
<garnt> - This is where the poop
stories are coming in. </garnt>
<joey> - All of my poop stories
come from house parties. </joey>
<connor> - What? Whose plan? </connor>
<joey> - Like, okay... </joey>
<joey> So in Australia, Oh my God. </joey>
<connor> Another thing I think about
it, it's as fucking disgusting. </connor>
<connor> But.. </connor>
<joey> - Oh no.
- Oh no. </joey>
<joey> - But do you know what a shoey is? </joey>
<connor> - That's where you do
the beer out of the shoe. </connor>
<joey> - Yes. So it's this
thing that's very typical </joey>
<garnt> in Australia because there's
nothing as fucking good. </garnt>
<garnt> - Why is this typical in Australia? </garnt>
<joey> - Typical house party shit we do </joey>
<joey> in Australia.
- The local cuisine. </joey>
<joey> - The local cuisine of the shoey, </joey>
<joey> but essentially what it is, is you... </joey>
<connor> It's kind of like shotgunning
in America, right? </connor>
<connor> Where, shotgunning is like, you know, </connor>
<connor> if someone's holding a can of beer </connor>
<connor> they're like, Oh, shotgun it. </connor>
<joey> So you poke a hole on the side
and then you kind of drink </joey>
<connor> the whole thing like this. </connor>
<joey> Shoey is that, but way grosser. </joey>
<joey> You say, hey, do a shoey,
and then you go around, </joey>
<joey> the tradition is you go around </joey>
<joey> and find whoever has the
dirtiest fucking shoe. </joey>
<joey> - Ooooh. </joey>
<joey> It's not just any shoe, it's
whoever has the dirty shoe. </joey>
<garnt> It's either you do your own shoe </garnt>
<garnt> or you pick whoever's
has the dirtiest shoe. </garnt>
<garnt> - This is already starting horribly. </garnt>
<garnt> - And then you grab this
shoe, you pull the can of beer </garnt>
<connor> into their shoe and then you
drink the beer from their shoe. </connor>
<connor> - That's disgusting, that's.. </connor>
<connor> - And I mean, it's not
that exciting of a story </connor>
<connor> but my friend did a shoey once </connor>
<joey> and he got his friends a
shoe and he didn't realize </joey>
<joey> until after he finished the shoey </joey>
<joey> that he had stepped on his dog shit. </joey>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - So he had like a firm grasp? </connor>
<connor> - He had a firm grasp of
it and he finished it, </connor>
<joey> and he's like, he flipped it
over and just saw like shit, </joey>
<joey> (Conner and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<garnt> just smeared on that shoe. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's so disgusting. </garnt>
<garnt> - And like normal people will
be like, Oh, what the fuck? </garnt>
<joey> But because he was already so hammered, </joey>
<joey> he's just like yeah. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> And everyone was like yeeee! </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> This is fucking nasty. </joey>
<connor> That's the only thing really. </connor>
<connor> And then other than that, </connor>
<connor> it's just like a lot of vomit stories, </connor>
<connor> you know the usual that
you hear at house parties. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. I mean, yeah. </connor>
<joey> That was probably the grossest. </joey>
<joey> - God that's </joey>
<joey> disgusting.
- But also the most hilarious. </joey>
<connor> - Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> - All right. Where are you
going with some of them? </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, I've been to like
a few crazy house parties. </garnt>
<joey> I think most of the crazy
house parties I've been to </joey>
<joey> has been in Brighton. </joey>
<joey> So that's where like my hometown. </joey>
<joey> There are some parties
that are just like... </joey>
<joey> Kind of like, you know that
scene from American pie, </joey>
<joey> where you see that senior,
like there's no way there </joey>
<connor> that exists in real life. </connor>
<connor> There's no way this
crazy shit's happening. </connor>
<connor> But yeah, I've been to a few parties </connor>
<connor> where he was actually that crazy. </connor>
<connor> So I remember one time, </connor>
<connor> where there was this party
who we'd heard from a friend, </connor>
<joey> who heard from another friend, </joey>
<joey> who heard from another friend, </joey>
<joey> now that kind of thing </joey>
<joey> - Sounds like being in a horror story. </joey>
<joey> - There was a party happening </joey>
<joey> in the middle of this field. </joey>
<joey> I'm just like, there's no
fucking way this is true. </joey>
<joey> So we had to drive into the
middle of fucking nowhere. </joey>
<joey> And I was like, this is a scam, </joey>
<joey> we're gonna drive there, and
there's just gonna be like... </joey>
<joey> It's just gonna be like
a drug dealer den or so. </joey>
<joey> Or this is gonna be like... </joey>
<joey> We're gonna get fucking murdered. </joey>
<joey> And so we drive to the
middle of this field, </joey>
<joey> and keep in mind, this is all pitch black, </joey>
<joey> 'cause it's like the
middle of the countryside, </joey>
<joey> where we're driving
to, so we can see shit, </joey>
<joey> and then we go there and it
was basically like a festival, </joey>
<joey> somehow they had managed to... </joey>
<joey> Because this guy who had owned the farm, </joey>
<joey> had just told a few of his mates </joey>
<joey> that he was gonna have a party, </joey>
<joey> and then mates started
telling mates and then... </joey>
<joey> - It's always the worst. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. I don't know how
it's spreads so wide. </joey>
<joey> - Jesus! </joey>
<joey> - But I feel like it's because </joey>
<joey> no one else is having a party that weekend </joey>
<joey> and people were just
egging, and people were just </joey>
<joey> very much ready to go to somewhere. </joey>
<joey> - I just want to go to a party guys. </joey>
<joey> - I need to do a party. </joey>
<joey> - And yeah. Somehow there
was a fucking festival. </joey>
<joey> And then things started getting weird. </joey>
<joey> They started setting things on fire. </joey>
<joey> So, they went into his house, </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<garnt> and then they took out the sofa </garnt>
<garnt> and somebody thought it
would be a fun idea to </garnt>
<garnt> just start burning stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<connor> So it started off- </connor>
<connor> - Why is always there one
person that just burns things? </connor>
<garnt> - I don't know, there's always one pyro... </garnt>
<garnt> One fucking pyromaniac. </garnt>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<garnt> And so, first it starts with the chair. </garnt>
<garnt> So they get a chair out, </garnt>
<garnt> and like, okay, let's set this on fire. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's like fucking
cave man mood activates. </garnt>
<garnt> Like whenever you start
a fire, for some reason, </garnt>
<garnt> you see fire, and then you're like, </garnt>
<garnt> - Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo. </garnt>
<joey> - And then you start fucking
dancing around it like, </joey>
<joey> woo, woo fire.
(Garnt dancing) </joey>
<joey> I dunno why whenever there's a fire </joey>
<joey> and there's a house party and
there was alcohol involved, </joey>
<joey> you just forget... </joey>
<joey> The lizard brain just takes over, </joey>
<joey> and you just like circling, just watch it. </joey>
<joey> And then... </joey>
<joey> So they burned the chair
down, and they were like, </joey>
<joey> what could we do next? </joey>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> What could we do next? </joey>
<garnt> let's get a table. So, I don't know... </garnt>
<connor> - Where do you just take this </connor>
<connor> guy's whole fucking Ikea collection? </connor>
<garnt> My Jesus Christ. </garnt>
<garnt> - Then they take a table,
they set down fire, </garnt>
<connor> then as that's on fire, </connor>
<garnt> a fucking sofa appears out of nowhere, </garnt>
<garnt> and then they fucking
just shot the sofa in. </garnt>
<joey> And then, we were just like... </joey>
<joey> At the back of my mind, I'm thinking, man, </joey>
<joey> the host must feel so fucking shit, </joey>
<joey> I dunno where he's probably
plastered out of his mind. </joey>
<joey> - Oh my furniture has been burnt. </joey>
<joey> - And then as the sofa is on fire, </joey>
<joey> we actually see the host just walk out, </joey>
<garnt> and he just looks at his sofa, </garnt>
<garnt> and his fucking Ikea furniture
connection that's on fire. </garnt>
<garnt> And just goes, yeeeeeh! </garnt>
<connor> - What if right, what if all along, </connor>
<connor> he planned this out, right? </connor>
<connor> Because in the UK, if you wanna
get rid of stuff like that, </connor>
<connor> you've got to pay a lot. </connor>
<connor> So maybe this was all applaud, </connor>
<connor> just so he could get new sofas and shares </connor>
<connor> not pay to remove his old ones. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. There's always also
that one guy in any kind </joey>
<joey> of situation like that,
where something's put on fire </joey>
<joey> where they're holding
an alcoholic beverage </joey>
<joey> and they're like, I wonder
what happens if I pour it all? </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> It's like this the point I put it out. </joey>
<joey> It just makes the flame bigger. </joey>
<joey> It's like, Oh, I wasn't expecting that. </joey>
<connor> Okay. Every time, every fucking time. </connor>
<connor> - Animals, animals. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, fucking cavemen. </joey>
<joey> - There is... </joey>
<joey> So you know how I said I
lived in a student village? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It was basically a whole
area that was just houses. </joey>
<joey> And there had also two
really big apartment blocks </joey>
<joey> and they were disgusting. </joey>
<joey> They are the cheapest apartment
blocks you can imagine. </joey>
<joey> And one time people... </joey>
<joey> This doesn't exist anymore, this place, </joey>
<joey> they tore it all down. </joey>
<joey> So, yes. Once the student village RIP, </joey>
<joey> they said, Oh yeah,
there's gonna be a party </joey>
<joey> at one of the apartment buildings. </joey>
<joey> They didn't say which floor or anything, </joey>
<joey> so I thought that was kind of weird. </joey>
<joey> And then we turn up, and half
of this apartment building, </joey>
<joey> there's bin bags on all
the windows and stuff. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] -Right.
- [Joey] - Right. </joey>
<joey> And then you started
going into this building, </joey>
<joey> and it's been turned into
like the set of the raid. </joey>
<joey> There's just shit everywhere. </joey>
<joey> There's mattresses on the floor and shit. </joey>
<joey> All over the place, and
some of the rooms are open </joey>
<joey> and have nothing left in them. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, what the fuck? </joey>
<joey> And meanwhile, everyone is drunk as fuck, </joey>
<joey> there's people doing
drugs in certain places, </joey>
<joey> people in the kitchen,
there's always that one guy </joey>
<joey> who is in the kitchen making food </joey>
<joey> for somebody in all these parties. </joey>
<joey> Like this building is
literally like falling apart, </joey>
<joey> and one guy is standing there. </joey>
<joey> Anyone wants beans? Any
beans that you want? </joey>
<connor> It was just weird, and it was
like the further up you went, </connor>
<connor> there like more of a mess, it was... </connor>
<connor> And I remember going to one floor </connor>
<joey> and there was just beds all over it, </joey>
<joey> and people lying down and I'm like </joey>
<joey> what the fuck is going on here? </joey>
<joey> That was just weird. </joey>
<joey> And then I just didn't enjoy it. </joey>
<joey> Some are like just what is this? </joey>
<joey> - Wait, wait, so it was
an orgy floor or what? </joey>
<connor> - I didn't stay long enough. </connor>
<connor> - How did you get invited into this party? </connor>
<garnt> - It was one of those
things where everyone </garnt>
<connor> just everyone knew it was
happening in the village. </connor>
<connor> So we all just turned up it's the village. </connor>
<joey> - Word around the village,
is that this building. </joey>
<connor> - And I was like why did you put </connor>
<connor> (speaking in foreign language) </connor>
<connor> Why did they put bin bags on the windows? </connor>
<connor> And they were like, Oh, </connor>
<connor> so they can't see what's going on inside. </connor>
<joey> But I'm like, who, who can't see? </joey>
<joey> Because they think putting black window... </joey>
<joey> Like blacking out all the
windows is suspicious in a way. </joey>
<joey> That's what I thought. </joey>
<joey> And also a bunch of people
migrating towards this one thing </joey>
<joey> they completely fucked it though. </joey>
<joey> I don't know what happened to it </joey>
<joey> or how this was even possible. </joey>
<joey> I'm sure the owner- </joey>
<joey> - I mean the fact that it's gone now- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. It's true, it's true. </joey>
<joey> And then there was another party, </joey>
<joey> which was really weird
and it was a house party, </joey>
<connor> like just a normal
house and had a bouncer? </connor>
<connor> Which I thought was really weird. </connor>
<connor> - At a house? </connor>
<connor> - At a house party. </connor>
<joey> - And I wondered- </joey>
<joey> - What's the fucking motive? </joey>
<joey> - Right, right. </joey>
<joey> So it was a three storey
house, not that big, </joey>
<joey> but I thought, wow, this is fucking weird. </joey>
<connor> There's a bouncer and he's a list. </connor>
<connor> I said my name is and he is
like, you're on the list. </connor>
<joey> I'm like, when do I get put on the list? </joey>
<connor> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> - What is this List? </connor>
<connor> - Who's arranging this list
'cause my friend invited me. </connor>
<joey> So he must have put me on the list. </joey>
<connor> Then I got inside, the
first floor just is like </connor>
<joey> a big living room, </joey>
<joey> just has one small couch in the corner, </joey>
<joey> and like a hundred people
just standing around this, </joey>
<joey> very average looking
laminated-like wood floor, </joey>
<joey> just the people standing around </joey>
<joey> and I'm like, what the fuck? </joey>
<connor> Why is there a bouncer? </connor>
<joey> And then you go up the floors
and it starts to get weird, </joey>
<joey> as of course it doesn't if you got floors </joey>
<joey> in these weird house parties </joey>
<joey> I remember asking... </joey>
<joey> I found out that... </joey>
<joey> But I asked my friend
and he was like, Oh yeah, </joey>
<garnt> I paid them out so like 300
pounds just for tonight. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm like, why? </garnt>
<garnt> - Why?
- Why? </garnt>
<garnt> - What would you expecting to happen? </garnt>
<garnt> - Are you that worried? </garnt>
<garnt> And then, okay, okay. To be fair... </garnt>
<garnt> And then I realized why he
was that worried because </garnt>
<garnt> the second floor was
just people having sex. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was actually pretty standard. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's pretty standard,
that's pretty standard. </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, whatever, </garnt>
<garnt> and I was like, okay,
maybe we were in shock. </garnt>
<connor> 'Cause the bottom floor
was just really loud. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, maybe I wanna go </connor>
<joey> to the floor where people
were just chatting. </joey>
<joey> Right. So I go to the third floor, </joey>
<joey> and that's where it gets
really fucking weird </joey>
<joey> 'cause one of the rooms is like, </joey>
<joey> I thought it was like
five beds, two bunk beds </joey>
<joey> and instead they just put all
the mattresses on the floor. </joey>
<joey> I don't know why people are doing this. </joey>
<joey> All the mattresses were on the floor, </joey>
<joey> and people were making out
and one of them had like... </joey>
<joey> Was doing like a needle, I
don't know what he was doing. </joey>
<joey> And I was like, Oh, this is weird. </joey>
<joey> This is really fucking weird. </joey>
<joey> I'm not going here, and so I was like... </joey>
<joey> I asked my friend, I'm like, </joey>
<joey> there's gotta be somewhere else we can go. </joey>
<joey> I do not wanna stay here. </joey>
<connor> There's someone doing what
I think is heroin upstairs. </connor>
<connor> Can we not do this? </connor>
<connor> University's a mess. </connor>
<joey> - Jesus Christ. </joey>
<joey> I'd never had any like that. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause I hung out with
good Christian boys. </joey>
<connor> - Obviously, so do I, but
sometimes you go to a party. </connor>
<joey> You hear about a party, you don't know </joey>
<joey> what it's gonna be like
till you get there. </joey>
<joey> Until you see someone doing
like hardcore drugs upstairs </joey>
<joey> and you're like, I'm
not supposed to be here, </joey>
<joey> I don't do this. </joey>
<connor> - I need to go to church. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. Most of the house parties, </joey>
<joey> the more stairs you go up </joey>
<connor> it's like the closer you get to hell. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> It's like the steps towards hell. </connor>
<connor> - It's literally the rate. </connor>
<joey> - It's like the opposite, right? </joey>
<joey> It's like the further up you go, </joey>
<joey> the closer you get to hell. </joey>
<connor> - It's awful 'cause I
mean, you have no way </connor>
<joey> of knowing in the UK what
the party is gonna be like </joey>
<garnt> till you get there. </garnt>
<garnt> So, if your friend's dead set on going, </garnt>
<connor> you're like alright fine. </connor>
<garnt> - Because I've been to
as many Dodd parties, </garnt>
<joey> where you go to and it's
like, this isn't a party, </joey>
<joey> this is a house gathering. </joey>
<joey> With like prettied up. </joey>
<connor> We prettied up. </connor>
<garnt> - Right, right. You never know... </garnt>
<garnt> I never know, a party could mean like </garnt>
<connor> a come dine with me,
four people making dinner </connor>
<connor> for each other experience
or it could be, you know, </connor>
<connor> a vagan orgy going on upstairs. </connor>
<connor> You don't know till you get there. </connor>
<joey> No one knows, my parents
were probably terrified </joey>
<joey> they're like what was
Conner doing in university? </joey>
<connor> I was not doing anything, mother. </connor>
<connor> I was just... </connor>
<connor> You happen to go to places </connor>
<connor> and they fucked up. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. It's funny because I did... </garnt>
<garnt> I had less crazy parties in university, </garnt>
<joey> but that might just be because
of the university I went to, </joey>
<joey> which was University of Bristol, </joey>
<joey> and because it's like a city campus, </joey>
<joey> it's like University Bristol
was in the middle of the city, </joey>
<joey> there was less going on
because it was all... </joey>
<connor> Like we're integrated
with the normal people, </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- [Conner] Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - The normal working people, </connor>
<connor> so, you can get away with less shit </connor>
<garnt> than if it was on like a campus. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. Mine was kind of the same </garnt>
<joey> 'cause Sydney uni was in
my the smack bang middle </joey>
<connor> of the city center in Sydney, so, I mean, </connor>
<connor> there was always weird
shit that were happening </connor>
<joey> like the smaller campuses,
but nothing like that. </joey>
<connor> - There was just so many rundown places. </connor>
<joey> So it was like, sometimes I think </joey>
<connor> like locals would like see a party </connor>
<connor> and then just like go in. </connor>
<connor> - Just go in. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. I think that happened a lot. </connor>
<connor> - And that makes sense. </connor>
<connor> - That's why I would
never throw a house party </connor>
<connor> that just let anyone in. </connor>
<connor> - No.
- No. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know how fucked up this is. </connor>
<connor> Bro, talk about the trust system, bro. </connor>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<connor> That's just like the other
end of the stupid truck. </connor>
<connor> - I remember if you were having a party, </connor>
<garnt> and you told your close mates,
especially in my school, </garnt>
<connor> 'cause this was before
I went to university, </connor>
<connor> but in like college, if there was a party, </connor>
<connor> everyone would... </connor>
<connor> Everyone in fucking Brighton
would know know about it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- [Conner] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Somehow. You know word would get out </connor>
<connor> and I would not throw a party, </connor>
<connor> especially on a day, like New Year's eve, </connor>
<connor> where everyone's searching for a party. </connor>
<garnt> - People just rock up. </garnt>
<connor> I mean, that's kind of
why Chicano don't go </connor>
<connor> to open invite house parties anymore. </connor>
<joey> 'Cause like after seeing that I'm like, </joey>
<joey> that's just too much, that's... </joey>
<connor> I'm not signing up for that,
I don't need that in my mind. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, it's like if I
wanted to go to a house party </joey>
<joey> and like four fits of people
there, are people I don't know, </joey>
<joey> I'd rather just go to
a club ,at that point. </joey>
<connor> It's basically... </connor>
<joey> It becomes the same thing right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. But clubs are pretty bad, </joey>
<joey> but at least as not people doing like, </joey>
<joey> fucking hardcore without condom, </joey>
<connor> on the dance floor, probably
in the toilet, that's them. </connor>
<garnt> I don't care. </garnt>
<connor> - Call on Conner, even Fortnite dance. </connor>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Fortnite dance without
people judging me, </joey>
<connor> - And me in the orgy
room Fortnite dancing. </connor>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> All the mattresses a
dance floor dance, right? </joey>
<joey> I'll have a dance. </joey>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> - My God. But have you
guys ever been to the... </connor>
<connor> I know it's a property like tourist trap, </connor>
<joey> whatever it's considered, </joey>
<joey> but the Golden Gai in Shinjuku, </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, I've been. </joey>
<joey> - And how did you like it? </joey>
<joey> - No. </joey>
<joey> - They are not really your thing? </joey>
<garnt> - Not really because... </garnt>
<garnt> - You wanna explain more Golden Gai is? </garnt>
<connor> - Yes the Golden Gai is like this. </connor>
<joey> Fuck, what it's like? 40 by
40 meters area, if you will. </joey>
<connor> And it's just like a series of
alleyways, extremely compact. </connor>
<joey> - Its not even a block, it's
within the block, isn't it? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, it's tiny and it's bars all seat </connor>
<joey> max three to four people, sometimes two </joey>
<joey> depending on where you go,
and it's really expensive. </joey>
<connor> You pay sometimes 10
bucks just to sit down </connor>
<connor> and then you only pay
10 bucks for a drink. </connor>
<connor> And yeah, it's a tourist trap. </connor>
<joey> 'Cause a lot of the time it's tourists, </joey>
<joey> and also it's a very sketchy area. </joey>
<joey> And if you are a foreigner,
there will be a guy </joey>
<joey> who is very much watching you, </joey>
<joey> and the moment they see you're foreign, </joey>
<connor> they'll come up to you, that's
really fucking frustrating. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause sometimes it's- </connor>
<joey> - I went in there once,
just 'cause I wanted </joey>
<joey> to take my friend who
had never been there. </joey>
<joey> So I was like, okay, I'll experience it. </joey>
<joey> And yeah, I was just like, man, </joey>
<joey> this is just like a really cramped, </joey>
<joey> super expensive drinking experience </joey>
<garnt> like you can get anywhere else in Tokyo </garnt>
<joey> - It's like if you see pictures of it, </joey>
<garnt> which probably won't be on screen now, </garnt>
<garnt> it's kind of like
cyberpunk house-cloud like- </garnt>
<joey> - I love going to Golden
Gai just to take photos. </joey>
<garnt> - It's like that cyber punk aesthetic, </garnt>
<joey> where you just got these all... </joey>
<garnt> A lot of these buildings
and a lot of these bars </garnt>
<garnt> just crammed together, </garnt>
<garnt> and you don't even know how
anyone could live in there, </garnt>
<garnt> let alone operate a business in here. </garnt>
<joey> - 'Cause I can't imagine any of these bars </joey>
<joey> getting maybe more than 10
people at cost, a night. </joey>
<connor> - It depends there's
one or two of the bars </connor>
<connor> that would do something big, </connor>
<connor> but most of them are, yeah, very small. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, there'll be a few big ones </joey>
<connor> outside of Golden Gai
right before you enter it, </connor>
<connor> near the entrance. </connor>
<connor> But once you actually go into Golden Gai, </connor>
<joey> it's like, how do any of
these places stay open? </joey>
<connor> - I think it's you... </connor>
<connor> I think you go to Golden
Gai to meet other people. </connor>
<joey> You don't go there with your... </joey>
<connor> You can go there with your mates. </connor>
<joey> - But you can also meet
other people anywhere else. </joey>
<connor> - But this is kind of
vibe to it that's like, </connor>
<joey> because it's so small, you
immediately have to talk </joey>
<joey> to anyone who's next to you. </joey>
<joey> You don't really have a choice. </joey>
<joey> Like in the rest of Tokyo,
you kind of got your way </joey>
<joey> and be like, hi, you
wanna know about my cult? </joey>
<joey> Like you got to like really- </joey>
<joey> - That's right, that's right. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. You gotta seem
like a little weird, right? </connor>
<connor> 'Cause you have... </connor>
<connor> But in this bar, you know, you sit down, </connor>
<joey> you're immediately next to someone </joey>
<joey> and you just start trying to communicate. </joey>
<joey> And yeah, the one time
I went it was 'cause... </joey>
<joey> We used to staying right
next to it funny enough. </joey>
<joey> And I think it was one night where </joey>
<joey> it's my second to last night in Japan, </joey>
<joey> my first time visiting, I think Joey, </joey>
<joey> Joey like gone and Allen
didn't wanna hang out, </joey>
<joey> and now I was like, well,
I wanna do something </joey>
<joey> so, I Googled on my, where can I go? </joey>
<joey> And then, this was the
only place that came up </joey>
<joey> and I was like, all right, fine. </joey>
<joey> I'd never heard of it before. </joey>
<joey> I didn't know it was a tourist tracker. </joey>
<joey> So I just went there and
yeah, it was really fun. </joey>
<joey> I mean, met a ton of people and
then eventually made friends </joey>
<joey> with these Japanese people, who took me </joey>
<joey> to some of the Japanese only bars. </joey>
<joey> And that was really fun 'cause
then they were all talking </joey>
<joey> to me and asking what
my favorite anime was, </joey>
<joey> knowing the Japanese titles
came in very handy that day. </joey>
<connor> - Oh yeah, of course.
- Of course. </connor>
<connor> - Yes it's just a lot of fun, I mean it. </connor>
<connor> when it works and you go
out and you meet people </connor>
<connor> and they're actually cool and it's fun. </connor>
<connor> It's like the best thing ever. </connor>
<joey> - I feel like you got quite
a lucky experience though, </joey>
<connor> especially in Golden Gai, because- </connor>
<connor> - I think so. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah I've heard a lot of
horror stories about Golden Gai. </joey>
<connor> - You could easily go there </connor>
<garnt> and just have not meet anyone cool, </garnt>
<joey> and yet be bored, spend a lot of money. </joey>
<joey> - Because I've been to
quite a few smaller bars </joey>
<joey> and establishments that are outside, </joey>
<joey> like just outside the Golden Gai, </joey>
<joey> this is really fucking cool. </joey>
<joey> Gaming bar that Chris Brown took me to </joey>
<connor> literally across the road from Golden Gai. </connor>
<connor> - Wanapo. </connor>
<connor> - I think its called One Up, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - One Up I have been there. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. And it's tiny,
there is just one bar, </connor>
<connor> it can only maybe seat six people, </connor>
<joey> but it's a proper gaming
bar, we're not talking about </joey>
<joey> the one thing you guys
look into in the UK. </joey>
<joey> It's a legit-like gaming bar </joey>
<joey> and that one was really fucking cool </joey>
<joey> and way cheaper than Golden Gai. </joey>
<garnt> But the problem is that those kinds </garnt>
<garnt> of places don't come
up in Google searches. </garnt>
<garnt> It's almost always like,
when do you drink Shinjiku? </garnt>
<garnt> Golden Gai always comes up. </garnt>
<garnt> - I noticed there's a lot of bars in Japan </garnt>
<joey> that are fucking tiny, and you go in there </joey>
<joey> and it's like I really liked the vibe, </joey>
<joey> 'cause it's a really intimate vibe. </joey>
<garnt> 'Cause it can only fit
like five to six people. </garnt>
<garnt> And there's only one bar
and you sit at the counter </garnt>
<garnt> but I do like that vibe and I don't know </garnt>
<joey> how they stay in business? </joey>
<garnt> 'Cause there are so many in Japan. </garnt>
<garnt> - And they are so hidden away. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. There's so hidden- </garnt>
<joey> - Like the cigar bar,
we went to in Ikebukuro, </joey>
<joey> I was like, how the fuck
would anyone be like, yes, </joey>
<joey> let me go into this tiny building, </joey>
<joey> go all the way up to the sixth floor. </joey>
<joey> And there it is right there. </joey>
<joey> It's like, how would you
know that that's right? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - It's like it could be just
someone's apartment for rental. </joey>
<connor> It probably is.
- It probably is </connor>
<connor> - That they just remodeled. </connor>
<connor> That's kind of the size
we're talking about, </connor>
<garnt> like an apartment in Tokyo just- </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. Like a one room
apartment in Tokyo. </joey>
<garnt> - Or you took me to that
bar that was like... </garnt>
<garnt> It was like an apartment,
someone's apartment, </garnt>
<joey> in an apartment building
that have been converted </joey>
<joey> into a ping pong bar. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah.
- What? </joey>
<garnt> - And I was like, what the fuck is this? </garnt>
<garnt> They served food and everything. </garnt>
<connor> It was fucking weird. </connor>
<connor> - So that... </connor>
<connor> Sydney actually discovered that </connor>
<connor> because she read a manga
that I was based on, </connor>
<connor> a manga that had that
bar and she Googled it </connor>
<connor> and that bar actually existed. </connor>
<garnt> So it's this ping pong bar that has </garnt>
<garnt> this massive ping pong
table in the middle. </garnt>
<connor> - It's like going into
someone's living room </connor>
<garnt> it's so weird. </garnt>
<joey> - To get there, we had to go
down the dodgiest alleyway. </joey>
<joey> It was literally this handwritten sign </joey>
<joey> that says ping-pong bar,
go down this alleyway. </joey>
<joey> And so we go down this alleyway, </joey>
<joey> it's a dirty, dirty alleyway. </joey>
<connor> - Take some sheep from PT. </connor>
<joey> - Like there could be someone </joey>
<joey> doing heroin around the corner </joey>
<joey> you have no fucking clue. </joey>
<connor> So we go in there and then we
have to go up these stairs, </connor>
<connor> and it was just the stone stairs </connor>
<connor> that someone's probably
pissed on, you know. </connor>
<joey> That kind of bar. </joey>
<joey> As we go up and then it's
just someone's apartment. </joey>
<joey> It's just literally someone's apartment. </joey>
<joey> But then they opened the
door and it's a proper... </joey>
<joey> They've properly remodeled it into a bar. </joey>
<joey> And I'm thinking, man, </joey>
<garnt> how would anyone fucking discover this? </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause this is just hidden away, </garnt>
<garnt> down too fucking dodgy alleys
that I would not go down. </garnt>
<joey> - That's what I'm saying. </joey>
<joey> It's like there are so
many where I'm just like </joey>
<joey> you wouldn't, if you
didn't have a curious mind </joey>
<connor> and you weren't afraid </connor>
<connor> that you might possibly get
stabbed down this alleyway, </connor>
<connor> but there are so many
places where it's just like </connor>
<connor> you'd never be able to see. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, I try think Shinjuku is good </connor>
<connor> especially if you're a
foreigner 'cause you can... </connor>
<joey> I think a lot of people in Shinjuku, </joey>
<joey> are like wanting to meet foreigners </joey>
<joey> and stuff like that, or Shibuya, </joey>
<joey> so if you stayed with
those two places yeah </joey>
<joey> the super touristy and
everyone knows about them. </joey>
<joey> But I think a lot of
places outside of that </joey>
<joey> you probably won't find
people who are super </joey>
<joey> eager to talk to foreigners. </joey>
<joey> - Maybe Ikebukuro to an extent. </joey>
<connor> - Maybe Ikebukuro, yeah. </connor>
<joey> But that's as far as
you'll probably go, right? </joey>
<connor> - I mean, in Shinjuku,
you'll definitely find people </connor>
<connor> who wanna speak to you
if you're a foreigner. </connor>
<garnt> - And it's like sometimes you go </garnt>
<garnt> to a bar and the people serving you </garnt>
<connor> have time to speak to you as well. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah that's fun. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. I like that experience. </connor>
<connor> Like the one place we went to </connor>
<connor> that started playing all
of our YouTube videos. </connor>
<connor> So there was this bar
that we went to, right? </connor>
<connor> There was this bar that we went to, </connor>
<connor> a really small intimate bar. And they... </connor>
<connor> I can't remember who
brought up the conversation, </connor>
<connor> but I remember they found out that Sydney </connor>
<connor> was a YouTuber, 'cause
Sydney was there as well. </connor>
<connor> She makes the stupid
mistake of telling her </connor>
<connor> her YouTube channel. </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God.
(Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> So this bar has four... </connor>
<garnt> Has about three TVs in it, right? </garnt>
<garnt> And so, as soon as the bar
lady hears her YouTube channel, </garnt>
<garnt> she just Chromecasts Sydney's fucking... </garnt>
<joey> (Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> Sydney's videos </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> Sydney's videos all over the bar, </joey>
<garnt> where other people that are
also drinking there on this bar. </garnt>
<garnt> So we're just there watching
Sydney's YouTube channel, </garnt>
<joey> and she's just dying inside. </joey>
<joey> - That's a fucking nightmare, isn't it? </joey>
<garnt> That's the one thing you shouldn't do </garnt>
<garnt> if you have a YouTuber friend, </garnt>
<connor> is play their videos in front of them. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> - What is it about that? </connor>
<joey> I've never understood that. </joey>
<joey> - Just hearing your own voice. </joey>
<connor> So you being not like being silly, right? </connor>
<joey> It hurts. </joey>
<connor> - But it's just like you're... </connor>
<connor> It's like you're okay with you. </connor>
<connor> It's such a weird dilemma </connor>
<connor> 'cause my cousin asked
me that same question, </connor>
<joey> which is like okay, so
you're all fine with me </joey>
<joey> watching your videos, as
long as you're not there. </joey>
<garnt> But the moment you're there, </garnt>
<garnt> you don't want me watching the video? </garnt>
<garnt> Like how does that make sense? </garnt>
<joey> I'm just like, I don't
know, I just don't like it. </joey>
<garnt> I just don't like exactly the same. </garnt>
<joey> - Like I hate it when I have to rewatch my </joey>
<joey> video to check it, like- </joey>
<joey> - I'm fine with that. </joey>
<connor> - Are you?
- Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause I'm just like- </garnt>
<garnt> - I used to not be. </garnt>
<joey> And then now I'm like,
God, I love this video. </joey>
<joey> God I love it. </joey>
<joey> - God I love that guy.
- I love this part. </joey>
<joey> Damn you Conner. </joey>
<connor> Damn, that was a funny joke
Conner. I'm proud of you. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. I don't mind
rewatching back on my video </joey>
<joey> that I'm editing for example, </joey>
<joey> if I'm the only one in the room, </joey>
<joey> but if someone's standing behind me, </joey>
<joey> like micromanaging me and
watching out the video </joey>
<joey> I'll be like please, leave. </joey>
<joey> I don't want you watching this right now. </joey>
<joey> You can go watch it after it's uploaded, </joey>
<joey> when I'm not there. </joey>
<joey> Yeah, I don't get it. </joey>
<joey> It's weird.
(Garnt laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - Do you remember the
time that you accidentally </garnt>
<joey> deleted the video while
we were out drinking? </joey>
<joey> - Oh my God.
- You what? </joey>
<joey> This is one of the worst to have... </joey>
<joey> Look at what happened to us, </joey>
<joey> we were at a friend's house, </joey>
<joey> and they were Chromecasting </joey>
<connor> all my fucking videos to the Chromecast. </connor>
<connor> And I don't wanna watch my videos. </connor>
<garnt> - This is about 2:00 AM in the night, </garnt>
<connor> so we're pretty drunk at this point. </connor>
<connor> - And I'm, so fucking bad. </connor>
<joey> So here's my most recent
video and had a sponsor on it. </joey>
<joey> And so, here's what happens, right? </joey>
<joey> When you have the YouTube app </joey>
<joey> and someone's Chromecasting
and you're also connected, </joey>
<joey> you can move the video, skip it, whatever, </joey>
<joey> and it was said like, Oh, </joey>
<joey> I could click on the
playlist of the cute videos, </joey>
<joey> and it said... </joey>
<joey> I clicked it, and my video was on </joey>
<joey> and I was like I'm gonna turn this off so, </joey>
<joey> I click it and there was no off button, </joey>
<joey> there was only delete
video and I was like, well, </joey>
<joey> delete video from the Chromecast. </joey>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> So I deleted the video on the spot, </connor>
<joey> bear in mind I haven't even
paid for the sponsor yet. </joey>
<joey> And it got paid like... </joey>
<joey> And I uploaded like two days ago, </joey>
<joey> and then I realized 10 minutes later, </joey>
<connor> I'm like, I'm looking at my channel </connor>
<connor> and I'm like, where's the video gone? </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> Wait, wait, did I delete the video? </connor>
<joey> And then I was just sitting
there for like all nights. </joey>
<joey> Sorrying up, thinking I
deleted the fucking video, </joey>
<joey> what am I gonna do? </joey>
<joey> Maybe they won't notice I deleted video. </joey>
<joey> And then on the taxi
backup, which was gone, </joey>
<connor> I was like, God, I think I fucked up. </connor>
<connor> And what do I do? I
deleted the sponsor video. </connor>
<joey> I don't know how do I play this off? </joey>
<connor> - Wait, is this recently? </connor>
<connor> - No no no, it was like two years ago. </connor>
<connor> - This is back in England. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh yeah yeah yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - It was just like yeah, ages ago. </joey>
<connor> - I remember Conner
calling and telling me, </connor>
<connor> it's like, yeah, I
think I deleted a video. </connor>
<joey> I'm like, Oh, I mean,
it's still like this. </joey>
<joey> It's not that bad we just re-upload it </joey>
<joey> and he's like, no, I mean,
it's a sponsored video. </joey>
<joey> I haven't been paid for a year, </joey>
<joey> and do you think the sponsors will notice? </joey>
<joey> I'm just like, okay. </joey>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> That's a pickle that you are in. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - A bit of a pickle. </connor>
<connor> - And then like they... </connor>
<connor> I can't remember who,
which sponsor it was. </connor>
<connor> I'm pretty sure they probably
shouldn't tell anyway. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause they wanna have some fun. </connor>
<joey> They emailed me two days
after, they were like, </joey>
<connor> hey, what was the video
called? Where's it gone? </connor>
<connor> And luckily, I've just been dealing </connor>
<connor> with a ton of copyright issues. </connor>
<connor> And so I emailed them back and
being like, Oh gosh, darn it. </connor>
<connor> That YouTube copyright
is doing its magic again. </connor>
<connor> They've blocked the video worldwide. </connor>
<connor> That's why I'm like
retyping all the things. </connor>
<connor> I'm like I'm pretty sure I can fix it </connor>
<connor> by tomorrow at 8:00 AM. </connor>
<connor> So I uploaded that and they were like </connor>
<connor> great work on it back up. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, thank you, man. </connor>
<connor> I'm so glad I fixed it. </connor>
<connor> - Wow! You giga brain. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, Oh my God,
I fucking didn't see that. </connor>
<joey> So, yeah I was really drunk.
I wasn't even that drunk. </joey>
<joey> I wasn't even telling you.
I was just like lightly. </joey>
<joey> - So, wasn't that really dumb? </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah. I was just really fucking dumb. </joey>
<connor> I just did it and I was like,
fuck, that's a bad thing. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<joey> - Can you just please fire me? </joey>
<connor> Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> - I paid for it in the end though. </connor>
<connor> - That's good. </connor>
<joey> That's a YouTuber's
worst nightmare though. </joey>
<connor> - Deleting the video was not so bad, </connor>
<garnt> but having to explain to someone- </garnt>
<garnt> - Why you deleted. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. I think it's like, you know, </garnt>
<joey> when you have to explain to your parents </joey>
<joey> that you've fucked up in some kind of way. </joey>
<joey> And you're like, man, I
really have to hype myself up </joey>
<garnt> to just explain to mum and dad
why this thing has happened. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh my God. </joey>
<garnt> - That's terrible. </garnt>
<connor> - But going back to Japan nightlife, </connor>
<connor> how do we keep going off
on these fucking tangents? </connor>
<connor> - It's fun, let the tangents happen Joey. </connor>
<connor> All the fun is serious. </connor>
<connor> - I'm okay with it, I'm okay. </connor>
<connor> I'm just impressed at ourselves </connor>
<joey> that we can tangent that fucking far away </joey>
<joey> from whatever it is we
we're talking about. </joey>
<connor> But one place I like to
go to a lot is Bagus. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah, I like Bagus too. </connor>
<garnt> - Have you been to Bagus? </garnt>
<garnt> - I have not been to Bagus. </garnt>
<connor> - Okay, okay. </connor>
<joey> 'Cause I was saying
before that I was like... </joey>
<joey> I didn't remember if it was you </joey>
<connor> or Conner who hasn't been to Bagus. </connor>
<connor> - I have been to Bagus plenty of times. </connor>
<connor> - But yeah. So Bagus to explain </connor>
<connor> is it's like a darts, pool, ping pong. </connor>
<connor> - This is more of other stuff as well </connor>
<connor> it depends on some other places. </connor>
<connor> - It's a Manga cafe as well. </connor>
<connor> So basically where I did </connor>
<connor> the manga cafe video, that's a Bagus. </connor>
<connor> So they have a bunch of
different Bagus that sometimes </connor>
<connor> they focus on the manga
cafe side of things, </connor>
<connor> sometimes they focus on the pool </connor>
<joey> and darts bar side of things </joey>
<joey> but basically, it's
this 24/7 establishment </joey>
<joey> that's where you can just go </joey>
<joey> and get drinks and just hang out, </joey>
<joey> play pool and stuff like that. </joey>
<connor> - There's a ton in Shinjuku and Shibuya. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah a lot, a lot. </joey>
<joey> But I'm surprised that you haven't been. </joey>
<garnt> I don't know, I don't think that... </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah I don't know, I just haven't been. </garnt>
<connor> - It's a... </connor>
<connor> I think it's one of those places </connor>
<connor> 'cause you wanna spend at
least two, three hours there </connor>
<connor> and you don't really wanted
to do it before your meal. </connor>
<connor> You don't really wanna
do it after your meal </connor>
<connor> 'cause that's like best drinking hours. </connor>
<connor> So it's normally like, you
know, it gets to 1:00 AM </connor>
<connor> you're like, what do you guys wanna do? </connor>
<connor> I don't wanna keep drinking that much </connor>
<connor> 'cause I'll just string your Bagus. </connor>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. Exactly. </joey>
<joey> - It's fine I mean, it's
kind of pricey though. </joey>
<joey> - It is a little- </joey>
<joey> - If you're there for like three hours </joey>
<joey> that shit adds up fast,
'cause they charge you per- </joey>
<joey> - Half an hour. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah half an hour. </joey>
<joey> And then you're buying drinks on top. </joey>
<connor> Which of the drinks kinda little pricey. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, you can get
all you can drink though. </joey>
<connor> Of course. </connor>
<connor> - And you, I don't even know that. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. You can
do all you can drink in Bagus. </connor>
<connor> But again, you have to be prepared to stay </connor>
<joey> for at least two hours, right? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. 'Cause I know they do a package </connor>
<connor> that's like till the sun comes up package, </connor>
<connor> where it's like one to 6:00 AM, </connor>
<connor> and it's quite cheap, but
obviously you're committing- </connor>
<joey> - But it's like, I'm gonna stay up </joey>
<joey> till 6:00 AM to play pool. </joey>
<connor> - There's only so much pool you can play </connor>
<connor> before you're like this
just isn't fun anymore. </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> We both aren't good at pool
and we've been doing it </connor>
<connor> for 30 minutes and I'm starting
to think I don't like this. </connor>
<garnt> - I feel like I get better
when I'm drinking at pool. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't know, that's the alcohol </connor>
<connor> making you think you're better. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<joey> - It's not like you're getting better. </joey>
<joey> Your opponent would choose just as drunk </joey>
<joey> as he was getting worse. </joey>
<garnt> - So I think I just doubt
myself too much where... </garnt>
<joey> When I'm like playing pool sober, </joey>
<joey> I think when I'm about two pints in, </joey>
<joey> I just start hitting shots. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, for some reason it just goes in, </joey>
<joey> and then I have four drinks </joey>
<joey> and then I start getting worse again. </joey>
<joey> I don't, I feel like there's a sweet spot </joey>
<joey> where I'm slightly tipsy and
I'm a fucking goaler at pool. </joey>
<garnt> - I'm like that with bowling. </garnt>
<garnt> - I like the darts, because
there's not a dart board. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like an arcade
machine with a dart board. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like yes, I can electric- </garnt>
<joey> - And some of them are so fucking overkill </joey>
<joey> and what they are, like
there was one more, </joey>
<joey> it's like you could play
on a whole RPG, in darts. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that's right. I remember that. </joey>
<connor> - And I was like, what the fuck is this? </connor>
<connor> And it was like, </connor>
<joey> your dart would do extra amount of damage. </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> I mean, it's so hard with a straight face, </joey>
<garnt> like if you're on a date
or something being like, </garnt>
<garnt> hey, do you wanna play the RPG darts? </garnt>
<garnt> - That sounds amazing. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's pretty great for the first time. </garnt>
<joey> But then some of the
levels were so bullshit </joey>
<joey> You had to get like- </joey>
<joey> - You needed to be like a fucking God. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, you had to get triple twenties, </joey>
<joey> like every single one, I'm
like, this is bullshit, </joey>
<connor> Medusa should die way
easier than this, come on. </connor>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, but it's those
little touches, right? </joey>
<joey> That I think add to the whole Bagus- </joey>
<connor> - This is a lot more fun
that you don't have to count </connor>
<joey> in the darts 'cause the
machine just does it for you, </joey>
<connor> - Exactly, exactly. </connor>
<connor> - And it does make it a lot. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause I've to a lot
of old-fashioned pubs </connor>
<connor> in Australia where there
is like a dart board- </connor>
<connor> - But you get the real
darts in all of those pubs? </connor>
<joey> They have these fucking
flimsy plastic darts. </joey>
<connor> - But it's also just as dangerous as well. </connor>
<connor> - But I love the danger. </connor>
<joey> - Ooooh I got a sharp </joey>
<joey> metal object!
- The drunk danger, </joey>
<connor> it's exciting, Joey. </connor>
<joey> - No, I'm good, man. </joey>
<joey> I'm too old for this shit. </joey>
<connor> - When you meet those people in the UK </connor>
<connor> that are like full pints in... </connor>
<connor> Are getting nailed, they get
like the peak performance </connor>
<connor> out of four pints. It's insane. </connor>
<joey> - I'm like I was bowling, </joey>
<joey> I fucking suck at bowling while I'm sober, </joey>
<joey> but I've quickly discovered the other day </joey>
<joey> that if I drink two or three pints, </joey>
<joey> before bowling, I can do
like a fucking Turkey, </joey>
<garnt> like I don't know tomorrow. </garnt>
<garnt> - Of course you just
don't think, you just- </garnt>
<connor> - I'm just like throw a ball, half pint. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know why, but I
think bowling is the most </connor>
<garnt> depressing activity out
of all of the activities. </garnt>
<garnt> - Really?
- Really? </garnt>
<garnt> - I think so. </garnt>
<garnt> - I feel like bowling with alcohol is fun. </garnt>
<connor> - It's fine. </connor>
<garnt> - But bowling without alcohol is boring. </garnt>
<joey> - I think, I feel like I like bowling </joey>
<connor> because I didn't really
play it growing up. </connor>
<connor> Like I know it's... </connor>
<joey> You're either the kid
who fucking used to bowl </joey>
<joey> all the freaking time for fun, </joey>
<joey> or you were that one kid
who would only ever bowl- </joey>
<connor> - Fuck bowls are for fun? </connor>
<connor> - So a lot of people do,
in the UK apparently. </connor>
<connor> - Do they? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. A lot of- </connor>
<connor> - Why do you think bowling is depressing? </connor>
<connor> - I don't know, there's an air to it. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<joey> - There always-
- It just doesn't </joey>
<joey> hit different. </joey>
<joey> - Okay. So I went... </joey>
<joey> Okay. This isn't an exclusive incident. </joey>
<joey> A lot of the places are like this, </joey>
<joey> but I'm just giving this for an example. </joey>
<joey> I went to a place in California. </joey>
<joey> Very nice area of California. </joey>
<joey> And somehow in California </joey>
<joey> this place that was very
like, seemed very normal. </joey>
<connor> There's just this one place. </connor>
<connor> And somehow this bowling
place was the only place </connor>
<connor> that gave me mega redneck vibes. </connor>
<connor> And I went in there </connor>
<connor> and it was very much just like that. </connor>
<connor> But what it seemed like
there was just a bunch </connor>
<connor> of people who, you know,
like were, I don't know. </connor>
<joey> - Have you been bowling in Japan though? </joey>
<joey> - No, I haven't. </joey>
<joey> - Well then maybe it might change, right? </joey>
<connor> - Unless there's screens
and shits fucking like, </connor>
<connor> Prrrrrrrrr! you got those
stuff like a tickle 10, </connor>
<connor> woooooo! </connor>
<joey> Like a guy comes over, congratulates you, </joey>
<joey> unless that happens no way, no way. </joey>
<joey> - I mean it, there is- </joey>
<connor> - How can bowling be any fucking different </connor>
<connor> with Japan, to other countries? </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, there's no rednecks. </garnt>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<joey> 'Cause I've like to me it
just sounds like the... </joey>
<joey> You said it was the era about it. </joey>
<connor> - But then this whole, okay. </connor>
<connor> Although I live there kind
of like bowling places </connor>
<connor> for some reason, universally, are the most </connor>
<connor> semi rundown places out of any
of the entertainment things. </connor>
<connor> I don't know why, bowling's always... </connor>
<connor> Like places always look the worst. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, I can see that. </joey>
<connor> - Does anyone understand what I mean? </connor>
<joey> - But the difference is
that bowling alleys in Japan </joey>
<joey> are run by round ones, so
they'll usually have the first... </joey>
<joey> We usually with like a
lot of big round ones </joey>
<joey> which is like a huge arcade
chain, if you don't know, </joey>
<joey> but it's like, the first three floors </joey>
<joey> are the arcades and the
rhythm games or whatnot. </joey>
<joey> And then the next four floors
are all the bowling exits. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, to me it's just like an activity </garnt>
<garnt> to do when you're drinking. </garnt>
<connor> - I enjoy it, but it's... </connor>
<connor> I do think it's the worst
activity out of the bunch. </connor>
<garnt> - Why? Why? </garnt>
<joey> - There's plenty of time
to talk to your mates </joey>
<joey> and you just throw ball every few minutes, </joey>
<joey> - And you get a laugh at
your mate being shooted ball. </joey>
<connor> - 'Cause he know like everyone's
too invested in the bowling </connor>
<connor> and we're not talking, right? </connor>
<joey> Or nobody's invested in the bowling. </joey>
<joey> And the moment someone- </joey>
<joey> - Well, that's not the kind of people </joey>
<joey> you should be going bowling with. </joey>
<joey> - Tell me the perfect
level of bowling ratio </joey>
<joey> to conversation ratio
I should be expecting </joey>
<joey> because what happens is, </joey>
<joey> and this happens every single
time you go bowling, right? </joey>
<joey> Everyone's talking, Oh, it's my turn </joey>
<joey> but I was in the middle
of a fun conversation. </joey>
<joey> I don't really wanna bowl. </joey>
<connor> So do you just fucking
throw her like a med bowl? </connor>
<connor> But because you're already 10 points down, </connor>
<connor> you're not gonna win this one. </connor>
<connor> You're not gonna get a
strike, let's be realistic. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause you're kind of shit at bowling. </connor>
<connor> And you know, then someone
or sometimes you... </connor>
<connor> Okay, so then, sorry, I'm losing my... </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<joey> - If I'm getting tilted over bowling. </joey>
<joey> - So then, you go up, you
miss out on the conversation </joey>
<joey> and just feels like you're speed dating, </joey>
<connor> but the one person is
not getting a date who </connor>
<joey> keeps going out. </joey>
<joey> - But I get that. If it's... </joey>
<joey> If you're only going bowling
with your date, right? </joey>
<connor> If there's only two people bowling- </connor>
<joey> - No dates, it's just mates. </joey>
<joey> It's like, you're in a group </joey>
<joey> and then you leave the conversation </joey>
<connor> and then no one's really giving a shit </connor>
<connor> about the bowling because
am having a conversation. </connor>
<connor> Or its vice versa. </connor>
<garnt> - It's just like a background
activity you know what I mean. </garnt>
<connor> - Then what's the point? </connor>
<connor> Don't do something else. </connor>
<connor> - This is exactly the same
as like darts and stuff. </connor>
<connor> - That's also what I had to say. </connor>
<garnt> It's exactly the same
as like darts or pool. </garnt>
<garnt> - Now darts, you can keep talking </garnt>
<joey> while you're playing
darts with each other. </joey>
<joey> - You can keep talking while you bowl. </joey>
<joey> - You gotta like, what are you gonna do, </joey>
<connor> follow him up to the bowl? </connor>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> What are you gonna do? Follow
him up to the thing like, </joey>
<joey> okay, okay, keep going. Oh,
nice bowl, lets go back, </joey>
<joey> now lets go talk. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I do that sometimes. </joey>
<joey> - Fuck off. </joey>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<connor> I would be like, fuck off
Jerry I'm trying to bowl here. </connor>
<connor> - Whatever it is, that
doesn't make a lot of sense </connor>
<joey> 'cause you are like I don't
give a shit about the bowling. </joey>
<joey> I only care about the conversation right? </joey>
<connor> - Because at bowling, I give
a shit about the bowling. </connor>
<connor> And then when I'm talking,
when it's someone else's turn, </connor>
<connor> I give a shit about talking. </connor>
<joey> - You're one the most
difficult fucking bowler </joey>
<connor> I've ever seen. </connor>
<connor> - I just feel like it's a dichotomy </connor>
<connor> and it shouldn't exist fully. </connor>
<garnt> - There's so many activities
I can think of that you know. </garnt>
<connor> - No, the easier pool. </connor>
<connor> While you're doing the pool, you can talk. </connor>
<connor> While you're doing darts, you can talk. </connor>
<connor> Everything else you can
do without like talking. </connor>
<garnt> - Just like 'cause it's a group activity, </garnt>
<connor> 'cause your pool and darts I feel like </connor>
<garnt> it's just like two people that's doing it. </garnt>
<connor> - You can do it with group like pool. </connor>
<connor> You can all sit around
the table and enjoy- </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, but there's only
two people playing pool. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, but okay, with bowling- </connor>
<garnt> - You can do it like tag. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because it's such a distance,
one, too much for walking. </garnt>
<connor> Can I just put that out
there, too much for walking? </connor>
<connor> - From such a distance? </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - You have to walk far enough away. </connor>
<joey> while can't be in the car. </joey>
<joey> Okay. This is going to
sound so fucking dumb. </joey>
<joey> All of this sounds dumb I realize, </joey>
<garnt> but you have to walk far enough away </garnt>
<connor> where you're then
leaving the conversation. </connor>
<joey> - But you don't have to
leave the conversation? </joey>
<connor> - No, you lost. You're gone Joey. </connor>
<connor> You're gone. You're out of it. </connor>
<connor> - If the conversation is... </connor>
<joey> Like how, you're not gonna
be like fucking far away </joey>
<joey> for five minutes, you're
up there for three seconds. </joey>
<connor> - That's enough to leave the conversation. </connor>
<garnt> - I'll be honest, I've never thought </garnt>
<garnt> this deeply about bowling. </garnt>
<connor> - I think this deeply
about everything in my life </connor>
<connor> except the music and story. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - So in your mind, are you
thinking like this could be </garnt>
<joey> optimized? This situation
could be optimized? </joey>
<joey> This isn't speed running fun. </joey>
<garnt> You know, this is fun with extra steps. </garnt>
<connor> - I don't think there's
too much gap between... </connor>
<connor> No one needs that much
run-up when they're bowling. </connor>
<joey> And if you do something's wrong with you. </joey>
<joey> Let's shorten the distance
between where the seats are </joey>
<connor> and where the alley starts. </connor>
<joey> - Well then... </joey>
<joey> But I mean, you don't gonna
have a 500 meter run up to bowl. </joey>
<connor> - I know some people who are
like, I need the full length. </connor>
<joey> - Well then I don't wanna go
bowling with people like that. </joey>
<joey> That just sounds like a dush. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> You taking this bowling
shit way too serious. </joey>
<connor> - I just think that bowling
is a not very optimized sport </connor>
<connor> for friendship engagement. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna put that out there. </connor>
<connor> I just think it's not the best. </connor>
<connor> You know, what can I say
gentlemen? I mean it. </connor>
<joey> - I don't know, I felt like... </joey>
<joey> Okay, 'cause I've been bowling with like- </joey>
<joey> - I'm sure there is one people out there </joey>
<connor> that are like, Conner knows
what he's talking about. </connor>
<connor> He's not monkey brain. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, well, then they
are the kind of people </joey>
<garnt> I don't wanna go bowling with. </garnt>
<joey> - Because I don't know. </joey>
<joey> There's always gonna be those comments </joey>
<joey> 'cause they're gonna be
like, Oh, I'm not alone. </joey>
<connor> I need to speak up. </connor>
<garnt> - Finally. </garnt>
<connor> - Also bowling feels like an activity </connor>
<joey> where I shouldn't have to change my shoes. </joey>
<joey> You know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> It's that level of activity,
that isn't serious enough </joey>
<joey> to warrant me changing clothes. </joey>
<joey> - I will admit, the shoes part
is kind of bullshit, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Like it's not like
you're going rock-climbing </connor>
<joey> or something. </joey>
<joey> Like I understand the need
to bring like, you know </joey>
<joey> flexible clothing, right? </joey>
<joey> It feels like an activity
that shouldn't require me </joey>
<joey> changing clothes. </joey>
<joey> And I hate the fact that
you always get the most </joey>
<connor> disgusting rancid shoes, that feels so </connor>
<connor> yeah, okay, sure, they spray it. </connor>
<connor> They give it a little alcohol spray </connor>
<connor> like that does fucking anything.
The shoe is disgusting. </connor>
<joey> - Okay, to be fair though,
Japan is really good, right? </joey>
<connor> With that cleanliness and stuff like that. </connor>
<connor> So I've never gotten... </connor>
<joey> I've had that in Australia where like- </joey>
<connor> - Still I don't wanna
fucking wear my fucking </connor>
<connor> Wales Waldo shoes while
I'm talking to my friends, </connor>
<connor> eating the most pathetic
fries in existence </connor>
<connor> that had been half cooked, while we have </connor>
<joey> a half good conversation
and overpriced alcohol. </joey>
<joey> I just think bowling
needs to be done better, </joey>
<joey> and it's depressing as
fuck, I don't know why. </joey>
<connor> - What's like with someone
with childhood trauma, </connor>
<joey> bowling alley. </joey>
<joey> - Who hurt you Conner? </joey>
<joey> Show me on the door where... </joey>
<joey> Show me on the doorway bowling is- </joey>
<joey> - Show me on the bowling ball. </joey>
<connor> - No no no. </connor>
<connor> - My closing statement on bowling. </connor>
<connor> - Okay. There's a question
I need to ask you. </connor>
<connor> Because have you had
bad bowling experiences </connor>
<connor> when you were a kid or is it something </connor>
<connor> that you developed as an adult? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, as I become an adult
all this became a thing. </garnt>
<garnt> Because... </garnt>
<garnt> But, now that I have that
thought now where I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> you know what? </garnt>
<joey> I just realized, 'cause bowling places </joey>
<joey> always had arcades, right? </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I had more fun on the
arcade than the bowler </joey>
<joey> whenever I went bowling. </joey>
<joey> So what does that say about bowling? </joey>
<connor> 'Cause you know, when there was like... </connor>
<garnt> If you would have a party with 12 kids, </garnt>
<connor> you are waiting a long fucking time </connor>
<connor> before your turn.
- I feel like you </connor>
<connor> don't enjoy bowling for the same reason </connor>
<joey> you skipped stories. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I want the game play. </joey>
<joey> - Like if you could just
bowl 10 balls in a row, </joey>
<joey> and just like... </joey>
<joey> And then have conversation, </joey>
<connor> I'm sure you would enjoy it then. </connor>
<garnt> but you're just like, skip,
skip, skip, skip, skip. </garnt>
<connor> - I think, because it's like... </connor>
<connor> I don't know if you're like this but </connor>
<connor> when it's like not my turn </connor>
<connor> I have a tiny bit of
anxiety of like, fuck, </connor>
<joey> when's it gonna be my turn? </joey>
<joey> I don't know when it's gonna be my turn. </joey>
<joey> But I don't get called out? </joey>
<joey> I don't wanna be that much. </joey>
<joey> - You're not that serious. </joey>
<joey> - I know it isn't but this is the thing. </joey>
<garnt> I have someone out there. </garnt>
<garnt> - You're only throwing
balls to an alley way. </garnt>
<garnt> - Someone out there
viewing experiences where </garnt>
<garnt> you're just like, yeah,
it's kind of anxious </garnt>
<garnt> just not knowing when I'm
gonna to fucking stand up </garnt>
<connor> and throw something. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> Like I just don't like to know that okay, </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna just do it and
then I can come back. </connor>
<joey> - You treating it like it's
a fucking quick time event. </joey>
<joey> Like you can go out whenever you want. </joey>
<connor> - I just wanna talk to my
homies or play the arcades. </connor>
<connor> Can we separate them both? </connor>
<joey> - Well then maybe you'll enjoy bowling </joey>
<connor> if it was a one player game. You will just </connor>
<connor> play bowling by yourself.
They'll be like finally, </connor>
<joey> I get all the time. </joey>
<joey> - You know my best experience bowling was? </joey>
<connor> Wee Sports, that was the
best project. You know why? </connor>
<connor> No waiting, I just throw </connor>
<joey> that shit-
- And its 100% optimized. </joey>
<connor> - And you had that a 100 pin ball </connor>
<connor> that should be fun as fuck. </connor>
<joey> I love watching YouTube videos </joey>
<joey> of people getting like a 1000 pins. </joey>
<joey> It's just amazing. It feels good. </joey>
<joey> - Well then maybe we should do that. </joey>
<connor> Just we bowling. </connor>
<connor> - Yes, we bowling. </connor>
<joey> - No, no. I still gotta wait
for you to do it yourself, </joey>
<joey> I don't like that. </joey>
<joey> - You know you can skip it if you want. </joey>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<joey> - Skip Joey's turn. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. Skip, skip, skip. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. I feel like talking
to you for enough times </garnt>
<joey> I'm like, yeah, I kind of
get the monkey brain now, </joey>
<joey> it's starting to make sense. </joey>
<garnt> I'm like scientifically dissecting
how you're breaking away. </garnt>
<connor> - I just think, 'cause you know, </connor>
<connor> it's not my pool or darts so constantly </connor>
<connor> like talking and next to each other. </connor>
<joey> Doesn't really fucking
matter when it's my turn, </joey>
<joey> but bowling, 'cause it's like, hard, </joey>
<joey> I have to walk up and you know. </joey>
<joey> - But why don't you walk up with them? </joey>
<joey> - And also, you know,
okay, I'm not gonna lie. </joey>
<connor> I'm never been a big fan
of having to pick the ball. </connor>
<joey> I own for it. I'm kind
of sick of doing that. </joey>
<joey> Like, 'cause you've been there, right? </joey>
<joey> That one place where they don't
have your fucking hand size. </joey>
<joey> It's like they're too fucking
big where it feels like </joey>
<joey> you're tryna grab three
fucking food containers, </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<connor> like large, or it's like, </connor>
<connor> yes, I want my fingers to be crushed </connor>
<connor> to death and potentially just pull my... </connor>
<connor> Like dislocate my finger
when I throw this. </connor>
<connor> And you know 'cause you've
been to a place like that. </connor>
<joey> - No I haven't. </joey>
<connor> - Fuck off. </connor>
<connor> - That's why I'm laughing, because- </connor>
<joey> - Come on. </joey>
<joey> I've been to your place and you're like </joey>
<garnt> I kinda enjoy this bowling </garnt>
<garnt> because none of these
fucking balls fit my hand. </garnt>
<connor> - Well, the one thing I
will say about bowling </connor>
<joey> is that no matter ball
you choose somehow it just </joey>
<joey> doesn't feel right. </joey>
<joey> - It never feels good. </joey>
<joey> - Like you pick a ball and
you're like, this feels right. </joey>
<joey> And then you throw it like,
Ooh, that didn't feel good. </joey>
<joey> Let me go for the smaller one. </joey>
<joey> And then you throw it
and you're like, nah, </joey>
<joey> that feels too light. </joey>
<connor> So you go for the big one again. </connor>
<connor> And it just, I don't know- </connor>
<connor> - You never get the right one
and it's never satisfying. </connor>
<connor> - You're in a constant
state of anxiety to be like- </connor>
<garnt> - You guys must have gone
to some shit bowling alley. </garnt>
<joey> - You know, they don't fucking
clean those bowling balls </joey>
<connor> on the inside either. </connor>
<joey> - Okay. That's all the more
reason I wanna take you guys </joey>
<joey> to a Japanese bowling ball,
because every single thing </joey>
<garnt> that you guys have been
complaining about the bowling </garnt>
<joey> experience, I feel is
completely get rid of. </joey>
<joey> - I feel like I'm in the middle for this. </joey>
<joey> I don't hate bowling as much as Conner, </joey>
<joey> but if I would like to make like a TLS, </joey>
<garnt> bowling's like good sea tale. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. It's definitely one of the worst. </connor>
<joey> - Okay, I'm not gonna say that bowling </joey>
<joey> is an extreme experience or anything. </joey>
<joey> Like if there is a BET for me as well. </joey>
<garnt> - You can say its like
the fairy tale all right. </garnt>
<joey> - Its like the fairy tale
of entertainment sports. </joey>
<joey> (Joey and Conner laughing) </joey>
<garnt> Like it's just a mid man. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Bowling is mid. </garnt>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - I remember I went on a
date when I first got here </connor>
<joey> and they wanted to get a Bagus. </joey>
<joey> So I was like, yeah, sure, sure, sure. </joey>
<joey> Three Bagus. </joey>
<joey> And then at the back
of my head, I was like, </joey>
<joey> yeah, I'll take it easy on you. </joey>
<connor> And then I just started fucking
destroying them in that. </connor>
<connor> And they are out there like, </connor>
<connor> oh man, I guess you got lucky. </connor>
<joey> We started playing darts, </joey>
<joey> I started just fucking
crushing them in that, </joey>
<connor> and I'm like, yeah, good, know your place. </connor>
<connor> I'm joking, I'm joking. </connor>
<connor> That actually he beat me in darts. </connor>
<connor> - I just like... </connor>
<garnt> Does the word casual mean anything to you? </garnt>
<garnt> Like just playing casually? </garnt>
<connor> - Now bowling is a casual player sport. </connor>
<connor> I don't like bowlers. </connor>
<connor> - It's 'cause you can't win in it Conner. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Maybe that's why 'cause
I fucking suck at bowling. </connor>
<connor> Maybe that's why I hate it. </connor>
<garnt> - I always wanted to
ask you, like going back </garnt>
<garnt> to the monkey brain thing,
like your opinion on gameplay, </garnt>
<garnt> and we've had a few comments about this. </garnt>
<garnt> Why don't you like fighting games? </garnt>
<garnt> That is-
- That is pool for you. </garnt>
<garnt> - The game genre that
would like in theory, </garnt>
<garnt> appeal to you the most. </garnt>
<connor> - Yes, there's no story. </connor>
<connor> - It's probably like the
one type of video game </connor>
<joey> that I've just never enjoyed playing. </joey>
<joey> - Why is that? </joey>
<joey> - I have no... </joey>
<joey> I think is like the difficulty
curve is insanely high, </joey>
<joey> and I feel that like, I
don't wanna sit there, </joey>
<joey> and have to research combos, </joey>
<joey> because sure, when I pull
one off, I'm like, cool, </joey>
<joey> that animation was fine I guess, you know. </joey>
<joey> I just don't feel like I care enough </joey>
<joey> about like to learn these combos. </joey>
<joey> Whereas in a game, like,
a first person shooter, </joey>
<joey> it's so intuitive that like- </joey>
<joey> - 'Cause it's just one button. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, it's risky just
putting click, right? </joey>
<joey> And yeah, it is very... </joey>
<joey> Anyone can figure it out, </joey>
<connor> but it's that one simple
mechanic that you keep mastering </connor>
<connor> and you keep getting better and better. </connor>
<connor> And so it's the kind of like I've noticed </connor>
<joey> that I really only enjoy
games where it's easy </joey>
<joey> to learn how to master type of thing. </joey>
<joey> And fighting game is just hard to learn, </joey>
<joey> even harder to master. </joey>
<joey> - No, I still fighting games that are easy </joey>
<joey> to learn how to master. </joey>
<joey> - No. The Smash maybe? </joey>
<joey> - Yes. Smash, I think is the one. </joey>
<joey> - I really enjoy Smash. Smash is fun, </joey>
<joey> because I feel that
it's just, I don't know. </joey>
<joey> It's not like fucking Tekken rafter, </joey>
<garnt> where I have to worry
about like the frames </garnt>
<garnt> and the frame spacing and stuff, </garnt>
<connor> I don't wanna worry about that shit. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean like people in
smash worry about that, </garnt>
<garnt> but you can get to a high enough level. </garnt>
<connor> - But smash is a casual
game there I said it. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> No I'm kidding. </connor>
<joey> - That's what Socrates says. </joey>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> - That's a take. </joey>
<joey> - I just like fucking
made a thousand people </joey>
<joey> (inhaling quickly) </joey>
<connor> I'm kidding. </connor>
<connor> I love watching Smash competitive </connor>
<connor> but for me it's a party game, right? </connor>
<joey> - Oh yeah. </joey>
<joey> Well that's the great
thing about Smash, right? </joey>
<connor> Is that it's really fun
to watch as a party game </connor>
<garnt> but it's also really fun process. </garnt>
<garnt> - The thing that's really hard
about fighting games is that </garnt>
<joey> it's hardly ever a party game. </joey>
<joey> Right? Because whenever you are at a party </joey>
<joey> and people playing fighting games, </joey>
<joey> there's always that guy or two guys, </joey>
<joey> you know who you are, you
see people put on like, </joey>
<garnt> Smash we'll take it, and you're like- </garnt>
<joey> - 'Cause they never
leave that fucking couch. </joey>
<joey> They will never leave it. </joey>
<joey> If anything is pissed, they're not going. </joey>
<joey> They'll wait till they get home. </joey>
<garnt> Fighting games don't wait. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like this is what they've
trained their entire life for. </garnt>
<joey> They're like, okay, let me smash the move. </joey>
<joey> Let me smash all the people at this party. </joey>
<joey> And then they need to find
other people like them, </joey>
<garnt> to continue on this path that
they've put themselves on. </garnt>
<connor> - It's the same people who rock up </connor>
<connor> to an anime convention just
with that, like the game pad </connor>
<joey> and they're like, I know
why I'm spending this. </joey>
<joey> This is like speed. </joey>
<joey> There's no question
about where I'm spending </joey>
<connor> these three days. </connor>
<connor> Put me to the room with the Wee U's. </connor>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - Because I feel like with
fighting games, it's yeah... </garnt>
<connor> I enjoy watching fighting games more </connor>
<connor> than I enjoy playing them because </connor>
<connor> you get to a point where
you just smashing buttons </connor>
<connor> and you're like I kind of get it. </connor>
<connor> And then you go online or something, </connor>
<connor> and then you just get destroyed. </connor>
<joey> There is like the difficulty curve </joey>
<joey> as you said is just casual, but to be... </joey>
<connor> The difference between
a beginner and a casual </connor>
<connor> is so fucking massive. </connor>
<connor> - Oh it's huge. </connor>
<connor> - You know. Because you
go from button mashing </connor>
<connor> to having to learn like basic theory </connor>
<joey> of fighting games of basic combos, </joey>
<joey> and the difference between that- </joey>
<joey> - It's like counting frames and shit. </joey>
<connor> - Stuff like that </connor>
<connor> - The difference between the beginner </connor>
<connor> and the casual is so fucking hot. </connor>
<connor> - Okay. For example, in a
game of Overwatch, right? </connor>
<joey> A pro can be killed by someone </joey>
<joey> who is absolutely garbage at the game. </joey>
<joey> Like it's very plausible
that he could do that. </joey>
<joey> But in a fighting game,
fucking pro is never gonna lose </joey>
<connor> to a casual like that,
it's not gonna happen. </connor>
<connor> And I think that element
of like, all right, well, </connor>
<connor> if I just play better, most
of the time I'll always win. </connor>
<connor> Which is like... </connor>
<joey> - It's because of fighting games </joey>
<connor> there's no element of chance. </connor>
<connor> And anyway, like, especially if you're </connor>
<joey> at a pro level because they
just know what's coming. </joey>
<connor> - And I think its kind of fun
and that's the kind of stuff </connor>
<joey> that really drives me into like overdrive </joey>
<joey> of wanting to learn something. </joey>
<joey> Is that like, I had a chance </joey>
<connor> of beating that guy and
I could have done it </connor>
<connor> if I just keep practicing,
I'll easily get it. </connor>
<connor> Then I keep going, and
that's how I got into league. </connor>
<joey> - So then maybe if you just gave that a go </joey>
<joey> with like Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat- </joey>
<garnt> - I reckon if you learn one
fighting game, you'll be- </garnt>
<garnt> - I reckon I will be hurt. </garnt>
<garnt> Which is why I don't want to, </garnt>
<joey> 'cause I'm already
trying to learn Japanese, </joey>
<joey> the last thing I need is
something else taking care </joey>
<joey> of my fucking life. </joey>
<joey> - Fair enough. Fair, fair. </joey>
<joey> - It's like fighting games. </joey>
<joey> People I know who like
fighting games, super chill, </joey>
<joey> but their life is fighting games. </joey>
<joey> They don't talk about anything else. </joey>
<joey> They're like, Oh, you had a nice day? </joey>
<joey> Oh, that's cool. </joey>
<joey> I had a nice day learning
this mash combos. </joey>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> It's like what? Like they'll bring it </joey>
<joey> up when it's not even in the conversation. </joey>
<joey> Yeah. I love Leonardo DiCaprio. </joey>
<connor> (speaking foreign language) </connor>
<connor> - That's what it sounds like, </connor>
<joey> sometimes it's just horrible. </joey>
<connor> - It was like Leonardo DiCaprio </connor>
<joey> which somehow turned into Smash. </joey>
<joey> It's like what? What the fuck? </joey>
<connor> That's my shame the way
I'd smashed my combos </connor>
<connor> and stupid stuff and it's like, what? </connor>
<garnt> Just like stop. </garnt>
<garnt> - I will say like from the outside </garnt>
<garnt> looking in the fighting
game community looks </garnt>
<connor> like one of the funnest
communities to be in. </connor>
<connor> - I love the trash talking. </connor>
<garnt> - The trash talking is so good. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, like in League of Legends. </garnt>
<connor> They ban that shit and I'm
like, dude, I love trash. </connor>
<connor> I love trash talking in video games. </connor>
<connor> I think it's so fun. </connor>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<connor> - Maybe it's because of the trash talking </connor>
<joey> in some of those communities
just go a little bit too far. </joey>
<connor> - Maybe. I mean, Legal
Legends is not trash talk. </connor>
<connor> It's like, I'm good to
kill you and your family. </connor>
<joey> - It's like a legit threat sometimes. </joey>
<connor> - I reserve the right to just
type to someone you're bad. </connor>
<joey> Like I think that's... </joey>
<joey> Come off.
(Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> Someone can do it to me. I won't mind it. </joey>
<connor> It won't ruin my day. I'm not like- </connor>
<joey> - In a sense, that's one of the worst ways </joey>
<joey> to trash-talk right. </joey>
<joey> If you just stop and just typed in </joey>
<connor> you are bad in chat, lowercase, it's like, </connor>
<connor> (Joey quivering) </connor>
<connor> How dare you. </connor>
<connor> It's like the worst type of insult. </connor>
<connor> - So I competed on the... </connor>
<joey> One time they did a gaming tournament </joey>
<joey> for my universities, </joey>
<joey> and I was really fucking
good at Cod. And so I- </joey>
<joey> - You were one of those kids, aren't you? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah I competed on that. So- </joey>
<garnt> - Of course you were called the wicked, </garnt>
<garnt> of course you were. </garnt>
<garnt> - So there was this thing... </garnt>
<connor> Oh, my mates will just go
on this whole tangent then, </connor>
<connor> now if you guys are fine
with that, I used to... </connor>
<connor> When I was 15, I went to a
fuck ton of Cod tournament's, </connor>
<garnt> because Modern Warfare 3,
and if you've ever played, </garnt>
<garnt> you would play Modern Warfare? </garnt>
<garnt> - A little bit. </garnt>
<garnt> - I stopped at Modern Warfare 2. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay. So Modern Warfare
3 had this thing where </garnt>
<garnt> you could pay like $40 a year or whatever </garnt>
<garnt> for the pass for all the maps. </garnt>
<garnt> And then you can also go on
this website that they had, </garnt>
<joey> and they're like tournaments,
and I entered one </joey>
<joey> and they would have a prize for, okay, </joey>
<joey> first 10 people get a shot
glasses of Call of Duty, </joey>
<joey> (Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> which is like ladies fucked anyone who's </joey>
<joey> over the age of 18, but 15 on me was like </joey>
<connor> ( Conner straightening up) </connor>
<connor> wow!
(Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - I can pull my G fuel into that. </garnt>
<connor> - Wow, wow! I can be
like can I get something </connor>
<connor> for playing called. </connor>
<joey> So I went to my mate's house 'cause I know </joey>
<joey> that my parents would never let me </joey>
<joey> pull an all-nighter because bear in mind </joey>
<joey> these tournaments were... </joey>
<joey> Essentially what they
were was a stat tracking, </joey>
<connor> so it would be 24 hours tournament, </connor>
<connor> of where you would just... </connor>
<connor> It would be like most
kills in team death match. </connor>
<connor> So you would just go into a normal team </connor>
<joey> death match and just play. </joey>
<joey> And then it would count
how many kills you hadn't </joey>
<joey> team death match before
and how many death sets. </joey>
<joey> - So basically just like who can get </joey>
<joey> the highest score. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, right. So, basically it was like, </joey>
<connor> you just fucking keep
playing and I shit you not, </connor>
<connor> I played fucking like capture the flag </connor>
<garnt> for 20 hours straight during this to- </garnt>
<garnt> - Win these shots like hell. </garnt>
<garnt> - To win these shot glasses. </garnt>
<joey> And I was like crippled after it was like, </joey>
<joey> it was worth it. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> I came like... </joey>
<joey> I won so many at that
time that I was able to go </joey>
<connor> to sleep confidently knowing
that no one would be up </connor>
<connor> we'd be able to like overtake me. </connor>
<connor> I think it came like third
or something, so I won. </connor>
<connor> And then, what happened
was that it all changed. </connor>
<joey> They changed it so that
it was three hours now, </joey>
<joey> way more manageable. </joey>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt nodding) </joey>
<connor> I was like, sweet, I
can enter all of them. </connor>
<joey> And they were like most flags defended </joey>
<joey> and captured, that weird shit. </joey>
<joey> So sometimes I would be sitting
at my base, just waiting </joey>
<joey> for someone to take my
flag, kill them, get it back </joey>
<joey> and then just go back and camp. </joey>
<joey> And I would do this shit. </joey>
<joey> I won like 15 tournament or
something in the end. I won- </joey>
<joey> - So my room was full of shackles. </joey>
<joey> - I'll tell you what though. </joey>
<garnt> - What was the best prize you got? </garnt>
<garnt> - iPad Pro, at the time- </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] Oh wow.
- [Garnt] Wow. </joey>
<joey> - iPad, when I was like 17, </joey>
<joey> the brand new iPad at the time </joey>
<joey> my mum thought that I was a drug dealer. </joey>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> Because she was like, what the fuck? </joey>
<joey> 'Cause all this stuff turned up. </joey>
<joey> I won this huge poker
set, wooden poker set. </joey>
<joey> They only made 250 of them </joey>
<connor> and I still have it at my, at my house. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I couldn't sell it, </connor>
<connor> 'cause it was worth about 700 pounds. </connor>
<connor> - Jesus, fuck. </connor>
<connor> - It's a wood box this
big and you open it up </connor>
<connor> and all these wooden
poker chips, handcrafted, </connor>
<connor> cord tapes, dealerships,
metal, immaculate. </connor>
<joey> I'll show you pictures. </joey>
<joey> They'll be on screen
right now. It's crazy. </joey>
<joey> And I was doing these for ages. </joey>
<joey> I won like three skateboard decks. </joey>
<joey> I don't skateboard. </joey>
<joey> What the fuck should I do with it? </joey>
<joey> A hoodie, two coaster sets
that I still use actually, </joey>
<joey> metal coasters with like Cod skulls on it. </joey>
<joey> Who the fucking cream stuff? </joey>
<joey> One like wall decals,
which I couldn't use. </joey>
<joey> I sold most of the
stuff on eBay, but yeah. </joey>
<connor> I won an iPad Pro, which is one time. </connor>
<joey> And then, I got banned, from competing. </joey>
<joey> - Why?
- 'Cause you were too good? </joey>
<joey> - No, no, no. I... </joey>
<joey> So, the rules were not well-defined. </joey>
<joey> And I was... </joey>
<joey> I don't know how to, how do I describe it? </joey>
<joey> - You sneaky mother fucker? </joey>
<garnt> - You bent the rules to say- </garnt>
<connor> - Listen, if I saw an opportunity </connor>
<connor> to win an iPad Pro </connor>
<joey> I'm gonna take the
opportunity to win an iPad Pro </joey>
<joey> 'cause it seemed all legit. </joey>
<joey> So about halfway through these tournaments </joey>
<joey> I realized, okay, I'm trying
really hard to win these </joey>
<joey> but I think I can also do it a lot easier. </joey>
<joey> So basically what I would do is </joey>
<joey> I'd won a bunch of these tournaments, </joey>
<joey> and I used that notoriety
from those tournaments, </joey>
<joey> to recruit people to come, </joey>
<joey> 'cause all it would do
is track your stats. </joey>
<joey> So everyone else on
your team didn't matter. </joey>
<garnt> So if you had a team that was
coordinated into making sure </garnt>
<garnt> that you were the one
getting everything, right? </garnt>
<garnt> - So you basically smuffed. </garnt>
<joey> - So what I did was is I got
these five Swedish players. </joey>
<joey> For some reason the Swedish and Norwegian </joey>
<joey> do it always fucking amazing in Cod. </joey>
<joey> They were way too good. </joey>
<joey> And I promised them if they help me win </joey>
<connor> all these tournaments,
I would join their clan. </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> I was like negotiating online. </connor>
<joey> I would be like I won't
shout you out, I will join. </joey>
<joey> Bear in mind, I wasn't worth anything. </joey>
<joey> But to them, they were like, yo, </joey>
<joey> he's winning all these tournaments. </joey>
<joey> We've got to get this guy in. </joey>
<joey> So did you know of the game mode </joey>
<joey> like kill confirmed? </joey>
<joey> - No.
- No. </joey>
<joey> basically a game of
where you killed someone </joey>
<joey> and they would drop a tag
and you'd have to collect it. </joey>
<joey> So there was one tournament that was like </joey>
<joey> whoever gets the most kill
confirms in three hours, won. </joey>
<joey> So what I did was I told these guys, </joey>
<joey> I was like, hey, kill these
dudes, and put a marker </joey>
<joey> on the map of where you dropped
it and don't collect it. </joey>
<joey> And I just ran around,
collecting them all. </joey>
<joey> I didn't kill anyone. </joey>
<connor> And it was... </connor>
<connor> And I should have not done that </connor>
<connor> because what I knew was happening was like </connor>
<connor> first place was like
1200, second place 400, </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> And it raised like a lot of alarm bells. </connor>
<joey> The people were like,
that doesn't seem fair. </joey>
<connor> So I got away with it for
two or three tournaments </connor>
<connor> before people started really complaining. </connor>
<joey> And people were like, this isn't fair. </joey>
<joey> He's winning everything 'cause of this. </joey>
<joey> But then the thing was,
people started doing it. </joey>
<connor> So then it was a matter of everyone </connor>
<connor> was fucking cheating each other. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> And because there was some
real fucking big boy prizes. </connor>
<connor> There was a Jeep, one of
them, which I fucking, </connor>
<connor> I was like 10 points off
winning a fucking Jeep </connor>
<connor> at the age of 16, bear
in mind, I was killed. </connor>
<connor> I was winning all these
prizes under my dad's name. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause they wouldn't
ship it to you if you were- </connor>
<joey> - Underage.
- underage yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - They also made me fill out tax forms </garnt>
<joey> which I couldn't even
legally fill out, which I- </joey>
<garnt> - What did you tell your dad
that you were like filling out? </garnt>
<connor> - I was like, dad, I
have won a bunch of stuff </connor>
<joey> and it's gonna turn up to
the house in a UPS fab, </joey>
<joey> about 20 items. </joey>
<joey> I need you to pretend
that you won them dad, </joey>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<joey> And they were very visibly, like what? </joey>
<joey> And then they were like, okay, I guess. </joey>
<joey> And so the thing that got me banned </joey>
<joey> from these tournament's. </joey>
<joey> There was this one
price that was, you know </joey>
<garnt> the movie battleship
with featuring Rihanna? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah.
- Yeah Rihanna. </joey>
<connor> I know that horrible movie. </connor>
<connor> - They were promoting
the movie Battleship. </connor>
<connor> One of the prizes was </connor>
<connor> you could rent out a whole movie theater </connor>
<joey> and take all your friends
to get drinks, snacks- </joey>
<joey> - Secure the whole battleship. </joey>
<connor> - I only thought to myself </connor>
<connor> the amount of street
credit I'll get for this. </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> This is just an outstanding move I'll need </connor>
<connor> all the experience out
there and I was like, </connor>
<connor> Okay. Okay. </connor>
<connor> Okay. Bear in mind. </connor>
<connor> I have to say people
might've scored bullshit </connor>
<connor> on this whole thing, </connor>
<connor> but I was literally eight
hours a day addicted to Cod. </connor>
<connor> So straight up, like
made for me to do this. </connor>
<connor> So what I had was this was a
team death match tournament. </connor>
<joey> I remember this so vividly, </joey>
<joey> and team death mantra to kill them. </joey>
<joey> So what I would do is
I would ask my friends </joey>
<joey> to go around with riot
shields and Kaji replay, </joey>
<joey> don't kill anyone. </joey>
<joey> If you can trap them in a
corner, tell me where they are. </joey>
<joey> I'll come over and pop them in the head. </joey>
<connor> So what we would do is I coordinated- </connor>
<garnt> - The mafia.
- It was literally. </garnt>
<connor> - So you... </connor>
<garnt> What incentive did you give them </garnt>
<connor> to follow everything you said? </connor>
<connor> - Fucking nothing. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<garnt> I was keeping this all for myself. </garnt>
<joey> I never ever told them once
I was gonna help them do it. </joey>
<garnt> I was just like I'm just
gonna take the prizes </garnt>
<connor> and you guys can help
me and they were like </connor>
<connor> it sounds good. </connor>
<connor> - That sounds like a good deal. </connor>
<connor> - It actually is great. </connor>
<garnt> I do remember thinking... </garnt>
<garnt> So the Swedish dudes,
they had reason, right? </garnt>
<joey> I said I would join that team. </joey>
<joey> I did join that team and
we won a lot of tournaments </joey>
<joey> but yeah, there are a lot of
the other people who helped me </joey>
<connor> out. No incentive whatsoever. </connor>
<joey> I just wanted to have fun. </joey>
<joey> It was entertaining as a fact
to just go in and do this. </joey>
<joey> And I won some of these
tournaments on my own </joey>
<joey> but I was sweating my ass off. </joey>
<joey> Like I would have to really play my best. </joey>
<joey> And so I thought, why
do that when I can just </joey>
<joey> get it secured? </joey>
<joey> I mean, it's in the rules,
the rules against it. </joey>
<connor> I was like, why am I sweating </connor>
<connor> when I can just guarantee the W? </connor>
<connor> Like, so yeah, I did that. </connor>
<joey> And by that time that
they implemented a feature </joey>
<joey> where you could see a heat
map of what was happening. </joey>
<joey> People were starting to see
that it was like 75 kills </joey>
<connor> to me, zero, zero, zero,
zero with my teammates. </connor>
<connor> And people were like, </connor>
<connor> hmmmm, hmmmm,
- That's a little sauce. </connor>
<connor> - It doesn't seem like a normal
game of team death match. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> He got a nuke. </connor>
<connor> (Conner flexing his shoulder muscles) </connor>
<connor> And so what happened was is that </connor>
<connor> they wanted to make an example out of me. </connor>
<connor> And they were like, no more doing this. </connor>
<connor> No one else is allowed to do this. </connor>
<connor> We've banned this from happening. </connor>
<connor> And so they banned me from doing it. </connor>
<connor> And I remember I spoke to the other... </connor>
<connor> 'Cause there was like four of us </connor>
<connor> who won all of these tournaments. </connor>
<connor> And the other two were 30
year old men who worked </connor>
<connor> in construction companies and this is </connor>
<joey> all they would do in their free time. </joey>
<joey> And I felt bad for them. </joey>
<connor> 'Cause that was like a 15
year old kid being like </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna take the money
that you probably need. </connor>
<connor> I don't need this shit, I'm gonna take it. </connor>
<connor> - Well I thought they banned you </connor>
<connor> and then you kind of became that. </connor>
<connor> You were like V for Vendetta. </connor>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<joey> It was like I wanted to make a statement </joey>
<garnt> and I got banned for it, but
it was worth it to get the W. </garnt>
<connor> - Up to this day, I was like... </connor>
<joey> The one year after that
I was so fucking bitter </joey>
<joey> because I was like wasn't
in their fucking rules. </joey>
<joey> They just didn't make
an example out of me, </joey>
<joey> their website shut down five months after- </joey>
<joey> - Down with the government. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. The website fails five months </joey>
<joey> after I was like, yeah, fuck you. </joey>
<joey> - Wow. </joey>
<joey> - They emailed me like two
years later being like, </joey>
<joey> Hey could you fill out
those tax forms we sent you? </joey>
<joey> I'm like, I just never did. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, what are you gonna do? </joey>
<connor> I live in a different country. </connor>
<joey> What are you gonna do, sue me? </joey>
<connor> - They can't sue you for that. </connor>
<garnt> - I was 15 at that time. </garnt>
<garnt> - How legit was this website? </garnt>
<joey> - It was the official Call
of Duty website. It was... </joey>
<joey> - Oh okay. </joey>
<joey> - If you wanted to go and track your stats </joey>
<joey> you'd have to go and do this. </joey>
<garnt> And you would just get
10 pounds extra a year </garnt>
<connor> to get access to the tournament. </connor>
<garnt> - And you're that guy who just tries </garnt>
<connor> to cheat every system in life. </connor>
<connor> - Oh dude, yeah. Like... </connor>
<joey> - Over-optimize everything yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It's like, if there's like loopholes </joey>
<joey> or corners to be cut, I'll
just always find them. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause it's like, that's- </joey>
<joey> - You work smarter, right? </joey>
<joey> - Like why would I, work harder </joey>
<joey> when I can just do things easy? </joey>
<joey> I mean, that's what I want to do. </joey>
<joey> - That's what like every criminal says </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> - So it was... </joey>
<joey> I was not cheating, there was no rule </joey>
<connor> against what I was doing
and they fucking... </connor>
<connor> They banned me 'cause I was
too good at their own game. </connor>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<garnt> - I wasn't cheating, I was
just bending the rules. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah I was outsmarting-
- I was so sad. </joey>
<joey> - I was outsmarting the system. </joey>
<connor> - I'm so fucking sad 'cause like... </connor>
<connor> - You are now, I was
outsmarting the system. </connor>
<garnt> (all laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - The only thing... </connor>
<joey> The only truth. Okay. Too bad that iPad. </joey>
<joey> I got mad mileage out of that iPad. </joey>
<joey> That was worth the goal. </joey>
<joey> That iPad was worth-
- I can Imagine. </joey>
<connor> - Like $2,000 at the
time, so that was amazing. </connor>
<connor> And my mum was like, still
even after it was like, </connor>
<connor> Hmmmm, if you got an iPad,
you start to send dick pics </connor>
<joey> to somebody's Conner? </joey>
<joey> Is that how you got the iPad? </joey>
<garnt> - You selling drugs on the side? </garnt>
<joey> - Are you winning son? Are you winning? </joey>
<joey> - There was such a fun time. </joey>
<joey> That was great, that was so fun. </joey>
<joey> I love doing that 'cause
I just won so much. </joey>
<connor> I wish I won the good
stuff like the Jeeps. </connor>
<joey> - That dude, that would
have been a bad flex </joey>
<connor> if you wanna chill with </connor>
<connor> a Jeep at 16?
- I was just busy </connor>
<garnt> watching animated. </garnt>
<joey> - Yes I am, I was yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I remember the Jeep I
wasn't close to winning, </joey>
<connor> but there was one time
where they had quad bikes. </connor>
<connor> Like four quad bikes,
worth about 10 grand maybe. </connor>
<joey> I came fucking fourth and it was </joey>
<joey> for the top three and I came four by draw. </joey>
<joey> - Oh wow. </joey>
<joey> - So I'd drawn for it and I
didn't get it because of that. </joey>
<connor> I was so annoyed. </connor>
<connor> I was like, mum, I didn't
get the quad bikes. </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughing) </connor>
<connor> I can't believe it. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<garnt> - Would you even be able
to use the quad bikes? </garnt>
<connor> I suppose in Wales. </connor>
<connor> - In wales yeah you have plenty of people </connor>
<garnt> to sell them too. </garnt>
<garnt> I think like four out of
the 30 people in my class </garnt>
<connor> had quad bikes. </connor>
<connor> Like it's everyone had
quad bikes for some reason. </connor>
<joey> - Those were the guys who
like came in the top three. </joey>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> Man, see my quad. </joey>
<connor> - That's how they got it. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, that's how they got it. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<connor> - It was yeah, man. </connor>
<connor> I think it would have been problematic </connor>
<connor> if I got that though because
I'm not sure how much </connor>
<joey> my dad could have bull-shitted, </joey>
<joey> 'cause I imagine that
would have been a lot </joey>
<joey> more forms involved when
it came to a court plan. </joey>
<connor> Like UPS isn't just dropping
off a quad bike like- </connor>
<joey> - Holding his insurance
and everything right? </joey>
<connor> Yeah Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Did he ever find out
how you got those stuff? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. They knew. They were just </connor>
<connor> like the first few
tournaments that I said I won </connor>
<connor> they didn't believe me, until... </connor>
<connor> 'Cause all of the stuff to end
up at once, like these 20... </connor>
<connor> I think I won around
15 tournament's total. </connor>
<connor> And they all turned up at
the same day, the prizes. </connor>
<connor> And my mum was like in complete disbelief. </connor>
<connor> She was like, you weren't lying? </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> What is this? </connor>
<connor> - Wow. </connor>
<connor> - I wish I could get my mum onto a test. </connor>
<connor> She probably has a better
memory of it than me </connor>
<connor> 'cause I don't remember it very well. </connor>
<joey> - You are the epitome
of "I am winning dad". </joey>
<connor> - I literally was that
hyper competitive kid. </connor>
<connor> When I found something I
really liked, it was like, </connor>
<connor> I would get just insanely good at it. </connor>
<joey> - How I wish I could have
that, 'cause I like... </joey>
<connor> If I found something that I was... </connor>
<connor> 'Cause in that sense you're
very much like a perfectionist </connor>
<connor> with that kind of things. </connor>
<connor> I'm not like that, I'm just like, </connor>
<joey> if I'm good enough, then
that's good enough for me. </joey>
<joey> - I can never be like that. We stopped. </joey>
<garnt> But the problem is if
I don't have that drive </garnt>
<garnt> I kind of don't care about anything. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, because like for me- </garnt>
<connor> - It's so flirting . </connor>
<garnt> - For me when it comes gaming, I... </garnt>
<joey> In every kind of competitive game, </joey>
<joey> I always have this honeymoon period where </joey>
<joey> you're just learning the
game and it's just fun. </joey>
<joey> And then when you start playing ranks, </joey>
<joey> like ranked for the first few months, </joey>
<joey> I'm like yeah, this is pretty fun. </joey>
<connor> And then you get to
that you hit the ball... </connor>
<connor> You hit the wall, and that's for me </connor>
<connor> when it stops getting fun. </connor>
<connor> That stuff for me is
when it starts becoming </connor>
<joey> like a nine to five grind,
you know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> This is like, I'm not even
having fun grinding anymore. </joey>
<joey> This feels like another job. </joey>
<garnt> I'm getting angry for some
reason over a fucking video game. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughing) </garnt>
<connor> - Flashback. When I was in
my promos, I was close... </connor>
<joey> I was one game away from
being in master Tia at TFT. </joey>
<joey> And I'd only been playing it for a month, </joey>
<connor> and I was like, I'm gonna
be a fucking pro at TFT. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I'm actually gonna be a pro. </connor>
<connor> And then I got demoted and I just lost </connor>
<connor> all interest in the game. </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<joey> I was like to get better,
the amount of mind power </joey>
<joey> I'd have to like exert,
which will be too much. </joey>
<connor> I'm like, I can't do this. </connor>
<connor> You realize to get 10%
better, would take like </connor>
<joey> eight hours a day of playing. </joey>
<joey> It's like, I can't do it. </joey>
<connor> - It's not worth it.
- I can't do it. </connor>
<connor> - I'd rather be just like an average Joe </connor>
<joey> at like a lot of different things rather </joey>
<joey> than excel at like a couple of things. </joey>
<connor> - I think I'm the opposite. </connor>
<joey> I think that's what I've been. </joey>
<joey> I've been like really bad at
a lot of things in my life. </joey>
<joey> But the things that I
do, like you're like- </joey>
<joey> - Like you are really, really good at. </joey>
<connor> - 'Cause you are just super into it. </connor>
<connor> Normally when I'm into something </connor>
<connor> I rarely think about anything else. </connor>
<connor> It's like, I only wanna do this one thing </connor>
<connor> and I'm going to do it as much </connor>
<connor> as possible until I'm bored of it. </connor>
<connor> And then when I'm bored of it </connor>
<connor> I pretty much never come back to it. </connor>
<connor> It's weird. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughing) </connor>
<joey> - It's just the every episode, just like </joey>
<joey> the monkey brain
- I totally- </joey>
<joey> - Just gets like, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I know people look at it... </joey>
<joey> I know people, I already see some curse, </joey>
<joey> you're like Conner must be bullshitting. </joey>
<joey> One or two of the stories </joey>
<joey> I've like messed up the details and had to </joey>
<joey> like fucking elaborate,
like go a bit extra but, </joey>
<joey> - I guarantee that the stories </joey>
<connor> where I'm talking about chess and- </connor>
<joey> - I get, I see so many
people in the summer, </joey>
<connor> it'd be like Conner's </connor>
<connor> - He's bullshitting.
- Kind of </connor>
<connor> experienced too much. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, they're like he's bullshitting. </connor>
<joey> - No one human can experience
this much in his life. </joey>
<joey> - No, it's, it's normally the </joey>
<joey> the stupidest stories where I, you know, </joey>
<joey> maybe enjoy the details a bit more </joey>
<joey> to make it more entertaining. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah, of course. </joey>
<joey> - But the stories that I'm talking about </joey>
<joey> like that kind of stuff. </joey>
<garnt> Yeah. That was that legit happened. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> I mean. </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause like I don't
remember a lot of my life </garnt>
<connor> back at the time. </connor>
<garnt> Back like I think, there's just... </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know if it's like,
obviously not with you, </garnt>
<joey> but with Juju, do you have
a blank period in your life </joey>
<joey> where you just don't remember much </joey>
<garnt> of things that happened?
- Of high school. </garnt>
<joey> But that's just because I was doing drugs. </joey>
<joey> (Conner and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> If I'm to be frank with
you, that's exactly why. </joey>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<connor> - Are you keeping that
in? You want that in? </connor>
<connor> - I'm okay with that, I don't care. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<joey> It is the truth, I don't remember it. </joey>
<joey> - Because there was the time
when we were talking about </joey>
<joey> how you were getting into anime </joey>
<joey> and then I think you mentioned that... </joey>
<joey> But there's a reason Cory said what? </joey>
<joey> I just stopped watching anime or like, </joey>
<joey> was he jacking off? Is that
what he was insinuating? </joey>
<garnt> - Was he like selling his body for sex? </garnt>
<joey> Like what was it? It's
like, no, I was doing drugs. </joey>
<joey> I'm just to put it out there. </joey>
<joey> Not hard Drugs. </joey>
<joey> I just like to pinpoint that,
not hard drugs, but yeah. </joey>
<joey> That's the thing, right? </joey>
<joey> Like that's where I had
that blank of just like </joey>
<joey> I wasn't really doing
anything with my life. </joey>
<joey> And all I was really
doing was playing music </joey>
<joey> or playing games but not to the extent </joey>
<joey> that you are playing games, </joey>
<joey> I was just like on new grounds
playing the bullshittest, </joey>
<joey> dumbest fucking flash games
that have ever existed. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah I guess for me, the only thing </garnt>
<connor> I've been super invested
in is my career now, </connor>
<connor> which is YouTube, and I do
think of YouTube as a game. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, it's totally a game. </joey>
<joey> - It's totally a game of ad. </joey>
<joey> - It's pretty wide being able
to like, you know, I guess- </joey>
<joey> - Optimize it. </joey>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<joey> - I guess 'cause I don't know, </joey>
<connor> the way I see it is kind of like- </connor>
<joey> - You have fucking optimized
YouTube game though. </joey>
<connor> - I don't know.
- I feel. </connor>
<connor> - I think that there are many aspects </connor>
<connor> that it shares with a game, right? </connor>
<connor> Unfortunately.
- Yeah, yeah, of course. </connor>
<connor> - I mean there's still a
huge creative aspect of it </connor>
<connor> but I think there's ways to like iterate </connor>
<connor> on yourself that are very game-like. </connor>
<connor> - I feel like social media
in general is a game. </connor>
<connor> You look at something like
Twitter, where I think... </connor>
<connor> I remember I've watched this series </connor>
<connor> by this guy called Charlie Brooker, </connor>
<connor> he made a series called the </connor>
<connor> Top Most Influential
Video Games of All Time. </connor>
<connor> And he put number one was Twitter, </connor>
<connor> and at first I was like </connor>
<connor> what the fuck is he talking about? </connor>
<connor> Twitter isn't the game. </connor>
<connor> And then you think about it where like, </connor>
<connor> Oh yeah, you play an avatar
in line to affirm numbers, </connor>
<connor> and the more he gets into it
the more numbers you affirm, </connor>
<connor> and I'm just like, you know,
he's kind gotta a point, </connor>
<connor> 'cause like- </connor>
<connor> - Damn, he's right. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. Nobody really... </connor>
<connor> You're like playing a version of yourself </connor>
<garnt> but it's not like you don't
show all of yourself online. </garnt>
<garnt> No one ever does show themselves online. </garnt>
<joey> - You've got to optimize
every tweet you make. </joey>
<garnt> Should I rephrase it in this way? </garnt>
<joey> Is this funny thing to Tweet or? </joey>
<garnt> - I don't know how some
people can fucking tweet </garnt>
<garnt> like 50 tweets in a day. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't think I have 50 tweets, </garnt>
<garnt> like 50 thoughts in a
day, let alone like 15. </garnt>
<connor> - Remember when... </connor>
<connor> Do you ever get those moments? </connor>
<connor> You're like, Oh, I wanna
find that one funny tweet </connor>
<connor> from that account. </connor>
<connor> And then you're scrolling
and scrolling and scrolling. </connor>
<connor> You're like, Oh, it's
only been seven hours ago. </connor>
<connor> What the fuck? Stop tweeting. </connor>
<connor> You tweet too much. </connor>
<joey> - It's like how many? That's
the thing it's like... </joey>
<joey> Are you just that kind of person where </joey>
<connor> you just can't think about
the thought to yourself? </connor>
<joey> It's like I have to put
this out into the world. </joey>
<joey> - We'll, shall people
get like a fucking coffee </joey>
<joey> at Starbucks like </joey>
<joey> (Conner mimicking with his fingers) </joey>
<joey> I got us coffee from Starbucks, oh my God! </joey>
<joey> - Stay relatable. </joey>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> My God. Yeah, Twitter is a game </connor>
<joey> and it's a hard game, but I enjoy it. </joey>
<connor> - Damn, that's gonna be, fuck.... </connor>
<connor> I wanted to go an episode or two </connor>
<connor> I didn't tell a fucking
elaborate stupid long story </connor>
<connor> but I could pretty remember that I used </connor>
<joey> to fucking play Cod competitors. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughing) </joey>
<joey> I didn't even get to the
reason why I brought it up </joey>
<joey> but that's a story for another time. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, that's all right.
Well, we'll leave it </joey>
<connor> for the next episode. </connor>
<joey> Remember how this episode
was a power Japanese night? </joey>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </connor>
<connor> - Hey man, we spoke about
that long enough, Cod came up. </connor>
<garnt> - I think it was like I said
everything I wanted to say </garnt>
<garnt> about Japanese nightlife. </garnt>
<connor> - We'll come back to when
we've experienced more of it. </connor>
<joey> - I feel like there's so much
more of Japanese nightlife </joey>
<joey> We need.. </joey>
<connor> - We'll see that Trash Tastes
special in a soap blend. </connor>
<joey> We're gonna go. </joey>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<connor> If you don't know what a
soap blend is, it's a... </connor>
<garnt> - It's a place where
you get clean with soap. </garnt>
<garnt> - You have a service- </garnt>
<garnt> - You cleanse yourself- </garnt>
<garnt> - You have a service
and they don't advertise </garnt>
<garnt> which soap they use. </garnt>
<garnt> They advertise which women are doing it. </garnt>
<garnt> And you can fucking figure out </garnt>
<connor> why that's the case on your own. </connor>
<joey> - I would... </joey>
<connor> I was concerned with, well, what kind of </connor>
<connor> scrubbing method do they use? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah I was like, I
need to know the phrase, </joey>
<connor> is it grass-spread? </connor>
<joey> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </joey>
<garnt> - Do I bring my own loofa or
are they going to have one? </garnt>
<connor> - Do I need to bring a shower cap? </connor>
<garnt> - Do they use their own soap? </garnt>
<connor> Or I bring my, like my organics. </connor>
<garnt> - I have a whole gap
organic that I need to use. </garnt>
<connor> Meanwhile, the guy's
getting the hand job next </connor>
<connor> to me and I'm like, well,
that's kind of wooo. </connor>
<joey> - I'm not okay with the soap. </joey>
<joey> - I've never been to one by the way. </joey>
<joey> Just wanna make that very clear </joey>
<joey> before someone fucking assumes so, </joey>
<joey> and I'm sure you guys have in as well? </joey>
<joey> - No, no, no,
- Joey? Joey? Joey? </joey>
<connor> we definitely haven't. </connor>
<connor> (all laughing) </connor>
<connor> - He's implanting that
thought, so its like, has he? </connor>
<joey> - No, no. Please no. </joey>
<joey> (all laughing) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, but that's about
it for this episode. </joey>
<garnt> - That's a pretty good way to wrap it up. </garnt>
<joey> - But hey, check out these </joey>
<joey> amazing people on patron who support us. </joey>
