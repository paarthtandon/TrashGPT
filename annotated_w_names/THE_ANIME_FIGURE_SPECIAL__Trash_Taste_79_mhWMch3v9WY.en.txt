<SPEAKER_05> from the past special so if you don't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> know there are three videos on our own </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> respective channels where we went to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> akihabara and spent three thousand three </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> hundred and thirty three dollars each a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> total of ten thousand dollars between </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> the trash table which is where budget </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> which is where the clickbait comes from </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> we're like we're like we can stretch </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> this out to ten thousand dollars so we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> can put it on the video title </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and we have various challenges at those </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> stores that we can we hopefully </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> completed and we'll talk about on this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> episode of the podcast but we have no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> idea what each other bought we don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> know how many challenges we've completed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and uh yeah today is the day where we're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gonna find out we have an idea about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what the other boys did but if you want </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to find out now before you watch this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> then please go watch all of our videos </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or you can watch this first and then go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to watch the videos kind of like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> watching the avengers end game and then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> watching iron man either way either way </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> we'll either watch all of them </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> now or watch all of them after i would </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> say watch all of them before but that's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> just fine yeah but they're all up right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> now and they're all down in the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> description so check them out yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and also on our main channels not our </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> second channel yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so basically we're gonna just kind of i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> guess run through the products uh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there's also overarching challenges joey </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> do you have them all of the the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> challenges that aren't for the store </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> they're after they are they are on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> screen right now we're not going to read </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> them all out we've got 16 of them yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we have 16 of them but uh i think what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> some of the notable ones that we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> remember are like stuff like buying a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> figure closest to the price of 420 and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> also </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> as well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> of course of course </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i'll be honest i don't remember much of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> the other challenges i don't either so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's gonna be interesting yeah because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> by coincidence i remember </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like in the first tour i completely </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> forgot we had overarching challenges and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was only in the second store that i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> started to figure out well we we all try </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> to go for the 69 one right i think we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all try for the city </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah that was uh that was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> interesting it's a lot harder than i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> thought it was yeah so how did you boys </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> feel going into this challenge compared </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> to i mean my challenges that i got at </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> each store were way easier than last </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> year which is good so i think i i have a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> better chance this year </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's really up to you guys really i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think i think god though got like some </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> of the harder ones </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i just kept getting [ __ ] this year man </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> which is why i was just like you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> what i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm just gonna </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> content the first time that's how i felt </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> last year </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and this guy got an easy road again for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> the most part for the most part i think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> hard challenges i had to find a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a figure from an anime jerry had watched </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> do you know how hard that is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i had more like finding the the needle </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in the haystack </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like what are you what are you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this whole store full of anime and jerry </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> hasn't seen a single one i think uh it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was interesting though because we went </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> to four stores again this year um two of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> them were ones that we've been to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> previously which was a stop and army </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> army yes and then we had two brand new </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> ones which was rasheem bun and mandarake </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah and uh i think the new stores were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> definitely a challenge because uh yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it added some spice into the mix because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we didn't know what to expect so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> especially ending on mandarake it was so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> much risk came into what was in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mandarake because i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hadn't been to akihabara for about a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> good year yeah so i literally had no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ideas what would be in any of these </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> stores right yeah mandarake is truly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like the needle in the haystack store </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where like you go in it's it's the don </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> quixote of [ __ ] things i've found the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> coolest stuff in mandarake oh yeah you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> also don't find a lot of stuff in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> mandarake yeah it's it's either all so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> i'm glad we had some variations yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah exactly there was a store that sold </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> everything some stores that didn't sell </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> uh some stores that uh had a lot of loot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> stuff so that's good yeah yeah but i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mean i was i was kind of nervous kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> wasn't i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was weird because this time i wasn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> thinking about decorating as much as i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> was winning yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i was like i don't care about decorating </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> the office [ __ ] that yeah it's all about </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> winning by the way if you if you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> brand new to trash taste the the figures </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you see uh on the backseat are the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> stuff that we got last year yeah yeah so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so we only had a budget of 500 last time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and they got us all this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh so we like we we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> what was it six times yeah seven times </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the budget now six topics sex top with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> the budget i almost believe that the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> saying of like constraints make uh the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what did you say i was like i have sex </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> this man this man is the oldest one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> that's why i tried to not say that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> instead i said six times </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like i completely i think almost </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> having no limitations well there was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> limitations the money was you know but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> three thousand dollars is a lot yes more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> than one person will ever spend so i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> feel like having no limitation nearly on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what you could spend almost made it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> harder yeah yeah because you felt like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> okay i can buy literally anything now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah because before is that you would </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> see a 500 figure yeah and it was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> well i can't believe that was my budget </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah exactly right you can't buy it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> so i almost made it more interesting now </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> you look for them like the most </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> expensive figure in the store and you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like okay this is like a sizeable chunk </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in my budget but it's not i'm not going </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> to be dead in the water even if i buy it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah let's just say we didn't find a 3 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 300 figure </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> there was some stuff in mandarin </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> okay yes that was definitely like one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> figure would have gone our entire budget </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah but for the most part it definitely </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> felt like a big difference from last </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> year yeah to this year right because a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> lot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like it's it's a difference between like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> being a student and having like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> disposable income that's what it felt </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> like man you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just thinking about some of the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> figures i had to spend money on yeah i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no because i remember last year i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> remember going to a store like a stop i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> was looking at figures and like can't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> buy that can't buy that can't buy that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and now this time going into a stop i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> was like what can i buy let me just let </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> me just buy it all you know even the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> most exciting i'll take your entire </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> stock yeah and it was like i'll go i'll </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> take everything from here to here yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's like a dent in my body trash </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> taste season one versus trash day season </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> two the peasants versus the kings what's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> next it's like who can buy out all of a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> stop first </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i actually like got to a point </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> where we got to mandarake and i had </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> trouble finishing my budget yeah because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because there was like mandarake had </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> some really really cool [ __ ] but the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> really really cool [ __ ] was too </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> expensive yeah and then some of the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> mid-range stuff didn't even make up the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> budget i had left because originally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's like no in between yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> originally i thought uh we had three </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thousand dollars to spend </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um and then only halfway through did i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> realize oh no the entire budget was ten </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thousand dollars so technically it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> three thousand three hundred thirty </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> three dollars </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so i had to like make up 300 more which </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i didn't think i had in mandarake yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah um so yeah it was overall very </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> interesting yeah it's very tough yeah it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was it was a long day as well my god </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah it's definitely a long day for sure </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> it's great it was good fun though i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> really enjoyed it i really i really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> enjoyed it is it exhausting having to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> run around stores for hours a little bit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> but i it's not nothing i haven't done </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> before yeah in season one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> exactly i definitely felt a lot more </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> comfortable filming this one than i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> didn't see yeah you seem like you're </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like kind of digging it more yeah i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> remember i remember when we were all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> filming our intros i had to get away </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> from ghant because it was actually being </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> too loud like morgues now he's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> what's up guys it's me gigger </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you spend 24 hours </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> in russian </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> he's gotten too good we've created a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> monster he's just too good over youtube </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> flashback to season one occupies special </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> encounters like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how do i say [ __ ] without a script yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because i remember when we were filming </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> season one you boys had finished for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a good 10 minutes filming your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> intro yeah and i didn't think i'd even </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> started filming yeah because i'm like oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> cindy uh am i looking a girl yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> what </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> [Laughter] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> the glow up man it was it was it was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> great to see we all did a much better </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> job actually i think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i hope that came across in the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> videos yeah you know hopefully they look </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> better sound better and the energy's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there yeah yeah although most of the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> time i did get distracted and i was so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> focused on doing the things that i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> forgot to actually talk to the camera a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> lot of the time i was just so intently </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> focusing on finding these goddamn </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> figures that i didn't i didn't think to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> present right now i would like to hear </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even though you should go too long i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> would like to hear all of the the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> overarching challenges because oh sure </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i'm sure i think it'd be good for the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> viewers to know what challenges to keep </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in mind </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> can you stop reviewing so these are the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> ones that were separate so tell us how </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> much point you get from them as well </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> okay so one point to whoever spends the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> closest to three thousand three hundred </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and thirty three dollars and thirty </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> three cents to the budget uh one point </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to whoever buys the most expensive </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> single figure okay uh the one with the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> cheapest figure however loses one point </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> okay </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> figuring from the lowest rated mal </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> series gets one point okay uh the most </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> figurines bought overall gets one point </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uh most spent on one series gets one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> point most spent on a non-figure gets </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one point most spin in one store gets </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one point so there's lots of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> room room to wiggle okay uh as we said </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> earlier whoever spends the closest to 69 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on a single figure and whoever spends </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> closest to 420 on a single figure get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> one point each </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we're counting that as six thousand nine </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> hundred yen or four hundred and twenty </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thousand forty two thousand yen uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> figuring from the highest rated male </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> series however loses a point that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's the normie point you'll use </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> uh if anyone bought a hentai figure </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's a point because uh you know god </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> forbid you're going against you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> monetization i totally forgot i had that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> too </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh i've just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> remembered i bought </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i just said me too </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> let's just say someone got a point for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that uh one point to the most figures </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bought from an anime original movie oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> okay so you know any like shinkai movie </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> movie anything like that uh minus one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> point for every funko pop obviously yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh minus one point for every duplicate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> character anyone buys and minus two </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> points for every exact duplicate figure </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> anyone buys oh i see so we made that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> like stakes high because it's like you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know we might you know say for example </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> gan and i might buy and a stolfo figure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you would lose a point but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> joey's a massive stealth of course but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> there's like lots of the stuff i figures </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> right from like different makers so if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's the exact same which i don't think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> will happen honestly from the massive </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> budget we had then it's two points lost </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh and then the final one is if you fail </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> to spend at least a minimum of 50 000 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yen at a store or 500 you lose a point i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> think that was the one we were all kind </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of paying attention to yeah because i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> use that as like a good way to gauge </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> the rest of my budget yeah that would </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> encourage us not to hoard all our money </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> for one store yeah yeah exactly yeah and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh just just if we didn't make it clear </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how we are converting we got we're gonna </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> be saying everything in dollars </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but that's just basically taking the yen </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> price and dividing by a hundred i don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> it's not exactly right but yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's that's exclusive it's the closest </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you'll you can think of it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> i guess we should start with the first </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> store there yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> so the first store was slashing bun </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is what we wanted to go to last </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> year as well yes but unfortunately we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> couldn't get approved one time yeah this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> year since we knew we planned ahead yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah okay a huge huge shout out to uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> geeks plus for actually sorting this out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like last year last year uh melin sorted </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it out in like five days or something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> before we were going to film this time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we had they had a bit more time but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everything went smoothly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like like three weeks or something this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> time yeah we learned a lesson and like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> most of the stores a lot of stores we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> went to we got to like have free reign </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> over them without our customers which </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> was fun as [ __ ] yeah that shimbom was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> great especially because we got to go in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> before the store even opened so yeah so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> move whole floors to ourselves just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> going to legoland without anyone there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah like [ __ ] like awesome </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> younger means dream yeah honestly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you've you've lived out the dream </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> this is this is actually an actual dream </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right like this is the [ __ ] you wake up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as a kid being like i have infinite </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> budget to spend in this store and i can </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> buy anything </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> oh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you have to buy a figure that we </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> chose for you one of the stores gone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's great yeah yeah brilliant so do you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> guys remember what your challenges were </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for this store so yeah i've got two </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> challenges for this one i remember i got </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] immediately um so so we actually </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> actually knew what challenges were in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> trash taste good do we have trash taste </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> good is is he weird </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sorry i kept calling him </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> trashbox trash boxing so we actually </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> knew the challenges this time because we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> didn't know them last time and we picked </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> some easy challenges and some harder </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> challenges uh that would be harder to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> complete you just killed trashbox yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my god hillside </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and uh i started off with some of the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hardest challenges what were your </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> challenges got my challenge was one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> find an anime figure or find a figure </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> from a game that conor has played now i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> play a lot of games </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> now now normally this would be easy but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we're talking about akihabara yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> famous for selling anime figures and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe jrpg figures you know um a lot of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> japanese ips </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> uh it was basically games that connor is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> not so well in every store there was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> multiple games that i had played so if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you've got this in any store you've been </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> fine yeah yeah yeah did you pay </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> attention no there was a lot of time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that was just a big one there was a lot </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> of turn-based rpgs a lot of story-based </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> games yeah i went through </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> um and then my second chance challenge </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> was find the most expensive figure in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the store and uh buy it oh yeah that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right if these boys found a more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> expensive figure </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then you don't get the point then i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> don't get the points easy that's right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and what are your two challenges joey my </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> two challenges were fairly easy so my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> first one was buy a jojo figure and make </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the same pose and i mean you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> georgia figures it everywhere especially </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> so that wasn't easy given the second one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i had to kind of uh you know use my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thinking cap a little bit it was i had </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to buy a figure that can beat goku </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and i have to not only buy the figure </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but i have to convince these two boys </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> that this character can beat you and the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> audience you've got to talk </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> i think i figured it out though i think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> i figured it out i won't be easily </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> impressed in fact i might even be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> argumentative about it wow it's almost </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like i'm on trash </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my two challenges were buy a not anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> figure yeah which is very difficult </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is tough in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uh yeah it was uh because a lot of the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> games either had anime or animations and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i knew that you guys would be [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and that if i bought something that if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it wasn't anime but had some animation </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah you would give me [ __ ] right um and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there were shows that i thought didn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have animes that apparently are getting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> animes and i thought geez [ __ ] um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and the other one was uh just pick a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> figure blindfolded </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> oh wow okay so i just span around in one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> section so that one's not tough it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just it could end up very badly it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> didn't end up great okay </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> it didn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> we'll see okay we'll see then okay all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right so wait how many figures did you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> guys buy in lashing bun </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> three </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> three three all right same here three </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay we started things off like for me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> lashing man had so many good figures </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah right it had a lot of high quality </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> figures and aside from mandarake it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> actually had the most expensive figures </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that i could find yeah it did yeah which </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> uh [ __ ] me over obviously </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> well on that note then go on what is the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> what is the most expensive figure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay we'll go we'll go for that last oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> okay </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> okay so we don't know any of the figures </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> that each other bought i got glimpses of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one or two but i overall i don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what you guys purchased and i hope that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> you guys don't know what i bought not </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> gonna lie because russian was so early </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_05> the [ __ ] i bought it rushing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> well i only bought three so it's really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> easy for me at lashing bun like i spent </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> all of my time trying to complete my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> challenges right so i like i didn't even </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> consider the overall challenges i even </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> forgot that we had overall challenges </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because i was just trying to like i used </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> up all of my time completing every like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my all my challenges because i remember </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the store was like opening up the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> general public and i was like rushing to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> get my figures onto like are you rushing </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> um which was after perusing around to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> try and find the most expensive figure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was trying to find a figure from a game </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that conor has played well why don't you </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_02> figure yeah okay well which one do you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think it is okay well i'll tell the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> story because the figure is not actually </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that big right because because i had the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> most expensive figure challenge i tried </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to go on a budget at this point because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> it was the beginning of the day and so i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> look around i look around at what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> figures are available with dashing band </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_02> years ago </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i actually don't believe you how have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> you never mentioned this before because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> i didn't finish it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> well you've played it yeah i've played </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it you know the basic concept of it yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> why have we never talked about this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> because i didn't really like it that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> much </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> wait so you've owned the ps1 no no it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> on steam </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_05> life uh yeah when i was like 18. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it used to go on like steam sales all </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> oh my god wow that was literally the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> first figure i stole and i i know that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> was the first figure right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> if you bought that i didn't i didn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> beat it i didn't mean it i didn't read </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> it but you played it yeah it doesn't say </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you needed something oh true </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah so so like mostly i looked </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> around on the second floor and i didn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> notice that there were arc night figures </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> on the second floor until people were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> talking about it yeah i don't know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because i saw archives yeah i had such </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> little time that i spent so much time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> trying to buy the most expensive figure </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that i just like lost all my time so i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> didn't see any arc like figures um and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then i went downstairs because all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> basically all of the second floor were </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like expensive gaming figures which are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just like basically fate and final </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fantasy which i didn't know that you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> played all right so that would have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> played fate </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah i know i know i know you haven't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> played fakes </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_04> anime figures </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um and then i see i see a shelf </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's all persona and i was thinking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i was saying to myself </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i've been trying to convince connor to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> play persona for two [ __ ] years and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it has led up to this point and i was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> pissed that connor if you were a good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> friend you would have taken my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> recommendation and started playing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> persona 5 but no one time i played </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> persona your house for like 15 minutes </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_03> your game console history because like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that this made me question what your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> game console history was because i'm </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> point uh otherwise i would have got </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> something more expensive maybe you </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> joseph she's very top-heavy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> he's kind of like rohan where like you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> uh oh he's uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> let me have a look at this judge </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everyone jerry sets up this persona one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is quite the nice figure i wonder </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> why it's okay the thing with jojo </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> figures is i've learned basically a jojo </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> figure expert at this [ __ ] point um </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> jojo figures are weirdly expensive </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sometimes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i've bought some so there's a certain </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> line of jojo figures that i don't think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> are that impressive yeah they're </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> visually they're not that uh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> appealing i'd say </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and they're some of the most expensive </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> jojo figures as you'll see cause i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> actually bought some of them myself yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um it's weird and i don't really get it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> so i guess it's strange but this one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> normally when they're like this they're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> pretty good the ones that move for some </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> reason are like triple the price yeah so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you got like the shittier version of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> this and it moved it'd be 200 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> he's just like hi i'm uh oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm generic main character </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there we go there's someone around </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> my brain isn't working </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are we keeping all the figures bruh that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> costs 80 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> he's so top-heavy he's he's built like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> brick [ __ ] out he's joseph's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] joe star dude </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i gotta say he's holding glasses his </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> stand is very very big compared to the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> figure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the the uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the circumference of uh the stand is uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> very big </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there we go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who did you uh first romance in persona </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_05> all pretty all right they're all pretty </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> all right okay i'll do the jojo one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> first then all right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay oh jelly nice but look at the price </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's two hundred dollars for joy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> why did you bring a 200 figure of jolene </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> i didn't want to spend much money in the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> store and i wanted a figure and i needed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> one that would put me over my bud over </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> the 500 minutes oh this is a sass as </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> well they're usually like rather </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> expensive so these are the ones yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> super action uh statues that's the one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> you can move these ones are always so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> expensive and i don't think they look as </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> good as the others </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh and lie i think that jonathan one is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cooler than this jelly one yeah i mean i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> can i can take it out but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and this is opened and it's two hundred </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> dollars i don't know what this would be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> what makes them that like much price </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's the hype of part six the hyper part </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> six yeah i'm not entirely sure </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> there were a lot of expensive jojo </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> figures these are the expensive ones </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> like or that that figure line yes yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the sasses are very expensive the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> movable figure lines for some reason are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> quite expensive jojo uh maybe a figure </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> expert </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can tell me why out there i don't really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know maybe maybe it's more difficult to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> design figures that move it could be </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah there's also a lot of like movable </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> parts as well i think that's what it is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but like i feel like with removable </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> figures i feel like the static one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> static ones actually generally i've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> always said this i prefer static i i do </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> too i i i don't want to think about </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> posing it i don't yeah i despise the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> little pieces that you have with it that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you can't put anywhere where do i put </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> them i just i just with the essay this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> is i just don't like the the joints </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> having like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> exposed and then you look like it looks </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like an angel because like whatever pose </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you have you put with the movable </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> figures it's never going to be as cool </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one like this with like a static pose </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> maybe this one's cool because jolene it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> comes with like her extended hands </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh that's kind of cool </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i haven't seen that before so perhaps </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> this is quite a unique one because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> she has extended fingers here </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> but yeah i suppose two hundred dollars </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> though </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> god damn </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's that's a big span </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it's the same as this yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> sorry i know like i remember i remember </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> i thought like when i first walked into </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the store when i was doing like my most </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> expensive figure challenge i thought the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> most expensive figures was going to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> going to be around 200 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because that's what i could find at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> first um so knowing that that's 200 i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think uh yeah what's your most expensive </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> figure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we'll get to that oh my god he's [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> teasing us of course of course true </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> youtube needs a clickbait right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> so this is the second figure that i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> bought uh so this is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this is from one of my favorite artists </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yum </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so if you didn't know yamu did uh miru </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> tights and he has done the art for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> another anime that's coming out this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> season i believe which is uh gun buddy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> probably shouldn't have that on the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> screen for too long oh [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah oh okay i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> okay well i'm gonna i'm gonna keep it as </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> static as possible so mudan has an easy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> time censoring this we get it it's it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a it's a very hot figure um so let's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> let's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> see this out so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i didn't actually know that uh his </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> characters had figures </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> so when i saw this i've never seen that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> either actually yeah cause like i don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> do you count this as a hentai figure i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> don't really count this as a hentai i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> mean yomo is a hentai artist if it's not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> from an anime and it's inspired by like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> a hentai artist but he has he has made </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but he's made an anime mirror tights was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> an anime it is his anime and i think his </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ganbare doki chan yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i think that's the second one where it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like focuses </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> like the white glowy thing no it's not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> done choose carefully </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is it the white bars </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm taking this off now yeah that was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> two hundred dollars oh my god you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> so you've spent two two hundred dollars </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for it's totally that two two hundred </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> dollar figures yeah well i had to make </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sure i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> reached the 500 minimum i mean was that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> nothing you just wanted to buy out of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> like your own volition i was so focused </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on the challenges because i had one that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i struggled with which we'll discuss </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> right next time afterwards money will </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> span iso </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> you can take you can take that one home </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i'll take that one home [ __ ] yeah dude </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> all right gun what was your most </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> expensive figure that you purchased okay </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what was the most expensive figure that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you guys i don't know you know what you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> bring yours out and then if it happens </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to be more than the one that we found </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> then you get the point </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay well you know what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm going to go out and say </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> no no no no no no no no i know i didn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> get the most expensive figure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> so what was the most expensive figure </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> do you think are you saying that uh the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> amelia one was the most expensive one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that you found i thought it was that was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> seven hundred dollars that was seven </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hundred dollars yeah is it nice i found </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a more expensive one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> i actually took a photo of it just for </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> proof yeah in the meantime </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what the [ __ ] gone </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> all right that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gone that's not a figure where are we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> gonna display that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> you have to go through here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you have to go through here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> so obviously i had the most expensive </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> figure store and to tell the story of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this one as well so my first instinct </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was of course to go to the hentai </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> section because you know sydney aside </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sometimes the most expensive figures are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the hentai ones they are they are pricey </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> as we've said </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah as we've just established and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i saw some for like 150 dollars at first </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i was like oh that's pretty expensive </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 200 oh okay now now we'll get into the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> territory 250 all right 300 okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and then i went into the fate section </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> where dreams died because because of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> course i did where dreams are made where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> dreams are made by lawrence </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and holy [ __ ] i found so many good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> figures and like some of them and like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> as you're about to see with this one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i've bought </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like at which point do we not call it a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> figure and does it become a statue you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bring it on out i mean i see it in the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> corner of my eye but uh it's pretty fun </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> so oh my god </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> what the [ __ ] god where are we gonna put </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> that so i'm gonna kind of like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> can you even see me anymore over here hi </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> so i found a few fake figures i don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> know if you can even see me right now i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> can't hear you gone over the [ __ ] the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> monolith slab in front of you so i found </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> this for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> 500 and something bucks 150 dollars 550 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> dollars and i was just like there's no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> way </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i'm gonna either take it off the table </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> or open all right all right can uh can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can one of you guys open it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> someone's gonna i'm gonna need help </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> cracking that boy open it's literally </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like a fancy action board that's so cool </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> though oh that is pretty cool it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> actually like made of like felt yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay so i found that and i'm just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yes i have found the most expensive </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> figure in the store and it's a figure i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> want because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that that's not a figure because that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> looks [ __ ] amazing that's a statue </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that looks [ __ ] amazing and i'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i want this yeah and then i turn the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> corner and i see this amelia figure for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 700 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and i'm just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] my life </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i can't buy a 550 figure and a 730 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> figure at once so i was like the reason </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i almost ran out of time was because i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was just sitting there with both figures </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> next to each other being like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> do i go for the win do i go for the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> point or do i go for my heart </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and always the point </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and i looked at the emilia figure and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm just like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm not gonna i'm not gonna make the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> same mistake as subaru i'm gonna go [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> amelia i'm gonna go for the thing that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right in front of me and i chose the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fate figure and you know what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't regret a damn thing that is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> actually the coolest thing i've ever </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> seen though but you also wouldn't have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> got the point anyway if you went for the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> image yeah because uh i found one you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> see i think you should have looked a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> little harder in the hentai section okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because i found this one and it's uh 935 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what is that what is it what can i have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> a look at that </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> from uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is actually a game i've played </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and uh it's it's just like a witch girl </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that doesn't from this very 900 yeah but </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> it's from a very famous uh hentai game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's yeah 935 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's the photo </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> so yeah uh instead i um you went for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> your heart i went for my heart and i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just and i'm just like i respect that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and i'm just like um so guys so guys um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like if it's like a little too big for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the studio like uh what what are we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> doing for the figures </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_03> useless i don't know if you see how big </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> the studio is it's it's pretty big </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we can get a little pedestal through </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> behind </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you guys you guys aren't fake fans you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> guys aren't fake </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i think it looks cool </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is that enough </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> while they're still assembling this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> absolute </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> okay it's an absolute unit you want to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> get out your </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my one my second challenge was get a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> figure that could beat goku okay now i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> want you to think open-mindedly here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm gonna think very close-minded here </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bro [ __ ] you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> joey what is that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> so this is one of the few russian bun </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> figures that didn't come in a uh in a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> box </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it just came by itself </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> joe you've just bought goku </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i know i have not i've bought super </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> saiyan goku black actually you've bought </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> black goku </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i bought super saiyan goku black because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> canonically he does kill goku </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah but so is half of the [ __ ] cast </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> in dragon ball z so wouldn't you say </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that half of the cast in dragon ball z </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> can beat goku </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no he technically looks like he </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> literally fought goku and killed him </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that it means that he beat goku goku is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> fighting goku yeah so drac welcome to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> dragon ball super buddy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so without have having watched dragon </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ball super i know they go to like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> multiple universes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and i'm gonna guess that uh this comes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> from </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one of the multiple universes that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> right but the thing is right super </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> saiyan black goku goes to the other </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> universe yourself can beat yourself it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> not this is super saiyan black that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> goku right no it's super saiyan black oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> shoot he's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> wait what's the line again don't shoot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he isn't black oh yeah that's it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> but he is i don't know if you should get </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> a character that can beat goku he's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> literally a character that kills goku is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that not a character that can beat goku </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so would you say that majin buu is a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> character that can beat goku yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because he literally kills goku yeah but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> goku comes back and then beats margaret </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> have you maybe considered that goku </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> maybe isn't all that strong </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> [Music] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the mother joe joe </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what are you saying you can't say that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the [ __ ] dies like six times i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't think a guy who dies six times in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> his own show is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> considered strong so much and coming </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> back how does that ask toriyama okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> okay but can he beat goku now in the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> latest episode of dragon ball super </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> right because otherwise otherwise half </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of the characters in anime can be like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> child goku when he was a kid you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just because someone can beat him you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> are at some point </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> should have been more specific with the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> challenges in that case </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what do you think about this connor what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> do you think about this i literally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> searched up characters that have killed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> goku and he was the first one that came </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> up and i literally saw perfectly the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> exact same form as well of when he this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is the hand that took goku's life right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> here i think it's [ __ ] but it's alright </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you can have the [ __ ] point thank you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> all right thank you i don't know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> honestly my kindness dude if this wasn't </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_03> time uh i spent 674 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> dollars all right the next store is a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> stop and uh this is the one that we went </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to last time and it was a fan favorite </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> dare i say because it's quite visually </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> appealing yeah it's really cool really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> interesting store </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> tons of figures and you really do have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to look yeah so i hope you guys spent a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> lot of money or bought a lot of figures </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> i know i bought quite a lot of things </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i think i bought like in terms of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> pure number um </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i think it's either a stop or army army </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i bought the most figures i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> actually didn't buy a lot oh really okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so first of all what were your </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> challenges okay so my two challenges </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> were </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh mine was one to buy a female figure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and two to bide a lewd figure which is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> great pretty easy so i could get two </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> figures in one and i guess i'll start </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> off </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> shop </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my figure first i believe this is it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> um so i i actually like this was this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was the first time that i actually tried </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to be tactical about what i bought um </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for once in your life yeah in lashing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> once again you know we had riaz like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> last year and this time we actually came </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in for the clutch yeah this time we had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the fake figure where you know what it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> didn't matter i it didn't matter about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the game i just followed my heart </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all right so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> this was the lude figure that i bought </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um so mudan gets ready to censor this uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because i'm not sure i can't remember </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how lude it is i don't think it's hentai </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> level loot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh but it is definitely lewds </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh and it is that girl </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> from </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i can't remember she's just gone i think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh it's from um </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no no no it's a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> boring girlfriend uh what's oh cycano </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> psychonauts yeah that's the one uh so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah it's that girl from cycling yeah do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you want me to point this towards the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> camera uh the reason the reason there's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a lot of panty the reason </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> there is there's a lot of a lot of panty </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and from one angle it's safe </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and i mean she's uh she's not putting on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thigh highs but uh she is putting on her </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> socks right and so the reason i bought </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this one was because it was a female </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> figure </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a lewd figure and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was very very close to 420. i'm not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> gonna reveal how much this was okay okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> just because i know youtube bought some </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> other ones but uh yeah well we'll reveal </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> those at the end but i will say it is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> close to 420. oh okay so that's that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> around 520 for that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah what what did go into the mahogany </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> wood what's going on here i mean kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> stuff is pretty expensive cyclone itself </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> is pretty expensive and i'm not sure why </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like i feel like it's just i i was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> surprised that this one cost this much </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> right it's just like weirdly popular in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> japan for some reason i don't know why </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but like i i decided to i have no idea </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> why yeah i decided to go for it because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> i couldn't like looking back i couldn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> find many figures that were close to the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 420 mark yeah so i like i saw this one i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> was like this one's close-ish so let's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> just go for this one and see where it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> takes right right all right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> joey watch which okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> my ones were uh the first one was get a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fist of the north star figure </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which was perfect because this is all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> styles like one of my favorite manga </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> series of all time you were so lucky to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> get this one in um a stop because you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> would have any other star would have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> been [ __ ] if you're like it's maybe </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like a stop and maybe mandarakey </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no way we chose this one because we know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we knew it could be completed if like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the right circumstances were exactly but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like because it's such an old series </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's rare to find yeah any figures it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> just rare in general to find anything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> fistful of the north star related yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah but i got one you asked did you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> actually hell yeah i did god [ __ ] it not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> only that i i got a twofer ladies and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> gentlemen i got a two for one two for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> one i got two for one i not only got my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> boy kenshiro but i also got </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> da or as well as a combo set look at </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that oh my god how much were they </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> these yeah these were uh if i remember </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> correctly it wasn't actually that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> expensive this one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> uh these were i think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 148 dollars oh together together </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah it's actually not bad at all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> actually i think no no no no i think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this was actually the cheapest one i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> think this was 25 dollars </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's pretty cool yeah for for a two i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> mean you know these are like kind of i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mean they weren't in box for one yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> but it was a two for one so you you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> line it up like that that's pretty sick </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> hell yeah boys the boys are back in town </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> let's go </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i'll just show one off that i go yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah go for it oh my gosh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> pretty cool </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> looking mm-hmm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> jotaro figure oh nice oh okay from like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> the 90s ova oh yeah oh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> i've never really seen i love the dangly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> bits actually yeah i've never seen it in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the 60s </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i wanted more on the set and i thought </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is really [ __ ] cool because it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> must have been modeled after the old 90s </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> because like jojo doesn't use a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> scarf thing in the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> in the new one no i'm so glad i didn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> get any jojo figures because otherwise </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'd be losing points left and right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> right now i'm glad you didn't get joseph </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> but also why does he look more like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> lupin </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> oh a little bit a little bit yeah yeah i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> mean i just think it was sick i think it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> was um not that much as well remember </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> correctly the problem with a stop is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> that you can't actually see which ones </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they were that's right yeah so i have to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> remember we don't know how much you want </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i have to remember it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> i remember this one was quite cheap it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was like 2 000 4000 no more than that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like okay yeah pretty good uh what else </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> do i've got yeah so after i got uh after </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i've completed as many challenges as i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> could i basically just you know oh this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> also completes one of my challenges but </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_02> was like if not enough had been made uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> these were pretty cheap they were about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in the ten dollar range yeah i could </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> tell yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and i mean you know you know i just uh i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just wanted to pump pump the figure </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> numbers up with uh some girls that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hadn't been on the uh shelf yet </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> okay i bought uh two other ones that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> weren't a challenge so the first one i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> got was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> mitsuha from kimono noah ah okay [ __ ] i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> didn't see that one yeah and because one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of the challenges is get a figure that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is from an anime movie original yeah so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's one point for me this was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> actually the most expensive this was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> 258. was that wait was it get the most </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> anime figures from the movie original </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was it no no just one i think oh i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> thought we had that challenge </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> was it the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you should double check i'm pretty sure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> get the most and i think there's one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> from an anime original movie oh wait it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> was get one yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> those two movie challenges right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh yeah most figures bought from an </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> anime original movie what have they done </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> oh my god </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> well i figured you know it was going to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> be kind of difficult to find figures of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> anime original movies because they are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> quite rare i mean the fact that this is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 258 says that this is pretty rare why is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it so expensive because i've i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> personally have never seen a yacht </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i've never i didn't even know they made </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you mean either </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> if we do if we're doing anime original </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> figures i will pick up my other one sure </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_03> actually because i saw two one was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> pretty expensive and one was i actually </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> have both the these and hindroids from </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> uh premiere actually they're really nice </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> uh how much is this one oh this one was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uh 59 dollars that's not too bad yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which like i feel like anime original </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> figures are hard to find uh so they're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> normally like pretty expensive </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what did you get connor </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_05> like they've got a nicer build quality </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> in some ways mm-hmm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is cause it's because like it was </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_02> figures that i've heard about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh yeah yeah yeah so when i was lining </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> up at a stop there was a dude in front </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of me it's in my video as well but there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was a dude in front of me in like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> full-on business so it was like a proper </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> japanese salary man and uh i overheard </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and i thought i thought i doubted myself </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for a second i overheard the words </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kirito </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and 600 thousand yen </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i thought </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which is six thousand dollars six </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thousand dollars </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and i was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> excuse me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that that can't be right did you get a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> glimpse i leaned in closer no i think he </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> ordered it in bulk at asoc because i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> think there was just too many and then i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> found out as i was you know he left and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as i was checking out and you know i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> talked to the dude i was like so uh the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> guy the guy before me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> what what did he buy if you don't mind </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> me asking and he said oh he bought six </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thousand dollars worth of kirito figures </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> they do exist and i was like oh my god </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> they actually exist </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> these types of waves exist so he </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> literally went into the store and said </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i'll take your entire team [ __ ] your </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> entire story </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> kirito figures who's buying six thousand </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> dollars worth of kirito for that dude he </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was probably like in his maybe mid 30s </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just buying like i think he bought like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 13 or 14 kirito figures like so many </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that he didn't even like bother bringing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> them up he i think he just gave them the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> paper and said just send it to me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> oh my dropped his money and they just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> left is this like an investment is is is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> he like is this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like a kirito </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_05> this guy it was insane a big fan you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> know i guess so all right boys what </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> challenges did you have at amiami so for </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> army army we have three challenges </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because uh we yeah we just want to make </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> it a little spicy yeah yeah we thought </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> that we could spend a lot of money there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah and and we did we uh this was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> probably going to be the longest segment </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yet because we bought a lot of figures </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so my one were fairly varied my one was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> get a figure that's american uh buy a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wall scroll and buy an incestuous series </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and shout i love incest while holding it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uh now for the incestuous one i'm gonna </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have to finish that here because i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> didn't have enough time to actually grab </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it and shout it because literally the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> moment i picked it up sounds really </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_05> joke i'd like i'd like to at least get </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> half one because i did buy i did finish </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_02> you can say that i get the point for the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] uh humans on the eyeball no no </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> gave you the half a point for the year </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> no because the exact same vein no it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> not yes it is </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_01> old it is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> figure series it literally says it on </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> the [ __ ] box </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i need to know connor why did you choose </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that figure there was so many ava </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> figures there because all of them look </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so boring what about the bna one that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> you said you were gonna buy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah i found out that because we </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> literally did a video this year on the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> netflix yeah then i went to my calendar </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and we actually filmed that in like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> december oh really so god damn so gant </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> loses one point and i get nothing cause </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> i lost the point i gained oh we both no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> no you both lose the point both lose the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> point yeah and then i get the point for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> now you don't get the point i only lose </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> the point if i get the point because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you'd have to admit that it's an eva for </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> me to lose the point to begin </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with so what i'm saying is right if you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> agree that means it's either you lose no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> points or you lose two points no it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> either i lose no points or god gets a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> point </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> no i don't get any points he doesn't get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> any points i just don't lose a point </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah so then i get a point you know what </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you're losing the point if you if you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> admit that you lose a point you're </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> admitting this is an evangelion i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> going crazy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> this isn't this isn't okay okay you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what you know what i'd rather i'd rather </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not admit that that's the evangelion </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then admit that we got the same figure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'll tell you what yeah so doesn't lose </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> any points and you don't lose any points </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> how's that we're we're exactly where we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] start so so both of you have </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_04> was too perfect what is this so these </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> are like buildable i guess like like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> lucky boxes for a mogus character yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> it's among us it's a mongoose gacha </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> can we get the boxes off the table </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> luckily none of these are the red the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> red amongst yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> so does it count is it the same </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> character i don't know does it count </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> because none of them are red well let's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> open them up and find out who is uh no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> from the same series none of these are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> red though </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh yeah he's from the same series yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> but you've bought how many series from </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> jojo yeah yeah only one set of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> duplicates </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah but that that was only one set </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> right because it was yes so so you so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if i'm counting this is one yeah yeah so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> you guys you got the humongous guy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's literally a character no no i got </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> i got the red among them because they're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> not they're not different they're all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> the same </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> there's the white </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> one there's the purple the green the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> black the white and the red glow in the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> dark they're all the same characters </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> look look look they're just different </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> costumes it's the same color when you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> voting for someone to get off right well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> dude it's the same it's a different </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> costume it's the same character yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> we've already established we both lose a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> point and i get a point because it's ava </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> no no no no no we've established that we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> both don't lose a point </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he has not bought a red among us </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> character you can see there you can see </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> on the [ __ ] box they are the same </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> characters when you vote someone after </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> you go the among us character no you say </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> reddit sas connor you don't go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> among us </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> you got reddit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] purple </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> what's their name it's red well it's a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> crew mate it's red he's a crew it's a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> red crewmate it's a red crew mate yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> and that's a crew mate it's a red </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> crewmate they're both the same because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> this is the green logic joey's probably </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bought like 15 duplicates here no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because i'm counting this as one because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it came in one box </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> well if you open them all up how many </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> characters are there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> five yeah so you have five duplicates no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because this is one all right well you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> can either take the five minus points or </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> you can take the one minus points here </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i am going to argue this till the day i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> die if there was a red among us </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> character i will happily take the l yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i agree if there was a red among his </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> character i'd be like joey yeah we got </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> the same </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> character because i literally </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i literally tried like i literally like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> predicted maybe one of these character </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> maybe one of these guys will buy an </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> among us character right so i was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so i was like which i actually had to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> pick one that i thought the guys </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> wouldn't actually buy so i picked red </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah and luckily there's no real well it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sucks that you both got the crewmates so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it doesn't matter anyway you both lost </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> the point in the end that's a red </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> crewmate and there isn't a point off of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> them both </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> audience what do you think audience what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> most definitely going to say </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> what is this under the contention </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> ashley isn't this the stupidest [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> your honor your honor i object </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> you object you can't you will look like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> clowns </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you both lose one point oh my god </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> there's no doubt about it all right i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> actually bought a b stars figure because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i wanted to take it away from connor </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> just in case i bought as well hell yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no no not not now like in my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> in my personal life </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> don't tell me that you're like oh that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the one i bought joe </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i i pre-ordered this before it came out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> oh okay yeah yeah it's really yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because i was looking around and i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> just like well i've got all my points </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> let's try it let's try to [ __ ] over um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> so you know it didn't matter in the end </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> anyway yeah it didn't matter hell yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's it's such a nice figure as well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> did you even watch peace stars this year </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> though uh yeah season two i did okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah so yes that did you take one point </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> off of them actually uh it's under </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> contention </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we're having points on the contention </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> this year what the [ __ ] take it off for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> them no no it's under contention this is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> not under under what what the court of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> the clowns what the [ __ ] you know the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> court of the law </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> the court among us the court of among us </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> the court of the sus </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> i'm sorry i'm sorry but if we're going </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> far by among us laws then the majority </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> wins right it's by major majority votes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> so therefore therefore you would have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you would have been voted out if you're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> both in agreement you can't just both </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> keep making up rules and then say we </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> have the majority </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we're not making overalls that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> literally what you just did we did an </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> emergency meeting we voted and we voted </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> that your opinion was voted off because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you're in the same game the same figure </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and the same characters so they voted </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> the same character are you colorblind </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the same character </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there is not none of these look like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this character they literally look the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> exact same none of these they're all the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> crew members they're literally the same </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> character i can't believe this is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they're the same character how can like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> six of them go around at the same time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> they're all wearing different costumes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> gone </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because why because they're all the same </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> characters because they're different </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> characters johanna no they're wearing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what do you think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are you telling me they're all clones or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yes they are lit that is literally the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> point of the thing is that you can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> change color because there is no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> distinction between them because they </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> are the same character </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> what if what if this guy's name is gary </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and this guy's name is greg it's not </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> well how do we know have you have you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> looked into amongst them at all yes they </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> don't have any names they're all the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> same character </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so every fact so all among us characters </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are just clones of each other yes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i like to hear your opinions among us </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fans uh anyone who's uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> knows anything about among us law i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> think can back us up that uh these are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> all different characters </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> all right bring out the uh what else is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> in my box </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what else have i got i'm i'm just gonna </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> keep bringing that [ __ ] out so the other </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> it's it's okay altar the [ __ ] is this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> what is this it's okay someone's the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> best looking fate some sometimes you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> roll for a character and uh you are </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> unfortunately oh it's from fate yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah yeah later </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> it talks to alter those the best </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> character from honestly this this is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in terms of like her ranking in terms of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gameplay it's like it's it's not the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> best but in terms of [ __ ] design holy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] this is one of my favorite designs </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i agree and if you bought this you would </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have got a point joey because i don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> own her i tried tried rolling for her </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> did not get her um well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we'll we'll find out about that later </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that was in monroe i was in monday yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and that's and that's why you know if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you can't if sometimes you roll for a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gacha and you don't get it so sometimes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you go out your way and you own them </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> physically and that's uh that's what i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> did okay okay so my biggest challenge at </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> army army was to get a figure of a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> character that is american </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> okay now i had to double check here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it didn't say anime character it just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> said character right because admittedly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there isn't a whole lot of american </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> anime characters there's a few there's a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> few like that guy from yugioh yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> there's a few but definitely not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> famous enough to make a figure out of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah right but luckily i i checked with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the staff and i said okay does it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> necessarily have to be anime it doesn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> say it needs to be anime so as long as </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's an american and you guys have no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> problems with it being an american then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i thought it was okay right so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i got </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> probably one of the most american people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ever </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> lebron james </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> why is there a lebron james </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> what american you can't argue it's a </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> i don't know because it's not going to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> give me any points or anything but oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's alter okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> look at that octa ultra dude </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> damn </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> making me so sad i now know that you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> don't own her </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so this is the bike and yeah it's a big </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> box yeah i bought this because i well i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> was going to buy this because it was 600 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and i thought at the time i'm i'm i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like i was very confident the time that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was the most expensive figure i don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know if you guys bought another one yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i still you know from all the stores so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> far i think it is i think so far yeah so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the reason why i bought the other figure </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> was to try and secure the challenge of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> spending the most on one series yeah how </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> much how much was this bike </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> 600 600 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> oh my god it's like a whole mic it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like a full-on operation oh my god look </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> at that this is not a podcast episode </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> anymore this is just an unboxing yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i like how we've just made a glorified </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> unboxing episode and uh audio aliens are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> gonna be so confused yeah if you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> watching if you're if you've come this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> far oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> lord </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so cool </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yo i can only get so erect dog </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that's amazing oh it moves holy [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that is so cool </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> holy [ __ ] i hope you can [ __ ] put it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> on the set </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah that's like canada </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i hope i hope you can put canada on that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> god damn that looks good that is so cool </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> again that's not that that supersedes a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> figure i think that's yeah that's just a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> statue </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh dude i really hope you can get him to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> sit on it so the main so the main reason </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> i wanted to get it was because i was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> near certain that yeah it did indeed </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> i mean that's impressive but look at my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> boiler </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> clean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> look at that physique that perfect </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> physique oh look at that look at that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> that's so cool so i wonder why it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> doesn't really stand up very well i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> think in even in the the movie it kind </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of leans when it stands yeah but like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like that i think i think it needs </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to stand on the side right the boys are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> low right yeah the set though i thought </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that would look sick behind us yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> having you know a one to sixth scale of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> the bike i just thought you can't say no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> to that yeah that that's sick you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> what that legitimately looks amazing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah uh worth wasting two points for um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> so yeah i agree you know what i ain't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> even mad i lost two points because we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> got that yeah we got that in the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_02> joe i didn't know you were a hatsune </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> miku fan what can i say i like anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> we've gotten to the point where the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> figures we've bought we buy are so big </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that it's actually blocking us yeah uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> so i'm not gonna unbox this but this is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> the memorial dress uh hatsune miku </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah that one is also the one that is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> closest to 420 for me okay we'll we'll </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so we'll uh well funny enough the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> one of the things i have left is the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> closest to 420 for me oh nice oh okay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> all right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> i don't know what the [ __ ] this is pull </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> it out it happened to be so close to 420 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> what the [ __ ] is that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> [Applause] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> thank god i do not know what this is uh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> this is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> megazone23 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't know what that is i'm guessing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like a super obscure yeah it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> probably a super old makeup show </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where will i get it destroyed for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> calling this a transformer because it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> kind of looks like a transformer </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so i'm guessing this is some very og </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> isn't garland like a different character </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from a different show yeah it's final </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> fantasy right i'm guessing it's rare or </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> something because it's 420 i think it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> like i think i think just looking at the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> font of the show name it looks like an </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> old show uh in like the mech section of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> me oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like that's what it looks like so i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> guess yeah i don't want to be here all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> day opening for you guys yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah so yeah we'll just take that off </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> stream good stuff that's my closest i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> have one more uh how many do you have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> left i'm done would you want to go first </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i just went </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay um so uh oh you go first because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> this one's a hentai thing right well i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> thought my last challenge was get </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> something from an anime </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that the boys haven't watched okay </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and what better than an anime that isn't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> even out yet because there's no possible </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> way you could have watched it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> nice </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> arc nights and i i was i was running </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> around the store and i thought there was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> a few hasn't it been </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah it's been announced announced yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you haven't watched it we haven't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> watched it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no one's seen it nobody's seen it except </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for the people working on it so i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thought perfect and and you know me and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> joey like arc knights i do i still play </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't play it you didn't get the chin </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one though </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> see i i went for the more expensive one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> uh okay but the children was i know you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like that i i like chen more yeah why is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the four star no she is she is five </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> stars she's literally the first unit you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> get yeah she's she's kind of repeating </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> she's yeah yeah she's literally the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> default unit yeah i don't even know how </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> to open her her like final e2 is like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> obvious [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i'm sorry if you don't play arc </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> knights yeah well so this is the main </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> character from arc knights i'm guessing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> she'll be in the anime as well i think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> she'll be the main goal in the app yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> um yeah that's so nice though because i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> have uh i've seen the nendoroids of army </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i don't like nendoroids </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i like nanderoids but i i really like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the nendoroids for armia but like a full </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> figurine of that i actually might </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> i actually might go and buy this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like it's actually it's actually so nice </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if there's one thing arc knights does </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> absolutely amazingly it's character </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> design yeah yeah i think i think there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> is there is no better game that can do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> better character design and it's [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> so cool </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like i've been looking i've been eyeing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> up some arc night figures that haven't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> been released yet yeah um like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> the e3 one that's coming out looks </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] amazing </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_04> visibly like striking on the thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because yeah none of this [ __ ] can fit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> on the desk </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or there </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> i don't know i don't know you can fit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> this thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we can't show that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's so funny </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> let's go to the next store all right but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> last and certainly not least is the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> final store mandarake yep it's brand new </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> i i think we tried to go to mandaraki </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> last year we just didn't have enough </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> time to get yeah this year we finally </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> got it it is an absolute [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> smorgasbord of just random </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> shimorgas board of random [ __ ] in there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i was like really excited to go to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mandarake because like we always when we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> go to akihabara or anywhere on mandarake </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is we always got to hit up that store </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it's literally a lottery because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you never know what you can find you can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> find some of the coolest [ __ ] and then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> sometimes you go on the ship you go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> there and you find some of the dumbest </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] right so it was like how did you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> guys feel going into mandarake do you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> feel like you had enough budget uh i had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> more than enough budget in fact i had to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> make sure i got as close to three three </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> three three as possible in mandaraki </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which is like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] impossible yeah i have like 500 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> bucks left yeah oh really yeah i had </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> like nothing left i had like 500 bucks </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just to meet the criteria i mean you did </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> spend a [ __ ] on it i had to go to i mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> actually take stuff out oh that i could </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was able to spend five hundred dollars </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> at mondragon oh [ __ ] yeah okay i still </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> wanted to get quite a lot of things yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah uh let's go uh what was it so we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> had one challenge for monday yeah mine </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was to buy a figure from a show that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> you'd all watched mine was to buy a fate </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> figure that gantt hasn't pulled for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> or doesn't have yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh mine was to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> uh ask the store clerk for an </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> recommendation recommendation </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> um yeah i'm just gonna lose a point </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> right away yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> how many do you how many deals </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> do you have i'm not gonna lie i totally </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> forgot that we were doing duplicate </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> characters i thought it was only </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> duplicate figures no no no that's extra </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> extra we've learned the hard way about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> duplicate characters and figures how </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> many points have you lost well i i lost </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> two points now to dx yeah he has because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> he has four drops so i've lost wait does </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he have four diodes yeah he bought three </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at a stop yeah does does the deal and uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> does dio and jonathan one count yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's still d all right would it count </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> i mean it's like a duo i don't know no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> no no dio's there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> zio is clearly there it's not like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> spirit of deals so i've lost a total of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> two points because of my do buying </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> obsession because your love for deer </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> well the reason i actually bought this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> one was because i wanted to get as close </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as possible uh to the uh number and this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is one of them that i chose again i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> totally forgot about um the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the duplicate the duplicate thing yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i ended up buying this but i mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's a lot to keep track of but i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> also got very very close to the uh three </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> thousand three hundred and thirty three </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay nice nice all right so my one uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that i had to buy a fgo character that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> god doesn't have on fgo </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> now uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm not gonna lie it's been way too long </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> since uh i played fgo myself </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah so tell me your thought process on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> this because like my thought process was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> okay i knew all of the basic characters </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that you get at fgr yeah like the ones </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that are just like guaranteed so those </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> were cl obviously out of the window yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay i thought all right i i talked </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> about it with knobby my cameraman yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> he was like an fgo expert and we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> basically made it yeah we we basically </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like did a hypothesis on what might he </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> not have i feel like you were really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> lucky getting nabi as a cameraman </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because if conor got it yeah he would </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> have been he would have [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> he would have just had to pick the fake </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> character yeah so i i had the choice </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> because i wanted to get as close to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> three three through three as possible </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i had the choice to either buy a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> shitload of fate nenderoids </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [Laughter] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and just hope just hope that you don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have one of them right or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i just go big and go hard on one figure </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to get as close as possible i hope you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> went big and went harder i went big and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> went higher okay what did you get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i have i have a backup so i i bought two </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> fake ones okay okay so the first one i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> bought because i'm not too confident </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> right do you have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> ishtar </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i got spaceshi </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> no archer archer ishtar do you have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> archer ishtar ah so you have the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> character ishtar i'd say you have ishtar </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's it's it's different it's like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> goku black [ __ ] again no no no no no no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> no no no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's very different in fgo it's very </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> different okay but that's okay that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> okay you can think about that because i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> have enough </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> do you have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> gray </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no yes let's go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> hell yeah navi oh my god okay because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> this was the big gamble for me because i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> was like i found gray in the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> corner like the back corner the [ __ ] is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that what is he what is he the grey is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> like the like a grim reaper uh what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> class is it uh zep rails airplane </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_02> was like this is a recent character </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> isn't it he was like yes and i'm like he </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hasn't been playing that heavily </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> recently so there might be a chance but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i was so scared because this cost 160 </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_05> like all balls no brain on this can we </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> get this out of the box can uh yeah </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_02> deserves although yeah although he had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like the biggest cheat sheet of all time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i might imagine having navi as a chichi </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that for that challenge yeah what would </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you have done if you got that challenge </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> tell him you know price price is an </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> issue and he was just like um so you </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> one of the first figures i got at the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> store </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um so obviously with with a random guy </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_02> probably the most voluptuous one yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just a normal looking one piece for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> you yeah it doesn't look like anything </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> exceptional </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean compared to like getting like one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> of the male characters yeah </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_03> normally like if it's a building one the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> back has you should lose the backers </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_03> are so many hentai figures that come in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> boxes that uh are just blank they don't </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_02> he's my favorite fortnite character dude </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah some some stuff i bought just to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> pad out the number just to get as close </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> to uh yeah it's a question how much did </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you guys do like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> small scale adjustments to get to the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> phone okay so the the difficult thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> about mandarake </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> is that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> some price tags had tax on it and some </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> price tags didn't right so trying to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> calculate if the price you were getting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was actually like with tax or without </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> tax was like [ __ ] insane see because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just completely coincidentally i thought </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i was gonna have to do that when i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bought my three figures yeah but then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when i calculated everything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i literally couldn't it was that it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that close i really yeah i actually like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> completely coincidentally i got insanely </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> close to three three three three i hope </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as closer </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> than you two what's your cheapest figure </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> by the way gone </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> the pikachu because i've got an even </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cheaper one have you actually 100 yen no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] way oh you just lost the point </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> there you've lost another point i lost a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> point to gain a point </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i thought for sure the pikachu would </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have lost him a point i i was so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> confident that i would get the exact </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> amount that i had well no no he yeah he </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> hasn't what what was i bought for 100 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> yen so what was 200 no but what was that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> bought for what challenge nothing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was it was so that he could get as </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> close to all right uh um don't add a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> point yeah it's it's whether he gets </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> close to the number enough do you like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> out of mastercard um you're almost sure </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sure </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> there you go you can have that one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> this is going in the background corner </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> no it's not going anywhere </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> is that what you bought </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> uh i bought one more thing buy a figure </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_00> true </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i think the biggest the biggest </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> difference between this figure special </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the last figure special is that i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was like i was like struggling to find </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> things to like fit the budget that we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> had set yeah because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like we could have in most of the stores </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we could have bought like the most </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> expensive figure there and a lot of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> times we did buy the most expensive </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> figure there uh within reason yeah oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that looks good that's a nice straight </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> clean fit oh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it connects </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> i have one more thing okay but connor i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> think me and you are going to need to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> swap uh because i i'm going to need i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> going to need the table for this uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> conor can we swap for a second why don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you put it there huh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> also i want both your reactions at the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> same time okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_02> um that's the size of my girlfriend so i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> was struggling to like fill up my budget </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mandarake had a lot of cool figures but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> nothing that really like not nothing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that really likes you know spoke to me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> um and then i was thinking uh if you've </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> got another fake figure i'm gonna </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] kiss </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't uh don't guess what this is yet </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> right so should we close our eyes i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> gonna close my eyes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i swear to god god if it's another fake </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm so excited okay okay is this what it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> feels like to be a small child during </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> christmas </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you know what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm hearing a lot of uh struggling </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> oh okay so before you open your eyes i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just want i just i just want to uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> put a bit of back story to this okay it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> better be quick okay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um we like to [ __ ] on america a lot as </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know trash tastes part of trash </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> taste is [ __ ] on american culture </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah okay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and so i thought instead of [ __ ] on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> american culture for once why not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> embrace it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> okay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] hell what was that what was that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that's okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] steal brick and so i thought we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> can embrace american culture together </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for trash taste okay so you boys can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> open your eyes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> what the [ __ ] god </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> okay um so this is an airsoft gun </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i did not know that airsoft guns look </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> a steel brick do you want to feel this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> oh my god if if police come they're </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> going to arrest us that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are we going to get demolished oh my god </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> so for obvious reasons i'm not going to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> put get out of the box yeah because this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> looks way too realistic how much was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this was only 300 bucks </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> i like this is this is making me wonder </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what the airsoft community is like in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> japan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because this is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> well if a zombie apocalypse happens i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> know who i'm going to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> like this is the closest thing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> oh okay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah yeah of course of course of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> course uh this is not going out of the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> box uh just in case anyone ever thinks </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> that this is anything but an airsoft gun </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but uh youtube this is an airsoft gun </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't worry about it i think we might </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have to blur it for you we'll probably </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have to blur for youtube patrons </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there you go enjoy uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> enjoy that and so yeah this is uh so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i was like you know what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> americans love gun so let's just buy a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gun </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [Laughter] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> americans what do you think how </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> realistic does this video because yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> could you have sounded more like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> neanderthal america love gun america </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but if you [ __ ] bought this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i can't believe god you didn't realize </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> the whole point of this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> challenge was the five figures for the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> background of our set no i wanted to buy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] to see your reaction i thought that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was the whole point of the thing of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> challenge </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i wanted to get a good reaction out of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it oh you got a reaction where do we put </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> this i don't know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> about the other figures but actually </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where do we put this we can put this how </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> do we get rid of this without someone </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> calling the police </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> we can figure that out later yeah let's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> figure that out later </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> change to me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> hello we've had a time skip no [ __ ] if </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> you couldn't notice uh i lost all my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hair from thinking so hard </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> so we are recorded the previous </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> recording for so long that we actually </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ran out of time uh so we couldn't record </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the outro and uh we thought you know we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thought about having some continuity </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah then joey got his haircut so we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> were just like yeah i didn't i didn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> quite think about that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm not a team player here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so yeah i guess uh we wanted to i think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the last thing we wanted to do was to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> tally up all the points right of all of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the challenges that we were doing yes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> also do a forfeit as well unfortunately </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> uh because we recorded for so long i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> mean i think the recording's like three </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hours long now or something like that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's a very long episode yeah so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah so we rather think about it and we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thought that it would be better if we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> tallied up the points on stream and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we're not just going to do that there </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> are a few points that are under </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> contention like for example uh is still </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> angry two weeks later </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is uh is the character that joey bought </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> can can he beat goku is it even goku in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the first place you know how many </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> characters in a mogus </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> that was a real contagion they are the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] same i'm sure you guys will </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> agree with me live on the 21st yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so what we're going to do is we're going </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to do something similar to what we did </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for our trash chase awards uh we're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gonna have a bunch of categories some of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> them which we argued on this podcast and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> some of them are entirely new categories </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like who do you guys think bought the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> best figure and who do you guys think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bought the worst figure and other things </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that we can think of that are going to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> contribute to the final score for what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we have and then we will be doing our </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> forfeit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's live on stream </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> able to like show you guys some of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> figures that we couldn't really like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> delve upon too much in the episode </SPEAKER_04>
