<SPEAKER_01> - Here's some sipping ASMR. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt sips) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, I'm hard. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just another Tuesday. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (bright music) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> When we're recording this,
the Mori episode is out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> which was weird to just mention, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I love-
- Just like breaking NDA. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I love how they legitimately
figured it out like day one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm not surprised you
made it really obvious. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, on the day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They were like, "You should, could it be?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, it wasn't that, it was the threat </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that was like "Here's the evidence, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> of like the past few weeks
that I've collected." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - We haven't tried to hide
it, like we made it obvious. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think I saw three videos, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of people-
- You saw three videos? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I saw three videos
of people being like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Here's what's up in Hollow Live News. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The Trash Taste Boys tweeted out a tweet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> That is exactly the same as Mori Calli..." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He sounded exactly like that too. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause, you know, they
all sound like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, welcome to this
episode of Trash Taste, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm your host CDawg Monkey Brain. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - You really clearly
slayed your way in there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, and I'm here
today with Joey and Garnt </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm tired as fuck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - We're just back,
we've just the boys now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (chuckling) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why are you so tired Connor? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was up all night and then
I didn't sleep very well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was considering
canceling my Japanese lesson </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I can cancel it online. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But if I do it, like after
6:00 PM the day before </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't get my money back. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh really? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - So its like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wait, do you pay every lesson? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's not like a monthly thing? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - You pay for like tokens, and then- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - What? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like the token you can like redeem- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What, is this like the gacha currency? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (both chuckling)
- No, its like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's what I was thinking, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Not everything is fucking
gacha with you guys, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (chuckling) like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - So, how do you earn tokens? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Could you earn tokens by
just going to the store? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Pay to win currency
guys, called the money. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Don't know if you've heard of it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Can you claim them
like in game as well or? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my God, you guys have
been playing gacha too much. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like, do you have
like dailies for like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Every lesson you go to
there is like dailies, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you got like five tokens a day? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm just gonna ignore that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Then finally, I can do my 10 pool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You can explain now Connor. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, finally are the jokes done? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (chuckling)
- You just pay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then you get like X
amount of lessons with it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But like private lessons cost more </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like class lessons, cost X. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, I'm sure people can figure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> out which school I'm going to now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (both chuckles) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, someone already fucking did. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Someone like approached me and was like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Really. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, they were like, I
was talking with my teacher, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was like a common area </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and 'cause you got like a 10 minute break </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and we were talking and
then some guy was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Hey, are you like the guy on YouTube?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Which guy?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The guy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like, I guess I am, like, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know, the white British guy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I probably already told the story </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on the podcast there, but yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, so yeah, that's
it, and I'm tired as fuck </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I went to it and I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I probably should've
canceled and just slept in." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But again- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, that's- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You knew fully well, we're gonna do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> a podcast episode today? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I did, but I've been
doing it every week, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but for a lesson before. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm like impressed that
we've been able to manage </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like this weekly schedule
without taking a single week off </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> since we started, I think, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think so, I mean we've maybe one off, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but other than that we've
been pretty consistent. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - We've had one off simply
because one of the cameras broke </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> for this one week. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's right, one of
the cameras did break. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - But to compensate, we
did two episodes one week. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, 'cause I'm sure it's
obvious to the viewers at home </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but this set up, is all
been set up by like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I guess us, mainly me, but- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt chuckling)
- Mainly you, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We just chilling. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So, when like the camera died </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I didn't know what
I was doing, I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, fuck, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I guess we're not filming today." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - To know one of the cameras was broken </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we had to get it fixed which- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - For no reason at all, we
never figured that out, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Have you guys been up to
anything exciting recently? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, I've got some news. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh.
- oh, shit, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I've got some news. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just wanna say that this might be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> the last podcast episode that I do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Both ] What? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because if you guys saw on Twitter, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I've recently been emailed by- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt and Connor chuckling) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> By, you know, you might know them, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> they are called Big Hit Labels. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They are the management of a BTS. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, yeah I know, I actually
auditioned myself remember? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Like-
- Yeah, I remember. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Someone signed me up as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - But, they emailed me
and it was all Caps. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The title of the email was
all Caps, IDLE CASTING. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (both chuckling) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so I was like, Oh, shit
and then I saw, Big Hit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'll read the email to you right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Go on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause the first time
I saw this, I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh my God, is this actually Big Hit? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause that'd be crazy." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But then, because, it... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And like, I'll read it
but like the first half </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sounds legitimate. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It says like, "Hello The Anime Man, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we are Big Hit Labels, BTS's
management from South Korea. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> We are very interested in
casting you to be a member </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of the new boy group in the
Japanese branch of our company." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And this was the moment,
the next word I read, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I realized, oh, this is all a lie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Japanese branch of our company, STD!" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - "We think you'd make a fine- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's kinda catchy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, STD. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "We think you'd make a fine visual </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> with your astonishing idol-looks
or maybe a good leader </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with your wisdom and old age." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What the fuck does that mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Old age? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Old age. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "If you have anyone else in mind </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who you think would fit,
please let us know." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And they gave me a list of requirements </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I needed, all right?
- Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - To be the leader of STD. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] What was it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, "must speak Japanese." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - All right, check.
- Got that covered. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Must be six feet or over." Check. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - "Must be hot, "not sure about that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Must be hot."
- Well (chuckling) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - He's a lovely oxymoron, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Must be somewhat feminine, must be male." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (both chuckling) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, yeah, you can rock it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - "Must look good in tight leather pants." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Hell yeah, hell yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then this last one fucking kill me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> "Singing and dancing would also be good." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (both laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Would be good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Would be good, "Kindly
consider our offer </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and get back to us when
possible, Big Hit Label." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, but what if it was a legit Big Hit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and they reached out to
you, what would you do? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, because like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - What if it was them?
- No, what if it was? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like, what if it was-
- Hypothetically. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, Big Hit is like, "Joey,
we want you in the band." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> What would you say? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Dude, I would 100% say yes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Are you kidding me? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Do you know how much of fun... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I could- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Think of the content. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Dude, think of the content. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Think of the stories we can
tell on Trash Tastes, Connor. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I became a K-pop
idol for X amount of time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt chuckling) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - How confident are you in the
singing and dancing aspect? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - In dancing, I'm basically
a middle-aged white man </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> so, I can't dance to save my life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think I'm okay at singing (chuckling) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but yeah, dude, now could you imagine STD? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I would like radiate the same energy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as going to your
accountant and being like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Yeah, do that like
tax fraud thing for me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (both chuckling) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Save me all the money,
do what Trump did, dude." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah, pretty cool- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - "Fix me up like that." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
(all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know someone actually like
submitted like an audition </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> with my business email, like legit to them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and they replied being like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think it was no or
like to do the next step </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or something, like it was
some like verification thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was like, oh, thanks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I've had so many, I've had like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> every single dating site you can imagine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Right.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like I've had like SingleMuslim.com, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> be signed up for christianmingle.com. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Classy, did you get Farmers Only? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I haven't had that,
was there a website? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, Farmers Only is
like only you have to own </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like a certain amount
of land to be eligible. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Seriously?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You have to own like
certain amounts of acres? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You have to own a certain
amount of acres of farm land </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> to be eligible for it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm like, I see these and I
don't think anything about it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but I remember that I have like an agency </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> looking at our emails and that's
when I started to get like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> kind of worried about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And Mayline the other day, he goes to me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh, there was a weird
email in your email. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That apparently you had matched positive </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for STDs with someone. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (both laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Like someone you had slept with had STDs." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like, Mayline,
it's obviously fake. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> One, if I thought I had an STD, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I would go to the fucking
doctor not a website, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Let's just use my work email, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> which I know my agency checks to be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> by the way let's get
an STD check right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like how many
terrible decisions in a row </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> would I have to make to have that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, I would one, have
to sleep with someone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who I would have to be like,
wow, you knows, no condom. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Then go in, think I have
an STD immediately after, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not go to the doctor,
sign up to this website, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> hm, final step use work email. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like do you ever meet people who are like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Man, I just can't seem to get a W." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then they just don't think. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But they always should do
things that never set it up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's the kind of
behavior that they do, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that they're just like, "Man,
I'm just so unlucky in life." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's like, you did
drive with no wheels. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like what did you expect to
happen, like this is all you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] I think we all
know like one person </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that is like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He's like the nicest person ever </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but they keep doing dumb stuff </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and you're like, "Come on, man." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm like, you have to be like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No one person can take that many ELLs </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> without actually trying to do so, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've got like three
friends, you just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> "Come on, man, I wanna see you get a W, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you just keep doing it, man, stop man." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Dude, like that BTS one though, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the Big Hit Labels one, like I posted it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I thought it was hilarious, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it is, but you know I
quickly learned my lesson </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to not fuck with K-pop fan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - You felt the wrath of K-pop Twitter? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Which-
- Just the Twitter rule. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I woke up in the morning </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I saw that the thing
had 800 quote retweets. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like-
- Oh no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - "That's never a good sign." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, no, (chuckling) boy's
about to get rationed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I checked it and like
a lot of them are just, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you know people just saying, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> obviously getting that
it's a joke but you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's those handful of K-pop stands </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who would just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Wow, how dare you like
stereotype all K-pop stars?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't worry about
it, its what they do- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, no I thought it
was fucking hilarious, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but there are some people who are like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, he probably photo-shopped it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just to get attention." I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What? I'm not that desperate
for likes on Twitter. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] That's got like more creativity </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> than half my videos- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's also the Photoshop- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The only reason I posted
it because I thought </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was fucking hilarious, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like I wouldn't have
(chuckling) otherwise. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's weird that people assume that like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that's the kind of
content we think we need. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Both] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's like, that's the amount </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of steps that would jump in through- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, that's how desperate
I am for Twitter clout. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, that I have to fake an email. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - The amount of loops you
would have to jump through </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to get to that point,
you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You could just say, I like hentai </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you get more likes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (chuckling)
- So true. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Dude, I tweeted penis
and I got like more likes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> So it's just like whatever, yeah, but I'm- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - K-pop since you don't
mess with them, Joey </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's a universal truth. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I mean, I knew
that from the get go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> but I didn't think that would
have caused a riot, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just like, "Can these
people not take a joke?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Clearly not anyway. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, moving on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I see you started
Genshin, and I'm like, what? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - After holding off this
entire fucking time- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Holding to the curve. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And holding off from like
me and Joey talking about it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like every week. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I didn't wanna spon... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Our fucking podcast to become
a sponsor episode for free. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> If we're gonna talk about Genshin, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I wanna get fucking paid. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (both chuckling) you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Do you like it though? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it's fine, it feels
like Breath of Wild light, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like-
- [Both] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It feels like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's die hard, Breath of the Wild. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know how like in Breath of the Wild </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when you would like, think, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh what if I do this weird thing? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then you'd always
get rewarded for it?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> In Genshin I would be like,
"Oh, there's nothing there." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's another common
chess, that won't bore you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't understand what
I'm picking up but I- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because the reason I like Genshin, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I've... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> The reason I like it is that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it is very, very Breath of the Wild. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, yeah that's the
best part of the game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it's Breath of the
Wild mixed with basically </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> JRPG elements and I'm just like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's fucking awful. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (both chuckles) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - See that, I was watching
this guy's stream. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Every time Python came on
screen, he was like, "Shut up!" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - There was like those one
point where it was a cut scene. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think like, I just like
had my mouse to my head </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was just tapping it, just like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause I was so bored,
The story is so shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Not that I would have
paid attention to anyway </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's like doubly shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then some people in my chat were like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Why are you skipping the cut scenes?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like, "It's shit, right?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And everyone's like,
"Yeah, it's kind of shit." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was like, okay, good,
then I'm skipping them all. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know, that's like, it's boring. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't find any of these
characters interesting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause they're all gacha characters </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and most of them are just, I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean like the thing
with gacha game stories </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is that they rarely start
off goods, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If a gacha story gets
good, it's normally like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> way into development where
like five chapters in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or like when they released
like their fifth story. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like chapter six Arknights. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, which I've heard
about chapter six Arknights </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so it was just meant to be
amazing and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> well, I've kind of
skipped the entire story </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> up to this point, so- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just don't trust anyone with- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've read chapter one and that's it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like after that, I was
like, oh, okay, I don't need </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> to know this story to play the game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I just don't understand people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who like love stories in gacha games. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I just, I mean, we've
covered this before but- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Have we? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, we've covered
story in video games, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - But I mean, there are
specially shitty in gacha. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Like Breath of the Wild
didn't have much story </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was like the best part of the game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So like, just do what you want. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, but like the reason
why people skipped over </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> fucking Breath of the Wild
story is because like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> what person doesn't know the
story of Legend of Zelda. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - What is the story of Breath of the Wild? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Began it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, you just began it, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's nice though, I liked that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They kept it simple, like, let me do it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, I like the fact that
you can change characters </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's elemental and
the combat's kind of fun. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's it's okay, it feels
pretty limited, but- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean that's fine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, the reason
I thought it was great </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was because it feels like Genshin is like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of feels like a
first of its kind, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because when you think of gacha games </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and when you think of
the whole gacha genre, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you have this image of just like, you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cheap mobile games that only
hardcore weaves are into. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's been really weird seeing just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how much Genshin has blown up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I feel like I went
into Genshin thinking, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh, it's just gonna
be kind of like Honkai </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but a little bit more polished." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I got completely blown
away when I was just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> No, this just feels like a AAA gacha game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It feels like the very,
very first AAA gacha game </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where it's like way more
polished than pretty much </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> any of its competition. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, I didn't understand
why people liked Faygo, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like I saw Faygo, it looks- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's because of fate. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It really looked like a mini clip game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The art looked shit and then also </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the story sounded like a convoluted mess. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then also the gacha
rates were abysmal, so- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because you don't mess. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like, tide moon fans
like K-pop fans, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like the moment
there's anything tide moon </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they are just like, "Give it to me." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - So, there's this thing called like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the waifu economy, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (gasping) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (chuckling) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Where it's the value of the waifus </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and because those tide
moon have such like... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because tide moon have such a strong brand </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with fate and all the waifus in it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that just makes the waifus
and fate worth that much more. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And people look... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You look like you're about
to die inside right now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Garnt's a waifu economist. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (both laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like absurd. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - But like the story in
Faygo does actually get good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like fucking five chapters in. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I can't remember which chapter Camelot is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but that's when it gets good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - So when you're playing the gacha games </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> do you want the characters
because you liked them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or because they'll make you OP? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, I'm sure it goes both ways. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's the eternal struggle, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Do you go with Metta or
do you go with waifu? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just want the OP ones, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't care about the characters looks. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, I'm completely the opposite. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause like every time I stream Genshin, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> there are so many back seater
for Genshin, Holy shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - There are two types
of people in this world. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, there are so many
backseaters for Genshin, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> where like, I think once I
had like both Qiqi and Klee </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in like my party and people were like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "What the fuck, that's like
the worst combination." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, I didn't give a shit
, I like these characters. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I just wanna play as
the characters I like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I like these waifus. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I honestly think like going </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with the just the good
waifus is the way to go. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because I feel like
going into a gacha game </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> wanting to be OP means that you kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> go into the mentality where you wanna like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of complete the game,
you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You wanna optimize it, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like going into a casino </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> expecting to be a millionaire, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, you wanna complete the game, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> wait, were we not completing the game? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Is that not what we are all doing? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Am I confused? Like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, I mean, if you wanna comp- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - If you don't wanna complete the game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, its not about- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - How can you complete a gacha game? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do the story. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - But the story is and
everything in a gacha game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, so you do the story
in Genshin, and then what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Then what did you do? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - You go around exploring the world </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or you collect all the characters or- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Collect all the characters? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You mean gamble all your
fucking money away, like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yes, welcome to gacha's Connor. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt chuckling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> That's the whole fucking point. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, once you have done all
the content in the game, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What do you do then? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Its like wait for the next update. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But like, okay, that's where like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> when Arknights came out, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The white between those things </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was just like a ticking time bomb of like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Am I gonna drop this game?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because that wait period is like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "How long can I reasonably
keep logging into this?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like to the point where I'm
like, "What am I doing?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And obviously like, after X amount of time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when you've beaten the
game that's when it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> "Okay, I'm done, like,
I've played this game, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I've got my fill, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't need to spend
any more money on this, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll play something else." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I find it really funny though </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you're the one who's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "No, I wanna finish the story." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> As someone who does, no idea
what fuck the story is about. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, I wanna do all, like
the content, all the bosses </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like all the fun aspects,
and normally, unfortunately </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it's tied to the story. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause I remember- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fortunately all the boss
fights are tied to a story. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like seeing you enter
like discover Arknights </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for the first time and seeing
you like your first entrance </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> into the world of gacha. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just like, "I see him." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just saw you spiraling down into hell. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause I saw you were like,
"Oh man I wanna collect this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I wanna level up this character. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I wanna level up that character,
I wanna optimize this." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, "Oh no, you're gonna
be spending a lot of money." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, that's 'cause I wanted to, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> unfortunately with Arknights </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> there will always be that
one stage, Arknights is like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a tower defense kind of game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Please, sponsor us. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And basically, there was... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> No matter how many OP characters you had </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> their always come a stage,
when you will need like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one specific character
that had this one niche </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that you didn't have. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was super annoying when it happened. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I just wanted to spec everything </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And everything we've had on every stage </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then yeah, I just
gave up and I thought- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, which is what I was saying. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, if you want to
complete a gacha game, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you are gonna have a bad time because- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I felt like I completed
Arknights, like I did everything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, there's always
new content coming out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You never reach- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - That was now- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The only time you can
complete a gacha game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> is when the developers just stop. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Giving a shit, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - But this is the thing, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> If, when you have done
everything in a game, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then say the next patch
coming out in a month. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like, are you then happy
to stop playing that game </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> before the new chapters
come out next month? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Are you done? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Which is why, I feel like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this is a super interesting
conversation because I feel like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> a lot of people wins the
Genshin and they like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't think even Genshin,
is kind of expected </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the kind of response
that it would have gotten </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and how popular it would have gotten, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because this is like a lot of
people's first introduction </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> into gacha games, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And there's been like a big controversy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with Gentian stamina system
when you reach end game, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> When you kind of complete the
story, explore everything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - So, is the stamina is for
running around, swimming, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and climbing, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, so you haven't used
stamina in Genshin yet. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, I haven't, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, so you understand... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Okay, so every gacha game has
kind of like a stamina system </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where normally you
spend a resource to play </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> some certain aspects of the game, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Genshin to me, I feel like
it's super weird, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause you can go, you could
play it for like 30 plus hours </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and never have to use
stamina system at all. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Whereas with like Arknights has sanity. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You kind of like, reach the stamina cap </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> within like a week of playing it all out, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'd say right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Same thing like Faygo. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I can't remember what the stamina
system in Faygo is called, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but in Genshin the stamina
system is called resin. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And you use resin whenever
you like go complete a dungeon </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or don't go like flights and bosses. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Now when you're in the early game </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and when you're just exploring the world </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you can just not use the
stamina system at all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because their is so much to
do and the world is like... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The world is fucking massive, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The world is absolutely massive </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you could spend 30 plus
hours exploring the world </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> doing everything in the
world, doing story quest </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and not have to like focus on grinding </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and leveling up your
characters and doing bosses </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and everything, but once
you reach the end game, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> once you've explored everything,
then their is nothing to do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but grind out and you know, and try to... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And just use resin. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And the argument is,
from what I understand, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I haven't actually
reach end game myself </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there is just no enough resin,
to give yo meaningful content </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> once you've reached
the end of the content. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't understand
people who like just grind. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Like we'll play a game
for hours and end on grind </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when there's no guarantee
that anything's coming. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like that's like psychotic to me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, because I've
heard that the best way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> to like enjoy Genshin, from
what I've heard from people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who have reached end game already is that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you shouldn't rush through the game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, you shouldn't. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because getting to end game is actually </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> much quicker than a lot of people expect. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then once you hit that point, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and once you have to start
using the stamina system </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> then it's like you are really
limited to what you can do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, you are really limited to content. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And that's why I think Genshin is like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the super unique example,
because most gacha games, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's just like a mobile
game where you just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you can play it for
like five to 10 minutes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> when it pop sometimes, you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you rarely play for long period of time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Whereas with Genshin because
it feels more like a AAA game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> People wanna play this for hours on end. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And people are coming in expecting
this to be like an MMORPG </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where you're just like constantly grinding </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and constantly doing something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And this is like infinite content, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Mm. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just find that MMORPG is so boring. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> after like X level, when
you start grinding, I just- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Both] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know, like I think
some people can do grinding, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> no problem, but for me it's like just- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm on new JRPG, so. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I mean, I just
like, I think it's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> why would you just stop
me from having fun? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, (Garnt chuckling)
I don't understand. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Some people find grinding really fun. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think it's like
relaxing for some people. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I find it relaxing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - For me, it's just like, I
feel like you're just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> taking the out of me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like you're just kind of making
a mockery of my time here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, you are making me do all this thing- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You are only making
me use 1% of my brain. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Almost, it's like, you know, some, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when I used to play RuneScape,
like I didn't mind it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I was also fucking 12 and
I was just dumb little shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I wouldn't mind taking on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I literally spent like
hours a day clicking trees. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I can't even believe I did that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - But like MMOs by yourself </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> or were you playing it with friends? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I had friends as well, but still it... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause I mean, I
couldn't be able to grind </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in MMO by myself. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like raids look fun
in World of Warcraft. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> When they are eight people communicating, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like that looks fun, but I
also don't want to get there, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> because the points of getting
there are insane, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Both] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But my little brother was
addicted to World of Warcraft </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and he fucking, you
couldn't get him off it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I never got into all Wold of Warcraft. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've never been into. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't think I've played
like a single MMORPG because- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Wait, not even RuneScape? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I didn't even play RuneScape, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I fucking loved RuneScape, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I spent so many hours on the game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just like beg my parents
when I was like 14 like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Please, mother, please
pay for membership. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's only five pounds a month." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Seriously, I couldn't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't have the balls to
ask my parents to do that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> so that's why I was like, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think it was like for
my birthday, I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Can I have RuneScape for a year?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (both chuckling) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And they were like, "Yeah." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And obviously when you were like 14 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> time doesn't go nearly as
fast as it does now, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So I remember like the first month </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I played like eight hours a
day of RuneScape every day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was so addicted. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - True gaming goal right here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, and when I got
like 17, I stopped playing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I gave my account to my little brother, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause he wanted to play
on it for a little bit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Then fucking lost all my shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt chuckling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember there was like
this thing called like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> There was this thing you had to grind </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for like the specific armor
and it took like months </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and he'd lost it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like missile armor or some shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was like called Fist
of Gothics or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know what it was called. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (chuckling)
- Fist of Gothics. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was like this hummer
where you had to play </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like an egg game, it was really dumb. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I would spent like two weeks straight </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> getting this hummer,
doing these mini games </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then he lost it and
then I got up again. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I came out of retirement from
RuneScape, just to get this- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (chuckling)
- You came out of retirement. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I came out of RuneScape retirement, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just to get this hummer again
and he fucking lost it again. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, "That's it
I'm done with RuneScape." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - You pulled like a high misogyny, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm coming out to RuneScape
to save this company. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I couldn't believe it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> But going in to gacha, like
I'm so quick to drop games </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because at the moment the
game is boring, even remotely. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like if I have one gaming session
where I'm playing the game </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I just didn't have any
fun, I'm like, "All right, well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm done with that game." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Somehow League of
Legends hasn't done that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, I think it's like hacked my brain. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know why, I hate it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like it has hacked
your brain in such sense. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Do you enjoy league or do you feel like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - League of Legends by the way, I'm sure- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Did you actually enjoy
league or do you just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> sometimes play it because it's just like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - To copy me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like a familiar kind of like system </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that you just understand and- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think, I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Joey probably hasn't had this, but I think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when you've played a game
like that for so long, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> there is just kind of like
almost autopilot nature to it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where like I'll see, I
have like an hour free. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I'll just click it open
even though every time I know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when I click it open,
it's a bad idea because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not only will I probably
not have a good game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> If I have a good game, I
don't feel good about it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I'm like, "Well that
was a stomp, that was no fun." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But if I lose or have someone entering </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or on the Japanese
server I've been playing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people just fucking trolls
so much more, it's so bad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'll be like, "Wow,
I just wasted 30 minutes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and now I'm fucking angry." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I know every time I click it open </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's never gonna be worth it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but sometimes I still do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because it's like just habit building. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I have played League of Legends. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like it's been like, I'd
say my main game for... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> God, when did Dilution
come out? Like 2004? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Jesus Christ man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like, it's been like six, seven years. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I've just like, its for the game </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I always just go back to,
and it used to be really fun, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but now it's just like depressing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know, that's why I like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's so funny, you're speaking to people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> who've played league for years. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause everyone talks about
it like they are fucking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> drug addicts, like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - it's certainly sounds like it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like you know, "I wanna
quit, but I just can't man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I just can't, I need..." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The side effects.
- "There's something about me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just need to play one more
game, just one more game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> But I just can't quit.
I can't quit, damn it." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It used to be like,
back when I lived in... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> When I was in university,
it was really easy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> to just play with people
and it was pretty fun. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I was used to play for
the university team as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was pretty fun actually,
I really enjoyed that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But then when I left
university, I went to London. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I wasn't really playing
as much with friends. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then I set the bridge
to Japan it's totally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a solo queue thing,
which it's just isn't fun. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Which solo queue is
just playing on your own </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with four other random people. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I don't know why
in the Japanese civil, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's so bad dude. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's full of like Chinese
Smurfs and Korean Smurfs </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who wanna just fuck around,
all the deans are horrible. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - So then have you considered- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Quitting?
- Stopping? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's hard, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's because I know why. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Its because there's nothing
to replace it, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - What do you do, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What do you do when you have
like just one hour free? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Just only one hour free? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Jack off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt chuckling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - For one hour? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt chuckling) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, I'll get the job
done within that hour, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And then- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Connor's like, that's
an unoptimized jack off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You can't have that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - No jack off should take
more than five minutes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Then, yeah, I have 55 minutes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> to do whatever I want, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - But like, okay, now but
seriously, what do you do? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Like read a book, watch something? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, read a book usually. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I can't open a book
for an hour, I'd stuck </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, 'cause you are
a fucking monkey brains. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Its like an eight hour
thing for me if I open a book. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Eight hours? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I have to make it a
whole day thing if I read. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm talking about
like, like manga or like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, manga. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm actually with Connor. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Really? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like if I'm reading manga,
it has to be a whole day thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I can't put it down. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, no, I can easily
just pick up a volume, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> read it and then that's it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think the problem is
that league is so easy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to just do for 30
minutes without engaging. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It just engages that monkey brain, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that fucking lizard brain
where you just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Okay, I'm just clicking buttons now." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, and I recognize
that it invalidates </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a lot of my points, like when we talk </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> about fighting games. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That clip of us talking
about it and me being like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Yeah, fuck it." You know?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I got so much shit for that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause one first of all, they were like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Well Connor's a league player,
So it makes so much sense." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then the other top comments are like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Connor's is just a sore loser, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's why he doesn't
like fighting games." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, "You don't
know a true fucking loss </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> until you've played a
40 minute game of league </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and your team fucking threw it all. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - This video is sponsored by Honey. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Imagine this, you make a
list of gifts you gonna buy </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> - You're probably wondering,
is this the same honey </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that automatically searches
for promo codes online? </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_01> - Yes. Yes it is Joey. </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_02> - Back to the episode. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, there's a lot of
people who are saying, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Yeah, I'm just bad at fighting
games and I'm a sole loser, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's why I don't like to do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's so bullshit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If you had played league, you
know what true fucking pain </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is like, I would rather lose
a two minute fighting game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> any day of the week than
lose one league game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause it is brutal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, just from the sounds of it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it just sounds like a shit experience. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, it is, it's terrible.
It's fucking awful. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Then stop. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Who knows man, just say
that to a crack addict, Joey. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I will.
- Just tell him to search- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, you can quit
crack, just do League. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It is like crack because I will say like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the honeymoon period of league, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like when you first
start learning the game </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and when you start
clicking, it's probably like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> some of my fondest gaming
experiences in my life </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when I'm just like, "This is
a really, really fun game." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's just like, it is- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I didn't even get to that point. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I played one game
and then five minutes in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all the comments and called
me new fan and it kept me, so- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - So tell me like, what did you hate </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about League of Legends? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Like walk me throw it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, well, first of all, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't like MOBAs to begin with. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I mean like they
are assertive context. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, so yeah, so that was that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then just again, like,
just from what I've seen </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and from what I've heard from a distance </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the league community just looks like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a bunch of fucking cocks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What do you mean by a bunch of cocks? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like they just, you
know, I've always hated </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> using the word gate
keeping but, oh my God! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> League players are like
the crowns of gate keeping. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like you say anything bad about the game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You try and get into it,
like with no experience </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or no knowledge of the game whatsoever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Most communities will, you
know at least a few of them </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> will be like, "Hey you're
trying to get into our game, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> welcome, we'll invite you with open arms. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But if you suck at the game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then that's your responsibility, right?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like, all right, fair enough. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But meanwhile league is
like you're not a fucking God </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at this game from five minutes in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> then you're a new fan get out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That was my experience with league. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, league definitely
has one of the most </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> toxic communities. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I actively tell people like
just don't get into league, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's not like it's not rewarding. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, and I'm like, I already can't deal </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with fucking toxic
communities to begin with. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I guess I don't really mind that much. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I kind of liked that aspect of games. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've been on the internet for too long. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't wanna deal with that anymore. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Connor is like a toxic gamer. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I have to deal with the
anime community, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Like let alone the league community. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I know, what do you
think about the argument </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that like a lot of people get really upset </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> with the idea of like trash
talking video games online. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, what do you think about that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think if it's done
tastefully, I don't really- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, like whenever
I see you trash talking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like the fighting game
community, I'm like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> "Ah, that's just fun."
you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's kinda sad 'cause I feel
like in League of Legends, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> not... I mean, it's obviously
there are some people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who say some fucking APAR and stuff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But like, I think just, you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like fucking telling the
other team that Baton stuff </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> is funny as hell, like I'm not doing that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah, if it's done tasteful, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And which is, there's
many ways to do that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just as long as you're not like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> attacking someone personally. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Both] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think it's like, I'm all game for it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like if someone, if I do a terrible job </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in League of Legends game,
maybe fuck something up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I fucking hope they type
and they all chat to me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> saying like, "LOL" or
something, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because that's funny
to me, like I want that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because you do the same, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, a hundred percent. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But if it gets to like, you know some </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> racial xenophobic shit, then
I'm just like, "All right-" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, that's fucked up, yeah.
- Please stop. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, obviously I think
there was a draw on the line, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but obviously kind of feels
like, especially in league </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that they've like kind
of like cracked down </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on anything like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But I feel like they had
to, because it was so far </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> removed from what was
acceptable, that you're like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you go into like a normal
game and people are still </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> toxic as fuck, even
though it's a normal game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - The problem was that he
never enforced any of the rules </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> for so long, so it just kept escalating. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I reckon if they enforced
like the actual rules </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> from the beginning, it
wouldn't have been so bad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] You are right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - But I feel like this
is like the same cycle </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> for every competitive
game, you what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Without exception, I
mean, you can seem like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I played Overwatch as well- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, you look at
Overwatch, and it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the first few months, great. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Everyone had fucking fun. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Everyone was just learning the game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then like, it's the
problem of when you've played </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the game enough, you don't
play because it's fun. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> You play because like you said,
it's just something to do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then out from the
shadows rose the try-hard. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt chuckling) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Dude, I had some of
the worst experiences </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> of my life on Overwatch. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Did you actually? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because League of Legends, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's bad, right, it's bad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It's, you see them
violet shit, but at least </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's no voice chat. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> In Overwatch, you're automatically
put in like voice chat </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with your team. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That sounds horrible. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Sometimes you'd have like
the funniest moments ever </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like you would meet the coolest people. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And it was like, you'd
always have to remember that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> whenever you got like
the 10 games in a row </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of like fucking kids and shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Both] Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because like as well the
worst part is an Overwatch </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when I used to play it they
implemented a system now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where you can queue up for a role, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it used to be six of you got put in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you all might be six tank mains. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> You all might be six, like DPS mains. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> So you'd stop fucking
bickering immediately </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> over who gets what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And that's why I always
just play, fill in games. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, I'll just do
whatever, 'cause I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "I don't fucking care,
like don't shout at me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> let's just do it man." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Both] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But man, people would
like say horrible shit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> on that, like always 12 year olds as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, because once
you play it enough hours </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> then you've reached this
point where you're like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> "Okay I got to play ranks, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because otherwise playing
this game is kind of like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> meaningless in a sense, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I hate playing normal games
of like competitive games. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, but then when,
once you start getting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on the ranks ladder is when I
find it, it stops getting fun </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because then you reach and
everyone reaches a wall. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Doesn't matter who you are </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everyone will reach a wall eventually. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And once you reached that wall </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you just feel like you stop progressing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Unless you put like so many
hours into learning this game </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and trying to better
yourself and at that point </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I understand why people
get toxic and angry. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because then the weight
they like to invest into </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like making that... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like climbing up the ranks
ladder and everything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So they feel like they
need this to feel like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> they haven't wasted there time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Which let's be honest,
unless you're a programmer </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you probably are wasting
your time with it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know what it might be? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think it's just the simple thing that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I can just not into
PVP with random people. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think that's all it is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, I'm thinking about it now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, I've never enjoyed
just PVP games to begin with. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Maybe for the exception of
like some fighting games </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but only if I'm like playing
it with friends I know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So like, I'll play like a game of Smash </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or like straight fight or
old tech in or whatever </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if I'm sitting in the same room with you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and we just like having a
fun fucking time, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I think just the whole idea of PVP </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> against randos on the internet, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> who I don't know or care about, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I think that's just the one thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I fucking hate in gaming. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why is Garnt laughing? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just have this like
image of Joey being like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "I have fun with friends." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then I think like the
angriest I've ever seen Joey </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> is when you're playing against Connor </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and he was like, spamming
King K. Rool at your house </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm just like (chuckling) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, but that's the thing, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm okay with getting angry
in situations like that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I know Connor and he's
there in front of me, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, so like, that's
just fun times, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, yeah, I was off that you
were spamming fucking counsel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> with King K. Rool, every fucking match. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Joey gets very, very angry
when he loses in the Smash. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, but that's what I'm saying though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, I don't like
PVP games as it is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, I'm not a huge fan of PVP as it is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I get angry easily. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But especially when it's
against people, I can't see, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or I've never heard of, never
talked to, just don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - That anger, I think... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, that just like the
enjoyment is just completely gone. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I remember you were like,
"Yeah, man, I'm the best. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No, one's beat me at Mario Kart ever." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Like Joey is like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I did not say that, you are a lair. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - You were like I never
lose him Mario Kart- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - You are the absolute slander. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (both chuckling) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I did not say that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was like some fake news- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was something along those lines. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You were like, "I never
losing Mario Kart." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then I was like, "Bet." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then like, Joey
would bit all his friends </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I would just crush Joey. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, crush is a strong word. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt chuckling) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But in recent times, you've been playing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's been pretty 50, 50, but yeah, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> when it was like, which one was it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's probably when Deluxe came out, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the new Mario Kart eight,
I was fucking killing Joey. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I think so. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And had him made like,
he can't game play. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Ethan, like a fucking breakdown. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Do you remember that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We did like a stream where
we kept playing Mario Kart. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I only played baby
park for like five hours. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Until Ethan could beat me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and we must've played it
yeah for like five hours </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> until he managed to bit me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We did like 150 fucking time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> We did a baby park 150 times
on stream, we were like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "All right, let's like
after like race 20 rool." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We were like, "All right, if
Ethan beats Connor in one race, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> then we'll run the stream. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, and then that was also earlier on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that they thought I was
cheating or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, your doom was like,
"He's got a modern suite </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or something like, he's
winning too many times." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, so they made us all
change to the same character </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> in the same car and everything like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so there was no cheating at all, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like it was all the same thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And he was like, "How
are you still beating me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> every time?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was so funny. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - See, that's like, those
kinds of like competitive games </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I fucking love, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, I don't wanna say
the word party games. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But like, I mean, they are party games. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like that's why I fucking
love about party games, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is that yeah, you'll get
people who are fucking salty </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it is PVP technically. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But at the end of the day,
it's fucking whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's a fucking Mario Kart game, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - What do you think of people throwing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> their controllers, Joey? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Huh? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What do you think about
people throwing controllers? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, I've done it before as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Actually. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I've done it in Smash, remember? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Did you really? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But I think it's so cringe, (chuckling) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no matter how angry I get, I'll be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "But not you." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah.
- Put that there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (all chuckling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay, to be fair, I only did it once. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - But you see that's an
expensive fucking Joey, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Connor is like, "I aint
throwing these things. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh no, I threw it like
the really cheap shit, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like GameCube controller. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh those budget ones, oh. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Were just like 15 bucks. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like the budget one, it's
like even if I break this, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I can buy another one, it's fine, but the- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The YouTuber money is- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Pad control, I would never. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and that's too much of an expensive... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, Oh my God, seeing
like Smash compilations </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> of like people just absolutely </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just shocking their controllers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I do love watching Smash
tournament rage moments. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, it's so funny. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, dude, it's a
party game like just chill. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, but like I was about to ask </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what'd you think about party games? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, do you see Smash as a party game? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I mean- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Bro, you got a (indistinct) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Dude, Sakurai himself
said it was a party game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So it's a fucking party game, all right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's a party game that
can be played competitively. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's a party game that
is, can also be competitive. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Imagine like musical chairs. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> If there was a pro league- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah, (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't wait for the
salt in the comments man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I cannot Wait for the
salt in the comments. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, look, it's
like, I'm not saying that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, Smash is not a competitive game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like it absolutely is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I fucking love watching the
competitive scene of Smash pros. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But, but it's a competitive
game that can also </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> be a party, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like again, like if you
said for example, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If fucking Mario Kart
had like a pro league, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then yeah, it could probably
be a competitive game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it doesn't. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why doesn't it though? Why? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Okay, here's why I've never understand, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how did Smash get so competitive </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as opposed to basically like
every other Nintendo game? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think, because a lot of
them are like too random. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like Mario Kart has way
too many random aspects. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right.
- Where I think like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's why I like Smash,
like Smash competitive </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is like no items final destination only- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's right, they literally
knew called the randomization </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> from it, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - So even the stages
they can't move, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, so the only, like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I think the only way that something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like Mario Kart could
ever be competitive is if- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No items? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - it's the same course, no items, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt chuckling)
and everyone is- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Baby park. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Same course, no items,
everyone's in the same character </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> with the same car. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That'd be so fucking boring. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, and that's the
only reason why, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I guess so. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But again, like, you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm sure there's lots
of party games out there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that could very easily be
considered competitive games. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like what? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Guitar hero. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, that's just
the way, that should go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> into rhythm games right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That was actually competitive. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, that's what I thought about that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Rhythm games can very
easily be competitive games, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but they are not, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because there's like
no real league for it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> But I reckon the only
reason why Smash became </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a competitive game is
because of all the fucking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> street fighter games. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel like also it's just a nice </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> spectator sports as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I feel like with competitive games, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> if there's gonna be a league for it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's got to be interesting
to watch, I'd say. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like that's why
league is the biggest e-sport </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because while I'd hardly
ever play league anymore </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I still fucking watch it every year, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause it is a really fun game to watch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as opposed to- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because there's so much going on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it feels like it was,
it feels like it's a game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that's designed to also be viewed as well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from a third person perspective. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, I used to, when the Overwatch </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was doing the pro league
my friends used to watch it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I used to watch it and
I'm like, what the is this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I played this game and
there's way too much going on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> The quality was can't possibly
describe what's going, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because all the action happens so fast </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's six different people
doing six different things. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Whereas the league it's
normally, if it's a team fight </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's still like, you can still
tell people what's going on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, its because of the top-down view </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as opposed to Overwatch where just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> first person is here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It gets nociating. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Fucking be following
tracer, Tracer zooms back, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and then I switch into the
next guy and switch in again. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, "Oh, just fuck me." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, and also I feel that
because of the length of league </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you can sit down and enjoy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And like I think the one
reason I've really gotten </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to fighting games is that
normally when I'm watching </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, e-sports that's what I'm saying, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when I'm watching the e-sports, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I normally only watch like the finals </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I can kind of
follow what's going on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like the Semi's and the finals </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's really easy to follow along. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But when the group stages are going on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like, all right, "Who's this guy?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And by the time I'm finished Googling him </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the next guy's on fighting. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, "All right, well,
okay, who's this guy?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then the fight maybe I wanted to watch </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he's over in three minutes and it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Okay, well I guess,
yeah, I guess that's it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I guess all the fights
are over, okay, shit." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> League is quite a long thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and they've got a really
good system with the league </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> where it plays like two... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There's like every league
plays everyday now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like alternates on season. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean it's- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's crazy, they got set
up literally like a football. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it's way more like
just a football, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a traditional sports now
where you can kind of like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> jump in and jump out
and see familiar faces </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and kind of like familiar
brands every time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I feel like that's kind of helped... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like the e-sports scene in league, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it just seems to keep growing every year, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which is fucking insane
to me that it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> fucking 10, 11 years old now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> How old is league? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 10. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, and it's still
like growing each year </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> internationally, which- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Shows the e-sports- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, the e-sport which shows the power. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> But like totally, I enjoy
watching fighting games as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Me too. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like, the only time I ever get into </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> is during like Evo or like the big kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, true, Whatever else, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh, why is there a
million views on Twitch? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh, its Evo, okay, cool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like I don't go around
like fucking looking for like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, local cons doing,
you know, Smash tournaments. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I'm not gonna watch those live </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but you know, but yeah, like
Evo and fucking you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> those big Smashtournament
are fucking fun to watch. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - The sponsor of today's
video is EJ Anime store. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - EJ Anime store, is an online mode store </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that is run directly by Kodakawa. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Once again, they brought us an assortment </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> of special figures. </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_00> because they can only be
purchased at EJ Anime tore. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Tell us what we got today Connor. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - So, we have- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Was this your first rodeo or something? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Like come on, bro. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just didn't have what EJ stood for. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just kind of didn't know what to- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'll tell you, look into my eyes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Entertainment, Japan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, this in the middle
wearing the wedding dress </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I assume is the Taiga Aisaka
wedding version from Toradora. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't see the face, I love Toradora. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Very nice. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Celebrating the 50th
anniversary of Toradora </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> light novel series. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We bring you the main heroine Taiga Aisaka </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> dressed in a beautiful

<SPEAKER_03> of the original light novel
series Takemiya Yuyuko, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> as an exclusive bonus. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Out of here, Joey, that is the deal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Additionally, the figure also
includes extra exchangeable </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> face parts, showing Taiga loving games. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - And in original illustration
with a signature board signed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> by the original illustrator
Yasu as a bonus. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's pretty freaking Epic. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (Connor chuckling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But I'll tell you one thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I'm genuinely excited about, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It's the Slayer's sign, I
fucking love slayers dude. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I can't believe we are
celebrating the 30th anniversary </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of the Slayers light novel. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, to be actually honest with you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't fucking believe
it's 30 years already. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause I grew up reading
Slayers and I'm like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Man, this is such a new show." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I realized it started before I was born. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But we have the Lina
Inverse kimono version, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> which is again, celebrating
the 30th anniversary </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of the Slayers light novel series. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And the special set includes a
B2 tapestry of the originally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> created illustration
that inspired this figure </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as an exclusive bonus, as
you can see right here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Look at that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It looks very nice. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Then we also got to the
(speaking foreign language) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and that was a fucking mouthful. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, Kimisen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (both chuckling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Did you just name a town in Wales? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So this is the Aliceliese
original dress version. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - And finally we have the "Date A Live 3" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Tohka Yatogamy Chinese
style dress version. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - You nailed that pronunciation, Joey. </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> - As the host of this episode. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Why are you laughing? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm the host Joey, come on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What does it feel like? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Power, it's the power, I
guess are we anime podcast? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (chuckling) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wow, what a question? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was wondering this yesterday. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, I see people
on Twitter or Reddit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They talk about like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh man, I like it when
they talk about anime, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't like it when
they talk about anime." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I guess it's weird, 'cause
I guess when we started, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was like I guess we said
we were the animated podcast- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, our channel bio </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I think is a terrible anime podcast. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> If you go on our about
section that's what it says. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I always never gave a
fuck that much about anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wow, just come out and say it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, no, I always had
a genuine question for you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which is, do you see yourself
as an anime YouTuber? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - The thing is I think
because I see myself </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> in the same like realm. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - With like those people. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause you hang out with us, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I hanging out with you
guys, I watch a lot of anime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I make it, I think because I
make so many anime references </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and there's so much like anime
and like this Otaku culture </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in my videos, I guess I do. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But not in the traditional sense. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, 'cause like I don't
make videos about anime- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But that's the thing, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like nowadays you make
any content, that's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even if you make content
that's just like general </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or Otaku shit like you or hockey. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just because like I think
Otaku just equals anime now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, I think that the
people who watch my stuff </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> are people who consume anime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Right.
- [Garnt] Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - But I'm not necessarily
talking about anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I know it's weird, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because I've been like
as the OG anime YouTuber, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's so weird seeing anime
content on YouTube nowadays. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And this is just me thinking
out loud, but do people even </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> want to see as much like
anime content as much anymore? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And 'cause I feel like it's
been really weird seeing content </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on anime content on YouTube
in 2020, where it feels like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anime content doesn't even
perform that amazingly anymore. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Compared to doing like
anime themed content, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> as opposed to, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "I am going to make
content on a certain show." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's Otaku content now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, when we started the podcasts, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I was kind of worried,
I was like, Fuck it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They're going to like wanna
talk about anime every week </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I call it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, is that is technically speaking. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That is what we sought out to do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, 'cause I remember
when we were discussing it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember in my head, I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> "I'm just gonna like
bring up all this stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We'll just see how it does, right?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like it could have backfired so much. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's funny because the only
time I talked about anime most </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> is on the podcast with you guys, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Rarely do we actually talk
about anime off screen? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like there's more people like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I guess if you want to get into it like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> more people are way qualified
than us, to talk about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like just consuming anime, all
they do is talk about anime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> But I also, in my opinion like
when I do wanna consume stuff </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about anime, I often don't
want that kind of person, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who's just like, all they do is anime, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I kind of want like a monkey
brain person kind of opinion. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like a personality who
also love anime, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just want someone... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Which is why like I think
the only anime reviews </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I still watch which weird to say is, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I watch Critical reviews </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> because I know that when I'm getting that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm getting a review from someone- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, that's also like
someone like Critical </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can pretty much just
do content on anything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - But I think because I've
been on YouTube for so long </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and I've been throughout all
of my anime watching lifespan, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you will.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Whenever I wanted to see
if I wanted to watch a show </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I would just go and watch
a review from someone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who all they do is talk about anime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> All they do is consume
anime, Otaku culture. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's just really refreshing to now go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and watch someone who doesn't really care </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that much about anime but
they do like it a lot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like it's not their entire life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right, like it's just
like, I'm a normal guy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I do things, but I also
watch a lot of anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I feel like that
attitude really reflects </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on how you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how anime content performs
on YouTube as well, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's because I feel like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you only do anime
content and you like only... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel like because anime has gotten </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so much more mainstream
in the past few years </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's not so much about being an anime fan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Like there are definitely
channels that's, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm probably like one of the biggest </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where you focus solely on anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But I feel like there
you hit a ceiling, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You hit the ceiling of, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay, if you only target
yourself towards anime fans </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that community now is only so big, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but anime as a medium is
actually bigger than just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the anime community. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause like you can be
like a true anime fan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> follow seasonal anime
and everything like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But then there's like
a way bigger community </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that knows about anime and you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> watches the old anime show. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But they also don't have as
much of a vested interest. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Are you eight from that nomie guy? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Maybe I'm talking about nomies. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like they don't have a vested interest </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> or they're not as invested. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I basically gonna sum it up, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I like watching nomies reviews. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I should have said that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's the difference between anime fans </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and people who are fans of anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel there's like a
big difference, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause like an anime fan is
like someone where it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> anime is their life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like they love everything about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They'll watch anything, they'll
dedicate their life to it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then there are fans
of anime where it's like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I got the perfect word for this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> There are anime fans and
then there are weebs. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all chuckling) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, you are right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - You are just so fucking proud of that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm just like, I figured it out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I figured out the system. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - All right, you got it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - So just disregard
everything I just said. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, because, somebody is like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> as you were saying out- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's why I said that
like we like what you say, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> we are weebs- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, we are weebs, 'cause
like I was thinking to myself </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like what differentiates
someone like Critical </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from someone like in the anime community </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> because, it made me think,
remember the good old days </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of gate keeping and be- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You mean 2020? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, (chuckling) and
like the old days where like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you're not a true anime fan
unless you've watched XXX show. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey chuckling)
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like, oh, you're an anime fan, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> name me 20 different
shows that are now return- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - You are an anime fan
link me on my anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Then every anime on what Joey has done. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've done that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But I'm like, it's good that nowadays </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like gate keeping
especially in the anime community, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like, it's not died
but it's definitely way less </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> than it used to be. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> But I feel like someone like Critical </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like he has watched
a lot of anime, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And he does definitely- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think he actually
watches more anime than me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think he does as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> But I don't know like you look
at Critical and you're like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "You're not a weeb, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You're just a normal anime fan." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Felix was like that too. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like at one point he was doing
a bunch of like anime reviews </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and he was doing a lot of videos on anime </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm just like, "Okay,
I can tell you like anime, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but obviously your entire
life is not anime." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right, and I think that's why people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> really liked his review, 'cause
it felt like a very honest- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was like a new
perspective of opinions </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> on certain shows. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because I feel like when
maybe you're an anime YouTuber, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when you're reviewing an anime, it's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "I'm reviewing it because it's anime." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Whereas I feel like, if Critical, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or any other person makes review, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who doesn't talk about anime content. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It feels like they have something to say </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because they've gone out of
their way to make a video </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> about something normally
wouldn't make a video about, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to talk about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Whereas, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Garnt talking about Attack
on Titan season four, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of course, Garnt is gonna
talk about the att... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like it's expected and it's like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause he wants those views. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, but obviously I mean, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but if someone else does
it, right, it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, they must really like, be passionate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> about what they're trying to convey here." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And I think that's really refreshing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's something that,
I mean, maybe this is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> again this could be from
being an issue in myself. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I can understand the thought process </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of why they're talking
about it, but I don't know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I guess and that's why I
think I've distanced myself </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> from anime in some aspects, like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it's like not to
undermine the passion </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of actual anime fans, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, you know, I'm sure there's- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I still fucking love the cultured anime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm sure there's a massive amount </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> of like hardcore anime fans </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> who will make Attack on Titan videos </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because they genuinely love the show. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, of course, yeah, sorry. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not trying to say that everyone- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, of course, but like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No, I get what you're saying, it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> when you do see that anime
review from someone who </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you don't expects an anime
review from, it's just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, okay." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause like, looking
on the internet now, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> there's like so many low key
anime fans that, you know- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - They just like suddenly
coming out of the woodwork. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, I've always been an anime fan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it's like sometimes
you see these little hints </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> every now and again, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where it's like this
completely normal YouTuber </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you don't expect to
watch anime and like make </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a very subtle anime reference. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And you're just like,
wait, are you a weeb? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Did you have something to say? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's why I always get
like scared and surprised </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> when a YouTuber who I thought
had nothing to do with anime </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like follows me on Twitter. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, "Something's up,
do perhaps like anime?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Or maybe they've just seen like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "Wow, this guy likes a
lot of porn that I like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> maybe I should follow him back." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (both chuckling)
- Damn. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause I remember I was
watching like one of the latest </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Internet Historian videos
like a few weeks ago </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then like, you know,
it was a very normal </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Internet historian video
then right at the end, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> he was like giving some shout outs to like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> his other social medias. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then he mentioned like
streaming and everything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then he showed her a clip
of Corona and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Where did this come from?"
- Are you serious? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, he did, (chuckling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> its like right at the end as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> So it's at the point where
most people click off. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Good tastes, good tastes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm like, "Are you a
cultured individual too?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Would you like to come on to the podcast </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and talk about the goddess that is Corona? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, my God, (chuckling) Jesus. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause I'd be down. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, but yeah, I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just fascinating to watch, especially </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I'd say in like the last two, three years </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of just all these people
just suddenly coming out, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know saying- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - How'd you feel about anime
being like way more normalized? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - How do I feel about going mainstream? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, normalized, I was trying
to think of the right word. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause it isn't mainstream yet? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, that's the eternal debate. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, is it truly mainstream yet? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't think so. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It depends on your definition
of mainstream, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, it's not like
everyone's talking about 24/7 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but is everyone, you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, people argued
that like, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "All "Demon Slayer" was
trending on Twitter, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It must've gone mainstream." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I'm like, I don't
think it's mainstream yet. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think it's like about
three, four years away </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from like properly being
mainstream, I'd say. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know, I feel like
every time there's a big show </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it helps a lot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Its certainly on it's way. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, Attack on Titan season four </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> will hopefully help a
lot in terms of like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> "Hey, here's a completed
masterpiece," hopefully. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean the amount of
money that the fucking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Demon Slayer" movie
made in like the first, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like two weeks of it coming out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it's still like dwarf
numbers compared to like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Proper- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - The giant "Blockbuster"
four to $5 million </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in the first week, which is amazing, but- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean like, fuck it,
"Avengers" got like a billion </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> in like the first week of us, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> which is obviously like perish- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But then again if I had
Robert Downey Jr's voice </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> in "Demon Slayer" it
would probably get more. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And again, it is Japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> so it's kind of a very isolated market. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> So it's kind of hard to say
like how well it would do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's why I'd say that
it's still like a few years </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from being like properly mainstream. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But at this point it's
not like anime itself </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> isn't mainstream, but at least pretty much </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everyone knows what anime is now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's accepted world wide. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, there's never this
debate of, you mentioned an anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and people were like, "What the fuck? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What language are you speaking?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What is an anime? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What is an anime? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's weird because
I think that you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> there's 40, 50 year olds
online who talked to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who get all the anime
references and keep up with it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But then I've got 25 year
old friends in the UK </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who are like, "What's that?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like what's a dark note? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> What's that like?
(both chuckling) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What's a dark note. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, legit, like so it's,
I think we almost get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all like perceptions, especially us, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's because we are surrounded
by like-minded individuals </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to an extend, we're
surrounded by people online. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We never interact with
people really outside </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of the online bubble, even
when we leave our house, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we are normally going to an
event with other online people, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people who work in the
same industry, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But when I go back to the
UK or I go back to Wales </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I talked to my friends,
they literally have like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> no fucking clue about any anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Maybe there'll be like,
"What's that one punch man?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Or something, you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - But the fact that
they've heard about that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> is fucking massive. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - They might but they are my age, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I would expect them to be
like, "Come on, you are 24, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you should know what
date note is, come on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I mean like with titles like that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as long as you're on the internet, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's pretty hard to avoid, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, like it's weird. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause like when you go into
those kinds of social circles </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and you realize, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh," you don't spend
all your time on Twitter </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and seeing all that fucking drama </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and everything happening on online, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're just watching fucking
"Love Island" or whatever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And just- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (both chuckling) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I fucking hate reality TV. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's like a whole new world. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But even some people that I know who, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't spend any time on the internet </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and everything like that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> still I've heard of some
of these like bigger shows </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and to me that is still a massive step </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> than what it was even like five years ago. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And like going back 10 year- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because you had to
like seek out that shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - The reason I started
YouTube is to make friends </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> who I could speak to about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And now I don't really
want to speak about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean I do, I just- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Fuck these friends. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, again, going back
to the podcast, it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I did wanna speak about
it but I didn't wanna </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> make a whole podcast talking about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I wanna make a podcast
and talk shit about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, I think the only
reason why we labeled ourselves </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in anime podcast is because
all three of us individually </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> are already established in that field. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I guess it was like a comfort thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But then when we got in the flow of it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I think we realized that
like, I think us just chatting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> is like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, 'cause I remember
like when we first were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> conceptualizing this podcast we were like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "All right, let's just like,
maybe like the first like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 10 or 20 episodes, we
should like solely focus </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> on the stuff that people know us for. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then maybe every
now and then, you know- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The whole time I'm like,
I might not want to do this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So we'll slide IN some other stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then, you know
episode one rolls around, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> we don't mention anime a single time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think we only talked
about attack one time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for like 20 minutes on the first episode. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've watched a lot of animated podcasts. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've watched- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What do you think about them? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay, well this is the thing, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's only so much
you can say about anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And like, I feel like a lot
of the times it's like three </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> or four people who
regurgitate the same point </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with slightly different
wording back to each other. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They're like, "Hmm, yes. I agree." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it's like, "Okay, cool." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, some people, some
people are looking for that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> But to me it's like not exciting
anymore, I don't know why. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because there's so much of it out there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's too much
anime, and by the time... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've gotten to the point now where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't really have as
much time as I'd like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to do everything that I wanna do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So now I just wait
until the season's over. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like, right, so
it was the best show guys. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What was the show that was- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause I feel like
out of the three of us, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I've probably watch the most anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah you do, I'm the most
normal hee everyone knows that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, and we've got like a spectrum here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where Joey's like, "I don't
even watch anime anymore. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just read manga." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (chuckling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know they call The Anime Man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He's The Anime Man who
reads more manga like anyone. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like 2020 has been the year </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where I have watched the
least amounts of anime, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like in probably like last five years </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and that's partly due
to the fact that I feel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like 2020 has just been a
really weak year for anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It has yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like some variants
know the faults of like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the anime itself, it's just
the weld situation right now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where it's just less shows being made. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So it's just, it's been really weird </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> because I've been watching this anime </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've had to find my enjoyment
for like other things, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like Vtubers and gacha games. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's really like broadened my horizons </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to like other kind of anime
subcultures and everything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and like the weeb subculture
and everything like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - The Otaku just overall or Otaku cultures </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like really just expanding, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think just in general with
the success of, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the as you mentioned like the Vtubers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and gacha games and all that shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's just, I don't know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's really interesting to
watch especially as someone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who's been in that realm
for most of my life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do you find consuming
media in 2020 to be a bit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> worse in general? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Just due to the climate of
everything going on right now? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, I find that
consuming media periods </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> has become worse in general, I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because you kind of- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because of 2020, or just in general? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just in general. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel like there's
just too much media now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think it has to do
mostly with the environment </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that we're like placed in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like for a lot of
people consuming media </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is really the only
thing we can do to like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think that's almost like
a little bit about it as well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is that 2020s has just been so... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, everyone can
relate to this, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's been, shit, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Unless you are from the
future and you're watching this, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 2020 was a shit year. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's been kind of shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Every time like I have free time to do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, "Oh, this is free time, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I could've been doing something fun </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and doing something with my life, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I'm stuck here watching this anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've got nothing better to do." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's kind of sad, it doesn't feel like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm really choosing to
do it, it feels like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm doing it out of like, just like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like I got nothing better to do. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I, you know, what worries me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't enjoy anime, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Who fucking cares, but
at the end of the day, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just trying to explain
why I guess my enjoyment </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right now of like anime, especially </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's probably been the thing
that's dropped off most. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've definitely like, I
hate to admit it to myself </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but I've definitely had a
massive fucking burn out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with anime, like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just not only because
like this year's anime </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> has been kind of mid but
also just the fact that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah, I don't know, I've
just been doing this shit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for so long now where it's like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know, I made a video
like, like six months </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> into my YouTube career,
like five years ago now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Like why I don't watch much anime anymore. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (both laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I made a video, I think
it's actually still up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and in that video, I'm just kind of like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Yeah, like, I don't know, it's weird. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just started making YouTube videos </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I just don't watch
much anime anymore." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I kind of watch like two
or three a season at most. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And then I realized, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like I thought that
would go back to normal, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> never did go back to normal. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I've just been at that
same stage the whole time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel like that's just the normal cycle </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of a fucking anime fun. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, what I realized is like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when you first get into
anime or you have that period </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> when you start watching
a fuck ton of anime </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I thought it would be like, okay well- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - You thought that will last forever? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, I thought that, okay,
when that honeymoon period </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> if you will end it, I thought, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Well, you know maybe next summer </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when I have a lot of free time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it'll come back round." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I told myself that like
every year it just never has. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And I realized, oh, this is
just like the new normal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then when you wake up
first day of the summer break </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and you are like, I have nothing to do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (both laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel like it was a real tough for me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> This year especially
when I always felt like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I was behind on anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Well, like I don't have
enough time to keep up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with everything I wanted. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And then in the one year
where you have the most </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> free time to do whatever
you want it's just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> watching anime just felt
like a chore at points </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because you're just like
I'm not taking a break </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from something else. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I just feel like I'm doing this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I have nothing else to do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - If you start making
excuses, like, you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> when you were back at school
and you had to study, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, "oh, I have
to like clean my room." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I have to go shopping. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - This is hosting existential
episode of the podcast. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> What are we here for anyway? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> What are we doing? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Are we truly an anime podcast? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why do we watch anime? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - For fun? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, I don't know, like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, by the time when we were... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> This will be out, the
drifting episode will be out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then, you know, the,
the Calli episode to be out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and then we're filming another thing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's coming out soon. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Second special of the year. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I know we spent listen
to YouTube burnout, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I feel like a lot of my
energy that was once anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and consuming content has just been pushed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in different avenues,
and I feel like that's- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - All my energy has been
pushed into Trash Tastes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - And the game we spoke about that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't like talking about
topics I spoke about, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I guess I wanted to talk
about this topic in general, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> just because I know that
we get a lot of comments </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> being like, "Why don't we
talk about anime any more?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But then there's those
people on the other side of- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel like it's 50, 50. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, there's some people who are like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "I fucking hate it when
they talk about anime." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I wonder to the
viewers, do you prefer </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when we speak about anime or not? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, we're gonna
speak about it regardless </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when we want to, but it's
nice to hear your opinion. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, we wanna hear your opinions, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but at the end of the day
we're gonna talk about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> whatever the fucking we wanna talk about. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (both laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> But like, you know, but
that to me is just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> reassuring that we have
an audience that... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Because I always thought, "Oh
yeah like 99.9% of the people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who are subscribed to
and watch Trash Taste </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are only there because they like anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I mean, I thought
when we started the podcast, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I knew it was gonna be a risk, being like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> let's just talk about ourselves. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Let's just fucking talk
about life, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because there's someone
who's pigeon holed themselves </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> into that side of things- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - You never really spoke
about yourself publicly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I just wanted to 'cause I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Man, I flipped people-" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause I love myself. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (both chuckling) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just feel like I'm a gift. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all chuckling) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, 'cause on your chat </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I really thought that as a YouTuber </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that it was like this image
that people had of me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I really just wanted
to like talk about myself </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and help or not help. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just like, I dunno have
this image of the people... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The image people had of
me breath more truth, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so when they watch my videos, you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> they might see me behaving a certain way </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> but when they're go and watch Trash Taste, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they know what I'm really
like when I'm on the show. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Right? They know that it's- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, that's why I like
to preface it by saying like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> on Trash Taste, we're not
The Anime Man, Guk and CDwag. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We are Joey, Garnt and Connor. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because I like to think
that how you guys see us </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> on this show is the closest to reality </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of how we actually are. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Whereas like, you know,
on our main channels, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> of course like any good main channel, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> there's a performative side to it, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Where it's like, we're acting
as like that character. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - In my content on my main channel is like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> way different from anything
we do on Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And that's why like working on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> some of the more ambitious
projects on Trash Taste </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> has been like a breath of fresh air to me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause it's just something different. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Like the drifting video </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> was just a challenge all around. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, that was like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, that was a challenge
on every fucking end. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, we briefly talked
about like how much effort </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we put in that video but Holy hell, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I learned so much from
just doing the episode </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and just seeing all the little things </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you don't think about until
the day of the shoot, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - By the way, go check
it out if you haven't, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> link in the description. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, I already want to make more, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but also want some more help. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause like, I feel like being
in charge of all the tech </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> is so boring it's like,
what is Joey's might work, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and this is kinda work- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We need to start hiring like staff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We need a P.A. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> People living in Japan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We're hiring. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - But what are we saying, fuck it! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - About like the, is Trash
Tastes an anime podcast or not? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - So, we're just talking
about the evolution </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of the anime community in the past years </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and how how like Poplar has gotten, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> here's the question, where do
you see the anime community </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and the anime fandom in
like the next few years? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's really hard to say because I mean- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Honestly, same. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I think it'll be the same age. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You think it will be the same? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Roughly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think it would be the same </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but definitely we're
gonna start to see more </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as you put it, weebs than
actual like anime fans, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because I feel that the
whole genre of anime fans </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> is kind of like, I don't
wanna say it's dying, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's slowly becoming not as like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> in the spotlight as was before- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like saying you are an anime
fan is sounding more and more </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like you're just saying you're a gamer. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It just means nothing,
'cause everyone's gam... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, I remember when
I used to play online games </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like League of Legends </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I would make like a
weeb joke or whatever, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then like people would be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> "you're a fucking weed, you disgust us." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt chuckling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But now it would be like
one person in the lobby </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> who doesn't know the reference. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, I genuinely don't
think that much would change. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Soon we're gonna be starting... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We're gonna be calling
ourselves Otaku goals </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> instead of gamer goals, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (both chuckling) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, I'm an Otaku. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I wonder, do you ever think that maybe </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like the degenerate side
of anime might hold it back </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from going more mainstream? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I feel like that subculture </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> is always gonna be there because- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - If anything it's grown. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, 'cause right now
it's like people were scared </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that anime becoming mainstream would make </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> this degenerate side of anime, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like kind of calmed down a bit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But if anything, just because
there's so much more anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> being made nowadays, you
don't really have to pick- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Who the fuck thinks
that it would calm down </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the degenerative side? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, I've seen comments online too- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think the general stigma is that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - As someone who is in
this degenerate side. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You've seen how much Pokemon porn </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there is that shit? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> That stuff doesn't chill
out with more people. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - As someone on the degenerative side, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like seeing all these new
faces coming into these, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> just so wholesome, like
just pure hearted people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> coming into it, being
like, "What is hint eye?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm just like, "Let me show you." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Let me open your world. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I'm like the joker
and the guys are like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I love seeing people suffer through this, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and just realizing that the
world that they're living in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is actually burning from the inside. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Joey just wants to see the world burn. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I love seeing the world burn. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Alrighty then. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just be like let me
teach you a little thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about Dogan codes, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, but I feel like it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because the the big change I've seen </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is not in the content of
anime that's being made </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but just the sheer amounts
of anime that's being made. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like this season
we have like 38 shows </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there in the season. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just couldn't give a fuck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Which is like, if you try
to keep up with everything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's watching three seasons of anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in one fucking week who the is doing this? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> You know what I mean. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because 20 years ago, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think I remember this
from a video I made </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think 20 years ago </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> in like early 2000's each
season, we had seven shows. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Wow. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which is much more manageable. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, there was a period
like 10 to 20 years ago </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where you could you could
legitimately follow everything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that was going on in the season and be up, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> be kept up with like the conversation </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with what was coming out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because there wasn't that much to watch. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And now it's just, okay, what
kind of anime fan are you? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Do you like the mainstream
shown and stuff? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Do you like, you know,
degenerate stuff, idol stuff? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Whatever or like a mixture
of everything like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You could pick and choose whatever mood </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're in the mood to watch. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's an enemy for every
niche and every fetish now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - And the thing is like, I
feel like the quality of anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in general has gotten a little better </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> because everything like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel like everything's just good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You've got to stand out now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - And it's like TV,
like TV is so good now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Their is so many good TV shows </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that like every week
you're getting recommended </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a 9.5 out of 10. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> You're like, "Oh fuck yeah,
I mean, I barely finished </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> "House of Cards" and then
look what happened to- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - But like the problem
with that is it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the biggest first world
problem in the world, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when everything's good- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (chuckling)
- Everything's too good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - When everything's good
nothing stands out anymore. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Sometimes I watch a seasonal anime now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's like, this is
the biggest seven to eight </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> out of 10 in a season
anime and I just forget it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I compare these like
what I would call now, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> average shows, and I
compare it to some of like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the kind of like the mid
shows that I would watch </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> back when I was getting into anime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And they are like way better,
but for some reason I like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember watching like a show like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm going off the top of my head. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Maybe something like "Darker than Black" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which is also I fucking enjoyed that show, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it's like I think back and I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if that show had aired in our days </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it would just wouldn't stand out at all. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I kinda love that show. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's the thing though right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like normally in an out of 10 rating, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> five is the average and
it really says something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> when nowadays seven or
eight is the average. </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> (both chuckling) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm agreeing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I have to get up my phone,
but I've actually used, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> quite a while back when
I did promote Skill Share </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on my own channel, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I did do the Adobe Photoshop
CC essentials training course </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> because I sucked at Photoshop. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And this was a great way to
get very condensed guides </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on how to do certain things in Photoshop </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I still use to this
day, thanks to Skill Share. </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> - I'm scared. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm worried. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> When you put time, effort
and creativity into a gift, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it shows how much you care. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (both laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Give a gift that's one of a kind, </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> - Thank you Skill Share for sponsoring. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Back to the episode. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just going off from
what I was saying before, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where I feel like it's just
harder to consume media now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because just less things stand out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And there's so much
choice that sometimes... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You ever got to have a
point where you sit down, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you have like your lunch or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And you're like, "Oh, let's
put something on a lunch." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And then you spend like
15 minutes scrolling down </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> your anime list of you
have Netflix or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And then you are not finishing your lunch </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> by the time you like
finished scrolling down </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and looking at everything? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, (chuckling) yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just clicked the first thing
into my YouTube recommended </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's half decent. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Really.
- Yeah, 'cause I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> if I know I'm gonna be eating </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can put Netflix on, 'cause
I know I'm gonna eat the food </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with before the credits
even fucking finish. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I always have to put on YouTube, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but for me, it's the opposite, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I put on a video that where I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay, yeah I can rewatch that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's usually a video
that I know I enjoyed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I know I liked, but
has the re-playability </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I can watch it again during lunch. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So weirdly enough, I don't actually go out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and like look for new videos </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> during like a lunch break or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like, I need to be like in that mood </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> of like discovery, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Just what it sounds- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Before I go to bed, the amount
of times I've open Netflix </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and had luck and just be like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "All of these seem like
I'd probably have fun, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but fuck, I mean, I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I guess I'll put report of the week on, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and watch it on a fucking- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (both chuckling) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I dunno, like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Here is a question
for you though Conner, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you said you watch way less
anime now than you used to. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Would you say that maybe you
might be growing out of it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> in any sense of the world. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey gasping) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like it just doesn't fit
your lifestyle anymore? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - You maturing out of anime? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, no, I mean, I still love anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And like a bang of shows,
but I think I've just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know, stop
fucking lying to myself. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt chuckling) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I think because of
the position I was in. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I felt indebted to animate
like I had to watch it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know, back when I
first started I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "It's an anime, you
should have to watch it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> to keep up with it, you know?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I can be like, I can
keep up with the hot takes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But I think, you know, maybe
like two, three years ago </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I just kind of realized like,
I don't like doing this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just gonna watch the
biggest shows that come out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and enjoy them and have a great time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I love anime, like the way I can show- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But you don't care to like go out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and like discover the show is good or not? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, I have no ambition to do that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll just wait until everyone
agrees a show is good, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll watch it, 'cause I'd know
the show is gonna be good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've had so many experiences </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> where I've just watched an
animated that's so fucking boring </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I'm like, "Okay, I mean, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I guess "Decadence" was fine, you know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Did you watch "Decadence"? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I watched like three
episodes of "Decadence" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause everyone was hyping it up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, everyone was hyping it up is good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Connor sighing)
(Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I totally agree with him, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - There is so many shows nowadays, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which is seasonal anime and I feel like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people only hype it up
because it's a seasonal anime </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and nothing else to talk about. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> So someone's got to hype up something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it's really telling
because 90% of those shows </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like get hyped up while its airing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you don't hear about after it's finished. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I also just watch a lot more YouTube, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like I think on average </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I watch like 40 hours a week on YouTube. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I agree, I've
watched a lot more YouTube. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But it's a lot of YouTube. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The thing is right,
okay, YouTube tells me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause you can actually look on the app </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it can actually tell you how much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you should watch week. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it'll tell you how much
you watch on average day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It wasn't like four hours
a day I watch or something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on average least. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But like, I mean, like I said, 47- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm probably the same. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just haven't checked. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The problem is right? It's not- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's only the YouTube app? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, its only YouTube app.
- Ill check right now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Its like deep in the settings. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So I mean, I'll look
while I'm explaining it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I remember that their was a... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Because essentially right
when I go to the gym </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for two hours, cause I
have YouTube premium, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so you can, you can lock your
phone and listen to audio. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll watch YouTube videos
or just audio only. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So that's like two hours. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> While I take a shit, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you bet I'm putting the YouTube
video on for two minutes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> When I'm brushing my teeth, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> YouTube video, while I'm
in the bath, YouTube video, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when I'm working and it's not important, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't need to listen, YouTube video. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I have four
and a half hours daily. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - See, did you think you can
watch four hours YouTube? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, I've apparently already just today </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> watched three hours. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, I know that I watch
hell of a lot of YouTube- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Garnt doesn't wanna know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - If I don't look, I don't have to know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (both laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Dude, on Sunday, I watched
eight hours of YouTube. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Jesus. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't even remember doing that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, because here's the thing why like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've watched a 50
hours in the last week. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, because here's
the thing about YouTube </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is that it's just content on YouTube </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> is just that much easier
to consume, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause you know, when you have... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Do you have kind of like a
subconscious value system </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when it comes to like content. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So when you watch like a
Netflix show or something, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like you're sitting down </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you're paying the
fuck attention, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But when it's a YouTube video
you could be doing whatever </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you just can have it
on the in the background </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and just not really give
a shit about it, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I also like keeping
up with YouTube a lot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I think I'm way more
invested in like YouTube, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like as a- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - As a subculture? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, than anime, honestly, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like I've been following
YouTube like religiously </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for like seven years. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I know all like the drama, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everything that's ever
happened on YouTube. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm sure, like if we did a
quiz, I'm sure A stack wise- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Are you are YouTube fan? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm a big YouTube fan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I know exactly what you mean. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause it's exactly the same
in like every subculture </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> of YouTube as well, 'cause
like I know a lot Anitubers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who I swear spend most
of their time watching </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> other Anitubers as
opposed to watching anime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I feel like every Anituber </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> has been through that stage
where you find yourself </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> watching more Anitubes
than you do watching anime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it's like, I
could watch this anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> or I could watch this Anitubers
talking about that anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Exactly, and now it's just growing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from I watch other Anitubers </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just watch other YouTuber channels. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - In general, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Rather than like my anime consumption </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> has remained the same this entire time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But my consumption of like
watching other anime YouTubers </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and watching other YouTubers
has just grown immensely. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - And that's why I feel like it's so weird </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> whenever I see the comments </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you know the comment I'm
talking about where it's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh, I'm having trouble
keeping up with anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but a two hour Trash Tastes episode. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Give me that shit any day of the weekend, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I guess because it's
easy to digest, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I think with anime, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean Joey can relate to that you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the subtitles I can't
fucking focus you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like, all right, okay fine,
I guess I'll pay attention. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, I mean, I have to
focus on listening, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's true. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But I still, yeah...I mean- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know, I just it's sad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause I just don't wanna admit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I've fallen out of anime really, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think that's the saddest part. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right, especially because
you've like followed it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for all this time, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I guess it's kind of sad being... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I guess I'm just not into
anime as much as I used to be. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do you think that's because- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Part of growing up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do you think as well
that it might have to do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with the fact that you have grown up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> or is it the fact of like just the quality </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of the shows or like the
type of show coming out? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, we got better
anime now, let's be honest. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> The anime is better now than it was. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - But did you feel like maybe it's just, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you enjoy different kinds of media now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause, let's remove
anime from the equation </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but what's like the last TV
show you properly enjoyed, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anime or not? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Uh, "Great Pretender" I guess </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And that was like, that's an anime, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was like two, three months ago. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What the fuck I've I been watching? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - YouTube apparently. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause, here's what
I've realized, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when I find a show that I really enjoy, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's so rare nowadays because
we consume so much media, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but so much of it is
just fucking forgettable. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And that's why you like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you do watch a lot of YouTube, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But is that the same kind
of enjoyment that you get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> from watching some of your favorite shows </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that you remember from, you know, as a kid </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or when you're marathoning has shown </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you just really, really into it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I feel like just because
we can see more media </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> doesn't necessarily mean
that we value media the same </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, it's just, I feel like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> we've just programmed our
brain to never have dead space </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> so we're always consuming something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I guess 'cause of
the age of the internet </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and you know, being more
knowledgeable about anime </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> especially in opposition, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's almost commodified, so- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I guess it's kind of
weird, 'cause it's... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I think my motivation for
wanting to watch anime now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to just feel in the loop. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Not because I actually
want to watch that show. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which is why I've just
fully admitted to myself. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just only going to watch the big shows </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that everyone agrees with. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - But that's the thing, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, it definitely doesn't help </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> when everyone else around you is like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "Hey, have you watched this show? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Have you watched this show? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Have you watched this? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Or what are your thoughts on this show?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because to us it's different now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> because it was just like
anime has become a job </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and someone who watches
as much anime as me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like I can see a show and I can be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "I can see that this is a good show." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I can break it down to be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Yeah, I know why I know
why this is a good show. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I know why people are hyping this up." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But when you reached a
point where you kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> become part of the seasonal cycle, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you kind of see the patterns. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> There's always these, the same- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You are turning it into
a fucking conveyor belt. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I had that exact experience
when I went to go watch </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> "The Damon Slayer" movie, I was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I took one look at the
poster and I was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I know exactly what's
gonna happen in this movie. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, exactly, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like just from like,
"Oh yeah, this character </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is gonna do this and this
character is gonna do this." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And sure enough, I was like
90% correct on what happened. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And like, is that a good thing? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Or is it, I mean, I still
enjoyed it, but it's, you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The whole like wow factor
was completely gone, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I think that's the entire reason why </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've kind of been burned out on anime </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I've been much more into manga </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because like nowadays, especially nowadays </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everybody is talking about
every anime that matters. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's almost like an escape pool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But the manga side of things
because like 90% of manga </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't have translations,
it's still a mystery. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's what the anime community was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 10 years ago.
- Like 10 years ago. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I totally agree and that's why like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I love going into the world of manga, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause in anime you don't get that feeling </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of discovering that hidden gem any more. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's no feeling of discovery
because everyone knows </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> where everything good is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know what's gonna
come out three seasons. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's no surprise anymore. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like even when there's a good show </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I can recommend
someone watching the season </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to me I'm just like, I can
tell this is a good show </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I can tell people would enjoy it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But I don't enjoy it in
the same kind of like, wow </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> this is something new to me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, "Okay, this is just
a very solid show this season </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I recommend people watch
it if they wanna experience </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> X kind of thing." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But when I go into manga, I'm just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "I don't know, what's gonna be good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'd know what's gonna be bad." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - The amount of times
I've like finished reading </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a manga series and I've said to myself, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "How was no one talking about this?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Is way more than any amount of
anime that I've ever covered. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because again, like that whole mystery of- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's an event as well, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like, you know, it's
coming out the season. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It's one of the things you're
watching weekly, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, manga is so ongoing
that it's hard to, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I think, have that kind of hype for it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like there's way more
choice with manga as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's such a vast world that- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That fucking love it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't feel like anyone's gonna be able </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> to read everything, so- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Challenge accepted. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (both chuckling) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Actually, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like you said, first-world
problem is the podcast. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (both chuckling) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> My toilet seat temperature
is one Celsius, off my luck, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what can I say? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm dead, I'm dead. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, I mean, it's totally is, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel like a problem that has come </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> with this new generation
where there's just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so much to do so much to
watch, it's impossible- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's too much to do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's too much to do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like that whole fucking
meme of like, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> white people rewatch in the office </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for like the 10th time, it is just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's funny, I'll laugh- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (all chuckling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've rewatched " Always
Sunny in Philadelphia" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> more times than I can fucking count. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Its funny basically, like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Actually though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I liked that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - All right now.
(all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But I feel like, because there's so much </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we've desensitized ourselves
to so much as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And like, you know, I
look at someone like you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who probably watches
more content, more media </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> than you ever have in your life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But thinking back about
what's actually memorable </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> its like hard, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I like... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You, I think you were
like, "What the fuck?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Like when I play League
of Legends or play games </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I watch YouTube videos
on the other like screen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I can't do that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I can't do that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You can't? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's the same as
people who can, you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> watch a TV show while reading a book, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like, how do you do that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's fucked up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, right. It's
like, how do you do that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Or like listening to music
while reading a book. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I can't even do that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I can do that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I can't do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay, here's the question. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Do you remember the first time
you watched a YouTube video </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> at 1.5 or two times speed? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, I've never done it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Have you ever done that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Of course, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've never done that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I realized, I... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I realized why
would I ever want this? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That just means I'm not
enjoying the content </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> how it's supposed to be like enjoyed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then I realized, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Wait, I could just consume this content </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in a faster, in like a
shorter time period." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And then- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - There are people who
legitly watch every video. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then I realized it was like a habit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like that was subconsciously
forming and then realize, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Wait, I'm not even fucking
enjoying this content anymore. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Literally, I'm just watching
it just to keep up." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, "That's pretty fast." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause that's kind of like hacking my mind </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> into what entertainment
is at the end of the day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I do think time- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's slowly turning
into like an info Wars. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What is entertainment? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Are we consuming too much media? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I do think times too
should be reserved for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> shitty tutorials that
take too fucking long. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all chuckling)
too long to explain. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I totally agree with you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't trust anyone
who opens up a tutorial </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and doesn't immediately
skip to two minutes in. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like there's so many fucking
channels that are like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Tutorial is like, "Yoh, what's up guys?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and like, you should not... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Tutorials should not be
allowed to do intros. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You should basically just tell me what- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just give me the information. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, just fucking,
get right into it, dude. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Like "hey, what's up guys
I'm uploading daily content. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay, next week I'm live streaming. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm gonna be talking about." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I remember the other day
'cause I was trying to like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> fix something with my cam link, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, "Okay,
I need to figure out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> some issues with my cam link." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And there was this video,
which was like, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> five issues with cam
link and how to fix it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was like a 10 minute video. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, All right, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like maybe it's like
two minutes each, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It doesn't need to be 10 minutes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I'm like, dude, this dude like legit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I swear to God for the first six minutes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He was just plugging all the shit, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and like trying to add
like jokes and stuff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And he's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "All right, let's get into
the meat of the video." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like, "There's
only four minutes left." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> How are you gonna talk about five problems </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and how to solve them in four minutes? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh my God, dude. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - You know, it's a big
issue, when even like... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause you can Google this stuff </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and Google will show
you the video results. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And it'll literally skip to the point </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where it thinks tutorial actually starts. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Which is like, if Google
is automating this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> why do people think that anyone else </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is gonna fucking watch it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I remember like 2010 when
it was like video game, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like, "Oh, where's this thing
or how to do this thing." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Always watch a video, the
video will show you exactly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> how to do it and we'll jump right into it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But now it's kind of like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No commentary. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Now it's going backwards where I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I guess I'll click the forum first </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and see if I can get the
information in 10 seconds." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So I'm gonna click on this
20 minute video and fuck, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I see the same operating system. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> "I don't care about your
cam link jokes, all right, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just tell me how to fix my
fucking cam link, please." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can give all the times
that I've had like a tech issue </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's some guy with
like the thickest accent </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like trying to explain them like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay, fuck, what is he saying? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Times two?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - And he's like literally
swallowing the microphone as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So like, even at times
two-speed it's like, "I can't." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And you have to go down
to the comments to see </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if someone's like
paraphrase it in some way. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know what I hate? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> YouTube has started doing
a thing where you can... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, they've done it for a while </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but if you're a foreign channel, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so I could put like French titles. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So that was just one more, it was a guide </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I clicked on it and I'm pretty sure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it was like an Indian
guide fully in like Indian. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, "What the fuck? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Why is the title in English?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like how to fix your
Android five problem. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like sick, "That's
exactly what I want." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I click on it and he
starts talking Indian, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm like, "What the fuck?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And like, there was no
subtitles or anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - So I was like, "Who,
Why, why would you do this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because it like auto
translates the titles, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But you have to approve that I think. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, but like, I've done that before </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with like, 'cause I watch
like a lot of Japanese videos </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as well with like Japanese titles </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and for some reason every now and then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's a video where if I search for it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's displayed in Japanese. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But the moment I click on it,
the title turns to English. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is it the dude who makes
the knives out of shit? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - That one too, but also there's
like a bunch of just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a lot of like
Vtube clips, for example </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> are written in Japanese,
in the search bar. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> But then the moment I click
it, it turns to English. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I've noticed that as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And I feel like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Which is why I feel
like YouTube getting rid </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> of close captions is like
my biggest fucking mistake. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know why they're doing it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - There were like 0.5% who use them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, "That's still
0.5% of how many million, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who won't? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that's insane guys. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The entire YouTube
community's crying right now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How about we make it, hm, worse? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Are you saying we have to hard Saab- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Our videos? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Hard saabs, eww. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know, that feature that allows me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to conveniently change subtitles </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> depending on which language- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh wow, that would be stupid, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Let's get rid of that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (chuckling)
- Uh, fuck you? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can use serve dumb something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Jesus fucking Christ, I can't believe it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Stop changing YouTube. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Stop changing for the worst. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Stop changing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They're like, "How about we
do the 50th logo redesigned </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to more minimalism. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The color red is now our logo, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but let's take out all the good features." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's like, "Oh, okay. I guess, yeah." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Jesus, they take so many ELLs. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Remember they did the,
like, what was that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What was the funniest one? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The YouTube heroes do remember that one? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, my, what was that again? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like they were gonna
like make mods basically </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> out of like YouTube users
where they could like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh I remember that.
- I remember that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - There was a fucking
mess, it was so funny. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (all chuckling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Thank God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - All right, here's the
question to you guys then? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Because I don't know if
I'm like, just getting old </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> or is if this is just like, boom at all. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But do you feel like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the golden age of the internet has passed? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Or has there even been a
golden age of the internet? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think the wild wild West has gone. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, definitely. Like-
- Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - If I were to say, I don't know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> because like golden of something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is such a fucking subjectifying- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What do you defines as golden age? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Its so subjective-
- In the best period. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - But like this period based on what? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Like-
- I mean, it's subjective. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, right, based on like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> your personal experience with it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or like best like objectively, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or like based on something or other. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, because I can argue that like, okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like my personal golden
age of the internet </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> would be now because it's- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Its just easy to use now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's just easy to use. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, you know, you
can get any information </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with anything and everything
is so conveniently laid out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But best experience in terms
of like, my overall enjoyment </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of it would be like the mid 2000's, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because that was like
the golden age of like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> new grounds and like flash games. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And like, that shit was so fucking fun </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and none of that exists anymore. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, now when I
download something I'm like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> 99% sure it's not a virus. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Whereas back then it
was the opposite ratio </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Where I was like, "This is virus, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I really want that cool mouse though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That mouse popped up really
cool with the sprinkles. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I really want that." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - "I wanna turn my cursor
into like a little cat." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - "I think I want nine
toolbars," you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember the horror where
my mom showed me her laptop </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and I thought I fuck one of her pieces. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But she had like four
internet Explorer tab. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Like fucking toolbars,
and I'm like, "Oh God." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt chuckling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, you know, like at
the time, like I hated it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> But you know, the, the reminiscent </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like times of like going onto my mom's PC </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> having to swim through all
the pop-ups just to get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to where I needed to go to, was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I hated it at the time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> But now I look back and it's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh yes, internet do
used to be like that." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because I feel like
everything now is, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it's everything is more
formulaic, more clean. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'd say everything
has been like optimized. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> As we were saying, it's like the internet </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> has definitely been optimized, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you know, that's why
I bring up the argument </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of like was it better when it was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> had this charms, when you feel like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you are discovering something new </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it felt fresh, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Or now that everything's formulaic, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everything's laid out, everything's clean. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That it's just less fun. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, the whole, like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> As I was saying earlier,
like the whole like mystery </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of like discovering a new anime, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like back then in like the mid 2000's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was like fucking
great because it was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> going into a goldmine that
hadn't been discovered yet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - And like, you know,
it was the whole thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but at the same time it was
a double-edged sword, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was like, do I dare click on this anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to try and discover it with
the risk of possibly getting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know, like seven Trojan horses </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> coming into my house, you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, do I take the risk? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, oh, wild,
wild West, here we go. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But nowadays it's like,
if I click on the link </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like I'm fairly certain,
I'm gonna get something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's probably going to be something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've already heard off, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The entire mystery of it is gone. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, Oh my God, the fucking... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The amount of time I spent on
like newgrounds, for example </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> just going through just the
most shittiest of cartoons </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and flash games to find that one game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or cartoon where it's just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I'll never fuck-" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do you remember the
first time you discovered </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like the fucking stick
figure fights on newgrounds? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it was just like the best ever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You're like, I don't
need top 10 anime fights, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I have like jaljao, whatever
the fuck he's called. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (both chuckling) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Dude, the moment I discovered </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "The Ultimate Showdown
of Ultimate Destiny." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (screams)
- Oh my God! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like that shit, when
I found that I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> "This is peak internet,
nothing will top this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> no movie or experience will ever top this? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - That was the song, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> ♪ This is the ultimate
showdown of ultimate destiny ♪ </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - This thing I've had
the Harry Potter puppets- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, same guy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> When I first discovered
that I was like, dude, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> this is my entertainment
for the next 20 years. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, I will never get bored of this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt chuckling) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know if it's because
I'm just tired as fuck, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in like a shitty mood in general. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just, it's sad, the internet now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know, I just feel like
I'm fucking fatly injected </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like a stream of content constantly, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> especially on like Facebook and Twitter. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just like, I just
scroll, and I'm like (sighing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Ever thought about detoxing? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It feels like you need a detox, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because when you start multitasking
with your entertainment </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's when I'm just like,
"Okay, maybe this is too much. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm not even enjoying this anymore." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> When I'm having a league
game, and a YouTube video, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and music on the same
time, you're just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're not enjoying any
of these singular things. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know if it's out there, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know if it's just because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the way that the like Facebook
and Instagram and Reddit, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> they're all set up where it's just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like permanently feeding you something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Where like, even if I detox </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> from at the moment I get
right back into it, like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just gonna be the same shit again </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> where I feel like, I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like I'm constantly
being like manipulated now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like legitimate needs, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like serial experiments systems. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, it is, I mean like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - These systems know exactly
what we wanna fucking say, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and they know what's gonna
make us luck and it works. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I feel like back then it was exciting, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and it was really like
rough around the edges, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I didn't mind talking to strangers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (both chuckling) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Remember that room when you didn't mind </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> talking to a stranger and be like, "Hey-" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I missed the times of like
booting up MSN messenger </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and seeing like 70 like
friend requests from people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I had no idea, I'm like, "I'm
sure these are nice people." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I too made some friends who like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I still too keep in touch
with one or two of them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who are like complete random people, I- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I like made really good friends with. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I met them in person as well,
like that was really genuine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And it also felt because it
was rough around the edges </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it was normally a
very small team making </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> these huge websites, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, it didn't feel
like anyone was trying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to take advantage of anyone,
it was just a community. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Now, it feels like,
yes, there is a community </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I'm also just a fucking like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> just one of those fucking
chickens in the pen </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just like, "Oh, please give
me a drop of water, please. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I can get real fat for you, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you can sell my advertising money." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know what I mean? I just feel like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The social, close cooperate scums. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I would feel like a chicken in there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I honestly feel that
attention fatigue nowadays </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is a real thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - where like you talk about you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just wanna get up a game
of league and just do it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the beeping and it boops, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all chuckling) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And that's because you just
want something that's familiar, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it doesn't take a lot of
effort, you know how it works. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause that's like, just
because the internet nowadays </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> has become so good at
getting your attention. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's just like, I got I
some serotonin for you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I got some serotonin for
you right here, right here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Just take a sling- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, like it'll be
like, Twitter will be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> "Hey a tweet you missed." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it'll pop up as a notification, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, Don't do that,
stop, stop that, stop. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause remember when
going onto the internet </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> was like a fucking event? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, "All right,
Mom's out of the house </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> which means she's not using the phone. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Which means the dial up is gonna be just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a little bit faster, let's go. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I had a real like fucking
moment the other day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Audio listeners wouldn't
be able to see that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I like fell back a little bit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I remember that like, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> let's say you posted
something that blew up, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Now, you'll know immediately. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Do you have to log out of
a website, log back in, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> check that inbox, You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like weird, I just
remembered that we did that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, I just like
recently upgraded my computer </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> as we established last episode. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And like I had to log back into everything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it really like said
something when I was like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I haven't logged out yet. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Shit, what's my password again? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt chuckling) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because everything just
stays logged in, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I'm like, I swear, like out
of the 10 something websites </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that I had to log into like eight of them, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like forgot password. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Both chuckling) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I don't know
which YouTuber it was, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they messaged me and I
didn't reply for a whole day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I just stopped
replying to like messages </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on like a Saturday or a Sunday,
whichever day I'm feeling. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't mean just trying
to take one day off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I ignore like, I guess not important. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like if it's business-related
or like even like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> YouTuber friend's, I'll
just ignore it for a day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I'm like, I just
want to chill, play games, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not have to worry about
work or anything like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just kinda, yeah, that's what... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I thought Mayline was
laughing but she was coughing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Pathetic, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everyday is business.
- Stop fucking dying Mayline. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, I don't know like, and
I remember they were like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh, that's weird." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, "Is it weird
that I don't wanna be like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> communicated to every fucking day? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean it gets tiring. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. I don't know, I feel weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm I fucking boomer? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm a boomer now? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Shit, maybe I'm a boomer dude. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Don't say boomer, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when you're the youngest
person in this room. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like a boomer when
I'm looking at my fucking phone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is like, "Hey, here's a
post you missed on Reddit." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, "I don't care." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've never cared about any of those posts </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's recommended, ever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Like stop recommending me, I can probably- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I genuinely wonder, if some
people get those notifications </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like, "Oh, I'm glad they
fucking notified me." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (both chuckling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It must work because they keep doing it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like it must have a rate of
success that's worth doing it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's fucking annoying. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I guess so, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I can probably turn
off somewhere, I should- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I turn it off. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I just don't know, I probably- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause it's too much effort to find out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how to turn it off, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like I could unsubscribe from about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> 50% of emails I get, but
it's like, Oh, for fuck sa... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just delete it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, it's like a natural joke reaction </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but I should probably just unsubscribe it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> get rid of it, but I don't- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It sounds like you do
actually just need a detox from- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - How do I do it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> What if Mr. Beast is giving
out a million dollars </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> every day on Twitter, when I'm not there? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I need to ratio him,
to get that $10,000- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - What if its just Connor
will be the one day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where something big happens? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know you just
don't care for a while. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You just try not looking at your phone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for an entire fucking day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I need an incentive,
I can't just do that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> That's hard. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just get good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - If you give me a challenge, I'll be- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean like, this is
like properly talking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to like fucking addicts talk, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause like, do you feel
like you have a problem </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because if you don't think
you have a problem, then- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Everyone I know has a problem, Garnt. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know anyone who
is in the same situation </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where they're like, I
love my social media feed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I love logging into Instagram
daily and checking the story- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, but- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I can't wait to check my stories. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Have you ever heard someone say that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But you've got to understand </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that we are in a very unique
position where this is our job, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so we never have a break from it ever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's the equivalent to
an office lady being like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, I can't wait to
check my emails today." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just think everyone's
in the same position. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just think people just don't
wanna fucking check that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Everyone everyone's in the same position </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> but there's different severalties of it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, we have... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay, the difference between
us and like most other people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is that we have a vested
interest to keep up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with everything because it's our job. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like if someone misses
a fucking YouTube video </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> or fucking like YouTube drama,
it doesn't matter for them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> For us it's just like,
it's the equivalent for us </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of you know, being that stockbroker. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Reading the stocks every
day, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Shit, it went down my point 1%. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (both laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, that's exactly what I'm talking. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> That's like the equivalent of like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the situation for us, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And you've got to realize that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah, it's hacking your brain, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you are becoming dependent on it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because it's also part of your job. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> You have a vested interest
to keep up with everything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But it is like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It doesn't matter how
much you like your job, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at the end of the day,
it's still your job. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So eventually whether you like it or not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's gonna be some
parts of a way, just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> "Ugh" you know, like think back to when </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you first started YouTube, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you first started up your Twitter account </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you were like fucking excited to check </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you got a notification. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean yeah, maybe I guess.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like every YouTuber is like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Every YouTube who starts off </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and like starts to get some
amount of like numbers, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and has a Twitter is always
excited to go onto the Twitter </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> to see if they got like
a reply to something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or how many people like their thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But we've been doing it for so long now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where it's just like, you know
the same over and over again. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay, think of it this way. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Do you know any other
YouTuber, actual YouTuber </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who hits the bell notification? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey chuckling) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know what I'm saying? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - On a YouTube channel? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah, I do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Wait, you do? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, which ones? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't want to miss </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like an Internet Historian video, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I wanna know- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's pretty hard to miss, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> he uploads like once every three months. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, but I want a notification
on my phone when he does </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> so I can, like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I wanna be the first hundred viewers. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Have you also noticed
that YouTube recommendations </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have been kind of shit recently? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, I think they've been the opposite. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Really, they've been better? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think mine have been
garbage recently, I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Maybe because you're
watching garbage content. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt chuckling) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, there, I said it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Maybe it's because- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - No more Anime Man videos to me then, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm done watching The Anime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, I feel like just because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you've watched so much YouTube. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Actually that could be it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know that you just run out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You run out of all the good one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - You just run out of content, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's true. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, it's true
like any medium, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fuck, maybe you are right, Garnt, fuck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, my recommenders has been great </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> because I've just been
watching Vtube clips. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> So all of my recommenders, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just Vtube clips I haven't seen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just watch streams at that point, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, I mean, I do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, but sometimes I
don't wanna go through </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> a three hour stream to watch
five minutes of it, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - True. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean in my mind and I feel like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the best YouTube recommendations is like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know the one video it gets recommended </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's just like a sub minute video </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that has like 5 million views. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> They're always ended up being amazing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like my favorite YouTube genres now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is that a title that it
says exactly what is there, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a video that does exactly
what it says on the title. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I remember, like I
saw a video the other day </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that was like, ducks
annihilate a bowl of peas. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just like, "All right,
this can't be right." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's just a fucking two
ducks, just annihilating </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> this bawl of peas. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm just like, this is
peak YouTube content right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's like Twitter content, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like Twitter videos
put on to YouTube. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But in terms of like
YouTube recommendations, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean there's only a certain
set of content creators </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that like I would say, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> make content that you
are very invested in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And you're like getting excited over </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> when they upload and- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You always have that like, boom, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Of like a certain type of
content, like inside of you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - And we can talk about the
YouTube as we like on next week. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just gonna be the YouTubers episode. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - We're gonna talk about
our favorite YouTubers. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's gonna be the
giant shout out episode. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (both chuckling) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - But yeah, I mean, like, I
think YouTube recommendations </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> comes in like waves, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause you like... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> All it takes is like one
video and you are recommended. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then you like recommended... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Your recommendations are
like good for like a good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like few days. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause you're like, "Oh, this
is a new kind of rabbit hole </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've found myself in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But when you're in that like low moments </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when you end up watching so much YouTube, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then you just end up watching- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You've exhausted the recommended. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know, what sucks
about living in Japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is that everyone uploads
while we're sleeping. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> So when I wake up I
already know all the videos </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that are gonna be uploaded during my day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> But from people I'm subscribed to. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> So I already know like the
best videos when I wake up, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> so I can watch all the best videos </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in like the first hour,
hour and a half, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then I have nothing else. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> While I was living in
the UK they were like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> coming up gradually during my evening. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> So it was always like,
"Oh, this videos, okay, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> go back and-" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, I've had that
problem my entire life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I know, I mean I know your tim... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh, well Australia. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We're only one hour difference, so. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's so weird for me, 'cause it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh wait, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> So all the videos are out in the morning </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I've watched all in the morning. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's what I like about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's that like you wake up in the morning </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and all the content is there for that day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - But it sucks, when I'm
in the middle of the day </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I wanna watch something,
and there's nothing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> no one's uploading anything, so. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right, but then that's why- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've never cared about that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause I've always just- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I cared about that Garnt, clearly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause I'm talking about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Shit, that means YouTube
upload schedules actually matter? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Joey forgot to plug in his PC. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Shit, that means YouTube
upload schedules actually matter </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I thought everyone
was like me who just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> watches videos indiscriminately- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just upload whenever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, and just like, Oh,
I'll just watch this video </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> when I feel like it, I don't
care when it's uploaded. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I care when it's uploaded. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Fuck, again, I don't so
much care when it's uploaded </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because for me, like my entire
like idea of YouTube content </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> for that day has always been
like wake up in the morning, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like go down my sub-list be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "All right, I'm probably
gonna watch this video, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this video, this video. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then I usually just like, watch it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> as I'm like having breakfast
or getting ready for the day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then once I've exhausted that selfie </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> then I'm like, alright,
now I can go on with my day </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and actually do productive shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like out of the way now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just can't do anything
until I've watched </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all the good videos today. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I need my fix of selfie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Honestly, I don't think there's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that much good content out there where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just like, I need good con... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I don't, there's not enough content </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> out there that's good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in my mind that can keep me entertained </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> every day, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There's like certain
YouTubers where I'm like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "It's a bang of video and I
know I'm gonna enjoy this." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But most of the YouTube
content you watch is just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fills the time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] True. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And that's just it, and it's just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can this fill the time
without me getting bored? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is it not weird that like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know if this is just me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but like has it gotten
to the point now where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the sub feed has
just basically turned </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> into like a timeline just to
see what everyone's doing? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know? It's kind of
like a YouTube timeline. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, all right, let's see
what people are doing today. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] True. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And it's like, you don't
watch 80% of the videos </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that are on your selfie,
but you just do something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> because you're wondering like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> "All right, what are they up to now?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's weird how that's become- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel bad when don't
watch a YouTube video. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (chuckling)
- Oh, my God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - We're all very tired today. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - We're all very tired. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is probably been the most tired </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that we've all been for
Trash Taste episode. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I slept horribly,
Garnt went to bed at 6:00 AM </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and Joey's tied too. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm always tired. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - But you were saying you feel bad when? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel bad when I don't
keep up with YouTube </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> especially if I know that I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh man, I just I didn't
watch that new video of you, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm sorry, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Fuck, I'm a bad friend." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Have you always done that though? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> With like, YouTuber friends? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I try to keep up with
what my friends make, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I try to keep up just
so I can like be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh nah man, nice, you killed it." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like if they did
something really ambitious </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'd have to let them know, be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> "Hey man, you fucking
killed it bro, nice." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know if that's a rare thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause my general understanding is like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> again it's like people
just sub to you to like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, show support of course. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But also to be like, just
to see what's up with- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It might be different for every viewer, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like this one, I'm sure
not everyone watches </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> every episode of Trash Taste, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Or cares about when it
comes out, like I'll give- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Even though you should. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> You should be watching
every Trash Taste episode. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Anyway, this has been
a very weird two hour. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I hope you've enjoyed the
two hour therapy session </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> between the boys. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, this has been like the least, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like I feel like exciting episode. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We're all just tired of shit, we are like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "What are we fucking doing now?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's just basically
just addicts anonymous. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like-
- I'm addicted to this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Hello, Internet, I'm
addicted to the internet </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I need to take a
break and conscious' like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I don't have an issue,
I don't know where you... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh, maybe I do have an issue, oh okay." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like the shittiest
addicts anonymous, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like, "I don't have an issue, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> therefore you don't
have an issue, fuck you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - My league issue, my YouTube issue. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What's the next, dude? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like you want me
to fix your league issue? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just quit, just stop. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - This heroin is still good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (all chuckling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - To bring some positivity
back into the podcast though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, 'cause we need that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - What?
- Heroin. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Mayline] Like the drug? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, heroin is a drug Mayline, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> That was the joke. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> The joke is that heroin is
better than all those things. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Confirmed, Mayline doesn't
count heroin as a drug. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Mayline] Like heroin,
like, you know, character. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, not a he... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> No.
- No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Mayline's equally as tired as us. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Going down a pint of- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all chuckling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - A pint of cocaine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yes to bring some positivity
back into the podcast. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We got spare... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> We were send something
super special this week. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Did we? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I guess we did. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Bring it out onto the table. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - On the sub Reddit and the
Twitters, this post blew up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that somebody made a nice
little a quilt for us. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Actually, I think it's
actually a quite large. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, it's a large. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> There was also a letter
included from Shelby, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I believe, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Shelby from Cali, yes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I did read it, Shelby. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, we did read it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> We're not gonna read
it out on the podcast, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it was- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Tear that boy open, boy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We read it though, all right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So I think there's different
gifts for different people. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh, I mean, I assume this is the- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, this is the main. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, while you guys opening that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll just go ahead and explain. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We don't have a PO box
and we probably won't. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've had a PO box before
and although it is great </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> receiving stuff, it's
also equally frustrating </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> figuring out what the
to do with all the stuff </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you get sent. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I have so much food go stale on me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so much fruit go bad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel like opening
PO box is kind of like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, like opening
your first discord, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's sounds great in theory. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> But then when you get to
a point where you get sent </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> too much stuff that it's manageable. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's when it becomes
a second job basically. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We are like super grateful that people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who wanna send me stuff- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But that doesn't mean
we're not grateful. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We know you guys wanna send us stuff </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and everything like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Just at this point, we just
want less things to manage, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yes, its the worse thing to worry about. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But like when we see
something cool like this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like get posted on a radio or something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> we just wanna see- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Holy fuck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh shit.
- Jesus. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Holy shit that's huge. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's the wrong way around. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The wrong way round. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Holy fuck, that's confidential. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Audio users can take that
out of context if you like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Wow, that is... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Audio users what you're
looking at right now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is just a giant Trash Taste quilt. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh my God, that's actually amazing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What the fuck? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Shelby? What the fuck? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But thank you Shelby so much. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Thank you Shelby.
- [Garnt] Thank you Shelby. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Thank you so much. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Holy shit shout out
to Shelby what an MVP? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's like two other
gifts here as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Key rings, I believe
they were Shelby's message. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Should we open them as well? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yes, so the key rings are for Mayline, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you and I, there is a key ring for Mayline </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> which is the pink one,
a silver one for me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Green one for Garnt- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And see here, it say
he says J-G-C and M. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all chuckling) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - So, there is your C. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fantastic. </SPEAKER_02>

coolest gifts I received. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, Mayline, this is

<SPEAKER_03> - Mayline loves cats by the way. </SPEAKER_03>
