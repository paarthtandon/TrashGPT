<garnt> white water rafting it was like playing </garnt>
<joey> a cut scene that's that's basically what </joey>
<joey> our rafting trip was like </joey>
<joey> like we had to we had to like paddle </joey>
<joey> like the maximum was like three times </joey>
<joey> right right and then the rest was just </joey>
<connor> floating downstream </connor>
<connor> it did feel like a shitty uh house at </connor>
<joey> the dead cutscene right </joey>
<joey> ask secret is what you press like the </joey>
<garnt> gun once </garnt>
<garnt> yeah we had like that quick time event </garnt>
<garnt> where you had to press </garnt>
<garnt> x three times and then that was like </garnt>
<garnt> that was like the interaction with the </garnt>
<connor> cutscene </connor>
<connor> at one point they were like yeah you can </connor>
<connor> you can jump in the river and then they </connor>
<connor> were like yeah so you wanted to </connor>
<joey> put your foot in me and god just [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> jumped in head first but then i didn't </joey>
<joey> realize </joey>
<joey> it was like this deep so i immediately </joey>
<joey> was like yes </joey>
<joey> it's my time and i just like jumped in </joey>
<joey> and [ __ ] slammed my helmet into the </joey>
<joey> floor </joey>
<garnt> i'm pretty sure they were going to warn </garnt>
<garnt> us that it was too shallow but the </garnt>
<joey> moment they said you can jump in </joey>
<joey> before they can explain anything else me </joey>
<connor> and connor just like jumped head first </connor>
<garnt> because it was so hot and we were just </garnt>
<connor> dying to jump in i really </connor>
<connor> really wanted to jump in the water the </connor>
<connor> whole time </connor>
<connor> oh my god but joey went on vacation with </connor>
<connor> his other friends can you believe joey </connor>
<connor> is friends outside of us too what the </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> the [ __ ] joey they're acquaintances </joey>

<garnt> okay this is a surprise while joey's </garnt>
<garnt> getting his presents out we have a new </garnt>
<joey> camera angle </joey>
<garnt> yeah that's because we need the space </garnt>
<connor> behind it if you hate it </connor>
<garnt> that's tough [ __ ] you're gonna have to </garnt>
<garnt> get used to it yeah this podcast studio </garnt>
<garnt> is actually relatively small i remember </garnt>
<connor> the first thing chris said </connor>
<garnt> when he came into the podcast was like </garnt>
<connor> wow it looks a lot bigger </connor>
<connor> but our camera used to be like right in </connor>
<connor> the back and we basically couldn't use </connor>
<garnt> the center of the room yeah half of it </garnt>
<garnt> there's just like a lot of empty space </garnt>
<garnt> that we couldn't use if we used the old </garnt>
<joey> camera hey if you'd like to see the </joey>
<joey> behind the scenes then follow us on </joey>
<joey> twitter hey </joey>
<joey> but uh okay oh oh thank you very much </joey>
<connor> so this is one of the gifts did not get </connor>
<garnt> you a gift this is kind of i've </garnt>
<joey> yeah the first time i got you guys gifts </joey>
<joey> the [ __ ] snacks expired before you </joey>
<connor> even ate it </connor>
<connor> you never told me i should eat them </connor>
<joey> quickly okay eat these quickly then </joey>
<garnt> we'll just eat these now okay so this is </garnt>
<joey> like a type of uh cookie you know what </joey>
<garnt> yeah you just just rip it over my monkey </garnt>
<garnt> brain what am i doing i'm gonna be </garnt>
<joey> civilized </joey>
<joey> so this is a type of </joey>
<joey> you're like you're like a five-year-old </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah so this is a type of cookie that </joey>
<joey> you can only get in hokkaido it's kind </joey>
<connor> of known for it's called shiroi </connor>
<connor> which means a white white lover he gave </connor>
<connor> up his job </connor>
<garnt> it was so well wrapped that i just </garnt>
<joey> needed to bust that [ __ ] open </joey>
<joey> yeah so this is a this is a type of </joey>
<joey> cookie that you can only get in hokkaido </joey>
<connor> it's called thank you very much really </connor>
<joey> really nice like white chocolate uh like </joey>
<joey> milk cookies cause you know hokkaido is </joey>
<joey> known for its milk </joey>
<connor> right hokkaido is known for like a lot </connor>
<joey> of things dude milk milk </joey>
<connor> food that's the only way to describe it </connor>
<joey> everything i had in hokkaido </joey>
<joey> tasted so much [ __ ] better it's like </joey>
<joey> cream pie yeah kind of oh don't say that </joey>
<connor> no it's everywhere oh no it's is it </connor>
<joey> melted </joey>
<joey> no no no it's all good it's good </joey>
<garnt> yeah which like when i when i heard you </garnt>
<garnt> say like hokkaido has amazing food i'm </garnt>
<joey> thinking </joey>
<joey> man anywhere in japan already has </joey>
<garnt> amazing food i can't imagine </garnt>
<joey> somewhere leveling up that somehow like </joey>
<joey> if it's just like the seafood even just </joey>
<joey> just for the seafood right because where </joey>
<connor> i was in hakodate it's a </connor>
<connor> it's a coastal town so they catch all of </connor>
<connor> the seafood there like fresh </connor>
<connor> at the [ __ ] port and it's oh my god </connor>
<connor> they have a fish market there that we </connor>
<connor> went to in the morning </connor>
<connor> and all of the seafood that they sell </connor>
<connor> there they caught that morning so it's </connor>
<joey> the freshest seafood you can ever get </joey>
<joey> legit think of the best seafood you had </joey>
<joey> and just imagine that as just trash </joey>
<joey> because that's what garbage is garbage </joey>
<joey> compared to what you can have in </joey>
<joey> hakodate so i got you another thing as </joey>
<joey> well because </joey>
<joey> oh my god okay so there is this uh </joey>
<connor> there's this you got a wish list on </connor>
<joey> amazon or something </joey>
<joey> like repair i wanted i wanted to get </joey>
<joey> this for you guys because i feel it's </joey>
<joey> very uh </joey>
<joey> indicative of the kind of vibe that we </joey>
<joey> go for all right okay </joey>
<joey> it's clown juice </joey>
<joey> give me some clown juices for the boys </joey>
<joey> yeah so there's this hamburger joint </joey>
<joey> that's specific only to hakodate not </joey>
<joey> even hokkaido it's called lucky pierrot </joey>
<connor> and they have their own branded energy </connor>
<connor> drinks right because uh do you guys know </connor>
<connor> what like guarana is </connor>
<connor> like this the fruit that they use in </connor>
<connor> like red bull and stuff like that oh </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah okay they grow guarana and herd </connor>
<joey> and so i guess they just took that and </joey>
<joey> it's literally just </joey>
<garnt> clown juice you literally just sent us </garnt>
<joey> an irl clown emoji yeah i was like </joey>
<joey> here's your clown card </joey>
<garnt> drink up boys anytime one of us does a </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] take we've got to take a drink yeah </garnt>
<joey> just take a sip of the clown juice </joey>
<connor> how is it though uh it tastes like an </connor>
<joey> energy drink honestly for me it kind of </joey>
<joey> tastes like </joey>
<joey> some weird as it's to say it's like a </joey>
<joey> healthier red bull </joey>
<garnt> it's like a red bull with a stronger </garnt>
<garnt> aftertaste yeah i don't know it's </garnt>
<joey> it's definitely got that i think that's </joey>
<joey> definitely the guarana yeah yeah </joey>
<garnt> yeah i can't decide if it tastes cheap </garnt>
<joey> or expensive </joey>
<joey> let me tell you this was 150 yen so yeah </joey>
<garnt> i'll tell you </garnt>
<garnt> i'll tell you what it actually tastes </garnt>
<garnt> like a thai red bull oh really and to </garnt>
<joey> explain </joey>
<joey> what thai red balls are like so red bull </joey>
<joey> actually originates from thailand </joey>
<connor> and and yes i don't know that so redwood </connor>
<joey> actually originated from thailand but </joey>
<joey> the version they have in thailand </joey>
<joey> is not carbonated it's like it's like a </joey>
<joey> thick syrup </joey>
<joey> and whenever like the only people who </joey>
<joey> drink really drink red bull </joey>
<joey> in thailand it's like truck drivers who </joey>
<joey> like need to stay up yeah you drink one </joey>
<joey> and that's like drinking five the </joey>
<garnt> equivalent of likes five red bulls you </garnt>
<garnt> get anywhere else </garnt>
<connor> yeah but i think uh i think this has </connor>
<connor> probably the same amount of caffeine as </connor>
<garnt> like a regular red bull but </garnt>
<garnt> i think we're going to be loaded on this </garnt>
<garnt> podcast but uh </garnt>
<garnt> yeah so but but they also have like the </garnt>
<joey> non-carbonated stuff as well so they </joey>
<joey> have like guarana juice </joey>
<joey> which is just this basically it's as you </joey>
<joey> said it's like a non-carbonated red ball </joey>
<joey> essentially and it had that it actually </joey>
<joey> tastes really [ __ ] good </joey>
<joey> and i think it works better than a </joey>
<joey> coffee in my opinion even though it has </joey>
<joey> just as much caffeine as a coffee </joey>
<joey> so suffice it to say that for the rest </joey>
<joey> of this episode </joey>
<garnt> we all just [ __ ] had a coffee you're </garnt>
<joey> gonna you're gonna see when when the uh </joey>
<joey> when when this energy drink hits yeah </joey>
<joey> because uh we're gonna we're gonna be </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> you'll be able to see the heart </joey>
<connor> palpitations he's like a beer to like </connor>
<connor> downer you know </connor>
<garnt> no we're definitely gonna like we're </garnt>
<joey> gonna kill ourselves this episode yeah </joey>
<garnt> but yeah um i just wanted to get you </garnt>
<joey> guys some gifts yeah thank you very much </joey>
<joey> now i feel super bad that we didn't </joey>
<joey> get anything no it's okay although we </joey>
<garnt> didn't really get any souvenirs either </garnt>
<joey> for ourselves that's all right but like </joey>
<connor> hopefully like we'll actually be able to </connor>
<joey> take like a proper boys trip up yeah </joey>
<joey> because i know like you guys have been </joey>
<joey> saying how much you want to go up to the </joey>
<joey> north right yeah i really do i really </joey>
<garnt> really really want to go in the winter </garnt>
<joey> because it seems like really </joey>
<joey> a lot of things happening in the winter </joey>
<joey> oh yeah i want to i want to hit up the </joey>
<garnt> onsen </garnt>
<garnt> in the winter that's going to be so nice </garnt>
<joey> yeah just trying to get naked </joey>
<garnt> i just want to get naked we haven't </garnt>
<connor> talked about onsens on this podcast </connor>
<garnt> publicly haven't seen your guys dicks so </garnt>
<connor> much now that i don't even question it </connor>
<joey> going to the onsen with you it's like </joey>
<connor> you're mad </connor>
<connor> the first time we used to like first </connor>
<joey> time went to the onsen together i was </joey>
<joey> like oh we got to like </joey>
<connor> but now it's just like whatever we're </connor>
<garnt> getting naked with the boys another day </garnt>
<connor> with the boys </connor>
<connor> but like i feel like a lot of people are </connor>
<connor> afraid to go to onsens for the first </connor>
<connor> time </connor>
<garnt> because because of that barrier right </garnt>
<garnt> where you just have to be naked in front </garnt>
<garnt> of the boys i mean </garnt>
<joey> in a lot of countries it's not very </joey>
<connor> normal is it yeah some people have been </connor>
<connor> like yeah you want to come to the onsen </connor>
<connor> with me </connor>
<connor> and you know they that immediately </connor>
<connor> they're just like no i don't want to do </connor>
<connor> that </connor>
<connor> yeah and they're like oh because i don't </connor>
<joey> want to get naked and i'm like it's just </joey>
<joey> that </joey>
<joey> like it wasn't even like a decision it </joey>
<joey> was like in the head it was like of </joey>
<connor> course it's no i'm not getting naked </connor>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<connor> yeah but it's like but everyone around </connor>
<joey> you is naked yeah yeah it's like you're </joey>
<connor> not going to be the only one that's </connor>
<joey> naked it's like most european countries </joey>
<joey> naked yeah right but that's surprising </joey>
<joey> though isn't it is that like i've </joey>
<connor> tried to convince so many of my european </connor>
<connor> friends to go on onsen because </connor>
<connor> in my head it's just like oh bathing </connor>
<joey> together is like a very normal thing in </joey>
<joey> europe in a lot of european countries </joey>
<joey> right so i'm like oh well if it's </joey>
<connor> normal in their country and their </connor>
<connor> culture then it must be easier so </connor>
<connor> yeah so many times i'm like hey you want </connor>
<joey> to go to the onsen they're just like no </joey>
<connor> i think i don't know maybe like </connor>
<connor> our generation it's like less of a thing </connor>
<connor> than it was like 20 years ago </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah in the older generation </garnt>
<joey> because i remember trying to convince my </joey>
<joey> cousin to go to the onsen when he </joey>
<joey> visited japan </joey>
<joey> yeah and it was just it was just like </joey>
<joey> breaking down layers </joey>
<joey> right so first i'm not just i'm just </joey>
<joey> like yeah it's kind of it's kind of like </joey>
<joey> how can i like because he's the biggest </joey>
<joey> normal you can imagine right so how do i </joey>
<joey> explain the </joey>
<joey> cultural significance of like an onsen </joey>
<garnt> and a hot spring to someone who has </garnt>
<garnt> never watched an anime </garnt>
<joey> this is the same cousin that watched the </joey>
<garnt> live action at that one time yes yes yes </garnt>
<garnt> and like he's like seven eight years </garnt>
<garnt> older than me so he's from like the </garnt>
<garnt> older generation as well so </garnt>
<joey> had to be like okay so it's kind of like </joey>
<joey> a hot tub </joey>
<joey> but it's like a public hot tub yeah and </joey>
<joey> he was like oh yeah that that sounds fun </joey>
<joey> you know so </joey>
<joey> he was like oh yeah doesn't yeah so it's </joey>
<joey> so you wear like a bathing suit and </joey>
<joey> everything right </joey>
<joey> and i was like okay so here's the thing </joey>
<joey> here </joey>
<joey> you just everyone's naked and you know </joey>
<garnt> every </garnt>
<garnt> and that's it's just a really relaxing </garnt>
<garnt> experience and it's a really </garnt>
<garnt> cool experience i mean his voice tone </garnt>
<garnt> just like completely changed </garnt>
<garnt> just oh yeah oh </garnt>
<garnt> oh i'll know about that one chief </garnt>
<joey> because i love how you had to go in such </joey>
<joey> a roundabout way it wasn't just like a </joey>
<joey> yeah we get naked it was like </joey>
<joey> well i mean we have bathing suits we </joey>
<connor> just take them off yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah you just take them off you can </joey>
<joey> wear bathing suits </joey>
<garnt> until you enter yeah yeah because like </garnt>
<garnt> what was the first onsen experience for </garnt>
<garnt> you guys like because i remember </garnt>
<joey> you guys yeah i think i think it was </joey>
<joey> when we all went with uh </joey>
<joey> i think it was us three and allen yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah in the uh </joey>
<joey> dance and in uh yeah oh daiba yeah i'm </joey>
<garnt> pretty sure which is like a </garnt>
<joey> massive it's like a super scent or super </joey>
<garnt> insane as it's called but </garnt>
<garnt> and i remember the fact of like knowing </garnt>
<garnt> that we're going to get naked in front </garnt>
<garnt> of each other </garnt>
<garnt> that was just like i i think i just </garnt>
<garnt> built it up my mind so much because i'm </garnt>
<garnt> just like </garnt>
<garnt> oh it's it's about to happen i mean it's </garnt>
<joey> about to happen i mean i remember that </joey>
<joey> day like we all </joey>
<connor> stepped into the onsen yeah and alan was </connor>
<connor> like all right lads whip him out </connor>
<connor> let's just get it out of the way let's </connor>
<connor> just like let's just </connor>
<connor> get on the table get the messages out </connor>
<connor> let's gather around in a circle </connor>
<joey> and we'll just look at our each other's </joey>
<joey> dicks and then just be over </joey>
<garnt> it and we're like all right three two </garnt>
<garnt> one we'll look at this is like okay </garnt>
<garnt> we're good </garnt>
<garnt> no one's popping a fat all right we're </garnt>
<garnt> good </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and then it just literally took </garnt>
<garnt> five minutes and then i was like </garnt>
<garnt> completely comfortable </garnt>
<garnt> and then it was an amazing experience </garnt>
<garnt> and i feel like people who are </garnt>
<garnt> so afraid to go over that barrier are </garnt>
<garnt> missing such a good </garnt>
<joey> experience it's an experience you can't </joey>
<connor> really get anywhere else i feel like </connor>
<connor> even i've been to kind of you know </connor>
<connor> public uh you know bathing places in </connor>
<connor> europe as well but this just </connor>
<connor> yeah i don't know it's just i don't want </connor>
<joey> to say it it's different but </joey>
<joey> you know it's there's something that's </joey>
<joey> not quite right there's the vibe </joey>
<joey> it's just different yeah yeah it's </joey>
<joey> definitely like vibe check </joey>
<joey> hey yo onsen check constant check yeah </joey>
<connor> bruh </connor>
<joey> i don't think we have public bathing </joey>
<joey> places in europe do we but we have like </joey>
<joey> the saunas which </joey>
<joey> uh it's kind of similar right i guess </joey>
<joey> yeah you don't really </joey>
<connor> bathe together you just get in the sort </connor>
<connor> of naked and some people are like you </connor>
<garnt> know they'll cover themselves </garnt>
<garnt> i don't know because for me it's not </garnt>
<garnt> just the onsen experience it's like </garnt>
<garnt> everything around the entire experience </garnt>
<garnt> like getting out of the onsen when </garnt>
<joey> you're like especially in the winter </joey>
<joey> sitting out in the in the public onsen </joey>
<joey> when it's like really cold or sometimes </joey>
<joey> raining </joey>
<joey> and i've heard when it's snowing it's </joey>
<joey> amazing as well yeah </joey>
<joey> like that's like i've heard it's like </joey>
<joey> proper anime whether like there's mist </joey>
<joey> and everything yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> i want to experience that one day but </joey>
<joey> after coming out and having that </joey>
<joey> drink of cold milk yeah that's like the </joey>
<joey> most refreshing </joey>
<joey> hand on the hip hand hands on the hip so </joey>
<joey> what do you do you have to like put your </joey>
<garnt> hand on your hip </garnt>
<garnt> drink the milk in one and it's like the </garnt>
<garnt> most refreshing glass of milk </garnt>
<garnt> but it's like vibe right you gotta do it </garnt>
<garnt> and then having like an izakaya beer </garnt>
<connor> afterwards is just </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] incredible yeah i just it makes </connor>
<connor> when you're in an onsen for some reason </connor>
<connor> it makes you want to just </connor>
<connor> be a ceo and talk business like i don't </connor>
<connor> even have business to talk about but </connor>
<garnt> i'll be like </garnt>
<garnt> gentlemen let's discuss the topic at </garnt>
<garnt> hand and then like </garnt>
<garnt> animated it just makes you want to talk </garnt>
<connor> about important things </connor>
<garnt> with three other people so it's exactly </garnt>
<garnt> the same kind of vibe but like </garnt>

<joey> energy to it yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah i don't i never smoke like at all </joey>
<connor> but for some reason yeah the idea of </connor>
<connor> cigar i was like that sounds good i like </connor>
<joey> that well because unlike a cigarette </joey>
<joey> right like you don't inhale the cigar </joey>
<connor> smoke right yeah so i mean </connor>
<joey> like don't get me wrong it's still bad </joey>
<joey> for you it's still terrible it's still </joey>
<garnt> terrible for you and you come out of the </garnt>
<joey> bar smelling like you've just like </joey>
<joey> puffed an exhaust pipe </joey>
<joey> yeah you know what i mean that's that's </joey>
<joey> kind of the smell the smell that yeah </joey>
<joey> but man you feel so powerful like just </joey>
<garnt> with that aura of cigar </garnt>
<joey> around you like yes i just came out of </joey>
<garnt> the cigar </garnt>
<joey> i do business yeah you do have like a </joey>
<garnt> different aura around you don't you </garnt>
<connor> yeah yeah just feel powerful yeah it's </connor>
<connor> it's like when you order a drink at a </connor>
<connor> bar </connor>
<connor> it's like you're like the virgin when </connor>
<connor> you order a drink at the cigar bar it's </connor>
<connor> like oh there's a chat he's like what do </connor>
<connor> you want name a cocktail any cocktail </connor>

<connor> it it's an amazing drink </connor>
<connor> uh it's just coffee just with a vodka </connor>
<connor> base yeah pretty much </connor>
<connor> it's amazing it tastes just it's just </connor>
<joey> coffee with attitude really i love my i </joey>
<joey> love my food </joey>
<connor> am i not wrong what a terrible way to </connor>
<garnt> decide it's a coffee with attitude </garnt>
<connor> that's like it is describing anything </connor>
<joey> why are you </joey>
<joey> i'm right because it's such a like i </joey>
<garnt> don't know that sounds like a </garnt>
<connor> how a disney character that you </connor>
<connor> introduced in a in a short </connor>
<connor> oh yeah he's the bully with attitude </connor>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> i'll take a coffee with attitude please </joey>
<joey> hold the attitude </joey>
<joey> i hate it here i hate it here </joey>
<garnt> it's like today when you got a </garnt>
<garnt> frappuccino and you're like </garnt>
<garnt> no i didn't just get a frappuccino i got </garnt>
<garnt> an espresso fresh you know </garnt>
<joey> it's like oh my god you couldn't enough </joey>
<connor> sandwich any more white it's like 35 </connor>
<connor> celsius i want to i want an ice cream </connor>
<joey> and a drink in one </joey>
<joey> but i also want a coffee so yeah i don't </joey>
<joey> i normally think </joey>
<connor> uh frappuccinos are awful but i you know </connor>
<connor> i bent my own morals yeah so you </connor>
<joey> basically got a frappuccino with </joey>
<connor> attitude right </connor>
<connor> okay i hate it here i hated you so much </connor>
<joey> just add anything with attitude it'll </joey>
<connor> just make it sound bad all </connor>
<joey> the [ __ ] comments now are gonna be </joey>
<connor> like damn that was something with </connor>
<joey> attitude yeah </joey>
<joey> i want that i want that to be a meme oh </joey>
<garnt> no that's going to be a meme now </garnt>
<garnt> i'm going to describe everything with </garnt>
<joey> something yeah it's something with </joey>
<joey> attitude now </joey>
<garnt> you're welcome speaking of cigar bars </garnt>
<joey> yeah i think </joey>
<joey> the topic for today that we wanted to </joey>
<joey> discuss was uh night life in tokyo right </joey>
<joey> yes </joey>
<joey> or in japan japan in general true true i </joey>
<joey> mean i wouldn't </joey>
<joey> know i haven't been at night outside of </joey>
<connor> japan </connor>
<joey> for a while </joey>
<joey> because i mean like what is a typical </joey>
<joey> like nightlife for like say </joey>
<joey> uk or thailand or australia um because </joey>
<joey> like i don't know what the nightlife is </joey>
<garnt> in thailand </garnt>
<garnt> at all i mean the nightlife in thailand </garnt>
<garnt> is </garnt>
<garnt> i mean oh let me ask a question does it </garnt>
<joey> exist yeah of course </joey>
<garnt> that's all thailand is that that it </garnt>
<garnt> definitely it definitely exists and </garnt>
<garnt> there's different </garnt>
<garnt> there's different kind of vibes you can </garnt>
<garnt> go for you can go for like a disgusting </garnt>
<garnt> cheap </garnt>
<garnt> like not um nightlife in bangkok or you </garnt>
<garnt> can go for like some more extravagant </garnt>
<garnt> bars and everything </garnt>
<garnt> it's it's very varied but i don't know </garnt>
<garnt> if that i would say that there's like a </garnt>
<garnt> cot like a significant </garnt>
<garnt> significant culture that pertains like </garnt>
<garnt> all of </garnt>
<garnt> all of thailand but i feel like with </garnt>
<garnt> japan there's definitely like the </garnt>
<garnt> izakaya culture yeah which i [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> love </garnt>
<garnt> like you talk about nightlife in </garnt>
<garnt> thailand whenever i'm in thailand </garnt>
<garnt> i just go to a izakaya because i like </garnt>
<garnt> the vibe that much yeah yeah </garnt>
<joey> that's the thing right like i feel and </joey>
<joey> izakaya is just </joey>
<joey> i mean should we explain what an izakaya </joey>
<joey> is just in case people don't know sure </joey>
<garnt> for those who are uncultured </garnt>
<joey> um basically a japanese pub </joey>
<joey> basically but like it's like it's like </joey>
<joey> it's like a restaurant and a pub </joey>
<connor> 75 percent pub and 25 restaurants </connor>
<joey> yeah let's say yeah but like in a pub in </joey>
<garnt> the uk but it's not depressing yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> it's depressing and also </garnt>
<joey> for some reason i always feel pressure </joey>
<joey> to leave in the uk </joey>
<joey> yeah or like just drink like not sit </joey>
<joey> down and eat oh yeah i have this </joey>
<joey> pressure that's like </joey>
<joey> drink don't you're not here to eat right </joey>
<joey> because like when you go with your your </joey>
<joey> friends to the pub </joey>
<connor> i'm always that [ __ ] he's like i'm </connor>
<garnt> getting a meal </garnt>
<garnt> yeah because it's just it's just really </garnt>
<connor> inconvenient because you're there with </connor>
<connor> like a table full of pints </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah and then there's this guy who </joey>
<joey> just orders like a three-course meal and </joey>
<joey> you're like where are we meant to fit </joey>
<joey> this </joey>
<joey> i don't give a [ __ ] i got to hold that i </joey>
<joey> would like slowly nudge the 12 </joey>
<joey> beers out of the way to make room for my </joey>
<joey> like extravagant curry from weather </joey>
<connor> spoons </connor>
<connor> and the tables like down here you're </connor>
<joey> like this </joey>
<joey> is like bombing out do you do you like </joey>
<connor> pubs in the uk </connor>
<connor> yeah i love them in london i thought </connor>
<garnt> london had great pubs i don't know i </garnt>
<garnt> really don't like pubs pubs </garnt>
<garnt> pubs are the one thing about the uk that </garnt>
<garnt> i like anytime i go out the uk i'm like </garnt>
<garnt> yes this is a much better drinking </garnt>
<garnt> establishment than a pub </garnt>
<garnt> because it's just i don't know what it </garnt>
<garnt> is about pubs in the uk i just find it </garnt>
<garnt> so [ __ ] depressing </garnt>
<connor> because yeah it depends it depends which </connor>
<connor> one do you go to london has </connor>
<connor> a ton of like pubs that are like really </connor>
<connor> lively and </connor>
<connor> really great atmosphere but they're also </connor>
<joey> equally as i mean you guys took me to </joey>
<connor> one </connor>
<connor> uh it was like a gaming pub right that's </connor>
<joey> shut down </joey>
<connor> oh really yeah that pub was a mess there </connor>
<garnt> yeah i wouldn't i wouldn't even call it </garnt>
<garnt> i wouldn't even call it </garnt>
<joey> that was like a gaming bar but like the </joey>
<garnt> dirtiest gaming box </garnt>
<connor> yeah what was it called again meltdown </connor>
<connor> meltdown it was like </connor>
<joey> a gaming bar with like five pcs one </joey>
<joey> dirty old wii u no it wasn't even a wii </joey>
<joey> u </joey>
<connor> are we you and like they would be like </connor>
<connor> the same people who would hog the pcs </connor>
<connor> and there was no limit or anything so </connor>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> it was just awful it was terrible yeah </joey>
<joey> you know you compare a gaming bar </joey>
<connor> anywhere else and you're like that dude </connor>
<connor> they've got </connor>
<garnt> games yeah they got real like the way i </garnt>
<joey> would describe meltdown is it's it's </joey>
<joey> basically like a unibar </joey>
<garnt> but it was but they charged more than </garnt>
<garnt> the unibar it was just this it was like </garnt>
<garnt> a run down bar </garnt>
<joey> and like every single bar in london that </joey>
<joey> is even remotely interesting i feel is </joey>
<connor> sort of run down </connor>
<joey> unfortunately yeah i can see that </joey>
<connor> because i don't know the thing about </connor>
<garnt> pubs that </garnt>
<garnt> i i hate is that for some reason they </garnt>
<connor> just seem so dark i don't know it's it's </connor>
<connor> everything they're like i think what </connor>
<connor> pops are you going to man there's so </connor>
<joey> many in london that are so </joey>
<joey> anytime i go to like a pub styled bar </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> anywhere else the first thing i notice </joey>
<garnt> is man it's so bright in here </garnt>
<garnt> this is nothing like british pubs this </garnt>
<joey> is nothing like british pubs at all are </joey>
<joey> you like going to the pubs that are like </joey>
<joey> down the alley </joey>
<connor> it's like like the proper like local </connor>
<connor> pubs because in the uk </connor>
<joey> there's the pubs that anyone goes to and </joey>
<joey> then there's the pubs that have like the </joey>
<joey> exact same 30 people going right now </joey>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and those are the depressing as [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i don't know most 90 </garnt>
<garnt> of weather spoons i'd say fit under that </garnt>
<connor> category yeah okay most weather spoons </connor>
<joey> are weather springs is a brand of pubs </joey>
<joey> in the uk it's just like this ultra </joey>
<joey> treat </joey>
<connor> brand and you took me to one i did take </connor>
<connor> you to one i think </connor>
<garnt> the reason people go there is because of </garnt>
<garnt> the very very cheap drinks and cheap </garnt>
<joey> food that you use what was it like five </joey>
<joey> pounds for like a full course meal or </joey>
<joey> something </joey>
<connor> right you basically get like a full </connor>
<connor> course meal with an alcoholic drink for </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> seven pounds which is like nine dollars </connor>
<connor> um </connor>
<connor> in london in london which is like in </connor>
<connor> london the drinks alone normally were </connor>
<connor> like eight dollars which i'm probably </connor>
<connor> people in california are like oh that's </connor>
<connor> sure </connor>
<connor> like in the uk that's bear in mind where </connor>
<connor> i grew up yeah </connor>
<joey> a drink that's over three pounds which </joey>
<connor> is like four dollars like whoa yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah because of this guy yeah like if </joey>
<joey> you go to a pub in australia like for a </joey>
<joey> pint it's like nine bucks </joey>
<connor> yeah i mean where i the what the weather </connor>
<connor> spoons this is the cheap areas </connor>
<connor> where i i grew up it was like their main </connor>
<connor> selling point was like two pound pints </connor>
<joey> and sometimes some of the special brews </joey>
<joey> were like one pound sixty </joey>
<joey> wow so that's like two dollars something </joey>
<joey> for a pint yeah </joey>
<garnt> and you have no no wonder that there's </garnt>
<connor> like people are there from like 2 p.m </connor>
<garnt> until 9 p.m just like dead getting their </garnt>
<garnt> money's worth </garnt>
<garnt> yeah because like to me pubs are just </garnt>
<garnt> the place where you pre-drink before you </garnt>
<joey> actually go out to the establishment you </joey>
<joey> want to go to right that's that's that's </joey>
<joey> how i see it whereas </joey>
<joey> with uh izakayas i can [ __ ] stay </joey>
<garnt> there from the </garnt>
<garnt> beginning of the night at the end of the </garnt>
<connor> night yeah you don't feel pressured to </connor>
<connor> leave and you normally have like </connor>
<connor> they're normally just cordoned off </connor>
<connor> decently well when you feel like </connor>
<connor> it's just you and your mates yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> whereas sometimes the pubs having to see </connor>
<connor> everyone around you is a little like oh </connor>
<joey> my god it's busy </joey>
<joey> that's the one thing i don't like about </joey>
<joey> i guess like uk style pubs and there are </joey>
<connor> a few </connor>
<connor> of those in japan as well um there's </connor>
<joey> this place called the hub </joey>
<connor> which i'm sure you boys are aware of is </connor>
<joey> uh don't go to there by the way because </joey>
<connor> it's like it's like going into a uk pub </connor>
<joey> but in japan so why the [ __ ] writer </joey>
<connor> okay but it's a little bit brighter i've </connor>
<connor> heard though if you're a foreigner and </connor>
<joey> you really want to pick up </joey>
<joey> some people who are really into </joey>
<joey> foreigners oh yeah yeah yeah they're </joey>
<connor> probably there because they know that </connor>
<connor> foreigners go there </connor>
<joey> if you have the yellow fever but can't </joey>
<connor> be bothered to go the traditional route </connor>
<connor> go to the hub yeah yeah but shibuya </connor>
<connor> you'll be fine </connor>
<connor> yeah but like like every time i go into </connor>
<connor> a hub </connor>
<garnt> it's just well first of all it's like 99 </garnt>
<garnt> foreigners it's also very depressing </garnt>
<garnt> it's also very depressing because it's </garnt>
<garnt> it's </garnt>
<garnt> it's like kind of structured like what </garnt>
<garnt> i'm saying right </garnt>
<garnt> it's structured like a uk pub where like </garnt>
<joey> the seats are kind of sporadic and then </joey>
<joey> everyone is standing around you so you </joey>
<joey> just feel really claustrophobic yeah i </joey>
<connor> don't mind standing and drinking </connor>
<connor> sometimes standing is fun </connor>
<garnt> i don't know like i i need a table yeah </garnt>
<connor> there definitely needs </connor>
<garnt> needs to be a table there where i can </garnt>
<connor> leave my drink if i'm just like standing </connor>
<garnt> in the corner which </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes on like a friday or saturday </garnt>
<joey> night in england where some </joey>
<joey> pubs are crowded and you just have to </joey>
<joey> stand there in the middle of the floor </joey>
<joey> just with your mates i'm just like </joey>
<joey> this is this is not the vibe i want to </joey>
<joey> go my legs hurt i want to sit down </joey>
<joey> like the thing i like about izakaya is </joey>
<joey> that you're always sitting down you have </joey>
<joey> your own </joey>
<joey> sanctioned corner where you can just sit </joey>
<garnt> and talk to your mates and it's just </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> the perfect kind of catch-up vibe that i </garnt>
<garnt> look for when i just want to </garnt>
<garnt> just chill with my mates and just she's </garnt>
<joey> just so cheap like you can go to any </joey>
<joey> izakaya here and like the most you'll </joey>
<joey> pay for a beer is like what like 400 yen </joey>
<garnt> maybe that's like a pretty that's that's </garnt>
<garnt> an expensive one yeah i'm saying like </garnt>
<joey> the max </joey>
<garnt> normally you pay between 200 and 300 yen </garnt>
<garnt> for like </garnt>
<joey> a beer which is like two three dollars i </joey>
<joey> went to an izakaya though whereas 50 yen </joey>
<joey> beers </joey>
<garnt> what's the point 50 pm how do we even </garnt>
<garnt> compete because one thing that doesn't </garnt>
<garnt> make sense to me right </garnt>
<garnt> is that sometimes it's cheaper to drink </garnt>
<connor> in an izakaya than it is to go to a </connor>
<connor> family martial </connor>
<connor> kombini and buy like a can of beer buy a </connor>
<connor> can of beer </connor>
<connor> which like can you imagine if that was </connor>
<connor> the case in the uk like if going to </connor>
<joey> tesco's it's more expensive than going </joey>
<connor> to your local weather spoons </connor>
<joey> i'm just like nobody would drink at home </joey>
<garnt> yeah everyone would just be out </garnt>
<connor> constantly drinking </connor>
<connor> i think the uk economy would just stop i </connor>
<connor> think i think it would </connor>
<joey> the country would fail oh my god yeah </joey>
<joey> but like the i think the one thing i </joey>
<joey> like about izakayas is that </joey>
<joey> again like even people who don't drink </joey>
<connor> can still go to an izakaya and have a </connor>
<connor> good time </connor>
<connor> because as as you know we've established </connor>
<connor> like it's mostly like </connor>
<connor> drink based but the food a lot of the </connor>
<connor> times is also so freaking good and cheap </connor>
<connor> that you could probably you probably </connor>
<connor> won't have as much fun yeah if you </connor>
<connor> weren't drinking but </connor>
<connor> you could easily take your friend who </connor>
<joey> doesn't drink at all and they'll </joey>
<joey> probably still have a </joey>
<joey> you know a decent time right yeah </joey>
<garnt> because like the food there you can </garnt>
<joey> easily order </joey>
<joey> a lot of like snack kind of foods it's </joey>
<joey> like it's not like you have to order a </joey>
<joey> meal </joey>
<joey> yeah you know what i mean it's all your </joey>
<joey> giant [ __ ] pub burger yeah yeah </joey>
<connor> exactly </connor>
<garnt> i will say that i do feel like the food </garnt>
<joey> is a coin flip sometimes at the izakayas </joey>
<garnt> you can normally tell which one's gonna </garnt>
<connor> have bad food but </connor>
<connor> sometimes the food is just really bad </connor>
<joey> are you only saying that because you got </joey>
<connor> no idea i did get food poisoning </connor>
<connor> i did get food poisoning very recently </connor>
<joey> but then the more i've been living in </joey>
<joey> japan and the more i've been eating out </joey>
<joey> at restaurants in japan the more i </joey>
<joey> realized like my god this food is so </joey>
<connor> much better than the izakaya food yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah it's fine yeah yeah you know </connor>
<connor> normally just sticking to karage and </connor>
<connor> which is like the japanese boneless </connor>
<connor> fried chicken yeah yeah i mean yeah </connor>
<joey> don't get me wrong like the izakaya food </joey>
<connor> is good but there's definitely like if </connor>
<connor> you want problems </connor>
<joey> there's something like a proper </joey>
<joey> establishment there's sometimes there </joey>
<connor> are many </connor>
<garnt> kind i'm eating it and i'm like god this </garnt>
<connor> food is depressing it's like </connor>
<garnt> really like there's one near our where </garnt>
<connor> we're filming this that like the </connor>
<connor> you know the one it was the underground </connor>
<connor> place yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> and they had like the driest chicken i'd </connor>
<joey> ever seen in my life you'd think of like </joey>
<joey> they'd like left this chicken out to </joey>
<joey> like die in the sahara desert before </joey>
<joey> they like </joey>
<joey> harvested it yeah it was pretty anemic </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah everything on it was just kind </joey>
<connor> of like </connor>
<connor> all right i guess you just didn't love </connor>
<joey> your job today yeah the food </joey>
<joey> yeah that that one is definitely like </joey>
<connor> it's it's not horrible </connor>
<connor> you know it's gonna be that that bad </connor>
<connor> when like the menu everything is like </connor>
<connor> 150 yen oh yeah well you get what you </connor>
<connor> pay for something </connor>
<connor> right right right but like comparing </connor>
<garnt> izakaya food to some of the like </garnt>
<garnt> the pub food that i'm used to i don't </garnt>
<connor> know </connor>
<connor> i think pop food's really [ __ ] good </connor>
<connor> in the uk am i really yeah maybe i'm too </connor>
<connor> white to make this point </connor>
<garnt> i don't know because if i had a choice </garnt>
<garnt> pub food is where i </garnt>
<garnt> go if i like have no other choice or </garnt>
<connor> whatever i can't be bothered to i </connor>
<connor> promise right hand on heart if i had to </connor>
<joey> choose between izakaya food and english </joey>
<joey> pub food i'd go with pub food </joey>
<joey> no joke no joke i've had food </joey>
<joey> joey's [ __ ] biased no i'm not not </joey>
<joey> he's never gonna admit that no no </joey>
<connor> i don't care about your opinion okay </connor>
<connor> shut up for a second </connor>
<joey> okay fine okay like because it's the </joey>
<connor> kind of the same thing with australian </connor>
<connor> pop food as well </connor>
<connor> i don't know man i can't comment you ask </connor>
<connor> these are wild cause australian because </connor>
<connor> australian pubs </connor>
<joey> uh is kind of the same as the uk pubs </joey>
<joey> right where most people just go </joey>
<joey> to drink usually it's very [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> depressing because it's just a bunch of </connor>
<joey> like middle-aged dudes have been sitting </joey>
<connor> there since like 2 p.m </connor>
<connor> right just like wasting their life away </connor>
<connor> but like a lot of pubs </connor>
<connor> in australia they have really [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> good food but the problem is is that you </joey>
<joey> only get a set portion of food </joey>
<joey> for like a stupid amount of money right </joey>
<joey> right and so sometimes </joey>
<connor> it's like a cost thing yeah well yes so </connor>
<connor> what i'm hearing is that i smell </connor>
<joey> bro joey's broke yeah you will be </joey>
<connor> once you go to an australian pub you </connor>
<garnt> will be it's like 25 bucks for a [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> pizza it's like it's just not worth it </joey>
<joey> but like </joey>
<joey> but the thing is is that with australian </joey>
<joey> pub food a lot of it's good but it's </joey>
<connor> just like </connor>
<joey> you know even before you go into the pub </joey>
<connor> what food is going to be there </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah this is so little variety you </joey>
<garnt> know same thing could be said with </garnt>
<joey> izakayas </joey>
<connor> but i feel that it's always the same </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] in izakayas i don't know man like </connor>
<joey> different izakayas have different things </joey>
<connor> that they specialize yeah but then i </connor>
<joey> feel like yeah </joey>
<joey> and like pubs </joey>
<garnt> the reason i love izakaya food is like </garnt>
<joey> they're like designed to go </joey>
<joey> well with the beer or alcohol that </joey>
<joey> you're drinking it just it's just like </joey>
<joey> the perfect </joey>
<joey> it's like the synergy you were talking </joey>
<joey> about the pizza synergy i was right </joey>
<connor> about that by the way </connor>
<connor> it's it just synergizes so well together </connor>
<garnt> whereas with pub food </garnt>
<garnt> it's it is like the same it's just like </garnt>
<joey> you put this in your stomach </joey>
<connor> i think yeah sometimes it is but not all </connor>
<connor> the time like there's been plenty of use </connor>
<connor> guys we've been to where i'm like this </connor>
<connor> is just </connor>
<connor> weak like this is mid as you would say </connor>
<garnt> joey </garnt>
<garnt> i mean i wasn't but even like even like </garnt>
<garnt> the mid izakayas are still better than </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> some of the best pub food i don't i </garnt>
<garnt> don't know i i just don't like pubs i'm </garnt>
<garnt> sorry england i don't like pubs you know </garnt>
<joey> what though i do </joey>
<joey> really like irish pubs for their food </joey>
<joey> because i feel that at least with irish </joey>
<connor> pubs unlike uk pubs there's a little </connor>
<connor> more variety in the food and there's i </connor>
<connor> feel </connor>
<connor> at least from my experience i feel like </connor>
<connor> i took you to shitty pubs though yeah </connor>
<connor> but i feel less pressure to get out of </connor>
<joey> an irish pub than i do at uk pub if i'm </joey>
<joey> not </joey>
<connor> just sitting there drinking well i like </connor>
<connor> irish </connor>
<joey> dublin or yeah dublin and i went to </joey>
<joey> something like limerick and stuff like </joey>
<connor> that </connor>
<connor> all around ireland yeah i mean the norm </connor>
<connor> in the uk uh apart from england because </connor>
<connor> i think a lot of england is just </connor>
<joey> depressing outside of the big cities </joey>
<connor> no offense um like in the small towns in </connor>
<joey> like whales and stuff there's some </joey>
<joey> really fun pubs because it's just like </joey>
<joey> 20 yeah but i'm not going to go to wales </joey>
<joey> there's no reason to go to wales jerry </joey>
<joey> i'm sorry </joey>
<joey> i'm sorry i'm sorry wales it's true we </joey>
<joey> have to accept that fact unless you like </joey>
<joey> i like ship do you like nature joey i </joey>
<joey> like sheep all right do you like </joey>
<joey> rundown castles do you like those um </joey>
<joey> this is hit or miss for me </joey>
<connor> all right well you're lovely </connor>
<joey> all it is well there's not really too </joey>
<joey> much time i want to go to that [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> lake that has the longest name in the </joey>
<connor> world </connor>
<connor> oh no that's not like that's a town oh </connor>
<joey> it's a town yeah and it's uh </joey>
<connor> is the town name </connor>
<connor> i actually was going to make a video </connor>
<connor> where i went to that place i actually </connor>
<garnt> filmed it </garnt>
<garnt> was that was that the town where the </garnt>
<garnt> news anchor pronounced perfectly </garnt>
<joey> and that just went viral just up the </joey>
<joey> road from planned by to push </joey>
<joey> the temperature got to 21 celsius so </joey>
<connor> like 6 million views </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah so i i went i went there and i </connor>
<connor> filmed a video actually yeah like i have </connor>
<joey> all this footage still and like </joey>
<joey> so wait so what's in it it's just me </joey>
<connor> going around this place oh she's </connor>
<joey> checking out but i mean like what's the </joey>
<joey> town like </joey>
<connor> it's [ __ ] dead it's [ __ ] nice this </connor>
<joey> is dead because no one can pronounce the </joey>
<joey> place </joey>
<joey> maybe i don't so it's about it was like </joey>
<joey> two hours drive from where i grew up </joey>
<joey> so i asked one of my mates i was like </joey>
<connor> hey can we go here and just film a bunch </connor>
<joey> of [ __ ] i don't know why i was like [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> it </joey>
<joey> maybe something fun will happen nothing </joey>
<joey> fun happened obviously </joey>
<joey> but there was also a climbing place that </joey>
<joey> we wanted to go to so like we'll just go </joey>
<joey> there after we're done </joey>
<joey> you mean a hill no no like a climbing </joey>
<connor> gym right oh </connor>
<connor> huge warehouse pretty cool so if you </connor>
<connor> want to go there there's a climbing game </connor>
<joey> but i went there and it was just a bunch </joey>
<joey> of tourists from england </joey>
<joey> all right who were like old very very </joey>
<joey> old like 60s </joey>
<joey> just hanging around just checking it out </joey>
<joey> there's like a gift shop tiny </joey>
<connor> and then there's a bunch of stores and i </connor>
<connor> went in there you know asking like </connor>
<connor> because we were in a really uh west part </connor>
<connor> of wales and they normally could speak </connor>
<connor> welsh i was like oh well </connor>
<connor> maybe i'll ask around see if anyone can </connor>
<joey> speak well yeah no one can speak [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> welsh </joey>
<joey> really yeah i was surprised because </joey>
<joey> normally in that far west i think that </joey>
<joey> county is the one with the highest rate </joey>
<joey> of welsh literacy right </joey>
<joey> right so yeah nothing there nothing </joey>
<joey> there so if you've ever wondered what's </joey>
<joey> there </joey>
<joey> uh nothing no that's just a really </joey>
<joey> comically large train sign </joey>
<garnt> yeah it's actually how do they fit in is </garnt>
<garnt> it like on like size two fonts </garnt>
<connor> you know like the normal uh so normally </connor>
<joey> in the uk each one has like a the </joey>
<joey> standard size of uh font yeah it's quite </joey>
<joey> big </joey>
<connor> they literally just add it on there's a </connor>
<joey> really yeah there's a really funny thing </joey>
<joey> yeah there was a really funny image of a </joey>
<joey> guy like standing next to it and it's </joey>
<joey> just </joey>
<joey> like 10 meters it's really really i i'll </joey>
<connor> have some footage up from </connor>
<joey> the video that mudan can just show on </joey>
<connor> screen right now it's [ __ ] huge and </connor>
<connor> yeah it's sad because none of the trains </connor>
<connor> stopped there either </connor>
<joey> there's there's a really like train that </joey>
<joey> goes direct to london that doesn't stop </joey>
<joey> through there and i think it's only </joey>
<connor> local trains and </connor>
<joey> i mean at least you have plenty of time </joey>
<garnt> to read it as you go past i want to hear </garnt>
<garnt> how like the train lady pronounces it </garnt>
<garnt> like is there like an automated message </garnt>
<connor> that that </connor>
<joey> so it's shortened to like pg or sh </joey>
<joey> which is still yeah awfully long it just </joey>
<joey> sounds like you had a lot of flame stuck </joey>
<joey> that's right </joey>
<joey> right right but okay the problem is </joey>
<joey> right even with whales right if you look </joey>
<joey> around the rest of the map </joey>
<joey> like all the town names are just as bad </joey>
<joey> really around that area to pronounce i </joey>
<joey> can't pronounce some of them without </joey>
<joey> taking like three minutes to look at it </joey>
<joey> and be like </joey>
<joey> it's kind of hard there's a nice tangent </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah cute little town of wales </joey>
<connor> don't go there nothing </connor>
<joey> don't i mean i live next to some like </joey>
<garnt> weird weird sounding places as well i </garnt>
<joey> remember when joey came to visit i took </joey>
<joey> him and aki to uh this place called </joey>
<joey> devil's dice devil's dyke </joey>
<joey> i remember saying that oh yeah i'm going </joey>
<garnt> to take you guys to devil's dike aki's </garnt>
<garnt> face was just like </garnt>
<joey> jordan what did you just say </joey>
<joey> because do you guys like is dyke does </joey>
<joey> the word diet have the same meaning yes </joey>
<joey> yeah but it also means like a hill right </joey>
<joey> but there's tons of [ __ ] up names in </joey>
<joey> the uk there's like there's places </joey>
<connor> called like white knight </connor>
<garnt> and stuff like that yeah there's another </garnt>
<garnt> place i live next to or close to called </garnt>
<joey> cuckfield </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah every time i try </joey>
<connor> every time i'm on the train and it goes </connor>
<connor> past that i just have a little laughter </connor>
<connor> myself </connor>
<joey> there's like [ __ ] fosters </joey>
<connor> fosters finally so it's like this is the </connor>
<connor> train to [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> i feel like a five-year-old every time i </garnt>
<connor> go on going on that line i can't </connor>
<joey> remember what line it is it's a </joey>
<joey> piccadilly </joey>
<joey> piccadilly line like the dark blue line </joey>
<joey> every time i and </joey>
<garnt> because i haven't lived in london for </garnt>
<garnt> like like a few years every time i go on </garnt>
<garnt> there </garnt>
<garnt> and i hear it i just i just have to </garnt>
<joey> laugh bust a little smurf you're like i </joey>
<garnt> completely forgot to be thinking </garnt>
<joey> there's so many that are just like swear </joey>
<connor> words i don't know how this </connor>
<connor> is like a thing how did we get this </connor>
<joey> how did this happen we just like in </joey>
<connor> australia we just we don't have anything </connor>
<connor> like that it's kind of sad we just have </connor>
<connor> a lot of lives you're new </connor>
<connor> yeah honestly and like a lot of the </connor>
<connor> names are just named after like uh </connor>
<joey> indigenous </joey>
<joey> names so they sound funny but they're </joey>
<connor> not like [ __ ] feet </connor>
<connor> i i i was lying about talking to you </connor>
<joey> about this i was like why is there a new </joey>
<joey> south wales like south wales was never </joey>
<joey> good to begin with </joey>
<joey> why are we making another one i don't </joey>
<joey> know maybe start up from the ground up </joey>
<joey> make it a good one </joey>
<joey> honestly i don't know like the only like </joey>
<joey> funny named place in australia that i </joey>
<joey> know is uh </joey>
<joey> banana oh it's just a is this a town in </joey>
<joey> queensland called banana and it has this </joey>
<joey> thing called the big banana which is the </joey>
<joey> guinness world record for the largest </joey>
<garnt> banana statue in the world </garnt>
<garnt> why did they just name a town after that </garnt>
<joey> one scenario </joey>
<joey> oh no it's because also like every </joey>
<joey> banana in australia grows in banana </joey>
<connor> questions that probably makes more sense </connor>
<joey> you should have led with that before you </joey>
<garnt> told us that anyways </garnt>
<garnt> i have no idea why it's called banana </garnt>
<garnt> but they screw a lot of bananas yeah </garnt>
<joey> it's </joey>
<joey> the only place they grow bananas oh okay </joey>
<garnt> well that makes a lot of like now that </garnt>
<garnt> you've explained the context that </garnt>
<joey> there's a lot more stuff yeah exactly </joey>
<joey> so we just have stuff like that but like </joey>
<joey> i wish i [ __ ] lived in a place called </joey>
<connor> cockfield </connor>
<connor> that'd be hilarious that'd be the best </connor>
<connor> that would be the best [ __ ] like </connor>
<connor> conversation feel like it would grow </connor>
<connor> tired yeah yeah but it's like where are </connor>
<joey> you from cockfield and you immediately </joey>
<joey> get a laugh it's like </joey>
<joey> i have already blended in with the </joey>
<joey> conversation how did you just gotta tell </joey>
<joey> them in japan when they're like sunday </joey>
<joey> moscow and he was like no </joey>
<garnt> is like my number one kind of drinking </garnt>
<garnt> establishment that i enjoy throughout </garnt>
<connor> the world </connor>
<connor> i mean anyways the easiest it's the </connor>
<connor> chillest it's the chillest </connor>
<connor> it's always nice all foreigners love it </connor>
<connor> because it's so easy you press the </connor>
<connor> little button </connor>
<garnt> sometimes it's all you control yeah </garnt>
<garnt> because you don't have to order at the </garnt>
<connor> bar you never have to order them never </connor>
<connor> never i will say that is a hundred times </connor>
<garnt> better than the uk </garnt>
<garnt> you order all your food and drinks from </garnt>
<garnt> a tablet there's no pressure to get </garnt>
<garnt> water at the bar and they just bring it </garnt>
<joey> to you </joey>
<joey> there is uh one of my favorite izakayas </joey>
<joey> i go to a lot with my uh </joey>
<joey> other friends is uh it's one in </joey>
<joey> ikebukuro uh i don't know what it's </joey>
<joey> called anymore it used to be called </joey>
<joey> kobayashi's i think i took you guys </joey>
<joey> there </joey>
<joey> i remember basically it's it's like it's </joey>
<joey> uh on the west side </joey>
<joey> of ikebukuro and it's underground and </joey>
<joey> like it's like it's exactly like in </joey>
<joey> izakaya </joey>
<joey> so it has like food and everything but </joey>
<joey> you pour your own drinks </joey>
<joey> oh yeah i think i've been to that one as </joey>
<garnt> well and there's like a huge like tub </garnt>
<garnt> like it's like a [ __ ] barrel full of </garnt>
<garnt> miso shooter </garnt>
<connor> like miso soup and it's just all you can </connor>
<connor> drink miso soup as well it's the best </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] thing ever because it's just </connor>
<connor> like because miso soup is like </connor>
<joey> the ultimate hangover drink in my </joey>
<connor> opinion yeah because </connor>
<garnt> like another thing i want to talk about </garnt>
<garnt> when it comes to japanese drinking </garnt>
<joey> culture </joey>
<joey> is nomihoudai oh which is um all you can </joey>
<joey> drink </joey>
<joey> which any time you anytime someone from </joey>
<joey> england </joey>
<joey> or like america or someone comes here </joey>
<joey> and they </joey>
<joey> see how many like they they learn about </joey>
<joey> the all-you-can-drink culture yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah it's like </joey>
<garnt> boys i'm i'm moving here i'm coming out </garnt>
<joey> every night </joey>
<joey> every australian i've taken to a normal </joey>
<joey> holiday has always either been like </joey>
<garnt> so is there like a drink limit or </garnt>
<garnt> they're like </garnt>
<garnt> oh it's only for like 10 minutes all </garnt>
<garnt> right like it's like happy hour right </garnt>
<garnt> it's like no you can do it for as long </garnt>
<garnt> as you want they're just like </garnt>
<garnt> how are they how much is like a typical </garnt>
<connor> nomihoudai </connor>
<joey> 1500 for 30 minutes is it no no no no </joey>
<connor> it's cheaper than that you go either </connor>
<joey> either it's like i've seen like 2 000 </joey>
<garnt> yen for two hours yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i think it's it's about so it's about 20 </garnt>
<connor> bucks for two hours of all your </connor>
<connor> computers where you go but generally </connor>
<connor> it's around that price around that price </connor>
<garnt> and compared to like everywhere you see </garnt>
<garnt> in england </garnt>
<joey> and everything that's like a massively </joey>
<joey> good deal </joey>
<joey> exactly it's like why would you not like </joey>
<joey> even if you can't drink that much right </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> why would you not take that even if </joey>
<connor> you'd like </connor>
<connor> i'm at like a brisk pace yeah it's still </connor>
<connor> a good value for money yeah because even </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<joey> say like you know it's like 500 yen for </joey>
<joey> a beer yeah </joey>
<connor> even if you drink four beers in the two </connor>
<connor> hours you're still getting your money's </connor>
<connor> worth yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah so it's like every time i'm just </connor>
<joey> like i don't really feel like drinking </joey>
<joey> that much </joey>
<joey> let's go let me hold it i i remember </joey>
<joey> because obviously when you move here you </joey>
<joey> kind of like stop wanting all you can </joey>
<connor> drink because you're like it wears off </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah well the first few times i </joey>
<connor> visited here i remember thinking like </connor>
<connor> treating it like an olympic event i'm </connor>
<connor> like right how many can i do in the chat </connor>
<garnt> no because because that's that's what it </garnt>
<garnt> would be like if there wasn't all you </garnt>
<garnt> can drink in england </garnt>
<connor> right well it would be yeah that's how </connor>
<joey> we think because that's how we're wired </joey>
<joey> you're like yeah you're like 80 </joey>
<connor> speed running i was like i was like </connor>
<joey> get the clock ready time time </joey>
<joey> i remember i literally had this dilemma </joey>
<joey> i was like i was drinking a beer and the </joey>
<joey> first one i smashed it back no problem </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> it was easy second beer i was like [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> i'm two seconds off pace </joey>
<connor> like i remember i i actually remember </connor>
<connor> being like i'm one minute off the pace </connor>
<garnt> actually i'm so good </garnt>
<joey> i was like exactly the same you're like </joey>
<joey> if how many </joey>
<joey> how many beers do i need to drink to </joey>
<joey> make this worth in how many can i go </joey>
<joey> over yeah you're like calculating this </joey>
<joey> in your hair to be like okay if i drink </joey>
<joey> one beer every five to ten minutes then </joey>
<garnt> i can smash this many beers and i would </garnt>
<garnt> be like </garnt>
<garnt> earning back this amount of money you </garnt>
<joey> know what i mean yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> they're trying to get like stalks </joey>
<connor> because because we </connor>
<connor> i remember this we i first came here as </connor>
<joey> a tourist we visited a bar that had 200 </joey>
<joey> yen </joey>
<joey> beers yeah i thought okay that's my new </joey>
<joey> baseline yeah for all you can drink </joey>
<joey> i need to make sure i get more of my </joey>
<joey> money </joey>
<joey> i need to make sure it's more better </joey>
<joey> value than 200 yen a beer </joey>
<joey> so i think we went to one that was like </joey>
<joey> 2 000 yen for two hours and i was like </joey>
<joey> okay in my head i'm working it out i'm </joey>
<joey> like okay yeah that's ten beers and then </joey>
<joey> i need to get at least ten beers yeah so </joey>
<joey> i was like all right i gotta get 11. </joey>
<joey> just to just to get an under so i feel </joey>
<joey> like this was worth coming to </joey>
<joey> and i remember i was in so much [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> pain on like the ninth beer </joey>
<connor> yeah that i got because we were eating </connor>
<joey> as well yeah my stomach was like </joey>
<joey> because i think it was like eight beers </joey>
<joey> in where i was like i don't know if i </joey>
<joey> forgot to tell you but you can get other </joey>
<joey> drinks too like it's not it doesn't have </joey>
<connor> to be just </connor>
<connor> i knew that getting all you can drink </connor>
<connor> like spirits was playing with fire oh </connor>
<connor> yeah and i would i would have been like </connor>
<connor> on the floor </connor>
<connor> so i'm like nah i'll stick with beer </connor>
<connor> because beer is like the natural piece </connor>
<joey> now i'm gonna take you guys to the 50 </joey>
<connor> yen beer place because it's not an oil </connor>
<garnt> you can drink but it's 50 </garnt>
<joey> i mean it's 50 yen so it might as well </joey>
<joey> be all you can yeah right because i feel </joey>
<joey> like that's just the difference in </joey>
<joey> mindset between anyone from like the </joey>
<joey> west </joey>
<joey> people in japan right because when </joey>
<joey> anyone in the west comes over and hears </joey>
<joey> all you can drink or you can eat it's </joey>
<joey> it's a it's the same mindset where it's </joey>
<joey> just like </joey>
<garnt> i've got i've got to [ __ ] speed run </garnt>
<garnt> this optimize this what is the optimal </garnt>
<garnt> speed one strats </garnt>
<garnt> all you can drink and japanese people </garnt>
<garnt> are just like you know we just drink </garnt>
<connor> however much we feel like it's just like </connor>
<connor> the pressure of not having to know how </connor>
<connor> much i'm gonna </connor>
<garnt> yeah because i think it works on like </garnt>
<connor> the trust system yeah because i remember </connor>
<connor> we trust you not to be a [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> alcoholic because </connor>
<connor> that's why this would never work in any </connor>
<connor> other country but like japan </connor>
<joey> yeah because i remember i went to like </joey>
<joey> uh i went to this uh kind of like no it </joey>
<joey> wasn't a wine bar was like the place </joey>
<joey> that they make wine what's that called </joey>
<joey> winery that's that's the place so i went </joey>
<joey> to this winery with sydney um just </joey>
<joey> outside of tokyo </joey>
<joey> um and they basically had a cellar of </joey>
<joey> about like a thousand different wines </joey>
<joey> right and basically you could you could </joey>
<joey> sample as much as you </joey>
<garnt> as much as you like for ten bucks ten </garnt>
<garnt> bucks you had a seller of a thousand </garnt>
<connor> that's like </connor>
<connor> that's gonna be some willy wonka test </connor>
<connor> it's like if you actually go greedy </connor>
<connor> you're gonna like get killed </connor>
<garnt> that's exactly the point that's exactly </garnt>
<garnt> the point i'm trying to make so uh </garnt>
<garnt> so me and sydney went in being like the </garnt>
<connor> exact same mindset where it's like there </connor>
<connor> must be a catch there must be a gadget </connor>
<connor> one of them is poison so we go down </connor>
<joey> there and there and they give us like </joey>
<joey> this little cup right it's like the </joey>
<joey> super small cup </joey>
<joey> uh where you can pour like i'd say a </joey>
<joey> third of a glass of wine into it okay </joey>
<joey> and these japanese people were just </joey>
<joey> pouring like </joey>
<joey> one little drop like two little drops </joey>
<joey> now just like just like letting it </joey>
<joey> letting the drop like sit on their </joey>
<joey> tongue yeah yeah and then we were just </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> but we can draw we can pour however much </joey>
<joey> we want rice sorry in sydney </joey>
<joey> like because that's that's the thing </joey>
<joey> it's based on the trust system yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> but </joey>
<joey> you know if you want to but but if you </joey>
<joey> want to you can just pour however much </joey>
<garnt> you want for as many wines as you want </garnt>
<garnt> and no one's going to stop you right so </garnt>
<joey> there's something there's something </joey>
<joey> similar to that that i saw in uh </joey>
<connor> oh [ __ ] where was it i think it was in </connor>
<connor> nagano when i went for a trip it was </connor>
<connor> like a sponsored trip and </connor>
<joey> at the station because nagano is kind of </joey>
<joey> known for its sake </joey>
<joey> yeah there was exactly the same thing it </joey>
<joey> was like 50 </joey>
<connor> to like 100 like barrels of all sorts of </connor>
<connor> different sake and it's like yeah again </connor>
<connor> like it was like one of everything yeah </connor>
<garnt> it was like yeah it was like a thousand </garnt>
<joey> yen for like all you can test </joey>
<garnt> oh you can test oh you can it's not all </garnt>
<joey> you can drink it's all you can test yeah </joey>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<garnt> all you can sample and i'm just like </garnt>
<joey> hell yeah </joey>
<garnt> but but there's nothing stopping you </garnt>
<garnt> from sampling as much as you're like </garnt>
<joey> right </joey>
<joey> i was like 20 and i was like i'm only a </joey>
<garnt> fifth of the way through this i'm about </garnt>
<garnt> to [ __ ] like imagine if you can ask </garnt>
<joey> for a free sample but there's no one </joey>
<joey> stopping you from asking for unlimited </joey>
<joey> free stuff </joey>
<joey> you get unlimited free samples that's </joey>
<joey> basically the mindset </joey>
<joey> so it's so like we're here as a </joey>
<garnt> westerner thinking we got the [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> cheat code to this </garnt>
<joey> yeah so we can just like it's like </joey>
<joey> bottomless fries but if you can go up </joey>
<joey> and get your own fries right </joey>
<connor> it's like it's like having a buff in </connor>
<connor> this country it's like being british </connor>
<joey> with </joey>
<joey> the alcohol it's like oh [ __ ] yeah </joey>
<joey> what's like another </joey>
<joey> establishment that's like very specific </joey>
<joey> to like japanese nightlife because i </joey>
<joey> like to think that like the </joey>
<joey> karaoke nightlife i mean karaoke </joey>
<garnt> nightlife here has just got it </garnt>
<joey> done like it's it's it's the perfect </joey>
<garnt> it's the perfect kind of place for </garnt>
<joey> karaoke because </joey>
<joey> i didn't realize until recently but like </joey>
<joey> the karaoke in japan </joey>
<joey> is so much different to the perception </joey>
<connor> of karaoke in western countries because </connor>
<connor> i remember </connor>
<connor> when uh yumi and felix </connor>
<connor> when we took felix to a karaoke for the </connor>
<connor> first time he didn't want to go </connor>
<joey> yeah he was kind of like oh karaoke </joey>
<connor> cringe that sounds cringe because i </connor>
<connor> think in his mind </connor>
<joey> his idea of karaoke is an open bar </joey>
<joey> karaoke yeah </joey>
<garnt> which i think a lot of people think i </garnt>
<garnt> think a lot of people think because in </garnt>
<garnt> japan i feel like </garnt>
<garnt> after the izakaya you know or after </garnt>
<connor> going to a pub in england </connor>
<connor> the the president is after the pub you </connor>
<connor> basically go clubbing there's no other </connor>
<connor> place to go but in </connor>
<joey> in japan you'll go home and watch yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah exactly right </joey>
<connor> but in japan you can just go to karaoke </connor>
<joey> and just continue the sesh there </joey>
<joey> also hang out with your mates and sing a </joey>
<joey> bunch of songs as well it's all you can </joey>
<joey> drink it </joey>
<joey> again it's all you can drink everywhere </joey>
<garnt> you go in japan you can get all you can </garnt>
<garnt> drink </garnt>
<joey> it's [ __ ] great it's all you can </joey>
<connor> drink and the karaoke establishment is </connor>
<joey> open 24 hours yeah </joey>
<connor> which is just like a power move yeah </connor>
<connor> although i swear like whichever brand is </connor>
<connor> offering because not all of them do all </connor>
<connor> you can drink and some of them do it for </connor>
<connor> like way more expensive than others oh </connor>
<connor> yeah i never know which </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] one it is so i just walk in and </connor>
<connor> i'm like please be the cheaper that's </connor>
<joey> like yeah that's the thing though like </joey>
<connor> you have to kind of </connor>
<connor> go around to each brand of karaoke chain </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah and kind of be like </connor>
<connor> okay this is the cheapest one for all </connor>
<connor> you can drink this is the most expensive </connor>
<connor> one for you can drink so you have to </connor>
<joey> kind of be like okay do i </joey>
<joey> take value over price or price over </joey>
<joey> value yeah </joey>
<joey> right because you know that if you go to </joey>
<joey> the cheap ones the food is probably </joey>
<garnt> going to be like not that great </garnt>
<garnt> because like i've never like my entire </garnt>
<joey> life i've never really enjoyed karaoke </joey>
<joey> until i experienced karaoke in japan </joey>
<joey> right because </joey>
<joey> it's not only it's not only like having </joey>
<joey> having a private room so to explain </joey>
<joey> japanese karaoke you have this private </joey>
<joey> room </joey>
<joey> where you can just sing as many songs as </joey>
<garnt> you like that you choose </garnt>
<garnt> um there's no one watching you apart </garnt>
<garnt> from your own mates and you can just </garnt>
<garnt> have fun and sing whatever the hell you </garnt>
<connor> want it's basically just karaoke at home </connor>
<connor> right they also have like every single </connor>
<garnt> like western song so yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> so like they have a selection that is </garnt>
<joey> like it that eclipses everywhere else </joey>
<joey> i've been to </joey>
<joey> they have like english songs chinese </joey>
<joey> songs korean songs and obviously </joey>
<joey> japanese </joey>
<joey> anime songs i was about to say </joey>
<joey> man singing singing anime songs while </joey>
<joey> you're playing it as a weeb </joey>
<joey> that was like i remember my first </joey>
<garnt> experience was with joey and it was like </garnt>
<garnt> one of the funnest experiences </garnt>
<garnt> ever it's like seeing that list of all </garnt>
<garnt> the anime songs it's like opening </garnt>
<garnt> pandora's box </garnt>
<garnt> you're like which one do i sing </garnt>
<joey> it's like and then the moment he </joey>
<joey> selected [ __ ] tell me why by the pen </joey>
<garnt> pals i was just like </garnt>
<garnt> yeah okay the original the original </garnt>
<joey> berserk </joey>
<joey> with the shittiest guitar riff in </joey>
<garnt> existence i'm like </garnt>
<connor> yeah hell yeah like it's already bad in </connor>
<garnt> the original but then the karaoke </garnt>
<joey> version was like oh </joey>
<garnt> this is so much worse but it's so much </garnt>
<garnt> better it lasted at 3am we [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> destroyed that song more than it already </garnt>
<joey> destroyed itself </joey>
<joey> like three times </joey>
<connor> i think it's back open though right from </connor>
<connor> what i understand yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> but it's hard to get in that mood you </connor>
<connor> know yeah i know </connor>
<connor> i know it's like i don't know like i </connor>
<connor> feel now that </connor>
<connor> we've all kind of been established here </connor>
<connor> it's like become a little bit more </connor>
<joey> difficult to just be like hey you want </joey>
<joey> to stay up till like 4 00 a.m to go to </joey>
<connor> karaoke </connor>
<garnt> maybe because i get i go to bed at like </garnt>
<connor> 12 now i think i get really [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> tired earlier </joey>
<garnt> like my sleep schedule's a lot healthier </garnt>
<joey> now okay to explain another thing about </joey>
<joey> japanese drinking culture is that </joey>
<joey> you have this ticking clock and it's </joey>
<joey> called the last train and if you missed </joey>
<joey> the last train </joey>
<joey> you're staying out until 5am there's </joey>
<joey> there's there's no there's basically no </joey>
<joey> in-between either </joey>
<joey> you choose to go home at like what like </joey>
<joey> 11 12 11 12 </joey>
<joey> 11 11 30 which to me is like if it was </joey>
<joey> just one hour later or like two hours </joey>
<joey> later it would be perfect </joey>
<joey> because after about one o'clock i'd be </joey>
<joey> like okay i've had my fun this is this </joey>
<joey> has been cool </joey>
<joey> i'm gonna catch the last train now but </joey>
<joey> like having to choose between going out </joey>
<joey> at uh like 11 30 when you're just about </joey>
<connor> getting to that point of drunkness that </connor>
<joey> you just want to keep your mind going </joey>
<connor> to staying up till 5 00 5 a.m which </connor>
<garnt> we've done it several times </garnt>
<garnt> and every time i just feel more dead </garnt>
<joey> inside i'm like </joey>
<joey> there is there is nothing worse i think </joey>
<joey> i think the only thing that is worse </joey>
<joey> than </joey>
<joey> going home while you're buzzed at 11 p.m </joey>
<connor> is </connor>
<connor> catching that first train at 4 30 just </connor>
<joey> like [ __ ] like </joey>
<joey> oh my god it's like sunny outside and </joey>
<joey> then like </joey>
<connor> this businessman next to you and you're </connor>
<joey> clearly a [ __ ] mess you just turn </joey>
<joey> into [ __ ] vampires </joey>
<joey> i [ __ ] fell asleep one time and </joey>
<joey> missed my stop by like an </joey>
<joey> hour i woke up at like 6 a.m like in </joey>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> so [ __ ] northern like the end of the </garnt>
<garnt> line right yeah yeah i was like an </garnt>
<joey> hour from like i think i was like an </joey>
<joey> hour and a half from tokyo yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> that's how far i'd gone and i was like </joey>
<joey> get back and i was so </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] done yeah i was it was like 6 30 </joey>
<connor> a.m when i realized and i was like </connor>
<connor> no so i wanted to sleep </connor>
<connor> yeah i mean that's the tough thing man i </connor>
<connor> mean </connor>
<connor> that's the thing like back when i was </connor>
<joey> like still single </joey>
<joey> and like kind of going out and doing a </joey>
<joey> lot more of like the 4am 5am stuff </joey>
<joey> it would be a little bit easier because </joey>
<connor> you know say like a couple of my friends </connor>
<connor> would be like it'd be like you know one </connor>
<connor> or two a.m </connor>
<connor> and be like uh maybe we shouldn't </connor>
<connor> continue anymore it was really easy </connor>
<connor> because you could just go to a manga </connor>
<connor> cafe and just </connor>
<joey> book a [ __ ] room for like two three </joey>
<connor> hours yeah just [ __ ] sleep in there </connor>
<joey> until the first train </joey>
<joey> and that [ __ ] but we haven't done that </joey>
<connor> we should do that more often </connor>
<joey> instead of just being like let's let's </joey>
<joey> uh let's call up a taxi and spend 100 </joey>
<connor> bucks to get home </connor>
<connor> i've always known that you can do the </connor>
<connor> manga cafes i just don't want to have </connor>
<connor> that conversation at 3am smashed </connor>
<connor> some japanese do drum like uh manga </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah hi </connor>
<connor> every single time it's been like i'll </connor>
<connor> just wait till 5am i'll just yeah </connor>
<joey> we should just do that from now on yeah </joey>
<connor> if we're having like a boys now we just </connor>
<connor> be like i don't want something because </connor>
<joey> sometimes </joey>
<joey> i don't want to spend a hundred bucks to </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] go coffee you know we're all </connor>
<connor> going back the same way it's time you </connor>
<joey> split it three ways i mean yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah still it's like you still feel like </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] behind </joey>
<joey> this side </joey>

<connor> time when you guys like kind of stop </connor>
<joey> eating so much [ __ ] ice cream </joey>
<joey> because they came back with like two </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] pockets they had like </joey>
<connor> small tiny cups like bowls for this </connor>
<connor> this ice cream and i was like no i'll </connor>
<connor> take one of the big coke classes yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah [ __ ] pour all the ice cream in </connor>
<connor> there must have refilled it like three </connor>
<joey> or four times </joey>
<joey> but i was just sitting there the whole </joey>
<joey> whole time at karaoke sitting there just </joey>
<garnt> the ice cream machine next to like the </garnt>
<joey> soft drink machine </joey>
<joey> who the [ __ ] would get that like </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah but i i remember thinking like </joey>
<joey> i'm not we don't need that we need </joey>
<joey> alcohol yeah and then like </joey>
<garnt> two hours later [ __ ] plastered i'm </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> coke float coke that sounds amazing </garnt>
<garnt> right now ice cream looks so good right </garnt>
<connor> now it is </connor>
<connor> it is like pretty garbage vanilla ice </connor>
<connor> cream but </connor>
<connor> yeah but when you're like that drunk </connor>
<connor> it's like it's like you can get yeah you </connor>
<connor> don't put anything you could drink </connor>
<connor> anything </connor>
<connor> put anything in my body at that point </connor>
<joey> yo okay you know what else i like in </joey>
<joey> japan it just goes along with the </joey>
<connor> nightlife yeah right it's </connor>
<garnt> the uconn drinks uh </garnt>
<garnt> explain that you can't drink because </garnt>
<connor> that so i should have i should have </connor>
<connor> bought one in preparation if yeah </connor>
<connor> we can talk about this but there's these </connor>
<joey> like tiny little things like </joey>
<garnt> 200 milliliter cans yeah it's like a </garnt>
<joey> medicine bottle </joey>
<garnt> yeah yeah it tastes like bubble gum and </garnt>
<joey> it's apparently like ginger like it </joey>
<garnt> doesn't taste like bubble gum i think it </garnt>
<garnt> tastes like awesome i think it tastes i </garnt>
<connor> think it tastes great </connor>
<joey> turmeric turmeric it looks like ginger </joey>
<joey> thank you melon but uh </joey>
<joey> yeah that tastes like i like do you like </joey>
<joey> i like i like the taste </joey>
<joey> felix liked the taste yeah but felix is </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] weird </joey>
<joey> it reminds me of calpol that's that's </joey>
<joey> why i like the taste so essentially what </joey>
<joey> this drink is advertised as </joey>
<joey> is uh prevents hangovers yeah and </joey>
<connor> everyone in the western world is like </connor>
<connor> that doesn't seem right </connor>
<connor> i'm pretty sure if it worked we would </connor>
<garnt> that was my thought as well like how if </garnt>
<garnt> it really works </garnt>
<garnt> why has england's not used this before </garnt>
<connor> don't you think the entire budget of the </connor>
<connor> nhs would be spent on buying this </connor>
<joey> because </joey>
<connor> then all of the medical problems would </connor>
<joey> be sold like i'm pretty sure we would </joey>
<connor> have it right yeah </connor>
<connor> i thought and then one day on a whim i </connor>
<joey> was like all right </joey>
<joey> fine i'll try it yeah and then it was </joey>
<joey> like having a shield </joey>
<joey> on your liver like none of the drinks </joey>
<joey> got me drunk </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah and it was like that for the </joey>
<joey> first few times until i really drank way </joey>
<joey> too much and then it was like </joey>
<joey> not drunk not drunk not drunk absolutely </joey>
<connor> unable to sleep </connor>
<garnt> like not it's so weird it was just like </garnt>
<joey> the 2020 economy it's just like </joey>
<connor> a corona virus tank and then you're </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] drunk </garnt>
<joey> in like in like an instant because i </joey>
<connor> never tried it until i tried it with you </connor>
<connor> because every time i saw it i was like </connor>
<connor> no that maybe that will work for like </connor>
<joey> one drink yeah i don't go to a musical </joey>
<joey> and have one drink </joey>
<joey> so i'm like no this won't work for me </joey>
<joey> but then yeah i had it and </joey>
<joey> it tastes like us i'm like great this is </joey>
<connor> already a good start yeah and then yeah </connor>
<joey> i think i was like </joey>
<joey> four or five drinks you don't feel it </joey>
<joey> and i'm just like oh my god it's weird </joey>
<joey> the immunity </joey>
<joey> so like it's it's advertises that like </joey>
<joey> you don't have a hangover but </joey>
<joey> really i think you it's it's like </joey>
<joey> formatted alchemist it's like law of </joey>
<joey> equivalent exchange right </joey>
<connor> you drink it and you okay your [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> mother so you </garnt>
<garnt> you drink it and you get less drunk when </garnt>
<garnt> you're drinking it so you have to drink </garnt>
<garnt> more to get drunk but then the day after </garnt>
<garnt> like if you did completely destroy your </garnt>
<connor> body i feel like it doesn't help in </connor>
<connor> hangover </connor>
<connor> if you go too hard it doesn't help but </connor>
<joey> you know those times where maybe you've </joey>
<joey> had like </joey>
<garnt> quite a bit you're quite tipsy you're </garnt>
<garnt> not like absolutely shit-faced yeah it </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> completely stops any hangovers yeah </garnt>
<garnt> please stop any hangover but for me </garnt>
<joey> it stops that tipsy feeling as well yeah </joey>
<joey> in my in my mind when it comes to like </joey>
<joey> whether it gets rid of the hangover the </joey>
<joey> next morning i feel like a lot of it is </joey>
<joey> just placebo </joey>
<joey> where it's just like if i drink this </joey>
<garnt> it'll probably stop it and </garnt>
<garnt> i definitely definitely feel an effect </garnt>
<connor> yeah because the hangovers </connor>
<connor> the worst hangovers i've had in japan is </connor>
<connor> when i haven't drank that right </connor>
<connor> so now i pretty much like you'll never </connor>
<joey> see me go like drinking without drinking </joey>
<joey> it now yeah which i don't know if it's a </joey>
<joey> good thing or not like is my body gonna </joey>
<connor> get dependent </connor>
<garnt> on it to drink because like anything i </garnt>
<garnt> always drink it when i know i have </garnt>
<garnt> something to do the next day </garnt>
<connor> it's not bad for you by the way it's </connor>
<garnt> it's literally just like two americans </garnt>
<joey> if anything is </joey>
<joey> very very healthy it's just a bunch of </joey>
<joey> like [ __ ] minerals and [ __ ] i don't </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] know what </joey>
<joey> like like look at me a monkey break like </joey>
<joey> i know what's in it </joey>
<joey> i'll question this [ __ ] just look it up </joey>
<joey> and you'll find it </joey>
<joey> yeah from what i understand it's it's </joey>
<joey> very healthy it's like a health drink </joey>
<connor> someone's going to come and be like </connor>
<joey> actually </joey>
<joey> yeah it's actually it destroys your </joey>
<joey> liver it's like as if the alcohol </joey>
<garnt> doesn't already destroy them </garnt>
<joey> hidden health benefits hidden health </joey>
<joey> benefits of course </joey>
<joey> oh my god what do you how do you boys </joey>
<garnt> feel about </garnt>
<garnt> clubbing and because i've not been to a </garnt>
<garnt> club in japan before </garnt>
<joey> yeah i've been to a few but i've never </joey>
<joey> enjoyed clubbing even even back in </joey>
<joey> australia </joey>
<joey> it was just never really a thing yeah i </joey>
<garnt> don't i like bars but i don't like </garnt>
<garnt> i really like bars but i don't like club </garnt>
<garnt> i feel like </garnt>
<garnt> okay here's here's my theory i feel like </garnt>
<joey> clubbing is this place that everyone's </joey>
<joey> convinced themselves they enjoy when </joey>
<joey> they really don't enjoy </joey>
<joey> like it's clubbing is one massive lie i </joey>
<joey> don't know anyone who actually enjoys </joey>
<garnt> clubbing </garnt>
<garnt> because the only time you enjoy clubbing </garnt>
<joey> is if you're massively plastic if you </joey>
<joey> actually enjoy clubbing </joey>
<joey> you're someone i don't want to talk to </joey>
<connor> people the people i know who enjoy </connor>
<connor> clubbing are not me the ones who i just </connor>
<connor> don't like hanging out with yeah yeah i </connor>
<joey> know i'm not going to like the epitome </joey>
<connor> of oh my god </connor>
<garnt> they always talk like it's like clubbing </garnt>
<garnt> is like clubbing is great </garnt>
<garnt> when you're like young i guess but then </garnt>
<garnt> you you reach a certain point </garnt>
<garnt> like a few years past and you realize </garnt>
<garnt> man i'd never really enjoy clubbing </garnt>
<connor> isn't it </connor>
<connor> i was just lying to myself all i do when </connor>
<connor> i go to a club </connor>
<connor> is go in see the dance floor order a </connor>
<connor> drink go go dancing for like five </connor>
<connor> minutes realize i'm still too sober go </connor>
<joey> order another drink </joey>
<joey> and then that cycle repeats repeat until </joey>
<connor> you're [ __ ] drunk enough to not </connor>
<connor> remember the night </connor>
<connor> and if you do remember the night it's a </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] night yeah right and it hurts </joey>
<joey> because like you've got to pay entry fee </joey>
<joey> yeah and then you've got to pay like </joey>
<joey> double the price for a drink so if </joey>
<joey> you're not drunk enough it's like [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> not only am i </joey>
<connor> my am i having a [ __ ] time my wallet is </connor>
<joey> taking a financial beating </joey>
<joey> clubs are fast man they're a lie yeah </joey>
<garnt> i'll tell you the only times clubbing is </garnt>
<garnt> fun but </garnt>
<connor> can i tell the story about the last time </connor>
<connor> we went club sure sure go ahead </connor>
<connor> okay i feel like the only time clubbing </connor>
<connor> is actually fun </connor>
<connor> is when the night isn't planned when you </connor>
<connor> when you don't plan to go to a club i </connor>
<connor> feel like </connor>
<connor> like the spontaneous clubbing nights are </connor>
<connor> the best because you're already really </connor>
<connor> drunk and in the mood </connor>
<connor> when when you just suddenly decide to go </connor>
<garnt> to a club so the last time </garnt>
<garnt> i've actually went clubbing was like </garnt>
<garnt> over a year ago yeah with uh and it was </garnt>
<garnt> with connor and two of my mates right </garnt>
<garnt> and it was just a spontaneous kind of </garnt>
<garnt> clubbing night where we didn't even plan </garnt>
<garnt> to go clubbing we just wanted to go hit </garnt>
<garnt> up some bars </garnt>
<garnt> and then we got massively i think we </garnt>
<connor> were just sitting at your house and we </connor>
<connor> were just gonna do that </connor>
<connor> and yeah i think someone brought it up </connor>
<garnt> and we were like clubbing </garnt>
<garnt> i i i think the i think we were we were </garnt>
<garnt> like we were sitting in the house and we </garnt>
<garnt> were just gonna have like a chilled </garnt>
<connor> night right we were telling stories </connor>
<connor> about clubbing we were telling stories </connor>
<connor> about clubbing and i think eventually we </connor>
<connor> were like should we just </connor>
<garnt> go clubbing yeah because i remember we </garnt>
<garnt> hit up a bar beforehand and we were like </garnt>
<joey> pretty we were pretty uh we were pretty </joey>
<connor> merry at that point we weren't super </connor>
<connor> drunk </connor>
<connor> and then we got to the bar i think it </connor>
<connor> was like absolute like absolutely vodka </connor>
<connor> in brighton or something </connor>
<connor> and we just ordered like three of those </connor>
<garnt> 14 shot trays oh my god </garnt>
<garnt> and we got drunk very very fast but </garnt>
<garnt> the person who got drunk the most was </garnt>
<garnt> this guy </garnt>
<joey> i think i had like one of the whole like </joey>
<connor> 14 shots to myself </connor>
<connor> and i'm like bear in mind i think i was </connor>
<connor> just i i </connor>
<connor> [Music] </connor>
<connor> said at the time i just like broke up </connor>
<joey> with my ex and i was like i just want to </joey>
<joey> go out i just want to come here </joey>
<joey> i just want to do something i want to </joey>
<joey> get out of here it happens yeah i was </joey>
<garnt> like i almost want to party and then i </garnt>
<garnt> went i went waiting so what was the last </garnt>
<garnt> memory you had that night i remember </garnt>
<connor> waiting in line for the club </connor>
<garnt> alcohol abuse is bad by the way yeah we </garnt>
<garnt> don't condone this </garnt>
<garnt> this is a story not condoning we're </garnt>
<connor> laughing about it </connor>
<connor> i've rarely rarely do i get that drunk </connor>
<garnt> where i </garnt>
<connor> don't remember exactly what happened </connor>
<connor> which is which i when i speak to </connor>
<connor> americans like that sounds scary i'm </connor>
<connor> like yeah </connor>
<garnt> yeah i mean i'm around my mates you know </garnt>
<garnt> they'll take care of me so after the bar </garnt>
<garnt> we clearly realized how drunk connor was </garnt>
<joey> but we still it was still like pretty </joey>
<joey> early in the night it was like </joey>
<joey> it was like 10 o'clock 10 30. the club </joey>
<joey> had just opened but that's </joey>
<joey> that's kind of the timing we're talking </joey>
<joey> about and we're kind of we're all like </joey>
<joey> okay </joey>
<joey> before the alcohol gets connor anymore </joey>
<joey> we gotta [ __ ] get in this club as </joey>
<joey> soon as possible </joey>
<joey> so we line up just as the club was </joey>
<connor> opening never mind it's like a [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> wednesday or something </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah yeah no one was clubbing no </connor>
<garnt> one </garnt>
<garnt> it was like us we were worried about how </garnt>
<connor> connor was gonna get in because he was </connor>
<garnt> clearly </garnt>
<garnt> over the [ __ ] limit and if you know </garnt>
<joey> uk clubs if you look like you're too </joey>
<joey> drunk i'll be fine they're just not </joey>
<joey> going to let you win bounces </joey>
<joey> bouncers in the uk are like the but the </joey>
<joey> school bully like yeah </joey>
<joey> they're like they will take advantage of </joey>
<joey> any power they have </joey>
<garnt> so we're [ __ ] worried so somehow </garnt>
<connor> connor we managed to get connor in </connor>
<connor> this club okay this is the best heist </connor>
<garnt> movie yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> so we managed to get connor and we're </garnt>
<joey> like oh that's this is it we've done it </joey>
<joey> we've been with you </joey>
<joey> we've done mission impossible yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> so then we go over </joey>
<joey> to the bar as you do in the clubbing </joey>
<joey> experience the first thing you go to </joey>
<garnt> is the bar of course and then we go to </garnt>
<garnt> order our drinks and so i'm here with </garnt>
<garnt> two of my mates </garnt>
<garnt> and we we each order a drink and then we </garnt>
<garnt> look around </garnt>
<garnt> and connor's just not there we're like </garnt>
<garnt> wait if you're not with connor </garnt>
<garnt> and you're not with connor and i'm not </garnt>
<garnt> with connor </garnt>
<garnt> then where the [ __ ] connor and then we </garnt>
<garnt> turn around </garnt>
<garnt> and look at this like look at this empty </garnt>
<garnt> dance floor </garnt>
<garnt> right and connor is just standing there </garnt>
<garnt> at a 90 degree angle he's like this </garnt>
<garnt> and then we're like oh [ __ ] we better </garnt>
<garnt> get him off the dance floor and then </garnt>
<connor> like as we're walking over </connor>
<connor> he starts [ __ ] fortnite dancing by </connor>
<connor> himself on the dance floor </connor>
<connor> and you know what you got to do you got </connor>
<joey> to do it and so </joey>
<joey> the bouncer sees this and obviously </joey>
<joey> connor's like way over the limit so </joey>
<joey> he gets kicked out and so we we also we </joey>
<joey> also have to follow him out the club so </joey>
<joey> we're like </joey>
<joey> do we attempt another club it's only </joey>
<joey> like 10 30. let's try and attempt </joey>
<connor> another club </connor>
<garnt> thinking we're not gonna get in somehow </garnt>
<garnt> connor by pure instinct </garnt>
<garnt> he's like he's like he can't even walk </garnt>
<connor> to this next club but as soon as he's </connor>
<garnt> standing in line he's like </garnt>
<garnt> yes gentlemen yeah i don't know i don't </garnt>
<connor> know why when i'm drunk for some reason </connor>
<joey> i can just like for like </joey>
<connor> 30 seconds i could be like yes of course </connor>
<connor> yes i don't know why like it's a </connor>
<garnt> superpower </garnt>
<garnt> yeah like when you're when he's in front </garnt>
<joey> of the bouncer he just turns into like </joey>
<joey> proper sea dog va yeah the monkey brain </joey>
<joey> unlocks into human brain so then we </joey>
<connor> somehow </connor>
<connor> we somehow get him to get him into the </connor>
<connor> second club okay </connor>
<connor> and the same [ __ ] thing happens again </connor>
<connor> we're going to the bar and then we take </connor>
<connor> our eyes off corner for one second </connor>
<connor> order our drink i look around look to my </connor>
<connor> look to my left </connor>
<garnt> look to my right if you're not with god </garnt>
<garnt> we all know we've got and then we turn </garnt>
<garnt> around and once again </garnt>
<garnt> connor on an empty dance floor is just </garnt>
<joey> fortnite dancing by himself is that just </joey>
<joey> like an instinct for you to do </joey>
<connor> like so i think it must be i like </connor>
<connor> dancing i don't know why fortnite </connor>
<connor> dancing must be my go-to </connor>
<garnt> i don't know and so we get kicked out of </garnt>
<garnt> that club and that was the end of the </garnt>
<connor> night oh my god </connor>
<connor> good night it's good night good night </connor>
<garnt> yeah he he woke up </garnt>
<connor> don't get that drunk yeah he uh he we </connor>
<connor> got him back home </connor>
<garnt> uh i took him on the bed and he just </garnt>
<garnt> started snuggling inside the saggy </garnt>
<garnt> pillow </garnt>
<joey> and yeah that's what he woke up all the </joey>
<connor> instincts are getting unlocked </connor>
<joey> yeah i woke up and i was like where is </joey>
<joey> my phone and wallet </joey>
<connor> where is it and then it was just under </connor>
<connor> the bed but i was like that's like the </connor>
<joey> first five minute panic of my i was like </joey>
<joey> where is it oh my god so you don't </joey>
<joey> remember any of that </joey>
<connor> i remember some of it but not much yeah </connor>
<connor> i mean that was probably the most drunk </connor>
<connor> i've gotten in a very long time i rarely </connor>
<connor> ever get that drunk </connor>
<connor> yeah but you know sometimes you [ __ ] up </connor>
<joey> and do a lot of vodka and uh </joey>
<connor> what happens man because like you've </connor>
<connor> you've been clubbing in japan </connor>
<garnt> right yeah yeah what's that like how </garnt>
<connor> does it compare to the rest of the world </connor>
<connor> it's just like at least compared to the </connor>
<connor> uk right in the uk i feel like everyone </connor>
<joey> in the club is very drunk and in japan i </joey>
<joey> felt like everyone was in the same </joey>
<joey> situation of </joey>
<joey> i need to be drunker which makes a </joey>
<joey> really shitty club environment because </joey>
<connor> everyone's kind of sober and it's weird </connor>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah no almost like step out of line </joey>
<connor> yeah it's weird like no one's doing </connor>
<connor> anything fun </connor>
<connor> except like for somehow everyone is </connor>
<connor> really well behaved </connor>
<connor> and somehow the moment you step into the </connor>
<joey> toilet it was like a war zone in that </joey>
<joey> toilet i don't know what happened </joey>
<joey> there was a dude who was like pissing </joey>
<joey> and he was not even aiming in the urinal </joey>
<joey> he was aiming at the wall next to it and </joey>
<joey> it was spraying </joey>
<joey> and i i remember walked in and i'm like </joey>
<joey> i'm not getting blamed for this i'm </joey>
<joey> walking yeah </joey>
<joey> because i know this guy was japanese and </joey>
<joey> i'm like i'm not [ __ ] with it </joey>
<joey> i don't want to be blamed for this i'm </joey>
<joey> not doing it i'm the minority in this </joey>
<connor> club </connor>
<connor> i'm like i'm the foreigner here i'm not </connor>
<connor> getting i'm walking out right now </connor>
<connor> yeah but yeah there it was so filthy but </connor>
<connor> the rest of the club was just like </connor>
<connor> fine it was whatever it was just a </connor>
<connor> depressing situation </connor>
<connor> you know i'd rather have been smashed </connor>
<connor> fortnite dancing alone </connor>
<joey> any day of the week yeah yeah that's </joey>
<joey> that's kind of a similar experience i </joey>
<joey> had i went to one club in japan and that </joey>
<joey> was enough for me to be like </joey>
<joey> yeah i mean i never really enjoyed clubs </joey>
<joey> but i was like you know what i'm </joey>
<joey> living here i might as well give it a go </joey>
<connor> yeah i just wasn't it </connor>
<connor> i felt like everyone was doing it </connor>
<joey> because they've seen it in the movies </joey>
<connor> there i don't know why </connor>
<joey> everyone's like this is cool right yeah </joey>
<joey> right now right like </joey>
<connor> we've seen this in the movies right this </connor>
<garnt> is exactly how we're supposed to behave </garnt>
<joey> right because i i think the like the </joey>
<joey> most different clubbing experience i've </joey>
<joey> had is probably in thailand </joey>
<joey> but they have like i i don't like i like </joey>
<joey> their club and culture even less </joey>
<joey> right because they don't even have a </joey>
<joey> dance floor so some clubs in thailand </joey>
<joey> um it's you go in and there's no dance </joey>
<joey> floor but everyone has their own tables </joey>
<joey> but the music is just as loud as any </joey>
<joey> other club </joey>
<connor> so try and see so you're sitting in a </connor>
<connor> loud restaurant this is a loud bar right </connor>
<connor> everyone has these private tables so you </connor>
<connor> can't even like it's not a social </connor>
<connor> environment where you can go </connor>
<connor> meet other people or even like like </connor>
<connor> interact with other people </connor>
<garnt> you're with your mates but it's so loud </garnt>
<garnt> that you can't communicate with </garnt>
<garnt> roommates </garnt>
<garnt> so all you're doing is sitting in this </garnt>
<garnt> loud [ __ ] room i must sound like such </garnt>
<garnt> an old guy now </garnt>
<garnt> the music was too loud this was awful </garnt>
<connor> but no no </connor>
<connor> too fair when the music is too loud it's </connor>
<connor> like my biggest pet peeve yeah like i'm </connor>
<joey> just like </joey>
<joey> i've been in some clubs in australia </joey>
<joey> where the base is so </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] bass boosted that you can </connor>
<connor> actually hear feel your chest going </connor>
<joey> dude it's like this while you're sitting </joey>
<connor> there i was like hey how are you </connor>
<connor> my voice is so bassy as well that in </connor>
<joey> clubs like i could just cannot </joey>
<joey> communicate </joey>
<joey> like it just gets drowned i remember </joey>
<joey> like university if i ever tried to like </joey>
<joey> hit </joey>
<connor> on someone they'd just be like what are </connor>
<connor> you saying </connor>
<joey> do you have that thing where you're </joey>
<joey> trying to say something to your mate but </joey>
<joey> it's so loud </joey>
<joey> so you sue or your mate's trying to say </joey>
<connor> something to you and it just sounds like </connor>
<connor> and you're like uh sorry can you say </connor>
<connor> that again you do you do it like three </connor>
<connor> times as the magic number </connor>
<garnt> and then the third time you're like yeah </garnt>
<connor> oh yeah yeah yeah definitely yeah </connor>
<connor> i'd be like yeah i don't know i don't </connor>
<garnt> know whatever they say </garnt>
<garnt> that's just yeah that's just the </garnt>
<joey> clubbing experience yeah i guess i mean </joey>
<joey> we personally don't recommend </joey>
<joey> clubs in japan but i mean i mean okay if </joey>
<connor> that's weird if that's your stick that's </connor>
<joey> actually </joey>
<joey> we don't we've i think we've made it </joey>
<garnt> clear that we don't really like clubbing </garnt>
<connor> anyway so we're </connor>
<garnt> not going to enjoy like japan the reason </garnt>
<connor> i like izakaya </connor>
<garnt> is that it's the perfect social </garnt>
<garnt> environment because i like talking to </garnt>
<connor> people i like house parties i like house </connor>
<garnt> parties </garnt>
<connor> like i've always in university if </connor>
<connor> there's a choice between a clubbing </connor>
<connor> going clubbing going to a house party </connor>
<connor> i'm like </connor>
<connor> 100 of the time i'm choosing the house </connor>
<connor> because i like talking to people and </connor>
<connor> i feel like the izakaya vibe is just </connor>
<garnt> that perfect vibe that </garnt>
<connor> yes just like you allows you to talk to </connor>
<connor> your mates there's also that element of </connor>
<connor> a house party it's like are they gonna </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] up their own house if someone i </connor>
<connor> want to be there to watch this it's like </connor>
<garnt> the craziest house party </garnt>
<connor> you guys have been to okay i've got like </connor>
<connor> i've got like two and they were both in </connor>
<connor> university because of course they were </connor>
<joey> of course they were </joey>
<joey> do you have one i mean i can only really </joey>
<joey> think of like if </joey>
<connor> i have one if you want me to go first </connor>
<joey> there's a lot of like poop stories but </joey>
<joey> i'm like </joey>
<garnt> yeah this is where the poop stories are </garnt>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> all of my poop stories come from house </joey>
<connor> parties what who's </connor>
<joey> what like uh okay so in australia oh my </joey>
<connor> god what </connor>
<joey> another thing about this was [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> disgusting but oh no no no </joey>
<joey> but uh do you know what a shoei is </joey>
<connor> that's why you do the </connor>
<connor> the beer out of the shoe yeah so it's </connor>
<joey> this thing that's very typical in </joey>
<garnt> australia because there's nothing </garnt>
<garnt> why is this typical an australian </garnt>
<garnt> typical house party yeah </garnt>
<joey> but essentially what it is is you it's </joey>
<connor> kind of like shotgunning in america </connor>
<connor> right where </connor>
<connor> shotgunning is like you know if </connor>
<connor> someone's holding a can of beer they're </connor>
<connor> like oh shotgun it so you poke a hole on </connor>
<connor> the side and then you kind of drink </connor>
<connor> the whole thing like this chewy is that </connor>
<joey> but way grosser you </joey>
<joey> you say hey do a shoei and then you go </joey>
<joey> around the tradition is you go around </joey>
<joey> and find whoever has the dirtiest </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] shoe oh </joey>
<joey> it's not just any shoe it's whoever has </joey>
<joey> the dirty shirt it's either you do your </joey>
<garnt> own shoe </garnt>
<garnt> or you pick whoever is dirty it's </garnt>
<garnt> already starting horribly </garnt>
<garnt> and then you grab their shoe you pour </garnt>
<connor> the can of beer into their shoe and then </connor>
<connor> you drink the beer from their shoe and </connor>
<connor> that's </connor>
<connor> disgusting and i mean it's not that </connor>
<connor> exciting of a story but </connor>
<connor> my friend did a shoei once and he got </connor>
<joey> his friend's uh </joey>
<joey> shoe and he didn't realize until after </joey>
<joey> he finished the shoei that he had </joey>
<connor> stepped on his dog </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] so he had like a firm grasp he had </joey>
<connor> a firm grasp of it </connor>
<joey> and he finished it and he's like he </joey>
<joey> flipped it over he just saw like [ __ ] </joey>
<garnt> just smeared on them and like normal </garnt>
<joey> people will be like oh what the [ __ ] but </joey>
<joey> because he was already so ham and he's </joey>
<joey> just like </joey>
<joey> and everyone was like yeah this is </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] nasty </joey>
<connor> that's that's the only thing really and </connor>
<connor> then other than that it's just like a </connor>
<connor> lot of like </connor>
<connor> vomit stories you know the usual thing </connor>
<connor> here at house parties yeah </connor>
<joey> i mean yeah that was probably the </joey>
<connor> grossest but also the most hilarious </connor>
<connor> oh my god we're at uconn i mean i've </connor>
<garnt> been to like a few crazy house parties </garnt>
<joey> uh i think most of the crazy house </joey>
<joey> parties i've been to has been in </joey>
<joey> brighton </joey>
<joey> yeah so that's like my hometown um there </joey>
<joey> are some parties that are just like </joey>
<joey> kind of like you know that scene from </joey>
<joey> american pie where you see that scene </joey>
<connor> you're like there's no way that </connor>
<connor> that exists in real life there's no way </connor>
<connor> this crazy shit's happening yeah </connor>
<connor> but yeah i've been to a few parties </connor>
<connor> where it was actually that crazy so i </connor>
<connor> remember one time </connor>
<connor> where there was this there was this </connor>
<joey> party who we'd heard from a friend who </joey>
<joey> heard from another friend who heard from </joey>
<joey> another friend no that kind of that kind </joey>
<joey> of thing that's </joey>
<joey> been into a horse that there was a party </joey>
<joey> happening in the middle of this field </joey>
<joey> i'm just like there's no [ __ ] way </joey>
<joey> this is true so </joey>
<joey> we had to drive into the middle of </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] nowhere and i was like </joey>
<joey> this is a scam we're gonna we're gonna </joey>
<joey> drive there and there's just gonna be </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> it's just gonna be like a drug dealer </joey>
<joey> then or something yeah this is gonna be </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> we're gonna we're gonna get [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> murdered yeah and so </joey>
<joey> we drive to the middle of this field and </joey>
<joey> and this keep in mind this is all pitch </joey>
<joey> black because it's like the middle of </joey>
<joey> the country </joey>
<joey> where we're driving to so we can see </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] and then we go there and it was </joey>
<joey> basically like a festival </joey>
<joey> somehow they had managed to because this </joey>
<joey> guy who had owned the farm </joey>
<joey> right had just had just told a few of </joey>
<joey> his mates that he was going to have a </joey>
<joey> party </joey>
<joey> right and then mate started telling </joey>
<joey> mates and then </joey>
<joey> that's always the worst yeah i don't </joey>
<joey> know how it spreads so wide </joey>
<joey> right jesus but i feel like it's because </joey>
<joey> no one else is having a party that </joey>
<joey> weekend and people were just egging </joey>
<joey> like people were just i really wanted to </joey>
<joey> go somewhere </joey>
<joey> i needed a party and yeah somehow there </joey>
<joey> was a [ __ ] festival </joey>
<joey> and then things started getting weird </joey>
<joey> they started saying things on fire </joey>
<joey> right so so they went into </joey>
<joey> his house right and then they took out </joey>
<garnt> this sofa </garnt>
<garnt> and somebody thought it would be a fun </garnt>
<connor> idea to just start burning stuff </connor>
<connor> so it started why is always one person i </connor>
<garnt> there's always one </garnt>
<garnt> pirate one [ __ ] pyromaniac right </garnt>
<garnt> and so first it starts with a chair so </garnt>
<garnt> they get they get a chair out right i'm </garnt>
<garnt> like okay let's set this on fire and </garnt>
<garnt> it's like </garnt>
<garnt> it's like [ __ ] caveman mode activates </garnt>
<garnt> like whenever </garnt>
<garnt> whenever you start to fire for some </garnt>
<garnt> reason like </garnt>
<garnt> you see fire and then you're like oh </garnt>
<joey> fire and then like you start [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> dancing around </joey>
<joey> like oh fire i don't know why whenever </joey>
<joey> there's a fire in there like a house </joey>
<joey> party and there's alcohol involved </joey>
<joey> you just forget the lizard brain just </joey>
<joey> takes over and you just </joey>
<joey> you just like circling just watch it </joey>
<joey> yeah and then so they burn they burn the </joey>
<joey> chair down and they were like </joey>
<garnt> what can we do next what can we do next </garnt>
<garnt> next let's get a table </garnt>
<connor> so so out of nowhere just take this </connor>
<connor> guy's whole [ __ ] ikea collection </connor>
<garnt> like jesus so then they take a table </garnt>
<garnt> they set that on fire then as that's on </garnt>
<garnt> fire a [ __ ] sofa appears out of </garnt>
<garnt> nowhere </garnt>
<garnt> and then they [ __ ] just chuck the </garnt>
<joey> sofa in and then we were just like </joey>
<joey> at the back of my mind i'm thinking man </joey>
<joey> the host must feel so [ __ ] [ __ ] like </joey>
<joey> i don't know where he's probably passing </joey>
<joey> out his mind oh my furniture </joey>
<joey> and then as the sofa is on fire we </joey>
<joey> actually see the host </joey>
<garnt> just walk out and he just looks at this </garnt>
<garnt> so his sofa and like his [ __ ] ikea </garnt>
<garnt> furniture collection that's on fire </garnt>
<garnt> and just goes yeah what if right what if </garnt>
<connor> all along you planned this out right </connor>
<connor> because in the uk if you want to get rid </connor>
<connor> of stuff like that you've got to pay a </connor>
<connor> lot </connor>
<connor> yeah so maybe this was all a ploy just </connor>
<connor> so he could get new sofas and shares and </connor>
<joey> not pay to remove his old ones </joey>
<joey> yeah there's always also that one guy in </joey>
<joey> any kind of situation like that where </joey>
<joey> something's put on fire where they're </joey>
<joey> like holding a </joey>
<joey> alcoholic beverage and they're like i </joey>
<joey> wonder what happens if i pour it off </joey>
<joey> like this will probably put it out right </joey>
<joey> it just makes the flame bigger it's like </joey>
<joey> oh </joey>
<joey> i was expecting that okay every time </joey>
<joey> every [ __ ] time animals yeah [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> cavemen </joey>
<joey> there was a so you know how i said i </joey>
<joey> lived in like a student village yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah it was basically a whole area that </joey>
<joey> was just houses and they had </joey>
<joey> also two really big uh like apartment </joey>
<joey> blocks and they were disgusting they </joey>
<joey> were like the cheapest apartment blocks </joey>
<joey> you could imagine </joey>
<joey> and uh one time people this doesn't </joey>
<joey> exist anymore this place they tore it </joey>
<joey> all down </joey>
<joey> uh so yeah swansea student village r.i.p </joey>
<joey> um </joey>
<joey> they said like oh yeah there's gonna be </joey>
<joey> a party at one of the apartment </joey>
<joey> buildings they didn't say which floor or </joey>
<joey> anything so i thought that was kind of </joey>
<joey> weird </joey>
<joey> yeah and then we turn up and like half </joey>
<joey> of this apartment building there's like </joey>
<joey> bin bags </joey>
<joey> on all the windows right and stuff and </joey>
<joey> then you start going into this building </joey>
<joey> and it's like been turned into like the </joey>
<joey> set of the raid </joey>
<joey> like there's just [ __ ] everywhere like </joey>
<joey> there's mattresses on the floor and [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> all over the place and some of the rooms </joey>
<joey> are open and have like nothing left in </joey>
<joey> them and i'm like </joey>
<joey> what the [ __ ] meanwhile everyone is like </joey>
<joey> drunk as [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> there's like people doing drugs in </joey>
<joey> certain places yeah people in the </joey>
<joey> kitchen there's always that one guys in </joey>
<joey> the kitchen making food for some reason </joey>
<joey> these parties like this building is </joey>
<joey> literally like falling apart and one </joey>
<connor> guy's stealing </connor>
<joey> pizza yeah any beans </joey>
<connor> it was just weird and it was like the </connor>
<connor> further up you went the like </connor>
<connor> more mess it was and i remember going to </connor>
<joey> one floor and there was just like </joey>
<joey> beds all over it and people lying down </joey>
<joey> and i'm like what the [ __ ] is going on </joey>
<joey> here </joey>
<joey> that was just weird and then i just </joey>
<joey> didn't enjoy it because i'm like what is </joey>
<joey> this wait wait so what was the </joey>
<joey> was like an orgy floor or like what i </joey>
<connor> didn't how did you get invited to this </connor>
<garnt> party it was one of those things where </garnt>
<connor> everyone in like just everyone knew it </connor>
<connor> was happening yeah in the village </connor>
<connor> apparently so we all just turned down </connor>
<joey> the village </joey>
<connor> around the village just like this </connor>
<connor> building here and i was like i was like </connor>
<connor> what why did you put uh </connor>
<connor> my ass one of the guys like why they put </connor>
<connor> bin bags on the windows </connor>
<connor> and they were like oh so they can't see </connor>
<joey> what's going on inside i'm like who </joey>
<joey> who can't see because i think putting </joey>
<joey> black wind </joey>
<joey> like blacking out all the windows is </joey>
<joey> suspicious giving it away right yeah </joey>
<joey> that's what i thought and also a bunch </joey>
<joey> of people migrating towards this one </joey>
<joey> thing </joey>
<joey> they completely [ __ ] it though i don't </joey>
<joey> know what happened to it or how how this </joey>
<joey> was even possible i'm sure one might use </joey>
<joey> i mean the fact that it's gone now </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah and then there was a another </joey>
<connor> party which is really weird and it was a </connor>
<connor> house party like just a normal house </connor>
<connor> and had a bouncer which i thought was </connor>
<joey> really weird when i had the house </joey>
<joey> at a house party and i thought it was </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] loaded </joey>
<joey> right right so it was a three-story </joey>
<joey> house not that big but i thought wow </joey>
<connor> this is [ __ ] weird there's a bounty </connor>
<connor> here the list </connor>
<connor> i said my name's like you're on the list </connor>
<joey> and i'm like when did i get put on the </joey>
<joey> list </joey>
<connor> what is this i was like who's arranging </connor>
<joey> this list because my friend invited me </joey>
<connor> so </connor>
<connor> he must have put me on the list and i </connor>
<connor> got inside </connor>
<joey> the first floor just is like a big </joey>
<joey> living room just has one </joey>
<joey> small couch in the corner and like a </joey>
<joey> hundred people just standing around this </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> very average looking laminated like wood </joey>
<connor> floor just </connor>
<joey> people just standing around i'm like </joey>
<connor> what the [ __ ] why is there a bouncer </connor>
<joey> and then you go up the floors and it </joey>
<joey> starts to get weird yeah and of course </joey>
<joey> it does whenever you go up floors in </joey>
<joey> these weird house parties </joey>
<joey> everybody asked i found out that i asked </joey>
<joey> my friend he was like oh yeah i paid the </joey>
<garnt> mountain like 300 pounds just for </garnt>
<garnt> tonight </garnt>
<garnt> and i'm like why why why what would you </garnt>
<garnt> expect </garnt>
<garnt> to happen are you that worried and then </garnt>
<garnt> okay okay to be fair and then i realized </garnt>
<garnt> why he was that worried because the </garnt>
<garnt> second floor was just people having sex </garnt>
<garnt> that's actually pretty standard that's </garnt>
<garnt> pretty standard that's pretty standard </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i was like whatever and i was like </garnt>
<garnt> okay </garnt>
<connor> i'm gonna show because the bottom floor </connor>
<connor> was just really loud maybe i want to go </connor>
<joey> to the floor people who's just chatting </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah right so i go to the third </connor>
<joey> floor </joey>
<joey> and that's where it gets really [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> weird because one of the rooms </joey>
<joey> is like uh what i thought it was was </joey>
<joey> like five beds two bunk beds and instead </joey>
<joey> they just put all the mattresses on the </joey>
<joey> floor </joey>
<joey> i don't know why people are doing this </joey>
<joey> yeah all the mattresses were on the </joey>
<joey> floor and like people were making out </joey>
<joey> and one of them had like uh was doing </joey>
<joey> like a needle i don't know what he was </joey>
<joey> doing and i was like oh this is weird </joey>
<joey> this is really [ __ ] weird i'm not </joey>
<joey> going here and so i was like </joey>
<joey> i asked my friend i'm like there's got </joey>
<joey> to be somewhere else we can go i do not </joey>
<connor> want to stay here there is someone doing </connor>
<connor> what i think is heroin upstairs yeah can </connor>
<connor> we can we not do this yeah </connor>
<connor> university is a mess jesus christ i've </connor>
<connor> never had any like that because i hung </connor>
<joey> out with good christian boys </joey>
<connor> well no sure do i but sometimes you go </connor>
<joey> to a party right cause you hear about a </joey>
<joey> party right you don't know what it's </joey>
<joey> gonna be like till you get there yeah </joey>
<joey> until you see someone doing like </joey>
<joey> hardcore drugs upstairs and you're like </joey>
<connor> i'm not supposed to be here i i don't do </connor>
<garnt> that </garnt>
<joey> i need to go to church with the house </joey>
<joey> parties the more stays you go up is like </joey>
<connor> the closer you get to hell it's like the </connor>
<joey> steps towards hell it's literally the </joey>
<connor> raid it's like the opposite right it's </connor>
<joey> like the further up you go the closer </joey>
<joey> you get to hell </joey>
<joey> because i mean you have no way of </joey>
<garnt> knowing in the uk what the party's going </garnt>
<garnt> to be like to </garnt>
<connor> get there if your friend's like dead set </connor>
<garnt> on going you're like all right fine </garnt>
<garnt> because i've been to as many like dad </garnt>
<joey> parties where you go to and it's like </joey>
<joey> this isn't a party this is a house </joey>
<joey> gathering </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah with with like prettied up </joey>
<connor> we're freaking out </connor>
<connor> right you never know a party could mean </connor>
<connor> like a come dine with me four people </connor>
<connor> making dinner for each other </connor>
<connor> or it could be you know a [ __ ] orgy </connor>
<joey> going on upstairs yeah you don't know </joey>
<joey> until you get there </joey>
<joey> jesus christ no one knows my parents are </joey>
<joey> probably terrified they're like </joey>
<connor> what was conor doing in university i was </connor>
<connor> not doing anything mother </connor>
<connor> i was just you happen to go to places </connor>
<connor> and they [ __ ] up yeah it's funny </connor>
<garnt> because i did i had less crazy </garnt>
<joey> parties in university but that might </joey>
<joey> just be because of the university i went </joey>
<joey> to which was like yeah </joey>
<joey> university of bristol and because it's </joey>
<joey> like a city campus it's like university </joey>
<joey> britain was </joey>
<joey> bristol was like in the middle of the </joey>
<joey> city there was like less going on </joey>
<connor> because </connor>
<connor> it was all like we're integrated with </connor>
<connor> the normal people yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> not more working people so you can get </connor>
<garnt> away with less [ __ ] than if it was on </garnt>
<joey> like a couch </joey>
<joey> yeah mine was kind of the same because </joey>
<connor> sydney uni was in like the smack bang </connor>
<connor> middle of like the city center in sydney </connor>
<connor> so </connor>
<connor> i mean there was always weird [ __ ] that </connor>
<joey> were happening in like the smaller </joey>
<joey> campuses but </joey>
<connor> nothing like that there was just so many </connor>
<connor> run down places so it was like sometimes </connor>
<connor> i think like locals would like </connor>
<connor> see a party and then just like go in </connor>
<connor> yeah i think that happened a lot </connor>
<connor> yeah that makes sense that's why i would </connor>
<connor> never throw a house party that just let </connor>
<connor> anyone in </connor>
<connor> no no i don't know bro talk about the </connor>
<connor> trust system bro you </connor>
<connor> that's just that's like the other end of </connor>
<garnt> it like a stupid trust like i remember </garnt>
<connor> if you were having a party and you </connor>
<garnt> thought like </garnt>
<garnt> you told your close mates especially in </garnt>
<connor> my school because this was like before </connor>
<connor> when i went to university but like in </connor>
<connor> like in like college </connor>
<connor> if you if there was a party everyone </connor>
<connor> everyone in [ __ ] brighton would not </connor>
<connor> know about yeah </connor>
<connor> you know word would get out and i would </connor>
<connor> not throw a party especially on a day </connor>
<connor> like new year's eve where everyone's </connor>
<connor> searching for right right yeah people </connor>
<connor> just rock up </connor>
<connor> just yeah i mean that's kind of why i </connor>
<connor> just kind of don't go to like open </connor>
<joey> invite house parties anymore </joey>
<joey> because after seeing that i'm like </joey>
<joey> that's just too much that's </joey>
<connor> i i'm not i'm not signing up for that i </connor>
<joey> don't need that in mind yeah it's like </joey>
<joey> if i wanted to go to a house party and </joey>
<joey> like four fifths of the people there are </joey>
<joey> people i don't know i rather just go to </joey>
<joey> a club yeah </joey>
<connor> yeah it's basically it becomes the same </connor>
<joey> thing right yeah like clubs are pretty </joey>
<joey> bad but at least there's </joey>
<joey> not people doing like [ __ ] [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> on the dance floor probably in the </connor>
<garnt> toilet that's them i don't care </garnt>
<joey> even fortnite dance yeah kind of a </joey>
<joey> fortnite dance without people judging me </joey>
<connor> and me in the orgy room fortnite </connor>
<joey> oh the mattress is a dance floor dance </joey>
<joey> right yeah </joey>
<connor> oh my god oh my god but uh have you guys </connor>
<connor> ever been to the uh i know it's a proper </connor>
<connor> like tourist trap or whatever it's </connor>
<connor> considered by the the golden guy in </connor>
<joey> shinjuku </joey>
<joey> oh yeah i've been i've been a fan would </joey>
<garnt> you like it no no not your thing not </garnt>
<garnt> really can i explain what golden guy is </garnt>
<connor> yeah so golden guy is like this [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> what is like 40 by 40 meters </joey>
<connor> area if you will and it's just like a </connor>
<connor> series of alleyways extremely compact </connor>
<joey> it's not even a block </joey>
<joey> it's like it's within the block isn't it </joey>
<connor> yeah it's tiny and these bars all seat </connor>
<connor> max three to four people sometimes two </connor>
<joey> yeah um depending on where you go </joey>
<joey> and uh it's really expensive you pay </joey>
<connor> like sometimes like </connor>
<connor> 10 bucks just to sit down and then you </connor>
<connor> only pay like 10 bucks for a drink </connor>
<connor> um and yeah it's a tourist trap because </connor>
<joey> a lot of the time it's tourists and also </joey>
<joey> it's a very sketchy area yeah yeah and </joey>
<joey> if you are a foreigner there will be a </joey>
<joey> guy who is very much watching you </joey>
<joey> yeah the moment they see your foreign </joey>
<connor> they'll come up to you it's really </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] frustrating </joey>
<joey> yeah i went in there once uh just </joey>
<joey> because i wanted to take my friend who </joey>
<connor> had never yeah so i was like okay i'll </connor>
<joey> experience it and yeah i was just like </joey>
<joey> man this is just like a really </joey>
<joey> cramped super expensive drinking </joey>
<garnt> experience that you can get </garnt>
<garnt> anywhere else it's like if you see </garnt>
<garnt> pictures of it which will probably </garnt>
<garnt> be on screen now it's it's kind of like </garnt>
<garnt> cyberpunk house cloud like i love going </garnt>
<joey> to golden gate just to take photos </joey>
<garnt> yeah it's it's like that cyberpunk </garnt>
<garnt> aesthetic where you just got these all </garnt>
<garnt> a lot of these buildings and a lot of </garnt>
<garnt> these bars just like cramped together </garnt>
<garnt> and you don't even know how anyone could </garnt>
<garnt> live in there let alone operate a </garnt>
<joey> business in here </joey>
<joey> because i can't imagine any of these </joey>
<joey> bars getting maybe more than like </joey>
<joey> 10 people across like a night right uh </joey>
<connor> it depends there's one or two of the </connor>
<connor> bars that are decently big but most of </connor>
<connor> them are yeah like </connor>
<joey> i mean there's like a few big ones like </joey>
<connor> outside of golden gate like right before </connor>
<connor> you enter it like near the entrance but </connor>
<connor> like when once you actually go </connor>
<joey> into golden gai it's like how do any of </joey>
<connor> these places stay open </connor>
<connor> i think it's you i think you go to </connor>
<connor> golden gai </connor>
<connor> to meet other people right you don't go </connor>
<connor> there with your </connor>
<joey> well you can go there with your members </joey>
<joey> you can also meet other people anywhere </joey>
<joey> else </joey>
<connor> but there's this kind of vibe to it </connor>
<connor> that's like because it's so small </connor>
<joey> right like you immediately have to talk </joey>
<joey> to anyone who's next to you yeah like </joey>
<joey> you don't really have a choice </joey>
<joey> like in the rest of tokyo you kind of go </joey>
<joey> out your way and be like hi you want to </joey>
<joey> know about my cult </joey>
<joey> right like you got like really you've </joey>
<joey> got to pray yeah yeah you've got to seem </joey>
<connor> like a little weird </connor>
<connor> right because yeah but in this bar you </connor>
<joey> know you sit down you're immediately </joey>
<joey> next to someone and you start trying to </joey>
<joey> communicate and </joey>
<joey> yeah the one time i went was because um </joey>
<joey> i was staying right next to it funny </joey>
<joey> enough </joey>
<joey> and i think it was one night where uh </joey>
<joey> it's my second to last night in japan my </joey>
<joey> first time visiting </joey>
<joey> i think joey joey like gone and allen </joey>
<joey> didn't want to hang out and i was like </joey>
<joey> well i want to do something so </joey>
<joey> i googled i'm like where can i go and </joey>
<joey> then this was the only place that came </joey>
<joey> up and i was like </joey>
<joey> fine i've never heard of it before i </joey>
<joey> didn't know it was a tourist trap right </joey>
<joey> yeah so i just went there </joey>
<joey> and uh yeah it was really fun i mean met </joey>
<joey> a ton of people and then </joey>
<joey> eventually made friends with these like </joey>
<joey> japanese people who took me to someone </joey>
<joey> like the japanese only bars </joey>
<joey> yeah and that was really fun because </joey>
<joey> then they were all talking to me asking </joey>
<joey> what my favorite anime was </joey>
<connor> knowing the japanese titles came in very </connor>
<joey> handy that day oh yeah of course </joey>
<connor> yeah it's just a lot of fun i mean when </connor>
<connor> it works and you go out and you meet </connor>
<connor> people and they're actually cool and </connor>
<connor> it's fun it's like </connor>
<joey> the best thing ever i feel like you got </joey>
<connor> a quite a lucky experience though </connor>
<connor> especially in golden gai because i think </connor>
<joey> so yeah i've heard a lot of like horror </joey>
<connor> stories about goals </connor>
<joey> i think a lot you could easily go there </joey>
<garnt> and just have not mean anything for the </garnt>
<garnt> worst time </garnt>
<joey> and yet spend a lot of money because </joey>
<joey> i've been to like quite a few </joey>
<joey> like smaller bars and establishments </joey>
<joey> that are outside like just outside of </joey>
<joey> the </joey>
<joey> guy this is really [ __ ] cool uh </joey>
<joey> gaming bar that chris broad took me to </joey>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> like literally across the road from </connor>
<connor> golden guy yeah one up or </connor>
<connor> zero i think he's called one up yeah </connor>
<connor> i've been there yeah yeah yeah yeah and </connor>
<connor> it's it's tiny like </connor>
<connor> there's just one bar can only maybe seat </connor>
<joey> like you know six people yeah but </joey>
<connor> like it's like a proper game but we're </connor>
<joey> not talking about the one thing you guys </joey>
<joey> looking to in the uk </joey>
<joey> right it's like a legit like gaming bar </joey>
<joey> and that one was really [ __ ] cool and </joey>
<garnt> way way cheaper than golden guy but the </garnt>
<garnt> problem is that those kinds of </garnt>
<garnt> places don't come up in google searches </garnt>
<garnt> right it's almost always like where do </garnt>
<joey> you drink and change </joey>
<garnt> golden guy always comes yeah i noticed </garnt>
<garnt> there's like a lot of bars in japan </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] tiny and you go in there and </garnt>
<garnt> it's like i really like the vibe because </garnt>
<garnt> it's like a really intimate vibe because </garnt>
<garnt> it can only fit like five to six people </garnt>
<garnt> and there's only like one bar and you </garnt>
<garnt> see at the counter um </garnt>
<garnt> but i do like that vibe and i don't know </garnt>
<garnt> how they stay in business because there </garnt>
<garnt> are so many in japan </garnt>
<joey> and they're so hidden away yeah there's </joey>
<joey> so many like like the cigar bar we went </joey>
<joey> to an </joey>
<joey> ikebukuro right now it was like how the </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] would anyone be like yes let me go </joey>
<joey> into this tiny building go </joey>
<joey> all the way up to the sixth floor and </joey>
<joey> there it is right there it's like </joey>
<joey> how would you how would you know that </joey>
<joey> that's yeah yeah right it's it's like it </joey>
<joey> could be </joey>
<connor> just someone's apartment before we know </connor>
<connor> it probably is something that they just </connor>
<connor> remodeled that's kind of like the size </connor>
<garnt> we're talking about </garnt>
<garnt> yeah uh like like an apartment in tokyo </garnt>
<garnt> just just yeah like a one-room apartment </garnt>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah well you jumped to that bar that </connor>
<garnt> was like it was like an apartment </garnt>
<joey> someone's apartment in an apartment </joey>
<joey> building that had been converted into a </joey>
<joey> penguin oh yeah </joey>
<garnt> yeah and i was like what the [ __ ] is </garnt>
<connor> this and yeah they said food and </connor>
<garnt> everything it was [ __ ] weird so that </garnt>
<connor> sydney actually discovered that because </connor>
<connor> she read a manga that i was based on </connor>
<connor> like a manga that had that bar in it and </connor>
<connor> she googled and that bar actually </connor>
<garnt> existed so it's this </garnt>
<garnt> it's this ping pong bar that has like </garnt>
<garnt> this massive ping pong table in the </garnt>
<connor> middle it's like going into someone's </connor>
<garnt> living room </garnt>
<joey> to get there like we had to go down the </joey>
<joey> dodgiest alleyway right it was literally </joey>
<joey> this </joey>
<joey> hand written sign that says ping pong </joey>
<joey> bar go down this alleyway </joey>
<connor> and so we go down this alleyway it's </connor>
<joey> like a it's like some [ __ ] from pt </joey>
<joey> right like there could be someone doing </joey>
<joey> heroin around the corner you had no </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] clue </joey>
<connor> uh so we go in there and then we had to </connor>
<connor> go up these stairs and it was just like </connor>
<connor> the </connor>
<joey> stone stairs that someone's probably </joey>
<connor> pissed on you know </connor>
<joey> yeah so we go up and then it's just </joey>
<joey> someone's apartment </joey>
<joey> it's just literally someone's apartment </joey>
<joey> but you but then </joey>
<joey> they open the door and it's like a </joey>
<joey> proper they've probably remodeled it </joey>
<garnt> into a bar </garnt>
<garnt> and i'm thinking man how would anyone </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] discover this because this is </garnt>
<garnt> just </garnt>
<garnt> hidden away down two [ __ ] dodgy </garnt>
<garnt> alleys that i would not go down </garnt>
<joey> that's what i'm saying it's like there </joey>
<joey> are so many where i'm just like you </joey>
<joey> wouldn't if you didn't have a curious </joey>
<connor> mind </connor>
<connor> and you weren't afraid that you might </connor>
<connor> possibly get stabbed down this alleyway </connor>
<connor> there are so many places where it's just </connor>
<joey> like you'd never be able to see it i </joey>
<connor> mean </connor>
<connor> yeah that's why i think shinjuku is good </connor>
<connor> especially if you're a foreigner because </connor>
<connor> you can </connor>
<connor> i think a lot of people in shinjuku are </connor>
<connor> like wanting to meet foreigners and </connor>
<connor> stuff like that or shibuya </connor>
<connor> so if you stay to those two places yeah </connor>
<joey> they're super touristy and everyone </joey>
<connor> knows about them </connor>
<connor> but i think a lot of places outside of </connor>
<connor> that you probably won't find people who </connor>
<connor> are super eager to talk to foreigners </connor>
<joey> maybe maybe maybe yeah but that's as far </joey>
<joey> as you'll probably go right </joey>
<connor> yeah i mean in shinjuku you'll </connor>
<connor> definitely find people who want to speak </connor>
<garnt> to you if you're a foreigner </garnt>
<garnt> and like sometimes you go to a bar and </garnt>
<connor> like the people serving you </connor>
<connor> have to have to speak to you as well </connor>
<connor> yeah that's fun yeah i like that </connor>
<connor> experience like the </connor>
<connor> one place we went to that started </connor>
<connor> playing all of our youtube videos </connor>
<connor> so there was this bar that we went to </connor>
<connor> right there was this bar that we went to </connor>
<connor> it like a really small intimate bar </connor>
<connor> um and they've i can't remember who </connor>
<connor> brought up the conversation but i </connor>
<connor> remember </connor>
<connor> they found out that sydney was a </connor>
<connor> youtuber because sydney was there as </connor>
<connor> well right </connor>
<connor> and she makes the stupid mistake of </connor>
<connor> telling her her youtube channel </connor>
<garnt> so this bar has like four like has like </garnt>
<garnt> about </garnt>
<garnt> three tvs in it right and so </garnt>
<garnt> as soon as the bard lady hears her </garnt>
<garnt> youtube channel she just like chromecast </garnt>
<garnt> sydney's [ __ ] cities videos </garnt>
<garnt> sydney's video all over the bar where </garnt>
<garnt> like other people are also drinking </garnt>
<garnt> there </garnt>
<garnt> so we're just there watching silly's </garnt>
<garnt> youtube channel </garnt>
<garnt> and she's she's just like dying inside </garnt>
<joey> that's a [ __ ] nightmare isn't it </joey>
<joey> that's the one thing you shouldn't do </joey>
<connor> if you have a youtuber friend is play </connor>
<connor> their videos in front of them oh yeah </connor>
<connor> exactly what is it about that </connor>
<connor> i've never understood just hearing your </connor>
<connor> own voice or you being </connor>
<connor> not like being silly right yeah yeah but </connor>
<joey> it's just like </joey>
<joey> it's like you're okay with you it's such </joey>
<joey> a weird dilemma because </joey>
<joey> my cousin asked me that same question </joey>
<joey> where she's like okay so you're all fine </joey>
<joey> with me watching your videos </joey>
<joey> as long as you're not there but the </joey>
<joey> moment you're there you don't want me </joey>
<joey> watching the video like how does that </joey>
<joey> make sense i'm just like </joey>
<joey> i don't know i just don't like it </joey>
<garnt> exactly </garnt>
<garnt> yeah like i hate it when i have to </garnt>
<joey> re-watch my video to like </joey>
<garnt> check it like i'm fine with that are you </garnt>
<connor> yeah cause i'm just like man </connor>
<joey> i used to not be and then now i'm like </joey>
<joey> god i love this video </joey>
<joey> god i love you god i love that i loved </joey>
<joey> it i love this part damn it connor </joey>
<connor> damn that was a funny joke connor i'm </connor>
<joey> proud of you yeah i don't mind </joey>
<joey> re-watching </joey>
<joey> back on my video that i'm editing for </joey>
<joey> example if i'm the only one in the room </joey>
<joey> but if someone's standing behind me like </joey>
<joey> micromanaging me and watching other </joey>
<joey> people like please leave </joey>
<joey> i don't want you watching this right now </joey>
<joey> you can go watch it after it's uploaded </joey>
<joey> yeah when i'm not there </joey>
<joey> yeah i don't get it it's weird do you </joey>
<garnt> remember the time </garnt>
<garnt> that you accidentally deleted the video </garnt>
<joey> while we were out drinking </joey>
<connor> oh my god </connor>
<joey> because what happened was we were at a </joey>
<joey> friend's house yeah and they they were </joey>
<joey> chromecast and all my [ __ ] videos to </joey>
<connor> the chromecast </connor>
<garnt> and i don't want to watch my videos this </garnt>
<garnt> is about 2 2 a.m in the night so we were </garnt>
<connor> pretty drunk at this point </connor>
<joey> and um so [ __ ] bad so it was my most </joey>
<joey> recent video and had a sponsor on it </joey>
<joey> yeah right </joey>
<joey> and so here's what here's what here's </joey>
<joey> what happens right when you have the </joey>
<joey> youtube app and someone's chromecasting </joey>
<joey> and you're also connected </joey>
<joey> you can like uh like move the video like </joey>
<joey> skip it whatever </joey>
<joey> and it said like oh like i could click </joey>
<joey> on the playlist of the cued videos </joey>
<joey> and it said uh i clicked it and my video </joey>
<joey> was on i was like i want to turn this </joey>
<joey> off so </joey>
<joey> i click it and there's no off button </joey>
<joey> there's any delete video and i was like </joey>
<connor> well </connor>
<connor> delete video from the chromecast </connor>
<connor> so i deleted the video on the spot bear </connor>
<joey> in mind i haven't been paid for the </joey>
<joey> sponsor yet </joey>
<joey> and it got paid like and i just blowed </joey>
<joey> it like two days ago </joey>
<joey> yeah and then i i was i realized like 10 </joey>
<connor> minutes later i'm like i'm looking on my </connor>
<connor> channel i'm like </connor>
<connor> where's the video going wait </connor>
<connor> wait did i delete the video and then i </connor>
<joey> was just sitting there for like all </joey>
<joey> night sobering up just thinking like i </joey>
<joey> deleted the [ __ ] video what am i </joey>
<joey> going to do maybe they won't notice </joey>
<joey> the video and then on the on the taxi </joey>
<connor> back which was gone i was like </connor>
<connor> gone i think i [ __ ] up what do i do i </connor>
<connor> deleted the sponsor video i don't know </connor>
<joey> how do i </joey>
<joey> how do i play the results recently </joey>
<connor> i remember connor telling me it's like </connor>
<connor> yeah i think i deleted a video i'm like </connor>

<joey> i mean so that's not that bad right just </joey>
<joey> re-upload it and he's like </joey>
<joey> no i mean it's a sponsored video and i </joey>
<joey> haven't been paid for it yet </joey>
<joey> and do you think the sponsors will </joey>
<garnt> notice i'm just like </garnt>
<garnt> ah okay that's that's a pickle that </garnt>
<connor> you're in </connor>
<connor> a bit of a pickle and then like they i </connor>
<connor> can't remember who which sponsor it was </connor>
<joey> pretty sure they probably shouldn't tell </joey>
<connor> anyone because they don't want to yeah </connor>
<joey> uh they emailed me like two days after </joey>
<connor> they were like hey uh </connor>
<connor> where's the video coming where's it gone </connor>
<connor> and luckily i've just been dealing with </connor>
<connor> a channel like copyright issues </connor>
<connor> yeah and so i emailed the mac and being </connor>
<connor> like oh gosh darn it that youtube </connor>
<connor> copyright </connor>
<connor> doing its magic again they've blocked </connor>
<connor> the video worldwide as i'm like retyping </connor>

<joey> i wasn't even telling you i was just </joey>
<joey> like </joey>

<connor> that's a bad thing can you please play </connor>
<connor> me </connor>
<connor> oh my god i got paid for it in the end </connor>
<connor> though that's good that's a youtuber's </connor>
<joey> worst nightmare </joey>
<connor> yeah delivering a video not so bad but </connor>
<connor> having to explain to someone like why </connor>
<garnt> are you delighted yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i think it's it's like you know when you </garnt>
<joey> have to explain to your parents that you </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] up in some kind of yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah and you're like man i really i </joey>
<joey> really have to hype myself up to uh just </joey>
<garnt> explain to mum and dad why </garnt>
<joey> this thing has happened oh my god that's </joey>
<connor> terrible but going back to uh </connor>
<connor> japan nightlife yeah how do we keep </connor>
<connor> going off on these [ __ ] tangents it's </connor>
<connor> fun let the tangents happen jerry all </connor>
<connor> the fun </connor>
<joey> i'm okay with it i'm okay i'm just i'm </joey>
<joey> just impressed at ourselves that we can </joey>
<joey> tangent that [ __ ] far away from </joey>
<joey> whatever it is that we're talking about </joey>
<connor> but one place i like to go to a lot is </connor>
<connor> baggis </connor>
<connor> oh yeah i like baggers too have you been </connor>
<connor> in baggage i have not been </connor>
<connor> okay because i was saying before that i </connor>
<joey> was like i don't i didn't remember it </joey>
<connor> was you or connor who hasn't been to </connor>
<connor> baggage </connor>
<connor> i've been back but yeah so baggage to </connor>
<connor> explain </connor>
<connor> is uh it's like a darts pull </connor>
<connor> ping pong there's more other stuff as </connor>
<connor> well it depends on like something it's a </connor>
<connor> mango cafe as well so basically </connor>
<connor> where i did the mango cafe video that's </connor>
<connor> a baggis so they have a bunch of </connor>
<connor> different baggages sometimes they focus </connor>
<connor> on the manga cafe side of things </connor>
<joey> sometimes they focus on the pool and </joey>
<connor> darts bar side of things but </connor>
<joey> basically it's this like 24 7 </joey>
<joey> establishment that's </joey>
<joey> where you can just go and like get </joey>
<joey> drinks and just hang out and you know </joey>
<connor> play pool and stuff like that there's a </connor>
<connor> town in shinjuku in shibuya yeah yeah a </connor>
<joey> lot </joey>
<joey> a lot but uh i'm surprised you haven't </joey>
<garnt> been i don't know i don't think </garnt>
<garnt> that's yeah i don't know i just haven't </garnt>
<connor> been yeah it's a </connor>
<connor> i think it's one of those places because </connor>
<connor> you want to spend at least two to three </connor>
<connor> hours there </connor>
<connor> and you don't you don't really want to </connor>
<connor> do it before your meal you don't really </connor>
<connor> want to do it after your meal because </connor>
<connor> that's like best drinking hours </connor>
<connor> yeah so it's normally like you know it </connor>
<connor> gets to 1am you're like what do you guys </connor>
<connor> want to do i don't want to keep drinking </connor>
<connor> that much </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah exactly it's fine i mean it's </connor>
<joey> kind of pricey though </joey>
<joey> it is a little if you're there for like </joey>
<joey> three hours that [ __ ] adds up fast </joey>
<joey> because they charge you per </joey>
<joey> half an hour half an hour and then </joey>
<connor> you're buying drinks on top which the </connor>
<connor> drinks are kind of a little pricey i </connor>
<joey> mean you can get all you can drink </joey>
<connor> though of course can you </connor>
<connor> i don't even know that yeah you can do </connor>
<connor> all you can drink in a bag yeah again </connor>
<joey> you have to be prepared to stay for like </joey>
<connor> at least two hours right yeah because i </connor>
<connor> know they do a package that's like </connor>
<connor> the till the sun like comes up yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah it's like </connor>
<connor> one to six a.m yeah and it's quite cheap </connor>
<connor> but obviously you're committing yeah but </connor>
<joey> it's like </joey>
<joey> it's like i'm going to stay up till 6 </joey>
<connor> a.m to play pool there's only so much </connor>
<connor> pool you can play before you're like </connor>
<connor> this just isn't fun anymore </connor>
<connor> we both we both aren't good at pool and </connor>
<connor> we've been doing it for 30 minutes and </connor>
<connor> i'm starting to think i don't like this </connor>
<garnt> i i feel like i get better when i'm </garnt>
<garnt> drinking apple yeah i don't know that's </garnt>
<connor> the alcohol making you think you're </connor>
<joey> better </joey>
<joey> no no it's not that you're getting </joey>
<joey> better your opponent which was just as </joey>
<garnt> drunk as you was getting worse </garnt>
<garnt> so for some i think i just doubt myself </garnt>
<joey> too much where </joey>
<joey> when when i'm like playing pool sober </joey>
<joey> but i think when i'm like about two </joey>
<joey> pints in i just like </joey>
<joey> start hitting shots i'm like for some </joey>
<joey> reason it just goes in </joey>
<joey> and then i have four drinks and then i </joey>
<joey> start getting worse again i don't know </joey>
<joey> like i feel like there's a sweet spot </joey>
<garnt> where the where i'm like slightly tipsy </garnt>
<garnt> and i'm like a [ __ ] god at pool </garnt>
<connor> i'm like that with bowling i like their </connor>
<garnt> darts because it's not a dart board it's </garnt>
<garnt> like an arcade machine with a dart board </garnt>
<garnt> it's like yes it's like an electric </garnt>
<joey> some of them are so [ __ ] overkill and </joey>
<joey> what they are like there was one more </joey>
<joey> like you could play a whole rpg </joey>
<joey> in dark yeah that's right i don't </joey>
<connor> remember i was like what the [ __ ] is </connor>
<connor> this </connor>
<joey> and it was like your dart would do x </joey>
<joey> amount of damage yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> and it's so hard with a straight face </joey>
<garnt> like if you're on a date or something </garnt>
<garnt> being like hey do you want to you want </garnt>
<garnt> to play the rpg dog </garnt>
<garnt> that sounds amazing that's pretty great </garnt>
<garnt> for the first time but then some of the </garnt>
<joey> levels were so </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] you had to get like you needed </joey>
<joey> to be like a [ __ ] yeah you had to get </joey>
<joey> like triple 20s like </joey>
<connor> every single one i mean this is [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> medusa should die way easier than this </joey>
<joey> come on yeah but like it's it's those </joey>
<joey> little touches right that i think add to </joey>
<joey> the whole like </joey>
<connor> bags it is a lot more fun that you don't </connor>
<joey> have to count in the dark because the </joey>
<connor> machine just does it for you exactly </connor>
<connor> exactly it does make it a lot longer </connor>
<connor> i've been to like a lot of old-fashioned </connor>
<joey> pubs in </joey>
<joey> australia where like yeah there is like </joey>
<connor> a dark but you get the real darts into </connor>
<joey> those pops </joey>
<joey> they have these like [ __ ] but it's </joey>
<connor> also like plastic dots yeah but it's </connor>
<connor> also like just as dangerous as well </connor>
<connor> i love it </connor>
<joey> joey no i'm good man it's all for that </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] i mean you meet these people in the </connor>
<connor> uk that are like </connor>
<connor> four pints in and getting they get like </connor>
<connor> the peak performance out of four pints </connor>
<joey> yeah it's insane i'm like that with </joey>
<joey> bowling i [ __ ] suck at bowling while </joey>
<joey> i'm sober but i've </joey>
<joey> quickly discovered the other day that if </joey>
<joey> i drink like two or three pints </joey>
<joey> before bowling i can do like a [ __ ] </joey>
<garnt> turkey like no tomorrow </garnt>
<garnt> because you just don't think you just </garnt>
<connor> like throw balls </connor>
<connor> i don't know why but i think bowling is </connor>
<garnt> like the most depressing activity out of </garnt>
<connor> all of the activities </connor>
<garnt> really i think so i feel like bowling </garnt>
<garnt> with alcohol </garnt>
<connor> is fun it's fine but bowling without </connor>
<garnt> alcohol is </garnt>
<joey> boring i think i feel like i like </joey>
<connor> bowling because </connor>
<connor> i don't didn't really play it growing up </connor>
<connor> yeah like i know like this </connor>
<joey> it's it's you're either the kid who </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] used to bowl all the freaking </joey>
<joey> time for fun </joey>
<connor> or you were that one kid who would only </connor>
<connor> ever bowl like balls for fun </connor>
<joey> a lot of people do in the uk apparently </joey>
<garnt> do they yeah why do you think bowling's </garnt>
<connor> depressing </connor>
<connor> i don't know there's an air to it </connor>
<joey> they're always it just doesn't hit </joey>
<joey> different </joey>
<joey> okay so i went okay this isn't an </joey>
<joey> exclusive incident a lot of the places </joey>
<joey> are like this but i'm just giving this </joey>
<joey> for an example </joey>
<joey> i went to a place in california right </joey>
<joey> very nice area of california </joey>
<joey> and somehow in california this place </joey>
<connor> that was very like seemed very normal </connor>
<connor> there's just this one place and somehow </connor>
<connor> this </connor>
<connor> bowling place was the only place that </connor>
<connor> gave me mega redneck vibes </connor>
<connor> and i went in there and it was very much </connor>
<connor> just like like that but it seemed like </connor>
<connor> there was just a bunch of people who you </connor>
<connor> know like i don't know </connor>
<joey> have you been bowling in japan though uh </joey>
<joey> no i haven't well then maybe it might </joey>
<connor> change right now unless there's like </connor>
<connor> screens and shit's [ __ ] like flat </connor>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> you got to stir like a 10. like a guy </joey>
<joey> comes over congratulates you unless that </joey>
<joey> happens no way no way </joey>
<connor> no i mean it there's how can bowling be </connor>
<connor> any [ __ ] different in japan to like </connor>
<garnt> other countries </garnt>
<garnt> i mean there's no rednecks because </garnt>
<joey> to me it just sounds like the you said </joey>
<connor> it was the error about it yeah yeah so </connor>
<connor> but then this whole like </connor>
<connor> okay other kind of like bowling places </connor>
<connor> for some reason universally are like the </connor>
<connor> most like semi-run-down </connor>
<connor> places out of any of like the </connor>
<connor> entertainment things i don't know why </connor>
<connor> bowling's always like places always look </connor>
<joey> the worst </joey>
<connor> i mean they're always the cheapest you </connor>
<joey> know what i mean does anyone understand </joey>
<joey> what i mean but like but the difference </joey>
<connor> is that like a lot of bowling alleys in </connor>
<joey> japan </joey>
<connor> are run by like round ones yeah so </connor>
<joey> they'll usually have like the first like </joey>
<joey> usually with like a lot of big round </joey>
<joey> ones which is like a huge arcade uh </joey>
<joey> chain </joey>
<joey> if you don't know but it's like you know </joey>
<joey> the first like three floors are like the </joey>
<joey> arcades and the rhythm games </joey>
<joey> and then the next like four floors are </joey>
<garnt> all the balls i mean to me it's just </garnt>
<garnt> like an activity to do when you're </garnt>
<connor> drinking </connor>
<connor> i enjoy it but i it's i do think it's </connor>
<connor> the worst activity out of the bunch </connor>
<garnt> why why plenty of time to talk to your </garnt>
<garnt> mates you just throw ball every </garnt>
<joey> few minutes and you get to laugh at your </joey>
<joey> mate being [ __ ] because either like </joey>
<connor> everyone's </connor>
<connor> too invested in the bowling and then </connor>
<connor> we're not talking right </connor>
<joey> or nobody's invested in the bowling and </joey>
<joey> what the most </joey>
<joey> that's not the kind of people what do </joey>
<joey> you mean tell me the perfect level of </joey>
<joey> bowling ratio to conversation ratio i </joey>
<joey> should be expecting </joey>
<joey> because what happens is and and this </joey>
<joey> happens every single time you got </joey>
<joey> bowling right </joey>
<joey> everyone's talking oh it's my turn but i </joey>
<joey> was in the middle of a fun conversation </joey>
<connor> i don't really want a ball so you just </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] throw her like a meh bowl </connor>
<connor> yeah because you're already 10 points </connor>
<connor> down you're not gonna win this one </connor>
<connor> you're not gonna get a strike let's be </connor>
<connor> realistic because you're kind of [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> bowling right </connor>
<connor> and you know then someone or sometimes </connor>
<connor> you okay so then </connor>
<joey> sorry i'm losing if i'm getting tilted </joey>
<connor> over bowling </connor>
<joey> so then you go up you miss out on the </joey>
<joey> conversation and it just feels like </joey>
<connor> you're like speed dating </connor>
<connor> but the one person is not getting a date </connor>
<connor> who keeps going out </connor>
<joey> right the rest but i get that if it's if </joey>
<connor> you're only going bowling with </connor>
<joey> your date right if there's only two </joey>
<connor> people it's just mate this is mates </connor>
<joey> you're in a group and then you leave the </joey>
<connor> conversation and then no one's really </connor>
<connor> giving a [ __ ] about the bowling because </connor>
<connor> having a conversation yeah </connor>
<garnt> it's an excellent it's just like it's </garnt>
<connor> just like a background activity yeah </connor>
<connor> then what's the point don't do something </connor>
<garnt> else well that's that's exactly the same </garnt>
<connor> as like dumb yeah that's all i have to </connor>
<connor> say is exactly myself like darts or pool </connor>
<joey> nah darts you can keep talking while </joey>
<joey> you're playing darkness you can keep </joey>
<joey> talking while you're bombing </joey>
<joey> like what you're gonna do follow him up </joey>
<joey> to the ball </joey>
<connor> what are you gonna do follow him up to </connor>
<joey> the thing like okay okay keep going oh </joey>
<joey> nice nice ball let's go back now let's </joey>
<joey> go talk okay yeah i do that sometimes </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] off i would be like [ __ ] off joey </connor>
<connor> i'm trying to bowl here don't do it </connor>
<joey> okay that doesn't make sense because </joey>
<joey> you're like i don't give a [ __ ] about </joey>
<joey> the bowling i only care about the </joey>
<connor> conversation right </connor>
<connor> i'm bowling right and then when i'm </connor>
<connor> talking when it's someone else's turn i </connor>
<joey> give a [ __ ] about talking </joey>
<joey> you're the most difficult [ __ ] bowler </joey>
<connor> i just feel like it's a dichotomy and it </connor>
<garnt> shouldn't exist </garnt>
<garnt> there's like so many activities i can </garnt>
<garnt> think of that you know no they're easier </garnt>
<connor> paul </connor>
<connor> while you're doing the pool you can talk </connor>
<connor> while you're doing darts you can talk </connor>
<connor> everything else you can do </connor>
<connor> with that it's because it's like a group </connor>
<connor> activity because we're pulling darts i </connor>
<garnt> feel like it's just like </garnt>
<connor> two people that's doing it yeah but you </connor>
<connor> can do it with like group like </connor>
<connor> pool you can all sit around the table </connor>
<garnt> and yeah enjoy it but there's only two </garnt>
<garnt> people playing pool right yeah but okay </garnt>
<garnt> with bowling you know like tag </garnt>
<garnt> because it's such a distance one too </garnt>
<connor> much walking </connor>
<connor> bowling can i just put that out there </connor>
<connor> too much water </connor>
<connor> you have to walk far enough away where </connor>
<joey> you can't be in the car okay this is </joey>
<garnt> going to sound so [ __ ] dumb all of </garnt>
<joey> this sounds dumb i realize but you have </joey>
<garnt> to walk far enough away where you are </garnt>
<connor> then </connor>
<connor> leaving the conversation right here but </connor>
<joey> you don't have to leave the conference </joey>
<connor> you are you're laughing you're concerned </connor>
<connor> if the conversation is like how you're </connor>
<joey> not going to be [ __ ] far away for </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> five minutes you're up there for like </joey>
<connor> three seconds that's enough to leave the </connor>
<garnt> conference i'll be honest i've never </garnt>
<garnt> thought this deeply about that </garnt>
<connor> i thought this is definitely about </connor>
<connor> everything in my life except for music </connor>
<joey> and story </joey>
<joey> so in your mind are you are you thinking </joey>
<joey> like this could be optimized </joey>
<connor> this situation could be optimized this </connor>
<joey> isn't this isn't speed running fun </joey>
<garnt> you know this this is this is fun with </garnt>
<connor> extra steps </connor>
<connor> there's too much gap between no one </connor>
<connor> needs that much run up when they're </connor>
<joey> bowling and if you do </joey>
<joey> something's wrong with you let's shorten </joey>
<joey> the distance between where the seats are </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> and where the alley starts well then but </joey>
<joey> i mean you're not gonna have a [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> 500 meter run up the ball </joey>
<connor> right i know some people who are like i </connor>
<joey> need the full length well then i don't </joey>
<joey> want to go bowling with people like that </joey>
<joey> that just sounds like a douche </joey>
<joey> you're taking this bowling [ __ ] way too </joey>
<connor> seriously i just think that bowling </connor>
<connor> is uh not very optimized sport </connor>
<connor> for friendship engagement i'm gonna put </connor>
<connor> it out there </connor>
<connor> i just think it's not the best i you </connor>
<connor> know what can i say gentlemen i mean i </connor>
<joey> don't know i've had like </joey>
<joey> like because okay because i've been </joey>
<joey> bowling with like i'm sure like some </joey>
<connor> people out there that are like conor </connor>
<connor> knows what he's talking about </connor>
<joey> he's not monkey brain yeah well they're </joey>
<joey> the kind of people i don't want to go </joey>
<garnt> bowling with </garnt>
<joey> because i don't know there's always </joey>
<joey> going to be those comments because </joey>
<garnt> they're going to be like </garnt>
<joey> oh i'm not alone i need to speak up </joey>
<connor> finally </connor>
<connor> also bowling feels like an activity </connor>
<joey> where i shouldn't have to change my </joey>
<joey> shoes you know what i mean it's it's </joey>
<joey> that level of </joey>
<connor> activity that isn't serious enough to </connor>
<joey> warrant me changing clothes </joey>
<joey> the shoes part is kind of [ __ ] like </joey>
<connor> it's not like you're going rock climbing </connor>
<joey> or something </joey>
<joey> right like where it's like i understand </joey>
<joey> i need to bring like you know flexible </joey>
<joey> clothing right yeah it feels like an </joey>
<joey> activity that shouldn't require me </joey>
<joey> changing clothes </joey>
<joey> and i hate the fact that you always get </joey>
<connor> the most disgusting rancid shoes </connor>
<connor> that feel so yeah okay sure they [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> spray it they give it a little alcohol </connor>
<connor> like that does [ __ ] anything this </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] is disgusting okay to be fair </joey>
<connor> though japan is really good </connor>
<connor> right with their cleanliness and stuff </connor>
<connor> like that i've i've never gotten i've </connor>
<joey> had that </joey>
<connor> in australia i don't want to [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> wear my [ __ ] where's waldo shoes </connor>
<connor> while i'm talking to my friends </connor>
<connor> eating the most pathetic fries in </connor>
<connor> existence that have been half cooked </connor>
<connor> while we have a half good conversation </connor>
<connor> and overpriced alcohol </connor>
<connor> i just think bowling needs to be done </connor>
<joey> better and it's depressing as [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> i don't know why it looks like someone </joey>
<joey> said childhood or trouble bowling alley </joey>
<joey> who hurt you i just show him show me on </joey>
<joey> the door where okay show me on the </joey>
<joey> doorway show me </joey>
<connor> show me on the ball no no no no no no no </connor>
<connor> no no because my closing statement on </connor>
<connor> board </connor>
<connor> okay there's a question i need to ask </connor>
<connor> you okay because have you had </connor>
<garnt> bad bowling experiences when you were a </garnt>
<garnt> kid or is it something that you </garnt>
<garnt> know yeah as i become an adult this </garnt>
<garnt> became a thing okay because but </garnt>
<joey> now that i have that thought now where i </joey>
<joey> was like you know what i just realized </joey>
<joey> because bowling places always had </joey>
<joey> arcades right </joey>
<joey> yeah i had more fun in the arcade </joey>
<joey> whenever i went bowling </joey>
<joey> so what does that say about bowling </joey>
<garnt> right because you know when you when </garnt>
<connor> there was like </connor>
<connor> if you'd have a party with like 12 kids </connor>
<connor> yo you're waiting a long time </connor>
<garnt> i feel i feel like you don't enjoy </garnt>
<joey> bowling for the same reason you skip </joey>
<joey> stories it's because there's yes like </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> if you could just bowl 10 10 10 balls in </joey>
<joey> a row and just like </joey>
<connor> and then conversation yeah yeah i'm sure </connor>
<joey> you would enjoy it there yeah </joey>
<garnt> but you're just like scared i think i </garnt>
<connor> thought i skipped the other part </connor>
<connor> i think because it's like i don't know </connor>
<connor> if you're like this but </connor>
<connor> when it's like not my turn i have like a </connor>
<connor> tiny bit of anxiety of like </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] when's it gonna be my turn i don't </joey>
<joey> know it's gonna be my turn what am i </joey>
<joey> gonna get called out i don't want to be </joey>
<joey> that hard </joey>
<joey> serious no i know it isn't but this is </joey>
<garnt> the thing someone's not really throwing </garnt>
<garnt> balls </garnt>
<garnt> somewhere someone out there viewing like </garnt>
<garnt> experiences where you're just like yeah </garnt>
<garnt> it's kind of anxious just not knowing </garnt>
<connor> when we have to [ __ ] stand up and </connor>
<connor> throw something </connor>
<connor> like i just like to know that okay i'm </connor>
<connor> gonna just do it and then i can come </connor>
<joey> back you're treating it like it's a </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] quick time event like </joey>
<connor> you can go up whenever you want i just </connor>
<connor> want to talk to my homies or play the </connor>
<connor> arcades can we separate them </connor>
<joey> well then maybe well then maybe you'll </joey>
<joey> enjoy bowling if that's a one-player </joey>
<connor> game </connor>
<joey> by yourself i'd be like finally i get </joey>
<joey> all of them do you know my best </joey>
<connor> experience bowling was wii sports that </connor>
<connor> was the best </connor>
<connor> you know why no waiting i could just </connor>
<joey> just just just just just just just just </joey>
<joey> just just just just just just throw that </joey>
<joey> down and it's 100 </joey>
<connor> optimized yeah yeah and you had that 100 </connor>
<joey> pin bolt that [ __ ] was fun as [ __ ] i </joey>
<joey> love watching youtube videos people </joey>
<joey> getting like a thousand pins yeah it's </joey>
<joey> just amazing it feels good </joey>
<joey> well then maybe we should do that just </joey>
<connor> wee bowling yeah he's away </connor>
<joey> no no i still gotta wait for you to do </joey>
<joey> your turn i don't like that yeah </joey>
<joey> you can skip it if you want skip joey's </joey>
<joey> turn skip skip skip </joey>
<garnt> yeah i feel like talking to you for </garnt>
<joey> enough times i'm like yeah i kind of get </joey>
<joey> wonky brain now </joey>
<joey> yeah it's it's starting to make sense </joey>
<garnt> i'm like scientifically dissecting </garnt>
<connor> how your brain is i just think because </connor>
<connor> you know like certainly pool or darts </connor>
<connor> you're constantly </connor>
<connor> like talking next to each other it </connor>
<joey> doesn't really [ __ ] matter when it's </joey>
<joey> my turn but bowling because it's like </joey>
<joey> all right i have to walk up and </joey>
<joey> you know why don't you walk up with them </joey>
<joey> and also you know okay i'm not gonna lie </joey>
<connor> i'm not not a big fan of having to pick </connor>
<joey> the ball i i don't </joey>
<joey> know i'm kind of sick of doing that like </joey>
<joey> because </joey>
<joey> you've been there right that one place </joey>
<joey> where you they don't have your [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> hand size it's like it's either too </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] big where it feels like </joey>
<joey> you're trying to you're trying to grab </joey>
<connor> like three [ __ ] food containers </connor>
<connor> like large or or it's like yes i want my </connor>
<connor> fingers to be crushed to death and </connor>
<connor> potentially just pull my like dislocate </connor>
<connor> my finger when i throw this </connor>
<connor> and you know it because you've been to a </connor>
<joey> place like that no i haven't [ __ ] off </joey>
<joey> that's why i'm laughing because </joey>
<connor> you must have been you because i feel </connor>
<joey> like i'm in a place and you're like i </joey>
<garnt> can't enjoy this bowling </garnt>
<garnt> because none of these [ __ ] balls fit </garnt>
<garnt> my hand </garnt>
<joey> the one thing i will say about bowling </joey>
<joey> is that no matter ball you choose </joey>
<joey> somehow it just doesn't feel right it </joey>
<joey> never feels good like like like </joey>
<joey> you you pick a ball you're like this </joey>
<joey> feels right and then you throw it like </joey>
<joey> oh that that that didn't feel good </joey>
<joey> let me go for the smaller one and then </joey>
<joey> you and you throw it you're like no </joey>
<connor> that feels too light so go for the </connor>
<connor> bigger one again and he just i don't </connor>
<connor> know </connor>
<connor> you never get the right one you're in a </connor>
<connor> constant state of like anxiety to be </connor>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<joey> you guys must have gone to some [ __ ] you </joey>
<connor> know they don't [ __ ] clean those </connor>
<joey> bowling balls on the inside either </joey>
<joey> okay that's all the more reason i want </joey>
<joey> to take you guys to through japanese </joey>
<joey> bowling ball because </joey>
<joey> every single thing that you guys have </joey>
<garnt> been complaining about the bowling </garnt>
<joey> experience </joey>
<garnt> i feel is completely get rid of i feel </garnt>
<joey> like i'm in the middle for this like </joey>
<joey> i don't hate bowling as much as connor </joey>
<garnt> but if i would like to make a </garnt>
<garnt> like a tear list bowling's like a good </garnt>
<connor> seat yeah it's definitely the one of the </connor>
<garnt> worst </garnt>
<garnt> yeah it's like i'm not going to say that </garnt>
<joey> bowling is like an ester experience or </joey>
<joey> anything like it's very like a bt for me </joey>
<garnt> as well </garnt>
<garnt> [Music] </garnt>
<garnt> it's like the fairy tale of </garnt>
<garnt> entertainment sports like it's just mid </garnt>
<garnt> man </garnt>
<connor> remember i went on a date when i first </connor>
<joey> got here and then they wanted to go to </joey>
<joey> baggage so i was like yeah sure </joey>
<joey> sure and in the back of my head i was </joey>
<connor> like yeah i'll take it easy on you and </connor>
<connor> then i just started like [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> destroying them </connor>
<joey> and now they're like oh man i guess i </joey>
<connor> got lucky we started playing darts i </connor>
<joey> started just [ __ ] crushing them and </joey>
<connor> that and i'm like yeah good know your </connor>
<connor> place </connor>
<connor> i'm joking wow she beat me in darts yeah </connor>
<garnt> i just i just like does the word casual </garnt>
<garnt> like mean anything to you like just </garnt>
<connor> playing casually that bowling is a </connor>
<garnt> casual player sport i don't like bowling </garnt>
<garnt> it's cause you can't win in it connor </garnt>
<connor> maybe that's why because i [ __ ] suck </connor>
<garnt> at bowling maybe that's why i hate it </garnt>
<garnt> yeah actually i always wanted to ask you </garnt>
<garnt> like going back to the monkey brain </garnt>
<garnt> thing like your opinion on gameplay </garnt>
<garnt> and we've had a few comments about this </garnt>
<garnt> yeah why don't you like fighting games </garnt>
<garnt> that is that's probably for you the game </garnt>
<garnt> genre </garnt>
<garnt> that would like on in theory yeah appeal </garnt>
<connor> to you the most yes there's no story </connor>
<connor> it's probably like the one type of video </connor>
<joey> game that i've just never enjoyed </joey>
<joey> playing like why is that </joey>
<joey> i've no i think is like the difficulty </joey>
<joey> curve is insanely high </joey>
<joey> and i feel that like i don't want to sit </joey>
<joey> there and have to research combos </joey>
<joey> because sure when i pull one off i'm </joey>
<joey> like cool that animation was </joey>
<joey> fine i guess you know i i just don't </joey>
<joey> feel like i care enough about like to </joey>
<joey> learn these combos </joey>
<joey> whereas in a game like i don't know like </joey>
<joey> a first person shooter it's so intuitive </joey>
<joey> that like it's just one bite right and </joey>
<joey> like yeah it is very </joey>
<joey> anyone can figure it out but it's that </joey>
<connor> one simple mechanic that you keep </connor>
<connor> mastering and you keep getting better </connor>
<connor> and better and so it's </connor>
<joey> kind of like i've noticed that i really </joey>
<joey> only enjoy games where </joey>
<joey> it's a easy to learn hard to master type </joey>
<joey> of thing and fighting game is just </joey>
<joey> hard to learn even harder i feel </joey>
<joey> fighting games are easy to learn no </joey>
<joey> stuff smash maybe yeah smash i think </joey>
<joey> it's much more yeah i really enjoy smash </joey>
<joey> is fun because i feel that it's just i </joey>
<joey> don't know </joey>
<connor> it's it's not like [ __ ] tekken where </connor>
<connor> i have to worry about like the frames in </connor>
<connor> the </connor>
<garnt> spacing and stuff i know i mean like </garnt>
<garnt> people in smash worry about that yeah </garnt>
<connor> when you get so high but smash is a </connor>
<connor> casual game there i said it um </connor>
<connor> i'm kidding </connor>
<connor> okay i love watching smash competitive </connor>
<connor> but for me it's a party game </connor>
<joey> right oh yeah but that's the great thing </joey>
<connor> about smash right is that we can be </connor>
<garnt> really </garnt>
<garnt> fun to watch as a party game but it's </garnt>
<garnt> also a really fun process yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> because the thing that's really hard </garnt>
<joey> about fighting games is that </joey>
<joey> it's hardly ever a party game right </joey>
<joey> because whenever you </joey>
<joey> are at a party and people are playing </joey>
<joey> fighting games there's always that guy </joey>
<joey> or two guys </joey>
<joey> you know you know who you are you you </joey>
<garnt> see people put on like </garnt>
<joey> smash or tekken and you're like because </joey>
<joey> they never they never leave that [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> couch </joey>
<joey> they will never leave it if they need to </joey>
<garnt> piss they're not going they won't </garnt>
<joey> they'll wait till they get home </joey>
<garnt> fighting games don't wait like this is </garnt>
<garnt> what they've trained like their entire </garnt>
<joey> life for </joey>
<joey> like okay let me let me let me smash the </joey>
<joey> noobs yeah yeah let me smash all the </joey>
<joey> people at this party and then they need </joey>
<garnt> to find </garnt>
<garnt> other people like them to like continue </garnt>
<garnt> on this path that they've put themselves </garnt>
<connor> on </connor>
<connor> the same people who rock up to an anime </connor>
<connor> convention just with their like uh </connor>
<joey> the gamepad and they're like i know </joey>
<joey> where i'm spending this yes </joey>
<joey> there's no question about where i'm </joey>
<connor> spending these three days point me to </connor>
<garnt> the room with the the wii u's </garnt>
<garnt> yeah because i feel like with fighting </garnt>
<garnt> games it's </garnt>
<connor> yeah it's i i i i </connor>
<connor> enjoy watching fighting games more than </connor>
<connor> i i enjoy playing them yeah </connor>
<connor> you get you get to a point where you're </connor>
<connor> just smashing buttons you're like i kind </connor>
<connor> of get it </connor>
<joey> and then you go online or something and </joey>
<joey> then you just get destroyed yeah there </joey>
<joey> is </joey>
<joey> there is like the difficulty curve as </joey>
<joey> you said it's just casual </joey>
<connor> but to be the difference between a </connor>
<connor> beginner and a casual is like </connor>
<connor> so [ __ ] massive oh it's huge you know </connor>
<connor> because you you go from button mashing </connor>
<connor> to having to learn like basic theory of </connor>
<connor> fighting games and basic combos and the </connor>
<connor> difference between that counting frames </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah and like different stuff the </joey>
<connor> difference between the beginner and the </connor>
<garnt> casual is so </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] like okay for example right like </connor>
<connor> in a game of overwatch right </connor>
<joey> a pro can be killed by someone who is </joey>
<joey> absolutely garbage at the game like it's </joey>
<joey> very plausible that </joey>
<joey> he could do that right but in a fighting </joey>
<joey> game the [ __ ] pros </joey>
<connor> never gonna lose it's not gonna happen </connor>
<connor> and i think that that element of like </connor>
<connor> all right well </connor>
<connor> if i just play better most of the time </connor>
<connor> i'll always win right which is like it's </connor>
<joey> because in fighting games there's no </joey>
<connor> element of chance </connor>
<connor> yeah anyway like especially if you're at </connor>
<joey> a pro level because they just know </joey>
<connor> like what's coming and i think that's </connor>
<connor> kind of fun and that's the kind of stuff </connor>
<joey> that really </joey>
<joey> drives me into like overdrive of wanting </joey>
<joey> to learn something is that like </joey>
<connor> i had a chance of beating that guy and i </connor>
<connor> could have done it if i just keep </connor>
<connor> practicing i'll easily get it right then </connor>
<connor> i keep going and that's how i got into </connor>
<joey> league </joey>
<joey> so then maybe if you just gave that a go </joey>
<joey> with like like street fighter or like </joey>
<garnt> mortal kombat </garnt>
<garnt> i reckon if you learn one fighting game </garnt>
<garnt> you'll be i gotta be honest </garnt>
<connor> yeah i reckon i would be hooked yeah </connor>
<joey> which is why i don't want to because i'm </joey>
<joey> already trying to learn like japanese </joey>
<joey> the last thing i need is </joey>
<joey> last thing i need is something else </joey>
<joey> taking over my [ __ ] life fair enough </joey>
<joey> airfare fighting games people i know who </joey>
<joey> like fighting games </joey>
<joey> super chill but their life is fighting </joey>
<joey> games like they don't talk about </joey>
<joey> anything else like they're like yeah oh </joey>
<joey> you had a nice day oh that's cool i had </joey>
<joey> a nice day learning the smash combos </joey>
<joey> like it's like it's like what like </joey>
<joey> they'll bring it up when it's not even </joey>
<joey> in the conversation </joey>
<connor> yeah i love leonardo dicaprio but by the </connor>
<connor> way sorry [ __ ] it </connor>
<joey> that's what it sounds like sometimes </joey>
<connor> it's just incredible he's like leonardo </connor>
<joey> dicaprio somehow turn it into smash and </joey>
<connor> it's like what </connor>
<connor> the [ __ ] that's my shame the way i'd </connor>
<connor> smash my combos it's like what </connor>
<garnt> what strike stop i will say like from </garnt>
<garnt> from the outside looking in the fighting </garnt>
<connor> game community looks like one of the </connor>
<connor> funnest communities to be in </connor>
<connor> i love the trash talking the trash </connor>
<garnt> talking is so good and it looks so cool </garnt>
<garnt> in league of legends they they ban that </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] i'm like dude i love trash </connor>
<joey> i love trash talking in video games i </joey>
<connor> think it's so fun </connor>
<connor> maybe it's because like the trash </connor>
<joey> talking in like some of those </joey>
<joey> communities just go a little bit too far </joey>
<connor> maybe i mean league of legends is not </connor>
<joey> true it's like i'm going to kill you and </joey>
<joey> your family yeah it's like a legit </joey>
<connor> threat sometimes </connor>
<joey> but i reserve the right to just type to </joey>
<joey> someone you're bad like i think that's </joey>
<joey> come on someone can do it to me i won't </joey>
<connor> mind it won't ruin my day </connor>
<joey> i'm not in a sense that's one of the </joey>
<joey> worst ways to trash talk right if you're </joey>
<joey> just someone's just typed in </joey>
<joey> you are bad yeah chad lowercase is like </joey>
<joey> how dare you it's like the worst type of </joey>
<connor> insult so i </connor>
<joey> i i competed on the uh like what one </joey>
<joey> time i did a gaming tournament with my </joey>
<joey> universities </joey>
<joey> yeah i was like really [ __ ] good at </joey>
<joey> cod um </joey>
<joey> and so i you're one of those kids yeah i </joey>
<garnt> competed on that so </garnt>
<garnt> of course of course you're a call of </garnt>
<garnt> duty kid yeah so there was this thing uh </garnt>
<connor> oh my gosh i'll just go on this whole </connor>
<connor> tangent then now if you guys are fine </connor>
<connor> with that </connor>
<connor> i used to when i was like 15 i won a </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] ton of cod tournaments </connor>
<garnt> uh because uh modern warfare three i </garnt>
<garnt> don't know if you've ever played did you </garnt>
<garnt> play modern warfare </garnt>
<garnt> a little bit i stopped at modern warfare </garnt>
<garnt> too okay so modern warfare 3 had this </garnt>
<garnt> thing where you could </garnt>
<garnt> pay like 40 a year or whatever for like </garnt>
<garnt> the </garnt>
<garnt> the pass for all the maps and then you </garnt>
<garnt> could also go on this website that they </garnt>
<joey> had </joey>
<joey> and they're like tournaments and i </joey>
<joey> entered one </joey>
<joey> and they would have a prize for like </joey>
<joey> okay first 10 people get uh </joey>
<joey> shot glasses of call of duty which is </joey>
<joey> like later as [ __ ] to anyone who's over </joey>
<connor> there </connor>
<joey> yeah but fifteen-year-old me was like </joey>
<garnt> i could pull my g fuel into the whoa </garnt>
<connor> i can get something for playing card so </connor>
<joey> i went to my mates house because i know </joey>
<joey> that my parents would never let me pull </joey>
<joey> an all-nighter </joey>
<joey> bear in mind these tournaments were </joey>
<joey> essentially what they were was uh </joey>
<connor> stat tracking so it would be 24 hours </connor>
<connor> tournament oh wow right of where you </connor>
<connor> would just it would be like most kills </connor>
<connor> in team deathmatch yeah </connor>
<joey> so you would just go into a normal team </joey>
<joey> deathmatch and just play </joey>
<joey> and then it would count how many kills </joey>
<joey> you had in team deathmatch before and </joey>
<joey> how many had so it's basically just like </joey>
<joey> who can get the highest score yeah right </joey>
<connor> so basically it was like you just </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] keep playing yeah and i shoot </joey>
<connor> you not i played [ __ ] like capture </connor>
<connor> the flag </connor>
<garnt> for like 20 hours straight she's doing </garnt>
<garnt> this to win these shots like hell to win </garnt>
<garnt> these shot glasses </garnt>
<joey> and i was like crippled after it was </joey>
<joey> like it was worth it </joey>
<joey> i came like i i'd won so many </joey>
<connor> at that time that i was able to go to </connor>
<connor> sleep confidently knowing that no one we </connor>
<connor> would be able to like overtime yeah all </connor>
<connor> right i think it came like third or </connor>
<connor> something i </connor>
<connor> won and then and then one what happened </connor>
<joey> was that it all changed </joey>
<connor> they changed it so that it was three </connor>
<joey> hours now way more manageable yeah </joey>
<connor> so i was like sweet i can enter all of </connor>
<joey> them and they were like most </joey>
<joey> flags defended and captured weird [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah so sometimes i would be </joey>
<joey> sitting at my </joey>
<joey> base just waiting for someone to take my </joey>
<joey> flag kill them get it back and then just </joey>
<joey> go back and count </joey>
<joey> and i would do this [ __ ] i won like 15 </joey>
<joey> tournaments or something in the end </joey>
<garnt> i won so my room was full of short </garnt>
<joey> glasses tell you what though </joey>
<garnt> what was the best prize you got ipad pro </garnt>
<joey> at the time oh wow </joey>
<joey> wow ipad when i was like 17 the brand </joey>
<joey> new ipad at the time </joey>
<joey> my mom thought that i was like a drug </joey>
<joey> dealer because she was like what the </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> because all this stuff turned up i won </joey>
<joey> this [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> huge poker set wooden poker set they </joey>
<connor> only made 250 of them right and </connor>
<connor> i still have it at my house because i </connor>
<connor> couldn't sell it because it was worth </connor>
<connor> about 700 pounds </connor>
<connor> jesus it's a wood box like this big </connor>
<connor> and you open it up and all these like </connor>
<connor> wooden poker chips handcrafted </connor>
<joey> card decks dealer chips metal immaculate </joey>
<joey> i'll show you pictures i'll be on screen </joey>
<joey> right now it's crazy yeah </joey>
<joey> um and i was doing these for ages i won </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> three skateboard decks i don't </joey>
<joey> skateboard what the [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> uh a hoodie two coaster sets that i </joey>
<joey> still use actually </joey>
<joey> metal coasters with like cod skulls on </joey>
<joey> them right [ __ ] cringe </joey>
<joey> one like wall decals which i couldn't </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] use i sold most of the stuff on </joey>
<joey> ebay </joey>
<joey> um but yeah i went on an ipad pro which </joey>
<connor> is the one time yeah and then </connor>
<connor> i got banned from competing why you </connor>
<joey> so the rules were not well defined </joey>
<joey> okay and i was uh i don't know how to </joey>
<garnt> how do i describe </garnt>
<joey> a sneaky [ __ ] you you you bent </joey>
<connor> the rules too yeah </connor>
<connor> if i saw an opportunity so when an ipad </connor>
<joey> pro </joey>
<joey> i'm going to take the opportunity to win </joey>
<joey> an ipad pro because it seemed all legit </joey>
<joey> yeah so </joey>
<joey> about halfway through these tournaments </joey>
<joey> i realized okay i'm trying really hard </joey>
<joey> to win these but i think i can also do </joey>
<joey> it a lot easier </joey>
<joey> yeah so basically what i would do is i'd </joey>
<joey> want a bunch of these tournaments and i </joey>
<joey> used that like notoriety from those </joey>
<joey> tournaments </joey>
<joey> to like recruit people to come okay so </joey>
<joey> because </joey>
<joey> it would all it would do is track your </joey>
<joey> stats right so everyone else on your </joey>
<joey> team didn't matter </joey>
<garnt> so if you had a team that was </garnt>
<garnt> coordinated into making sure that you </garnt>
<garnt> were the one getting everything </garnt>
<garnt> right so you so you basically smurfed so </garnt>
<joey> what i did was i got like </joey>
<joey> these like five swedish players yeah and </joey>
<joey> for some reason the swedish and </joey>
<joey> norwegian dudes were always [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> amazing </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah they were way too good and i </joey>
<connor> promised them if they helped me win all </connor>
<connor> these tournaments </connor>
<connor> i would join their clan </connor>
<joey> i was like negotiating online i would </joey>
<joey> shout you out i will join </joey>
<joey> bear in mind i wasn't worth anything but </joey>
<joey> to them they were like </joey>
<joey> he's winning all these tournaments yeah </joey>
<joey> we gotta get this guy in </joey>
<joey> so uh did you ever know the game mode </joey>
<joey> like kill confirmed no no basically a </joey>
<joey> game </joey>
<joey> where you killed someone and they would </joey>
<joey> drop a tank and you'd have to collect it </joey>
<joey> so there's one tournament that was like </joey>
<joey> whoever gets the most kill confirms in </joey>
<joey> three hours one yeah so what i did was i </joey>
<joey> told these guys i was like hey </joey>
<joey> kill these dudes and put a marker on the </joey>
<joey> map of where you dropped it and don't </joey>
<joey> collect it and </joey>
<joey> i just ran around collecting them all i </joey>
<connor> didn't kill anyone and i </connor>
<connor> it was and i should have not done that </connor>
<connor> because what ended up happening was like </connor>
<joey> first place was like 1 200 second place </joey>
<joey> 400. and it raised like a lot of alarm </joey>
<joey> bells </joey>
<connor> that doesn't seem fair so </connor>
<joey> i got away with it for like two or two </joey>
<connor> or three tournaments before people start </connor>
<joey> really complaining yeah and people like </joey>
<joey> this isn't fair he's winning everything </joey>
<joey> because of this </joey>
<joey> but then the thing was people started </joey>
<connor> doing it right so then it was a matter </connor>
<connor> of everyone was [ __ ] cheating each </connor>
<connor> other </connor>
<connor> yeah right and because there were some </connor>
<connor> real [ __ ] big boy prizes </connor>
<connor> there was a jeep one of them jesus which </connor>
<connor> i </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] i was like 10 points off winning </connor>
<connor> a [ __ ] jeep at the age of 16. </connor>
<connor> never mind i was i was winning all these </connor>
<connor> prizes under my dad's name yeah </connor>
<connor> because they wouldn't ship it to you if </connor>
<joey> you uh </joey>
<joey> they also made me fill out tax forms </joey>
<garnt> yeah which i couldn't even legally fill </garnt>
<connor> out which i </connor>
<garnt> what did you tell your dad that you were </garnt>
<connor> like filling out i was like dad i've won </connor>
<connor> a bunch of stuff </connor>
<joey> and it's gonna it's gonna turn up to the </joey>
<joey> house in a ups fan about 20 </joey>
<joey> items i need you to pretend that you won </joey>
<joey> them dad </joey>
<joey> and they were very visibly like what </joey>
<connor> yeah and then they were like okay </connor>
<joey> i guess yeah yeah and so the thing that </joey>
<joey> got me banned right </joey>
<joey> from these tournaments yeah there was </joey>
<joey> this one prize </joey>
<garnt> that was you know the movie battleship </garnt>
<connor> with featuring rihanna </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah horrible they were </joey>
<connor> promoting the movie battleship yeah one </connor>
<connor> of the prizes was </connor>
<connor> you could rent out a whole movie theater </connor>
<joey> and take all your friends to get drinks </joey>
<connor> i thought to myself the amount of street </connor>
<connor> cred i'll get from this is </connor>
<connor> imagine this is an outstanding move that </connor>
<connor> no one will experience </connor>
<connor> okay okay okay okay bear in mind i i </connor>
<connor> have to say people might have called </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] on this whole thing but i was </connor>
<connor> literally </connor>
<connor> eight hours a day addicted to cod so </connor>
<connor> straight up like it's like made for me </connor>
<connor> to do this so </connor>
<connor> what i had was this was a team death </connor>
<joey> match tournament i remember this so </joey>
<joey> vividly </joey>
<joey> and uh in team death manchester to kill </joey>
<joey> them yeah so what i would do is i would </joey>
<joey> ask my friends to go around with riot </joey>
<joey> shields </joey>
<joey> and card you ever play it yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> don't kill anyone okay yeah </joey>
<joey> if you can trap them in a corner tell me </joey>
<joey> where they are i'll come over and pop </joey>
<connor> them in the head right </connor>
<connor> so what we would do is right i </connor>
<garnt> coordinated it was literally so you </garnt>
<garnt> how what what what like incentive did </garnt>
<garnt> you give them to like follow </garnt>
<connor> everything [ __ ] nothing i was keeping </connor>
<garnt> holding </garnt>
<joey> i was keeping this all to myself i never </joey>
<joey> ever told them once i was gonna help </joey>
<joey> them do it right </joey>
<garnt> i was just like i'm just gonna take the </garnt>
<connor> prizes and you guys can help me they </connor>
<garnt> were like </garnt>
<garnt> all right it's good that sounds like a </garnt>
<connor> good deal </connor>
<connor> i do remember thinking so the swedish </connor>
<joey> dudes they had a reason right because </joey>
<joey> i would join their team i did join that </joey>
<joey> team and we won a lot of tournaments but </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> a lot of the other people who helped me </joey>
<connor> out had no incentive whatsoever i just </connor>
<joey> wanted to just </joey>
<joey> have fun yeah it was entertaining as </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] to just go in </joey>
<joey> and do this yeah and i i won some of </joey>
<joey> these tournaments on my own but i was </joey>
<joey> sweating my ass off like i would have to </joey>
<joey> like really play my best and so i </joey>
<joey> thought i'd do that one i can just get </joey>
<joey> it secured i mean it's in the rules </joey>
<joey> there's no </joey>
<connor> rules i was like why am i </connor>
<joey> sweating when i can just guarantee the w </joey>
<joey> right like so yeah i did that </joey>
<joey> and by that time that implemented a </joey>
<joey> feature where you could see </joey>
<joey> like a heat map of what was happening </joey>
<joey> right people were starting to see that </joey>
<joey> it was like </joey>
<connor> 75 kills to me zero zero zero zero with </connor>
<connor> my teammates </connor>
<connor> right and people were like hmm </connor>
<connor> that doesn't seem like a normal game of </connor>
<connor> team death </connor>
<connor> he got a nuke and so </connor>
<connor> what happened was that they wanted to </connor>
<connor> make an example out of me and they were </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> no more doing this no one else is </connor>
<connor> allowed to do this we've banned this </connor>
<connor> from happening </connor>
<connor> right yeah and so they banned me from </connor>
<connor> doing it and i remember </connor>
<connor> i spoke to the other because there was </connor>
<connor> like four of us who won all of these </connor>
<connor> tournaments right right and the other </connor>
<connor> two were like </connor>
<connor> 30 year old men who worked in like </connor>
<connor> construction companies and this is like </connor>
<connor> all they would do in their speed time </connor>
<connor> and i felt bad for them because i was </connor>
<connor> like a 15 year old kid being like i'm </connor>
<connor> gonna take the money that you probably </connor>
<joey> need i don't need this [ __ ] i'm gonna </joey>
<joey> take it i love how they banned you </joey>
<joey> and then you kind of became you like v </joey>
<joey> for vendetta </joey>
<joey> it's like i wanted to make a statement </joey>
<garnt> and i got banned for it </garnt>
<garnt> but it was worth it to get the doubles </garnt>
<connor> to this day i was like for the the one </connor>
<joey> year after that i was so [ __ ] bitter </joey>
<joey> because i was like </joey>
<joey> it wasn't in their [ __ ] rules they </joey>
<joey> just did it to make an example out of me </joey>
<joey> the website shut down five months ago </joey>
<joey> yeah that website failed five months </joey>
<joey> after i was like yeah [ __ ] you wow </joey>
<joey> they emailed me like two years later </joey>
<joey> being like hey could you fill out those </joey>
<joey> tax forms we sent you i'm like </joey>
<joey> and i just never did yeah i'm like what </joey>
<joey> are you gonna do i live in a different </joey>
<garnt> country what are you gonna do sue me </garnt>
<connor> i was 15 at the time was this website it </connor>
<joey> was the </joey>
<joey> official call of duty website it was oh </joey>
<joey> okay if you wanted to go and track your </joey>
<joey> stats </joey>
<garnt> you would have to go and do this and you </garnt>
<garnt> would okay like ten ten pounds extra </garnt>
<connor> yeah a year </connor>
<garnt> to get access to the tournament man </garnt>
<garnt> you're that guy who just tries to cheat </garnt>
<garnt> every system in life </garnt>
<connor> oh dude yeah if there's like overall </connor>
<joey> sheets yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah it's like if there's like loopholes </joey>
<joey> or corners to be cut i'll just always </joey>
<joey> find them because it's like </joey>
<joey> yeah like that's it works smarter right </joey>
<joey> yeah like why would i </joey>
<joey> work harder when i can just do things </joey>
<joey> easy right like i mean </joey>
<joey> that's what thought every criminal says </joey>
<joey> so it was i was not cheating there was </joey>
<joey> no rule against what i was doing and </joey>
<connor> they [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> they banned me because i was too good at </connor>
<garnt> their own game i wasn't cheating i was </garnt>
<joey> just bending the rules </joey>
<joey> i got mad mileage out of that ipad that </joey>
<joey> was worth it all that ipad was working </joey>
<connor> like two thousand dollars yeah yeah so </connor>
<connor> that was amazing and my mom was like </connor>
<joey> still like even after was like hmm you </joey>
<joey> got an ipad yeah you're doing drugs did </joey>
<joey> you send dick pics to somebody connor is </joey>
<joey> that how you saying drugs on the side </joey>
<garnt> are you winning son are you waiting oh </garnt>
<joey> that was such a fun time that was like </joey>
<joey> great that was so fun </joey>
<joey> i loved doing that because i just won so </joey>
<connor> much i wish i won the good stuff like </connor>
<joey> the jeeps yeah </joey>
<joey> that dude that would have been a mad </joey>
<garnt> flex if you want to just i was just busy </garnt>
<garnt> watching anime </garnt>
<garnt> yes yeah i remember the jeep i wasn't </garnt>
<connor> close to winning </connor>
<connor> but there was one time where they had </connor>
<joey> quad bikes </joey>
<connor> about like you know like 10 grand maybe </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah i came [ __ ] fourth and it </joey>
<joey> was for the top three and i came </joey>
<joey> fourth by draw oh wow so i'd drawn for </joey>
<connor> it i didn't get it because of that i was </connor>
<connor> so annoyed i was like mom </connor>
<connor> i didn't get the quad bikes </connor>
<garnt> would you even be able to use the quad </garnt>
<connor> bikes i suppose in wales in wales yeah </connor>
<connor> wait wait wait wait wait wait </connor>
<connor> people to sell them yeah i think like </connor>
<connor> four of the 30 people in my class had </connor>
<connor> quad bikes like it's </connor>
<connor> everyone had quad bikes for some reason </connor>
<joey> those were the guys who like came in the </joey>
<joey> top three yeah </joey>
<garnt> i was like i see you got it that's how </garnt>
<connor> they got it yes i got it </connor>
<connor> i mean it was yeah i mean i i think it </connor>
<connor> would have been problematic if i got </connor>
<connor> that though because i'm not sure how </connor>
<joey> much my dad could have bullshitted </joey>
<joey> because i imagine there would have been </joey>
<joey> a lot more forms involved when it came </joey>
<joey> to a quarterback </joey>
<joey> like ups isn't just dropping off a quad </joey>
<joey> bike insurance and everything right yeah </joey>
<garnt> did he ever find out how you got those </garnt>
<connor> yeah yeah they knew they were just like </connor>
<connor> the first few tournaments that i said i </connor>
<connor> won they didn't believe me </connor>
<connor> yeah until because all of the stuff </connor>
<connor> turned up at once like these twenty </connor>
<connor> except one i think around 15 tournaments </connor>
<connor> total right </connor>
<connor> and they all turned up at the same day </connor>
<connor> the prizes and my mum was like in </connor>
<connor> complete disbelief she was like </connor>
<connor> you weren't lying what is this </connor>
<connor> wow i wish i could get my mom onto a </connor>
<connor> test she probably has a better memory of </connor>
<connor> it than me because i don't remember it </connor>
<joey> very well </joey>
<joey> you you are the epitome of i am winning </joey>
<connor> dad like i literally was </connor>
<connor> that hyper-competitive kid when i found </connor>
<connor> something i really liked it was like </connor>
<connor> i would get just insanely good at it i </connor>
<joey> wish i could have that </joey>
<connor> because i like if i found something that </connor>
<connor> i was because because in that sense </connor>
<connor> you're very much like a perfectionist </connor>
<connor> yeah with that kind of things </connor>
<connor> i'm not like that i'm just like if i'm </connor>
<joey> good enough then that's good enough for </joey>
<connor> me i can never be like that with stuff </connor>
<garnt> but the problem is if i </garnt>
<garnt> if i don't have that drive i kind of </garnt>
<connor> don't care about anything </connor>
<garnt> yeah because like it's so fleeting for </garnt>
<garnt> me when it comes to gaming </garnt>
<joey> i i in every kind of like competitive </joey>
<joey> game </joey>
<joey> i always have this like honeymoon period </joey>
<joey> where you're just learning the game </joey>
<joey> and it's just fun yeah and then when you </joey>
<joey> start playing ranked like ranked for </joey>
<joey> like the first </joey>
<connor> few months are like yeah this is this is </connor>
<connor> pretty fun and then you get to that </connor>
<connor> you hit the wall you hit the wall and </connor>
<joey> that's for me when it stops getting fun </joey>
<connor> yeah that's that for me </connor>
<joey> is when you it starts becoming like a </joey>
<joey> nine-to-five grind you know what i mean </joey>
<joey> this is like i'm not even having fun </joey>
<joey> grinding anymore this feels like </joey>
<joey> this feels like another job i'm getting </joey>
<garnt> like angry for some reason over a </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] video game </connor>
<connor> i'm like </connor>
<joey> [Music] </joey>
<joey> i was one game away from being in master </joey>
<joey> tier at tft </joey>
<joey> and i've only been playing it for like a </joey>
<connor> month and i was like i'm going to be a </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] pro at tft yeah i'm actually </connor>
<connor> going to be a pro </connor>
<connor> yeah and then i i got demoted and i just </connor>
<connor> lost all interest in the game </connor>
<joey> i was like to get better the amount of </joey>
<joey> mind power i'd have to </joey>
<joey> like exert too much i'm like i can't do </joey>
<connor> this yeah and you realize like to get </connor>
<connor> ten percent better would take like eight </connor>
<joey> hours a day of playing it's like yeah i </joey>
<joey> can't do it </joey>
<joey> i can't do it i'd rather be just like an </joey>
<joey> average joe at like a lot of different </joey>
<joey> things rather than excel </joey>
<joey> at like a couple of things i think i </joey>
<connor> think i'm the opposite i think that's </connor>
<joey> what i've been i've been like really bad </joey>
<joey> at a lot of things in my life yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> but </joey>
<connor> the things that i do like you're like </connor>
<joey> [Applause] </joey>
<connor> when i'm into something i rarely think </connor>
<connor> about anything else right yeah like it's </connor>
<connor> like i </connor>
<connor> only want to do this one thing and i'm </connor>
<connor> gonna do it as much as possible right </connor>
<connor> until i'm bored of it and then when i'm </connor>
<connor> bored of it i pretty much never come </connor>
<joey> back to it </joey>
<joey> it's weird every episode just like the </joey>
<joey> the monk just gets like yeah i know </joey>
<joey> people are gonna i know because </joey>
<joey> people i already see some cars who like </joey>
<joey> connor must be bullshitting one or two </joey>
<joey> of the stories i i've like </joey>
<joey> messed up the details and had to like </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] elaborate like a bit extra </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah i i guarantee that the </joey>
<connor> stories where i'm talking about chess </connor>
<joey> and uh </joey>
<joey> i get like i see so many people on the </joey>
<connor> subreddit are being like connor's kind </connor>
<connor> of </connor>
<connor> experiencing too much yeah he's [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> no one human can experience this much </joey>
<connor> life </connor>
<joey> right no no no it's it's normally the </joey>
<joey> the the stupidest stories where i </joey>
<joey> uh you know maybe uh enjoy the details a </joey>
<joey> bit more to make it more entertaining </joey>
<joey> yeah of course with the stories i'm </joey>
<joey> talking about like that kind of stuff </joey>
<connor> yeah that was that legit happened </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah yeah i mean no because like i </garnt>
<garnt> don't remember a lot of my life back at </garnt>
<garnt> the time </garnt>
<garnt> uh back like i think there's just i </garnt>
<garnt> don't know if it's like obviously not </garnt>
<garnt> you but with jujo do you have like a </garnt>
<garnt> blank period in your life where you just </garnt>
<joey> like don't remember much of it yeah </joey>
<joey> but that's just because i was doing </joey>
<joey> drugs i'm sorry </joey>
<joey> there you go if i'm if i'm to be frank </joey>
<joey> with you that's exactly why </joey>
<connor> all right like are you keeping that in </connor>
<joey> mind i'm okay with that </joey>
<garnt> because it's the truth i don't remember </garnt>
<garnt> anything okay because there was the time </garnt>
<garnt> when we were talking about how you were </garnt>
<joey> getting into anime yeah and then </joey>
<joey> i think you you mentioned that there's a </joey>
<joey> reason </joey>
<joey> i can't really say why that i just </joey>
<joey> stopped watching anime yeah like </joey>
<joey> was it was he jacking up obviously is </joey>
<joey> that what he was like was he like </joey>
<garnt> was it like selling his body for sex </garnt>
<joey> like what was it it's like no i was </joey>
<joey> doing drugs </joey>
<joey> that's i'm just gonna put it out there </joey>
<joey> not hard drugs no </joey>
<joey> i just like to pinpoint that not hard </joey>
<joey> drugs but yeah </joey>
<joey> that's but that's the thing right like </joey>
<joey> that's where i had that blank of just </joey>
<joey> like i wasn't really </joey>
<joey> doing anything with my life and all i </joey>
<joey> was really doing was like playing music </joey>
<joey> or like playing games but not to the </joey>
<joey> extent that you were playing games i was </joey>
<joey> just like [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> on new grounds playing the bullshittest </joey>
<joey> like dumbest [ __ ] flash games that </joey>
<joey> have ever existed </joey>
<garnt> yeah i guess for me like the only thing </garnt>
<connor> i've i've been super invested in </connor>
<connor> is like my career now which is like </connor>
<connor> youtube and yeah i do think of youtube </connor>
<garnt> as a game yeah </garnt>
<joey> it's totally a game it's totally </joey>
<joey> gamified yeah yeah that's pretty why </joey>
<joey> i've been able to like you know i guess </joey>
<connor> i guess because like i don't know </connor>
<joey> like the way i see it is kind of like </joey>
<joey> you have [ __ ] optimized youtube game </joey>
<joey> though </joey>
<connor> i don't know how i feel i think that </connor>
<connor> there are many aspects that it shares </connor>
<connor> with a game </connor>
<connor> right unfortunately yeah i mean there's </connor>
<connor> still a huge creative aspect of it but </connor>
<connor> i think there's ways to like iterate on </connor>
<connor> yourself that are very game-like </connor>
<garnt> yeah it's like you do i feel like social </garnt>
<connor> media in general is a game yeah </connor>
<connor> like you look at something like twitter </connor>
<connor> where i think i remember i watched this </connor>
<connor> uh </connor>
<connor> series by this guy called charlie </connor>
<connor> brooker who made he made a series called </connor>
<connor> like the top </connor>
<connor> most influential video games of all time </connor>
<connor> all right and he put number one </connor>
<connor> was twitter and like when and at first i </connor>
<connor> was like what what the [ __ ] you talking </connor>
<connor> about twitter is in the game and then </connor>
<connor> you think about it where like </connor>
<connor> oh yeah you uh play an avatar online to </connor>
<connor> uh farm </connor>
<connor> numbers and the more like the more you </connor>
<connor> get into it the more numbers you farm </connor>
<connor> yeah and i'm just like </connor>
<connor> you know he's he's kind of got a point </connor>
<connor> yeah because like he's right yeah </connor>
<connor> nobody really you're like playing a </connor>
<garnt> version of yourself </garnt>
<garnt> but it's not like you don't show all of </garnt>
<garnt> yourself online no one ever does show </garnt>
<garnt> themselves online yeah you gotta </garnt>
<joey> optimize every tweet you make right yeah </joey>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<joey> should i do i phrase it in this way like </joey>
<garnt> is this funny thing to tweet </garnt>
<garnt> i don't know how some people can [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> tweet like 50 tweets in a day </garnt>
<garnt> i don't think i have 50 tweets like 50 </garnt>
<garnt> thoughts in the day let alone like 50 </garnt>
<connor> right </connor>
<connor> when you're do you ever get those </connor>
<connor> moments you're like i want to find that </connor>
<connor> one funny tweet from that account and </connor>
<connor> then you're scrolling and scrolling and </connor>
<connor> scoring you're like oh it's only been </connor>
<connor> seven hours ago </connor>
<connor> what the [ __ ] stop tweeting you tweet </connor>
<joey> too much it's like how many </joey>
<joey> that's the thing it's like it's are you </joey>
<joey> just like are you just not that kind of </joey>
<joey> person where you just can't like think </joey>
<connor> about the thought to yourself it's like </connor>
<connor> i have to </connor>
<connor> make it i have to put this out into the </connor>
<connor> world some people get like a [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> coffee at starbucks like </connor>
<connor> i got a coffee from starbucks oh my god </connor>
<joey> hashtag relatable </joey>
<connor> my god man yeah twitter is a game and </connor>
<connor> it's a hard game but i enjoy it </connor>
<connor> damn that's that's gonna be a [ __ ] i i </connor>
<connor> wanted to go in episode two where i </connor>
<connor> didn't tell a [ __ ] elaborate stupid </connor>
<connor> long story but i completely remembered </connor>
<joey> that i used to [ __ ] play card </joey>
<joey> competitively </joey>

<garnt> have a service and they don't advertise </garnt>
<garnt> which soap they use they advertise which </garnt>
<garnt> women are doing it </garnt>
