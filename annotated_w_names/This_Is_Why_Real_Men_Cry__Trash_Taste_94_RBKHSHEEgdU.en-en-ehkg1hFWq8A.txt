<connor> (Joey beatboxing) </connor>
<connor> (Connor thumping) </connor>
<connor> (Connor claps) </connor>
<connor> - Can't believe you used the wrong mike. </connor>
<connor> - I'm sorry. </connor>
<connor> (gentle music) </connor>
<garnt> - Hello and welcome to another episode of "Trash Taste". </garnt>
<connor> I'm your host for today, Garnt </connor>
<connor> and joining me once again are the boys. </connor>
<joey> (Joey sneezes) </joey>
<connor> Jesus Christ. - Sorry. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] God dammit Joey. </connor>
<connor> - We had it, we had it. </connor>
<connor> - We had the perfect take, </connor>
<connor> which was the only take we've ever done today. </connor>
<joey> You know. </joey>
<joey> Outtakes on patreon.com/trashtaste, of course. </joey>
<joey> - Damn, trying to lash it out early. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, of course, of course. Right. </joey>
<joey> - I spilled half of this on me. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, my fucking... </joey>
<joey> Guys, I thought we were professionals. </joey>
<joey> We've been doing this- </joey>
<joey> - The hay fever season's fucking... </joey>
<joey> - We've been doing this for almost like two years, now. </joey>
<garnt> We should be on this man, we should be on this. </garnt>
<connor> - Fucking hell. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. </connor>
<connor> - Sheez, a vine boom sound effect. </connor>
<joey> - Boom. </joey>
<joey> I'm just, yeah, I've been just... </joey>
<garnt> hay fever's been kicking my ass this season. </garnt>
<garnt> - Really? - Yeah, all of a sudden. </garnt>
<garnt> I hate it. - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And especially like now, </garnt>
<garnt> when you're sniffling on a train </garnt>
<connor> and you just see like all these like... </connor>
<connor> 'Ey, oh. </connor>
<joey> Is this boy sick or- </joey>
<joey> - Some Japanese guys have like these </joey>
<connor> most aggressive gravelly coughs, dude. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. - They come out of nowhere. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't how they have cough- </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt coughs) </garnt>
<connor> - You hear that every so often. </connor>
<connor> - Always- - I don't know how they do it. </connor>
<connor> - Exactly that noise. - Especially in COVID. </connor>
<joey> Deep in COVID season as well, </joey>
<joey> you're just like, you're on high fucking alert, man. </joey>
<connor> I'm like one of those guards in (indistinct), </connor>
<garnt> the fucking alert pops up and I'm just like, oh. </garnt>
<joey> - I actually saw at my local bookstore, </joey>
<connor> they were selling these pins during the pandemic, </connor>
<connor> in the middle of the pandemic, that just said, </connor>
<connor> like during hay fever season. </connor>
<connor> It was a pin that just said, </connor>
<connor> "Don't worry, I have hay fever". </connor>
<connor> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </connor>
<connor> And so people would like, </connor>
<joey> if there was sniffling on the train, </joey>
<joey> you'd just like show off the badge and be like, </joey>
<joey> "I don't have COVID guys, it's just hay fever." </joey>
<garnt> - But what if you had COVID and you bought that anyway, </garnt>
<joey> just to be like, guys it's hay fever. </joey>
<connor> - Trust me. Trust me. </connor>
<connor> - What if you had both? </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause I remember, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause I also had like a little bit of hay fever, </garnt>
<garnt> but also I remember one week, </garnt>
<garnt> I just got like a cough or something </garnt>
<garnt> and getting a cough during the pandemic time </garnt>
<garnt> is like the worst, right. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause normally it feels bad to cough in public anyway. </garnt>
<garnt> But you're like, when you have like just, </garnt>
<garnt> it's just like a dry cough, especially, </garnt>
<garnt> you're so conscious about it, right? </garnt>
<garnt> About how often you're coughing </garnt>
<connor> and it just makes the cough, </connor>
<connor> when you are thinking about it, </connor>
<connor> it just makes the cough 10 times worse. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And especially on public transport, you're just... </connor>
<connor> I remember like normally, going to my old place, </connor>
<connor> it would be stressful if I needed to take a shit. Right? </connor>
<connor> (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> You know, when you're holding it in, </connor>
<connor> I was holding in this fucking cough </connor>
<connor> and fucking spacing this cough out that I had, </connor>
<connor> for a good 40 minutes or however long that journey was. </connor>
<connor> And I dunno if anyone around me noticed it, </connor>
<connor> but I was like, I dunno, I was just, </connor>
<garnt> I was fucking sweating from how much </garnt>
<joey> I was trying to hold in this cough. </joey>
<joey> - I thought you were holding in the cough, </joey>
<joey> 'cause you didn't wanna shit yourself in the process, </joey>
<joey> like (imitates cough) </joey>
<joey> - Just do it. </joey>
<joey> I'm just gonna be like, I'm gonna do it. </joey>
<joey> Who cares? What are they gonna do? </joey>
<connor> It's not like a zombie apocalypse, right? </connor>
<connor> If you've been bitten, they're gonna kill you. </connor>
<connor> - Have you ever coughed and shit at the same time? </connor>
<joey> - No, what, what? </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<garnt> - No? </garnt>
<garnt> - We were not talking about shitting yet. </garnt>
<connor> Yeah, Twitter. </connor>
<connor> I'll leave it for the vlogs. </connor>
<garnt> - Do you have a story, Joey? </garnt>
<joey> - No. (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<garnt> Just curious. </garnt>
<garnt> - What? </garnt>
<connor> - I dunno, just... </connor>
<connor> - You've never done that? </connor>
<connor> - Of course I've done it. </connor>
<connor> - I've never done that. </connor>
<joey> - I don't have a story about it. </joey>
<connor> - Of course I've done it. </connor>
<connor> I have also, we've all done it. </connor>
<connor> We haven't all done that. </connor>
<garnt> - I have never done that, unfortunately Joey. </garnt>
<connor> Sorry I can't... </connor>
<garnt> - Sorry, I'm sorry man, I wish we could... </garnt>
<connor> - It's a sensation. </connor>
<connor> - So, are you on the toilet or? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, of course I'm on the toilet. </joey>
<connor> - Okay, that doesn't count, that doesn't count. </connor>
<connor> - No, that's what I mean, I don't mean like... </connor>
<connor> I'm not asking you to be like, </connor>
<connor> have you shat yourself before? </connor>
<connor> Like in public? I think we've already- </connor>
<connor> - I shat myself on the toilet. </connor>
<connor> - We've talked about that one. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, but yeah, no, </connor>
<connor> just like on the toilet and you just like, </connor>
<joey> it's not coming out and then you use the power of the cough </joey>
<connor> to exert your body. </connor>
<connor> (both laugh) </connor>
<connor> - That's how you get hemorrhoids. </connor>
<garnt> - You know what, let's change the subject. </garnt>
<garnt> - This is how you get hemorrhoids, I'm pretty sure. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think the only thing that comes close to that </garnt>
<connor> isn't like shitting yourself. </connor>
<garnt> But it's when you go back to the gym </garnt>
<connor> for the first time in ages. </connor>
<connor> You have ab day or something. </connor>
<garnt> And the day after your entire body aches </garnt>
<connor> and the one time you sneeze, </connor>
<garnt> it just pushed your entire body into pain mode. </garnt>
<connor> - It's like (screams) </connor>
<garnt> - I literally did this like two weeks ago. </garnt>
<connor> I did ab day for the first time in months. </connor>
<joey> And not one day, it was like five days afterwards. </joey>
<joey> - Oh really? - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Why was it lagging? </joey>
<joey> - Dude, no, no, it was like for the next five days. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, like in a row. - It hurt so much. </joey>
<joey> - I see, I see. </joey>
<joey> Damn, you went hard. </joey>
<connor> - I just went too hard, man, I just went too hard. </connor>
<garnt> I don't know, what can I say? </garnt>
<garnt> - Talking about seasons though. </garnt>
<garnt> Can Japan chill with its changing of seasons? </garnt>
<garnt> I dunno. </garnt>
<joey> Last week it felt like winter. </joey>
<joey> It felt like it was coming on the tail end of winter. </joey>
<joey> It was warming up a little bit. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And I think we had two days of spring, </joey>
<joey> like spring weather. </joey>
<joey> And I remember going out yesterday </joey>
<connor> or the day before in this jacket </connor>
<connor> and I was sweating my ass off already and I just... </connor>
<connor> Japan, I've just noticed, </connor>
<garnt> it doesn't have a transition period. </garnt>
<garnt> You just wake up one day and it's a new season. </garnt>
<joey> - And they say Japan has four seasons. </joey>
<joey> What a load of shit. </joey>
<joey> - It's such a lie, Japan has two seasons. </joey>
<connor> It's hot or cold. - It is, it is two. </connor>
<connor> It's winter and summer, that's all they have. </connor>
<connor> - It's like different stages of cold </connor>
<connor> and then just different stages of hot. </connor>
<garnt> There's no warm. </garnt>
<garnt> There's no warm period, you get like- </garnt>
<joey> - The warm period is maybe in the evening </joey>
<garnt> when the sun's just gone down </garnt>
<garnt> and the residue of the concrete heat is escaping. </garnt>
<connor> That's when it's like, "Okay, that's kind of pleasant". </connor>
<connor> But then immediately afterwards it's just like, </connor>
<joey> "Oh, now it's cold as shit, </joey>
<joey> 'cause you're in a t-shirt like an idiot." </joey>
<connor> - I always forget how hot it is until the summer comes. </connor>
<garnt> And then I'm like, "Oh yeah, this is hell". </garnt>
<garnt> - I think it's like trauma for me. </garnt>
<garnt> I forget about it and I'm like, "Summer, what?" </garnt>
<connor> I'm winter game, bro. I'm wearing a coat. </connor>
<garnt> And I forget that for half the year in Japan, </garnt>
<connor> you just can't wear more than one t-shirt. </connor>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah, exactly. </joey>
<connor> - Unless you're a Japanese person- </connor>
<connor> - Who can wear a full suit and an overcoat. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, and it'd be like, </connor>
<joey> "Oh, it's a little dab of sweat right here". </joey>
<connor> - What temperature is in the office? </connor>
<connor> Can we have 30 degree Celsius, please? What? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I dunno how I walk around in the summer </garnt>
<garnt> and just see business people in full on suits, </garnt>
<garnt> running along with their briefcase </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm here dying in my t-shirts and shorts. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm a sweater, I'm a big sweater boy. </connor>
<garnt> - I am as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - I sweat like a motherfucker. </garnt>
<connor> - I am. </connor>
<connor> I'm the complete opposite of Sydney </connor>
<connor> because she doesn't sweat enough </connor>
<connor> when it comes to heat. </connor>
<garnt> We're deep in summer and I feel her forehead </garnt>
<garnt> and it's just like, there's zero perspiration. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, Aki's exactly the same. </joey>
<garnt> I'm like, that's how you get heat stroke. </garnt>
<connor> - My body's working. - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - If you sweat a lot, that's healthy. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. - Technically. </connor>
<connor> - Water away - Is it? </connor>
<connor> - Get all the water away. </connor>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> That's why I weigh so much. </garnt>
<garnt> - To me, it's like it's a copium, it's healthy. </garnt>
<joey> I feel like the tiniest bit of heat </joey>
<joey> and my armpits, especially, just start perspirating. </joey>
<joey> And there's no way, </joey>
<joey> that doesn't ruin anything you fucking wear, unfortunately. </joey>
<garnt> So I just have to be worried in the summer, </garnt>
<garnt> even if I'm not... </garnt>
<garnt> even if I'm underneath air conditioning, </garnt>
<garnt> I still sweat sometimes. </garnt>
<joey> - For me, it's weird. </joey>
<joey> I don't sweat through my armpits as much. </joey>
<joey> For me, it's all in the face, </joey>
<joey> which is horrible because you can't hide that shit. </joey>
<connor> - You're literally like that meme of that guy. </connor>
<joey> I don't know, he's on the radio. </joey>
<joey> He's like (imitates sweating) </joey>
<connor> - Yes. </connor>
<connor> - Fuck it, fuck it. </connor>
<connor> I'm like that Key & Peele gif, </connor>
<joey> where it's just like dripping wet, </joey>
<joey> but the rest of my body is okay, I hate it. </joey>
<garnt> - But yeah, I guess that's why... </garnt>
<garnt> we're from England, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Do you feel like being British </garnt>
<garnt> has conditioned you to like cold weather </garnt>
<garnt> or do you feel like you've gotten used to other climates? </garnt>
<connor> - I don't think it's the temperature. </connor>
<garnt> It's more so the sun, </garnt>
<garnt> I think we're... I'm allergic to the sun. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't like the sun. - Is that 'cause you're white? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, no, very white, very white. </connor>
<garnt> Very white, indeed actually. </garnt>
<connor> - But you know, I would understand </connor>
<connor> because you guys have that lack of sun, </connor>
<garnt> right, in the UK. - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - But in Australia we have an overdose of sun. </garnt>
<garnt> So I'm also traumatized by too much sun. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - As well. </garnt>
<garnt> Because in Japan it's like sometimes the sun works </garnt>
<joey> and then sometimes it works overtime. </joey>
<connor> - I still think the summer </connor>
<connor> was worse in the UK than it was in Japan </connor>
<connor> because we don't have AC. - How hot does it get, though? </connor>
<joey> - Oh yeah. </joey>
<connor> - So it's three, four weeks of... </connor>
<joey> at least the last time I was there. </joey>
<joey> It was like three, four weeks </joey>
<joey> of just uncomfortable sweating, </joey>
<joey> and I can't do anything. </joey>
<joey> At least in Japan I can game all day </joey>
<connor> in a comfortable AC climate room. Right? </connor>
<connor> Yeah, okay, when I go outside it sucks. </connor>
<connor> I sweat, but I'd take that over having, be in my bedroom, </connor>
<connor> sweating and being able to do nothing. </connor>
<connor> - That's true, that's true. </connor>
<connor> - It's horrible. </connor>
<connor> You get one of those fans that blows air, </connor>
<connor> but I feel like that's literally like a copium. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. Yeah. - It doesn't do anything. </connor>
<garnt> - You just blowing the air around. </garnt>
<connor> - It's just blowing the hot air into my face. </connor>
<connor> - I actually like the fan. </connor>
<connor> Like sometimes I- </connor>
<connor> - I think that's a Southeast Asian thing. </connor>
<connor> - I think it is, I think it is. </connor>
<connor> - I think Asian people, they love fans. </connor>
<connor> I swear, they just like fans all the time </connor>
<garnt> - To me, you admit defeat if you are putting on the AC. </garnt>
<connor> Right, that means you are more weak- </connor>
<connor> - Why is the fan any different? </connor>
<connor> - I dunno, the fan, I like the feeling of hot. </connor>
<joey> Not exactly cold air. </joey>
<joey> - Would you say you're a fan? </joey>
<garnt> - Fuck off Joe, fuck off. </garnt>
<garnt> I dunno. - Just stand under the AC. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because to me, the AC, it just feels like, </garnt>
<connor> how can I put this? </connor>
<connor> It feels like artificial air. </connor>
<connor> - I get it... </connor>
<connor> - Does that make sense? </connor>
<garnt> - No, I understand that the AC air </garnt>
<connor> is not one you wanna be breathing in? </connor>
<garnt> I don't know why. - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - It feels weird. </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause I feel the same way about heaters, </garnt>
<garnt> where if you have... </garnt>
<garnt> There's a difference in having a warm room </garnt>
<joey> and having a room that's been warmed up by a heater, </joey>
<joey> 'cause it feels 10 times more stuffy for some reason. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Oh yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I don't like the feeling of just the artificial heat </joey>
<joey> as opposed to just being in a country </joey>
<joey> or in a temperature that is comfortable, </joey>
<joey> like naturally outside. </joey>
<joey> Same thing with AC, for me. </joey>
<joey> With AC, if you have a room that's cooled with AC, </joey>
<joey> it just feels, I don't know, like the air... </joey>
<joey> How can I describe this? </joey>
<joey> It feels like, it feels sterile. </joey>
<joey> (Connor and Joey laugh) </joey>
<joey> You know what I mean? You know what I mean? </joey>
<joey> - No, I don't know what you mean. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] It feels sterile. </joey>
<joey> - This is first world problems. </joey>
<joey> - It is first world problems. </joey>
<connor> - I agree, I agree. </connor>
<connor> - I breathe it in, it's just unnaturally dry. </connor>
<connor> Sometimes, my asthma, my lungs, </connor>
<connor> feel the dry air way more with AC air </connor>
<garnt> than with just cold air in general. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know, it's completely something </garnt>
<garnt> that is just a me issue, </garnt>
<garnt> but that's why I much prefer having a fan </garnt>
<garnt> as opposed to having the AC. Right. </garnt>
<connor> - Did I tell about why my apartment smelled like shit </connor>
<connor> for the first two months? </connor>
<joey> - Your current apartment? - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Why? </connor>
<connor> - Well, it involves the AC. </connor>
<connor> - Like literal shit, or... </connor>
<connor> - Like literal shit. </connor>
<garnt> - Is it 'cause of the AC? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, so you know I moved into this apartment building. </connor>
<connor> Something just kept smelling weird. </connor>
<connor> I couldn't put my finger on it. Right. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "What the fuck is this thing?" </connor>
<connor> I turn the AC off, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - It's still coming in. </connor>
<connor> So my apartment still smells like shit. </connor>
<connor> This is brand new, I just got this place. </connor>
<joey> Why does it smell of shit? </joey>
<joey> It's not me, I'm definitely flushing. </joey>
<joey> - Looks down, I'm covered in shit. </joey>
<joey> - I foul up, but it's not that kind of... </joey>
<joey> it's like a lingering. </joey>
<joey> No matter where I am, I'm getting this, right. </joey>
<joey> So I go to my balcony, right, and there's like, bird shit. </joey>
<garnt> And I'm like, "Well, it can't be that 'cause I clean it, </garnt>
<garnt> and it still smells of shit". </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, "What the fuck is going on? </garnt>
<connor> Why does it smell of shit?" </connor>
<connor> Turns out that there was this one place </connor>
<connor> where these birds were shitting, </connor>
<connor> that was like, the intake fan was right here </connor>
<connor> and all the birds were just shitting </connor>
<connor> right next to the intake. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </connor>
<connor> And I couldn't see it 'cause it's right next... </connor>
<connor> there's this much gap between the roof </connor>
<connor> and the box they're shitting on. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah yeah, yeah. - Right. </connor>
<joey> - It's literal perfect size for one pigeon to fit in. </joey>
<joey> and they loved, loved, shitting there. </joey>
<connor> I don't know why they loved it. </connor>
<connor> Maybe 'cause they felt like the roof was close, it was nice- </connor>
<joey> - So you basically were huffing in bird shit. </joey>
<connor> - I literally, for two months, was just huffing in, </connor>
<connor> and I'm pretty sure that pigeon poop </connor>
<garnt> is one of the poops you don't wanna be breathing in. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think any poop is. </garnt>
<joey> - I don't wanna breathe in any poop, to be honest. </joey>
<connor> - As in, I think they have one of the more </connor>
<connor> dirty poops out there, I believe. </connor>
<connor> I don't know if this is correct. </connor>
<garnt> Compared- - As compared to what? </garnt>
<garnt> - Compared to what poop? </garnt>
<garnt> - Listen, if I laid a log there, </garnt>
<garnt> it's not gonna smell as bad. </garnt>
<garnt> - Is there a poop scale of hygiene quality? </garnt>
<garnt> I think it's just like all poop, right, surely. </garnt>
<connor> - I remember, when I Googled cleaning pigeon poop, </connor>
<garnt> there's a bunch of things that were like, </garnt>
<connor> warning, please make sure you don't actually touch the poop, </connor>
<connor> 'cause it's filled with disgusting parasites and stuff. </connor>
<garnt> - When isn't it filled with disgusting germs and parasites? </garnt>
<connor> - I don't know, I play with mine all the time </connor>
<connor> and it's not that bad. </connor>
<garnt> (all laugh) </garnt>
<connor> It could have been just a generic warning. </connor>
<connor> Anyway, so I cleaned it and then I was like, </connor>
<connor> "Great, this is amazing, it's all fixed. </connor>
<connor> My apartment doesn't smell of shit." </connor>
<connor> Two days later I start smelling shit again. </connor>
<connor> They just kept coming back. </connor>
<connor> So, fuck... </connor>
<connor> So, I then had to install those spikes on it. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah. - To get rid of it. </connor>
<connor> And finally, now my apartment doesn't smell of shit, </connor>
<connor> unless I leave the door open and take a shit. </connor>
<garnt> Then it does smell of shit. </garnt>
<garnt> - I was gonna ask how you've sorted the problem, 'cause I... </garnt>
<connor> - My apartment is a... my balcony is like a joke. </connor>
<connor> It's like half reflective now. </connor>
<connor> I've put reflective stuff everywhere </connor>
<connor> and it doesn't stop them. </connor>
<connor> They just find a new spot. </connor>
<garnt> - I noticed that 'cause in my house </garnt>
<garnt> and in my home in Thailand, </garnt>
<garnt> it's on the outskirts of the city. </garnt>
<garnt> So it's more next to nature, the nature side of things. </garnt>
<garnt> And I notice the spikes do fucking nothing, man. </garnt>
<garnt> The spikes is a great place for birds to start a nest. </garnt>
<connor> So like- - Oh, really? </connor>
<joey> These are like comically large spikes. </joey>
<connor> - Okay, okay, okay. </connor>
<joey> - I literally don't get any birds on my balcony. </joey>
<joey> - You're so lucky. How does that work? </joey>
<connor> - I don't know. </connor>
<connor> - How do pigeons decide </connor>
<connor> this is the building that I'm gonna fuck up. </connor>
<joey> - Maybe one pigeon is like, "Oy, check it out." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, 'cause sometimes- - Come on, come on. </joey>
<garnt> - Sometimes we get that one fucking pigeon </garnt>
<joey> that's hanging out outside the toilet of this office </joey>
<joey> and I can hear fucking it. </joey>
<joey> I don't know why... </joey>
<joey> it's here and in Thailand as well, </joey>
<joey> why the first thing I hear when I wake up, </joey>
<connor> is just these birds going at each other. </connor>
<connor> (Joey imitates pigeons cooing) </connor>
<connor> It's not even that, right, it's not even pigeon. </connor>
<connor> Sometimes it's just like... </connor>
<joey> sometimes it is, I swear, it's just like the fucking ghetto. </joey>
<joey> Like it's the fucking ghetto of the birds, right. </joey>
<connor> And I can just hear is like, </connor>
<connor> "Oi, oi mate, what you doing here? </connor>
<connor> What are you doing here, mate? </connor>
<connor> Bruv, bruv, what are you doing?" </connor>
<connor> And I'm just like- (Joey imitates shooting) </connor>
<connor> (both laugh) </connor>
<connor> Every fuck morning, I don't know what it is. </connor>
<connor> And so we installed spikes to try and stop these birds </connor>
<garnt> from hanging out outside, like stop 'em loitering. </garnt>
<connor> Stop the youths from loitering outside of our window. </connor>
<connor> - I wanna see these spikes you're using. </connor>
<garnt> - It's just like the plastic spikes. </garnt>
<garnt> It's just like that. </garnt>
<connor> - Maybe use plastic and they just didn't do anything. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know, but we thought, okay, </connor>
<connor> we're gonna install them to stop the birds </connor>
<connor> hanging out here every morning. </connor>
<connor> It did the entire fuck opposite </connor>
<connor> because now they found out that the spikes </connor>
<connor> are great for propping up a nest there. </connor>
<connor> So they just built a nest there. </connor>
<garnt> So, we literally helped them settle down. </garnt>
<garnt> - At that point, you just gotta give them credit. </garnt>
<connor> That's just impressive. </connor>
<garnt> - Big brain. </garnt>
<garnt> - So yeah, unfortunately- </garnt>
<joey> - I'd rather the birds though, </joey>
<joey> 'cause in Australia I would wake up </joey>
<joey> to possums fucking on our roof. </joey>
<joey> - What does that sound like? </joey>
<joey> - It just sounds... </joey>
<joey> it's just like a lot of rattling like this </joey>
<connor> and a lot of like (screeches) at two in the morning. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Oh my God, please stop." </connor>
<joey> - That sounds pretty good. </joey>
<joey> - No, it's not. </joey>
<joey> How does that sound good? </joey>
<connor> - Do they make a mess? </connor>
<connor> - I hope not. </connor>
<connor> - Well, if you hope not, that means you don't know. Right? </connor>
<connor> So that must mean they probably don't make a mess. </connor>
<joey> - I mean, the mess is like half the problem. </joey>
<joey> It's the fact that I can't get to sleep </joey>
<joey> 'cause these possums are- </joey>
<connor> - I'd rather have trouble sleeping </connor>
<connor> than have to clean the shit up every two months. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's awful, they shit on my Ikea furniture as well. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh, because you got furniture out on your balcony as well. </garnt>
<connor> - So, wherever I put the reflective stuff down, </connor>
<connor> they just move </connor>
<connor> and then I put the reflective stuff right above- </connor>
<garnt> - What is the reflective stuff? </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like- - Like CDs? </garnt>
<garnt> - What's those? </garnt>
<garnt> The Coloso scopes? No, what are they called? </garnt>
<joey> - Kaleidoscopes? - That's it? </joey>
<connor> The kaleidoscopes kind of patterns that reflect </connor>
<connor> and it just scares them off. </connor>
<connor> But sometimes it doesn't and then other times </connor>
<connor> they just, it's like they're edging. </connor>
<connor> They'll find a spot and they'll have one foot on </connor>
<connor> and they'll just start shitting off of it. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, "How am I supposed to predict this? </connor>
<connor> This is insane." </connor>
<garnt> - That was very different edging to watch. </garnt>
<connor> - But then they're. </connor>
<joey> - They're standing on the edge, right? </joey>
<connor> - I was like, the pigeons are doing what? </connor>
<garnt> - They're probably edging as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - They're just like, ah, ah, ah. </garnt>
<joey> - They're probably doing that as well. </joey>
<joey> - Direct eye contacts, just like, ah, ah, ah. </joey>
<joey> - It's awful. It's awful. </joey>
<garnt> And they're like...they... </garnt>
<connor> oh, it's such a pain in the ass. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, 'cause... - Pain in their ass, too. </garnt>
<connor> - Do you ever have to deal with annoying wildlife in the UK? </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<connor> - Do you guy's have any wildlife in the UK? </connor>
<connor> - I feel like the most annoying thing for me in the UK is, </connor>
<connor> I dunno if you have it in Wales, </connor>
<connor> but in the city, in Brighton at least, </connor>
<connor> or at least when I was living in London as well, foxes. </connor>
<garnt> The sound that they make sometimes at night just is, </garnt>
<connor> is the worst screech I've ever heard in my life. </connor>
<connor> - You guys have foxes? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, we do have foxes. - Oh, wow. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like the deadliest animal we have. </garnt>
<garnt> - They're fucking pussies, though. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, they are, they run away. </connor>
<connor> - Because you make eye contact with 'em, they run, </connor>
<connor> they're already down the road, </connor>
<connor> like fucking legging it down a mile. </connor>
<garnt> - I used to live above a bunch of restaurants, </garnt>
<garnt> so always saw foxes, but they never made noise. </garnt>
<connor> - They never made noise? - No. </connor>
<connor> - No, actually they never make noise </connor>
<connor> if they're in the vicinity of guys or humans. </connor>
<connor> But I would sometimes hear them </connor>
<connor> just screeching off in the background. </connor>
<connor> And they literally sound like, I dunno, </connor>
<connor> like a kid being assaulted or something, right. </connor>
<garnt> Because I remember the first time Sydney moved to England, </garnt>
<garnt> she heard this noise and she was about to phone the police. </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, "No Sydney, that's just a fox." </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause it just sounds like (screeches) </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - You just hear that in the background, </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm just like... the first time I heard it, </garnt>
<garnt> I was like, "What is that noise?" </garnt>
<garnt> - At least that's what they tell you, </garnt>
<garnt> like, "It's the foxes." </garnt>
<garnt> - It's the foxes. </garnt>
<garnt> - Trust. </garnt>
<joey> - Enters the door with plastic gloves on. </joey>
<connor> It's the foxes. </connor>
<joey> - It's the foxes, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. I know. </garnt>
<garnt> - We only had ants. </garnt>
<connor> - Ants? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, we had ants. </connor>
<connor> - Ants that would get into the house. </connor>
<connor> They're pretty good, ants are. </connor>
<connor> They're really good at getting into your house. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - But the British ants are tiny though. </garnt>
<connor> Like fucking... </connor>
<connor> Can they even be called ants? </connor>
<garnt> - But when there's a lot of them. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, but that's the problem with it. </connor>
<connor> - It's not just a single ant. </connor>
<joey> - Ants don't travel solo. </joey>
<connor> They're not like fucking wolves. They're not like... </connor>
<joey> - You don't see a single ant in your house, </joey>
<joey> and you're like, "Oh, fuck." </joey>
<connor> - They're normally like, they're very kind though, ants. </connor>
<connor> They have a nice line that directs you </connor>
<connor> to exactly where they came from. </connor>
<connor> They're really, really considerate in that sense. </connor>
<joey> But they'd get into the bread bin and stuff </joey>
<joey> and they'd get into like- </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, like the sugar containers and stuff. </joey>
<connor> - They're really good at finding it. </connor>
<connor> - We had that a lot. </connor>
<connor> - They're so good at finding it. </connor>
<joey> - You think you've sealed that bread box up tight. </joey>
<connor> - I can't find where the snacks are hidden </connor>
<joey> in my house, sometimes. </joey>
<joey> - So I have to follow the trail. </joey>
<joey> - My parents would hide them, </joey>
<connor> but the ants would always find them. </connor>
<connor> They'd always lead me to them. </connor>
<connor> - I'd never really had such a big ant problem in the UK. </connor>
<connor> It was more when I was in Thailand. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] It might be where you live. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, 'cause whenever I'm in Thailand, </connor>
<connor> if you have a piece of food out </connor>
<connor> or you drop a tiny bit of crumb or something, </connor>
<joey> a timer starts right before you, </joey>
<joey> the timer starts before you can clean it up, </joey>
<joey> otherwise the ants are gonna clean up for you. </joey>
<joey> And then you're just kinda have a line of ants </joey>
<connor> just marching through your home. </connor>
<connor> And the thing about Thai ants </connor>
<connor> is that they're pretty fucking big as well. </connor>
<connor> - I'd rather them be big though, easier to kill. </connor>
<garnt> - No, no, no. </garnt>
<garnt> No, no, no. </garnt>
<garnt> - Assume it's like a super villain. </garnt>
<garnt> You know when you step on an ant? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. - And it doesn't die. </connor>
<connor> And you're like, what? </connor>
<connor> This is how the villains feel in movies </connor>
<garnt> when their attack doesn't work. </garnt>
<garnt> What do you mean my attack failed? </garnt>
<garnt> - But, in the UK, ants are just a slight annoyance, </garnt>
<garnt> because what the fuck can they do to you, right. </garnt>
<connor> - What do you mean, they can eat your food. </connor>
<joey> They make it like... </joey>
<joey> - Yes, slight annoyance. </joey>
<garnt> - Slight annoyance. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's very big annoyance. </garnt>
<garnt> - They don't bite you or anything, like some do. </garnt>
<connor> - I'd rather them bite me than take my food. </connor>
<joey> - Really? - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Have you ever been bitten by an ant? </connor>
<connor> - Not yet. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I don't think you'll say the same thing </connor>
<joey> once you get bitten by one. </joey>
<joey> - Not like the fucking... </joey>
<joey> What's that guy called on YouTube? </joey>
<joey> Coyote Peterson or whatever. </joey>
<joey> Not those kind of ants where he's like, </joey>
<joey> "Well, my hand has swollen in 19 times the original size. </joey>
<connor> I could scarcely breathe, but this is mildly painful." </connor>
<connor> - Even if it's something like, you know, </connor>
<joey> even if it's not like toxic or super painful, </joey>
<joey> that is more of an annoyance than the ants eating your food. </joey>
<connor> - No, no. </connor>
<connor> If it was a mild pain, I'd rather that than have to like... </connor>
<joey> - What if it's a lot of mild pains </joey>
<connor> 'cause it's a lot of ants. </connor>
<connor> - A lot of mild pains. - A lot of mild pains. </connor>
<joey> - A lot of mild pains, what does that mean? </joey>
<joey> - Because you're not gonna get- </joey>
<joey> - Can you an example of a lot of mild pain? </joey>
<joey> - Well, because, you know, there is... </joey>
<connor> - Can you give me another example? </connor>
<connor> - Because you're not gonna, </connor>
<connor> because when an ant bites you </connor>
<joey> that just invites the other ants to also attack. </joey>
<connor> - What's going on where I'm gonna give them a second chance? </connor>
<joey> - You never know. </joey>
<connor> - What is this? </connor>
<connor> - You'd be like, "Ooh, that hurt. </connor>
<connor> Another, another please." </connor>
<connor> - Again, yes, again. - One more time. </connor>
<connor> - Put them on my nipples, please. </connor>
<connor> Bite me again. </connor>
<garnt> (all laugh) </garnt>
<garnt> - Do you have to deal with any annoying pests in Australia? </garnt>
<garnt> - That is the entry requirement. </garnt>
<joey> When you get in the border, they're like, </joey>
<connor> "Oh mate, do you mind if a koala bites on your toes, mate? </connor>
<connor> - No, for what? </connor>
<connor> I don't even think I've ever seen a koala in the wild. </connor>
<connor> - Dude, I wanna see a koala. </connor>
<connor> - They're extremely rare in the wild </connor>
<connor> because they're so hidden. </connor>
<connor> But, my house, we used to have these wasps </connor>
<garnt> that flew around all the time. </garnt>
<garnt> - Fuck, how'd you get rid of wasps? </garnt>
<garnt> - You don't. </garnt>
<connor> The last time I went home, I remember I was like, </connor>
<connor> my dad was like, you know, </connor>
<connor> "Son, come and join me for a beer on the balcony, </connor>
<garnt> it's a nice day", and I'm like, "Yeah, sure." </garnt>
<garnt> I walk out and there's like 20 wasps just flying around. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause I had to- - And I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Father, there are a lot of wasps </garnt>
<joey> flying around your face right now." </joey>
<joey> And he's like, "Yeah, it's all right. </joey>
<joey> They won't sting you." </joey>
<garnt> I was like, "Okay". </garnt>
<garnt> - Why do wasps exist? </garnt>
<garnt> Do they do anything good for anyone? </garnt>
<garnt> - No. </garnt>
<joey> They are the dickheads of the internet. </joey>
<joey> Not the internet, the insect world. </joey>
<connor> - You can say that about so many creatures though. </connor>
<garnt> - But like, so a lot of creatures </garnt>
<garnt> don't actively try to be dickheads and sting you. </garnt>
<garnt> And the thing is at least nature- </garnt>
<connor> - Are you judging an animal's worth </connor>
<connor> based on how annoying it is to people? </connor>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Kind of, kind of, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> (all laugh) </garnt>
<connor> - Fair enough. </connor>
<connor> - What do wasps do for nature? </connor>
<connor> Because, you know, bees, they make honey, </connor>
<connor> they pollinise flowers and you know what, </connor>
<joey> at least nature had the decency to Nerf bees, you know? </joey>
<joey> They get one shot. - One shot. </joey>
<joey> - That's like their nuclear option, man. </joey>
<garnt> That's like they'll fight for their lives. </garnt>
<garnt> - This is how super villains are born? </garnt>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<connor> - It starts with wasps, Garnt, what's the next step? Huh? </connor>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Like I would be- </garnt>
<garnt> - People under six foot, is that the next? </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] I would be happy- </garnt>
<connor> - What the point of people under six foot? </connor>
<connor> They can't reach the shelves I've designed. </connor>
<garnt> - I would gladly be racist towards wasps. </garnt>
<garnt> (all laugh) </garnt>
<connor> - All right, well that's an out of context </connor>
<connor> clip in the making, </connor>
<connor> I would gladly be racist, cut. </connor>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<garnt> - No 'cause- </garnt>
<joey> - Garnt's the kind of guy, where if he got a death note, </joey>
<garnt> the first thing he'd write is wasp. </garnt>
<garnt> - Wasps. </garnt>
<garnt> - Just every wasp. </garnt>
<joey> - Everything that annoys me. </joey>
<connor> - Like one by one, one by one, by name, every single wasp. </connor>
<connor> - Is that a syntax error for the death note? </connor>
<connor> It comes back, it's like, "Sorry, did not spell correctly." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I should preface, </connor>
<garnt> I actually have a phobia of bees and wasps. </garnt>
<connor> I dunno if I've ever talked about this. </connor>
<connor> - You have told us. </connor>
<garnt> You got stung in the eye as a kid. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, I forgot. </joey>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. Okay, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> I would have that, for sure. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, but the thing is, I've grown, </garnt>
<garnt> even though I'm fucking deadly scared of them, </garnt>
<joey> I still in my heart, </joey>
<garnt> I still understand why bees are a thing. </garnt>
<garnt> I think, you know, after years of conditioning, </garnt>
<garnt> like bumble bees, they look kind of cute. </garnt>
<garnt> They look like furry and big and they pollinise- </garnt>
<garnt> - They're chunky. - Yeah, they're chunky. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh, let's give them a hug. </connor>
<garnt> Have you taken any steps </garnt>
<connor> towards trying to conquer you fear of bees? </connor>
<connor> - Erm, bees- </connor>
<garnt> - Maybe we should do like a fear factoresque kind of thing. </garnt>
<connor> where we have a- </connor>
<joey> - What would the steps be though? </joey>
<connor> - Why don't we play Dark Souls music, right? </connor>
<connor> Like, (hums tune) and then we bring out, </connor>
<connor> and Garnt, your punishment for the "Trash Taste After Dark" </connor>
<connor> is that you have to put your head in a box of bees. </connor>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<garnt> - What? - What? </garnt>
<connor> - What, is this fear factor? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, let's do it. </connor>
<garnt> - Would you do that? </garnt>
<connor> - If you told me, if... </connor>
<garnt> Okay, here's the thing, right, I'm an idiot. </garnt>
<joey> If some guy came on, he's probably, he's always Australian. </joey>
<joey> Cause on every single wildlife show </joey>
<joey> where there's a wildlife expert, </joey>
<joey> the fucker's always Australian. </joey>
<joey> - Of course. - He'll come on and be like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh yeah, they won't sting you." </joey>
<connor> And then 10 seconds later, you're like, (screams). </connor>
<connor> And he'll like, "Oh, you're fine though. You're fine." </connor>
<connor> - You're gonna die, don't worry. </connor>
<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<joey> It changes to, "Oh, you won't die." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah yeah, yeah. - But yeah, no. </joey>
<joey> If some wildlife expert told me </joey>
<connor> that it's safe to do it, I'd do it. </connor>
<connor> - What, stick your head in a box of bees? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. - I would not do it. </garnt>
<joey> You couldn't pay me to do that. </joey>
<connor> - That's a big fucking step. </connor>
<connor> I mean like, I dunno if- </connor>
<joey> - How much for you to put your hand in a box of bees? </joey>
<garnt> - For how long? </garnt>
<joey> - How much you're willing to pay me? </joey>
<joey> - One minute. </joey>
<joey> - One minute? </joey>
<joey> - One minute. </joey>
<connor> What is the minimum price you'd do it for? </connor>
<connor> - I don't know. - 10. </connor>
<connor> - I would gladly do it for like five. </connor>
<joey> - Five? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, five Gs. </connor>
<joey> - Five Gs. Yeah, 10 G for me. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh no, it would have to be more than 10 for me. </garnt>
<joey> I don't know, maybe. </joey>
<garnt> Or maybe just for content. </garnt>
<garnt> (all laugh) </garnt>
<garnt> - For that sweet ad revenue, baby. </garnt>
<connor> - That sweet ad revenue. </connor>
<joey> - If I'm just chilling in my living room, and you, </joey>
<joey> "Connor, how much to put your hand in a box of bees". </joey>
<connor> I'd be like, "Ah, five grand" and then they do it. </connor>
<connor> But if it's for content, I probably do it for free. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, here's the thing, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Because before, like when I was a kid, </garnt>
<garnt> I couldn't even look at... </garnt>
<garnt> I couldn't even look at videos of bees. </garnt>
<garnt> I'd see a bee and I'd literally scream </garnt>
<garnt> and run inside and shut the screen. </garnt>
<connor> - So if we got a box of bees, </connor>
<connor> you would do it for content. </connor>
<connor> How do we get a box of bees? </connor>
<joey> - Maybe, maybe. </joey>
<connor> - Don't give the audience an idea. </connor>
<connor> - How do they do this on shows? </connor>
<connor> How do they get a box of bees? </connor>
<connor> - I go through phases where, </connor>
<connor> maybe out of a sense of morbid curiosity, </connor>
<connor> I look at bee cleaning or bee videos on YouTube. </connor>
<connor> And just seeing these beekeepers </connor>
<garnt> just fucking scooping up these pile of bees. </garnt>
<garnt> And just them casually being like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh, you know, they're very friendly today. </garnt>
<garnt> I've only been stung three times." </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, you've been stung three times </garnt>
<garnt> and that's it, that's it? </garnt>
<garnt> I'd be fucking... one time is more than enough for me. </garnt>
<connor> - I wonder how many times would you get stung </connor>
<connor> if your hand was in that box for a minute, </connor>
<connor> with like a hundred bees? </connor>
<joey> - I think if you just stay still- </joey>
<connor> - Nothing. - Probably nothing. </connor>
<joey> - But if you're doing this... </joey>
<garnt> - This is ignorant wilful, what is it? </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Wilful ignorance? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, wilful ignorance, I think. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah, I'm sure we could get some. </garnt>
<connor> - Bees maybe, because bees maybe, wasps, get the fuck out. </connor>
<connor> I'm coming here with a flame thrower. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] Bees, bees, bees. </connor>
<garnt> - If you come here with wasps, 'cause like, I think- </garnt>
<connor> - How about we put your hand in a box </connor>
<garnt> with a feral hyena, Garnt? </garnt>
<garnt> What do you reckon? For a minute? </garnt>
<connor> - For one minute. - For one minute. We all win. </connor>
<connor> - For content. For content. (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - For content. </connor>
<connor> - I dunno, it's like, I've also like been glad... </connor>
<connor> Have you ever seen a hornet as well? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Those are fucking terrifying. I think I've seen one. </joey>
<joey> - We have the killer hornets here. </joey>
<joey> You have the killer hornets here. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, those, I don't wanna fuck with those. </garnt>
<connor> Those are like scary. </connor>
<garnt> - Those are scary. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, especially, I remember seeing the video </garnt>
<garnt> of just hornet... </garnt>
<connor> it sounds like a fucking anime fight or something. </connor>
<connor> It's like hornets versus bees and it's the- </connor>
<connor> - Dude, that video's epic. </connor>
<connor> Where the bees surround it? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, the bees surround it. </connor>
<connor> And it's not even like a war, it's a massacre. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause the hornet, like one hornet </connor>
<joey> takes down a fucking hundred bees or something, and it's... </joey>
<joey> I feel like- - No, no. </joey>
<joey> The bees fuck up the hornet. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, really? - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - We've seen different videos then, 'cause I've seen- </joey>
<joey> - It's two different fights. </joey>
<garnt> (all laugh) </garnt>
<connor> - I dunno which bee it is, but there's videos </connor>
<connor> where there is a way that they kill the hornet </connor>
<connor> by basically they all just compact themselves on the hornet. </connor>
<connor> - Right. - And they roll around </connor>
<connor> and they do it with such energy </connor>
<connor> that it actually just burns the hornet alive. </connor>
<joey> - What, like through friction? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, it kills the hornet by being so hot. </connor>
<joey> - Holy shit. </joey>
<garnt> - That's fucking metal. </garnt>
<garnt> - Japanese. - Japanese honeybees. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Crew Member] Japanese honeybees. </garnt>
<garnt> - They kill the Japanese, they surround it </garnt>
<connor> and they compact like a ball and they roll </connor>
<connor> and keep suffocating it and burning it. </connor>
<connor> - What the fuck? </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] It's so badass. - What? </connor>
<connor> That is fucking badass. - It's so cool. </connor>
<garnt> I'm sure there'll be a clip on the screen right now. </garnt>
<joey> It's fucking cool, it's so cool. </joey>
<joey> Like nature sometimes is like- </joey>
<joey> - That just sounds like a Shonen power. </joey>
<joey> - I just love it that these bees figured this out. </joey>
<joey> They're like, fuck it, just throw ourselves at it. </joey>
<joey> - How the bees figure that out? </joey>
<joey> - I don't know, man. - Fucking hell. </joey>
<joey> - Have you heard of friction? </joey>
<joey> We could use that. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, because the only video I've seen </joey>
<joey> is where it's just these bees, this hive of bees, </joey>
<connor> just fucking chilling, making honey. </connor>
<connor> Then these fucking group of 10 hornets or something </connor>
<connor> just come on and start fucking biting their heads off, </connor>
<connor> massacre this entire hive and then fuck off. </connor>
<garnt> I'm like, Jesus Christ. (Connor hums) </garnt>
<joey> - Where was that in "Bee Movie"? </joey>
<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, fucking nature can be fucking metal sometimes. </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause I remember seeing this video, </garnt>
<garnt> not about bees, but I think it was ants. </garnt>
<garnt> And scientists were like... </garnt>
<garnt> they were studying fire ants because fire ants have a way </garnt>
<garnt> when they're moving in a group or have, they have... </garnt>
<garnt> How can I word this? </garnt>
<garnt> When they're, what do you call a group of ants. </garnt>
<garnt> - A colony? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, colony of ants, </garnt>
<garnt> the way they act and behave sometimes </garnt>
<garnt> can behave like a liquid </garnt>
<garnt> and sometimes can behave like a solid. </garnt>
<connor> - This is certain ants, I think, can do it, not all of them. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, not all of them. </garnt>
<garnt> I think is it was fire ants. </garnt>
<garnt> - They can cross water by bunching together. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And basically becoming kind of like a pseudo solid. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - And then they can kind of like... </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, so they can have, these ants can have, as a colony, </garnt>
<garnt> have properties of a liquid or a solid, </garnt>
<connor> depending on the situation. - That's so dope. </connor>
<connor> - And they were like, </connor>
<connor> scientists were literally studying them </connor>
<connor> to try and apply this to like real life metals </connor>
<garnt> and real life applications. </garnt>
<connor> I'm just like, "That sounds so fucking metal" </connor>
<connor> - Can humans become liquid if we try hard enough? </connor>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> - I'm solid Joey now, soon I'll be liquid Joey. </joey>
<joey> - I am solid Joey. </joey>
<joey> But no, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> That's the weird nature videos </garnt>
<garnt> I've seen every now and again. </garnt>
<garnt> Did you guys watch a lot of nature videos? </garnt>
<joey> - Oh yeah, I fucking love nature documentaries. </joey>
<garnt> - [Garnt] I think... </garnt>
<garnt> - I grew up watching... </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause they used to just do constant reruns </garnt>
<joey> of every David Attenborough documentary. </joey>
<garnt> - I suppose in fucking Australia, they would have had loads. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh yeah, we love that shit. </joey>
<connor> - Go outside and you'll see your local kangaroo </connor>
<connor> fighting a koala bear. </connor>
<joey> - No, the only kangaroo club was the one </joey>
<joey> where the guy punched the kangaroo in the face. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, that was a good one. </garnt>
<garnt> - That one was all over Australian news for like two months. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah, I remember. </garnt>
<joey> - He was saving his dog. </joey>
<garnt> - What's that about? What's that like. </garnt>
<joey> - The kangaroo was like... - Yeah, the kangaroo- </joey>
<joey> - He had the dog. - Yeah, he had his dog </joey>
<connor> in a grip, in like a vice group. </connor>
<connor> - How does that happen? </connor>
<connor> - I don't know. </connor>
<joey> The clip literally starts with the guy in his truck, </joey>
<joey> just calling out to the dog being like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh no, fucking Terry", </joey>
<joey> or whatever the fuck his name was, </joey>
<joey> I don't remember what it was. </joey>
<garnt> And he jumps out and the camera pans over </garnt>
<garnt> and this red kangaroo, like, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> beefy motherfucker, standing like two meters tall </garnt>
<connor> just has the dog in a grip like this. </connor>
<connor> And the dog's just like, "Help me." </connor>
<connor> It has the most like, help face that I've ever seen. </connor>
<connor> And he squares up and the kangaroo's fucking squaring up </connor>
<garnt> and that's really dangerous </garnt>
<garnt> because one kick from this red kangaroo, </garnt>
<garnt> in the chest, that dude is dead. </garnt>
<garnt> A hundred percent. - Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - But no, this guy's like the biggest </garnt>
<connor> mega chat on the planet, </connor>
<connor> which just goes whack and just socks him in the face. </connor>
<connor> And the kangaroo's like, "What the fuck?" </connor>
<connor> He looks around and he's like, "No". </connor>
<connor> He just jumps away. </connor>
<garnt> And he saves the dog. </garnt>
<garnt> I think as well, the kangaroo felt threatened by the dog, </garnt>
<garnt> I think, so the kangaroo also tried to kick the dog as well. </garnt>
<connor> So the dog could have died too. </connor>
<connor> - But what do kangaroo eat? What do they eat? </connor>
<connor> - Grass. </connor>
<joey> - Are they herbivores? - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> But they're also very- </joey>
<connor> - Pretty fucking strong for herbivores. </connor>
<joey> - But they're also extremely territorial as well. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh. </garnt>
<garnt> - Is the picture I've seen of jacked kangaroos, </garnt>
<garnt> is that Photoshopped or is that real? </garnt>
<garnt> I could never tell if it... I've seen it in memes. </garnt>
<joey> - Some of them are real </joey>
<garnt> and I'm sure some of them are overdone. </garnt>
<garnt> But red kangaroos, </garnt>
<connor> which are like the biggest breed of kangaroos, </connor>
<connor> they on average stand like two meters tall. </connor>
<connor> - I mean Australia has the most interesting wildlife. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I mean that's because it was Pangaea, </joey>
<joey> on its own for like hundreds of thousands of years. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - So all these weird animals. </joey>
<joey> - It was like one of the first ones to break off. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, so it's had hundreds of thousands of years. </joey>
<connor> But that's also why it's also super delicate </connor>
<garnt> and why when they introduce foreign pests, </garnt>
<connor> it completely fucked up Australia. </connor>
<connor> They have a rabbit problem. </connor>
<connor> You know about this, do you know about this? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> But they can't kill the rabbits. </connor>
<connor> Do you know why? - Why? </connor>
<connor> - Because people don't want 'em to kill the rabbits, </connor>
<connor> but the rabbits are literally killing everything. </connor>
<joey> - Everyone's like, "Oh, the bunnies are so cute though". </joey>
<joey> And farmers are like, "Er." </joey>
<connor> - They eat everything and there's nothing left for the... </connor>
<connor> you know, 'cause rabbits are like insane. </connor>
<connor> They're so good at taking everything. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - And fucking. </connor>
<connor> - Like the British. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<connor> They literally, well, </connor>
<joey> I think it was brought over by a British guy. </joey>
<joey> - Of course it was. </joey>
<joey> - Because the guy wanted to hunt rabbits </joey>
<joey> in Australia. - In Australia. </joey>
<joey> - So he brought over some rabbits. </joey>
<connor> I could be incorrect on this. </connor>
<joey> And obviously rabbits are very, very good at expanding. </joey>
<joey> And so they have a terrible problem </joey>
<joey> and they've been trying to, they had a... </joey>
<connor> they were gonna start culling them and getting rid of them. </connor>
<connor> But obviously trying to pass a thing saying, </connor>
<connor> "Hey, we're gonna murder a million plus rabbits. </connor>
<connor> Is that cool with everyone?" </connor>
<connor> A lot of people are like, "No, rabbits are so cute. </connor>
<connor> We can't get rid of rabbits." </connor>
<connor> But it's like, "But our wildlife is..." </connor>
<connor> "But, but rabbits are cute." </connor>
<connor> Brings up a really interesting question </connor>
<garnt> of is it, you know, obviously- </garnt>
<connor> - Just because it's cute. </connor>
<connor> - At which point do you count something </connor>
<garnt> as a pest that needs control? </garnt>
<connor> - Well, I think when it's actively- </connor>
<joey> - When it's actively fucking up the natural wildlife. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, that's the problem, </connor>
<connor> is that the delicate ecosystem that Australia has, </connor>
<connor> because it's so susceptible to pests and stuff. </connor>
<connor> I think the rabbit, which just like went crazy </connor>
<connor> and so many of the natural- </connor>
<garnt> - What does it fuck up? </garnt>
<garnt> What do the rabbits fuck up? </garnt>
<connor> - Well, they eat everything. </connor>
<joey> They take everything. </joey>
<joey> - Because they eat all the food </joey>
<connor> that the natural animals are supposed to. </connor>
<joey> Or native, rather. - Rabbits are only, </joey>
<joey> from what I understand, they are only limited </joey>
<joey> by how much food there is. </joey>
<joey> They can breed and make as many of themselves </joey>
<joey> as they need to. </joey>
<joey> It's just, is there enough food available? </joey>
<joey> And they're really good at getting it as well. </joey>
<joey> So, what are those fucking tiny rats </joey>
<connor> with big ears and a tail, in Australia? </connor>
<connor> - Oh, Bilbies. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, those things eat shit compared to the rabbits. </connor>
<connor> The rabbits absolutely cream them in everything. </connor>
<joey> And also rabbits, like rabbits eat their own babies. </joey>
<connor> - Do they? - Yeah. Google it. </connor>
<joey> - Do they actually? - Do they? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. - That's metal as fuck. </connor>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<connor> - [Crew Member] A lot of that animals eat their babies. </connor>
<connor> - Rabbits don't give a fuck. </connor>
<connor> Everyone's like, "Oh, rabbits are so cute." </connor>
<connor> Rabbits eat their fucking babies, bro. </connor>
<connor> Well, you gonna call something cute </connor>
<connor> when it's devouring its first born child. </connor>
<joey> - It's like, all right, if I eat this one, </joey>
<garnt> I can just make another one. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Crew Member] They do, but only sometimes. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, sometimes. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - But, like... </connor>
<joey> - The fact that that's even an option is nasty. </joey>
<connor> - I mean, let's be honest, humans are... </connor>
<joey> let's not pretend like humans haven't done it. </joey>
<joey> All right, we're not great. </joey>
<joey> If we judge the whole species by one or two rogue rabbits, </joey>
<garnt> then maybe. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, the one thing that doesn't make sense to me, </garnt>
<connor> I guess. - Okay. </connor>
<garnt> - Is okay, rabbits are fucking thriving in Australia. </garnt>
<garnt> They're beating the shit out of Australian wildlife. </garnt>
<garnt> Why is it not a problem in the UK? </garnt>
<connor> - Well- - Because you guys </connor>
<joey> don't have enough native animals, maybe? </joey>
<connor> - Well, rabbits are, as far as I understand, </connor>
<garnt> they're native to the UK. </garnt>
<garnt> So the whole ecosystem in the UK had been created </garnt>
<connor> with rabbits being in it for a very long time. </connor>
<connor> If I'm correct. Can you Google this? </connor>
<connor> - [Crew Member] Foxes. </connor>
<garnt> - Foxes. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, the foxes eat the rabbits, right? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, you need to have the balance, right? </connor>
<garnt> - I'm just finding it funny </garnt>
<garnt> that rabbits can survive fucking Australia, </garnt>
<connor> where you look at a spider wrong and you're fucking dead. </connor>
<joey> And then in the UK, what the? </joey>
<connor> In the UK, foxes are like the biggest pussies </connor>
<connor> of the animal kingdom- </connor>
<connor> - Australia has a lot of species that are like... </connor>
<joey> you know, you're playing on the the easy server. </joey>
<joey> It's like- - What? </joey>
<joey> - A lot of these, even though we know </joey>
<joey> Australia is like one of these super scary animals </joey>
<joey> with these snakes and stuff, </joey>
<joey> they have a lot of species of animals </joey>
<joey> that can only survive in Australia. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - And it's very delicate. </connor>
<joey> - Well like koalas, for example, only eat eucalyptus </joey>
<connor> and a specific type of eucalyptus </connor>
<connor> that's grown only in Australia natively. </connor>
<connor> So that's why you don't see koalas in the wildlife, </connor>
<joey> outside anywhere else because they literally can't survive. </joey>
<connor> - In any other continent, </connor>
<connor> the animal probably wouldn't have evolved </connor>
<connor> to just eat one type of plant that is very not popular. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You know what I mean? - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You would have to adapt. Go on, sir. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. So. </connor>
<joey> - Okay. - But in Australia, </joey>
<joey> they're like, it's our territory now, baby. </joey>
<connor> - If you introduce a species it's a problem why these, </connor>
<connor> obviously people didn't understand this in the 1900's. </connor>
<connor> We didn't fucking know what was going on. </connor>
<connor> They were like, "Just bring my pets over. </connor>
<connor> I'm sure it'll be fine." </connor>
<joey> - What I understand is that the argument </joey>
<garnt> of why we shouldn't be getting rid of these rabbits. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, "Oh, they're so cute though." </garnt>
<garnt> Meanwhile, when the Australian government was like, </garnt>
<joey> "Eat the kangaroos, right now", </joey>
<joey> no one was like, "But they're so cute." </joey>
<connor> - Okay, this is also a common thing with cats. </connor>
<connor> Cats are more often, a very big pest in places. </connor>
<connor> People don't wanna get rid of cats </connor>
<connor> because people have pets, they have cats. </connor>
<connor> If the government is like, " Hey, you at home, </connor>
<connor> are you okay with us killing all of this animal?" </connor>
<connor> And you look down and you see that animal staring at you, </connor>
<connor> that you've loved and named and fed, </connor>
<connor> and you know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> It's really hard and- </connor>
<joey> - So what you're saying is, </joey>
<joey> less people need to keep rabbits as pets. </joey>
<garnt> (Garnt laughs) - No, no, no. </garnt>
<connor> - I understand both- - To change the status quo. </connor>
<connor> - What he's saying, is rabbits have way too good PR. </connor>
<garnt> - [Connor] That is literally- - That PR is too fucking good. </garnt>
<garnt> - They're like the McDonald's of animals. </garnt>
<connor> They've got it down, right. </connor>
<connor> You can tell them that McDonald's </connor>
<connor> puts all the shit in their food, </connor>
<connor> It doesn't fucking matter. People are gonna eat it. </connor>
<connor> It's like I understand both sides, </connor>
<connor> and I empathize with both. </connor>
<connor> I empathize with these poor people </connor>
<connor> who care about the natural wildlife, who are like, </connor>
<connor> "We need to keep it the way it was supposed to be." </connor>
<connor> I also understand why that person with 10 rabbits at home </connor>
<connor> might not wanna have all of the rabbit population culled. </connor>
<connor> I get both, right. </connor>
<connor> Also, another fun fact, </connor>
<joey> while we're on fun facts about animals. </joey>
<joey> - Go on. </joey>
<joey> - Did you know? </joey>
<joey> I love this. </joey>
<connor> I was watching an episode of QI the other day </connor>
<connor> and they talking about this? </connor>
<connor> - Do you know why, for the longest time, </connor>
<connor> they never gave the giant tortoise a genome, </connor>
<connor> like an official genome name. </connor>
<connor> - Why? What's a genome? </connor>
<garnt> - You know how every name, every animal has a Greek name. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right. - Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - Do you know why they never gave the giant turtle a name? </garnt>
<connor> - No. - No. </connor>
<connor> - They knew about this animal for a very long time. </connor>
<joey> Right? - Problem was- </joey>
<joey> - These are the motherfuckers that can live like 300 years. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<connor> Problem was people couldn't stop eating them. </connor>
<connor> They never ever made it back. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, I did hear about this. </connor>
<connor> - What? - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> Every time they tried to ship the tortoise- </connor>
<connor> - People would just eat them. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it would never survive the journey </connor>
<garnt> 'cause they were too delicious. </garnt>
<garnt> (all laugh) </garnt>
<connor> Apparently through the... </connor>
<garnt> 'cause we don't eat it anymore, obviously. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - [Crew Member] 'Cause there's none left. </connor>
<garnt> - 'Cause there's none left, </garnt>
<garnt> they're an endangered species now, right? </garnt>
<connor> - In the writing, right. </connor>
<connor> it is literally like the perfect storm </connor>
<connor> of unfortunate for the giant tortoise. </connor>
<connor> So, apparently, in all of the documents </connor>
<connor> left about the giant tortoise, </connor>
<connor> it tastes better than any meat. </connor>
<connor> It tastes better than lamb. It tastes better than beef. </connor>
<connor> It tastes better than pork. </connor>
<connor> Everyone almost unanimously agreed, who tried this meat, </connor>
<joey> agreed that it tasted better than all of them, right. </joey>
<joey> - Damn, I wanna try it. </joey>
<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<joey> - Right. Right. </joey>
<joey> Another unfortunate evolutional part </joey>
<joey> of the giant tortoise is that it also, </joey>
<garnt> this is just so sad. </garnt>
<garnt> It evolved so that it could store </garnt>
<garnt> up to one gallon or one liter of water, </garnt>
<garnt> I can't remember which one it was. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Inside of its body, almost perfectly like a sack. </garnt>
<connor> So when you would eat it as a human, </connor>
<connor> there was almost perfectly this one liter capsule. </connor>
<joey> - So basically, it came with a drink. </joey>
<connor> (all laugh) - It came with a... </connor>
<garnt> - It's like a meal. </garnt>
<garnt> - Imagine it, you've just had this, you're living in this- </garnt>
<garnt> - It's just a survival pack. </garnt>
<garnt> - At the end of the day. </garnt>
<garnt> - You're living in the time </garnt>
<garnt> where beer was drank more than water, </garnt>
<garnt> because water was, more often than not, poisonous. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - It was hard to get a hold of in certain places. </joey>
<joey> So you had this animal that tasted amazing. </joey>
<joey> That was this perfect kind of, </joey>
<connor> like it could store very easily. </connor>
<connor> It was very easy to eat. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Or a lot of the meat was edible in it as well </connor>
<connor> and it had this one gallon sack of water </connor>
<connor> that you could just drink. </connor>
<connor> So sailors would, when they would take them back, </connor>
<connor> they were like, "Well fuck, we're gonna eat it." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Because not only was it delicious and amazing, </joey>
<joey> they also had a free gallon of water they could drink. </joey>
<joey> So it never made it back. </joey>
<joey> - Wait, so does it have a genome now? </joey>
<garnt> - It did, it did after after many, many years, </garnt>
<garnt> it finally got one. </garnt>
<garnt> - Just, food. </garnt>
<garnt> - But it never survived the journey </garnt>
<garnt> back to the UK or something. - Wow. </garnt>
<garnt> - Unfortunately, it could never be classified. </garnt>
<connor> - I just... (laughs) </connor>
<connor> That's just so good. </connor>
<connor> That's really fucked up, but that's hilarious. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, that was really funny. </connor>
<connor> - Can you imagine it? </connor>
<connor> You're just on the boat, and you're like, fuck. </connor>
<connor> - I just wanna imagine the scientists waiting. </connor>
<joey> They're like, "All right, I wanna see this animal </joey>
<joey> so I can figure it out." </joey>
<joey> They're like, "What do you mean you ate it?" </joey>
<joey> - They're like, they're on the port back. </joey>
<joey> They're like, we're gonna bring back 10. </joey>
<joey> We're gonna eat nine. </joey>
<joey> We're gonna let one go back. </joey>
<joey> All right, we all agree, one can go back. </joey>
<joey> - We only need one to name it. </joey>
<connor> - And then that's like one week left on the ship </connor>
<connor> and they're like, "Fuck, dude. </connor>
<connor> Remember that flambeed giant tortoise we had, dude." </connor>
<connor> Ooh. </connor>
<connor> - It's looking kind of delicious right now. </connor>
<connor> - I'm getting real parched. </connor>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<connor> - Just makes me wonder how good must it have tasted. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it must have been amazing. </connor>
<garnt> They come back to port. </garnt>
<connor> They're like, "All right, we brought 10 back. </connor>
<connor> We got one, how many shells? </connor>
<connor> We got like one, two, three... </connor>
<connor> Fuck, we ate them all." </connor>
<garnt> (all laugh) </garnt>
<connor> What the fuck? </connor>
<connor> - Next trip guys, next trip. </connor>
<connor> This time we're gonna bring 11. </connor>
<garnt> - The way they wrote about it, </garnt>
<garnt> was that it was so delicious that, </garnt>
<garnt> it sounded like they genuinely </garnt>
<garnt> just couldn't resist eating it. </garnt>
<garnt> But like, imagine it's that delicious. </garnt>
<garnt> We were like, "Boys, do you fancy </garnt>
<connor> just going for a quick voyage to the islands </connor>
<connor> to go and get some more giant tortoises." </connor>
<connor> And they just keep eating it every time. </connor>
<connor> I'd like to think it was that good </connor>
<connor> that they would go back to go and get more. </connor>
<garnt> - Me and the boys on the way to get giant tortoises. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Connor] Oh. Oh, dude. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's an endangered species now, right? </garnt>
<connor> It's an endangered species now, right? </connor>
<connor> - [Crew Member] It's extinct. </connor>
<connor> - It's... (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Oh, I thought it was just endangered </connor>
<connor> - No, we fucked up. - Okay, okay. </connor>
<garnt> - [Crew Member] We ate all of them. </garnt>
<connor> - So it's kind like the Dodo as well, right? </connor>
<connor> - [Crew Member] I don't think we ate the Dodo. </connor>
<connor> - But, I would rather it was... okay, I'm not... </connor>
<connor> I don't want us to extinct any animal, right. </connor>
<connor> But I would rather us extinct an animal </connor>
<connor> 'cause it's too damn delicious, </connor>
<connor> not that we wanted its horn or something. </connor>
<connor> That feels so wasteful. </connor>
<connor> If we're like, "Dude, we made an amazing stew </connor>
<connor> out of the giant tortoise", </connor>
<connor> part of me is like, "That's fucked up". </connor>
<connor> Okay, at least you used it. </connor>
<garnt> - At which point do you think </garnt>
<joey> natural selection should just take its course? </joey>
<joey> - Right. - Right. </joey>
<joey> Okay, I'm just saying... </joey>
<garnt> - Are you saying, it's your fault </garnt>
<garnt> for being born this delicious. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know, I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> - He's got a point. He's got a point. </garnt>
<connor> If this...why the fuck? </connor>
<connor> This animal just was so unfortunate </connor>
<connor> that it evolved to be the perfect food for humans to eat. </connor>
<garnt> - You fucked up in some way in evolution </garnt>
<connor> by being super delicious. </connor>
<connor> - And having a free sack of clean water. </connor>
<connor> - I'm sorry, you kind of are, you kind of are, right. </connor>
<garnt> They just didn't survive, obviously. </garnt>
<connor> - Again, every part of the tortoise was also edible. </connor>
<connor> The marrow apparently was also delicious in soups and stuff. </connor>
<connor> It was, every single part of this fucker was delicious. </connor>
<connor> This tortoise had evolved somehow </connor>
<connor> to be so goddamn delicious. </connor>
<connor> I don't get it. </connor>
<connor> And I'm angry that I'm never gonna get to try it. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I'm angry that I'm never gonna try it now as well. </connor>
<connor> So, I mean, I'm more angry that it's extinct </connor>
<connor> because I can't try it now. </connor>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<connor> - Fuck it's feelings, I wanna eat it. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Listen, listen, we care about- </connor>
<connor> - Can it be like the McRib or something, </connor>
<connor> just come back for a month. </connor>
<connor> - We care about nature or something, all that bullshit </connor>
<connor> but you know, the delicious animal. </connor>
<connor> I mean, we've talked about eating possible dinosaurs </connor>
<garnt> and all the dinosaurs we might not possibly be able to eat. </garnt>
<garnt> Where's the Jurassic Park episode </garnt>
<garnt> where they bring back a extinct animal </garnt>
<garnt> so they can just serve it as a delicacy, right. </garnt>
<garnt> That's all I'm saying. </garnt>
<joey> - We brought, the sign is like, </joey>
<garnt> we brought back the T-Rex </garnt>
<connor> because we heard flambeing this shit, mm, so good. </connor>
<connor> - That's what Jurassic Park would actually be. </connor>
<connor> It wouldn't be a... it would be a restaurant. </connor>
<connor> It wouldn't be a theme park. </connor>
<connor> - It wouldn't be a theme park, it would be... </connor>
<connor> 'Cause like, come on, come on. </connor>
<connor> If you bring back an extinct animal, </connor>
<connor> there's gonna be that one fucker who's like... </connor>
<connor> - Me, I'm gonna be that fucker. </connor>
<connor> - How do they taste? </connor>
<connor> Come on, there's gotta... </connor>
<garnt> there's definitely gonna be a dinosaur restaurant </garnt>
<connor> somewhere in the world. </connor>
<connor> - Of course. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, it's, you know, the turtle, </connor>
<garnt> it's unfortunate that it was perfectly evolved to be- </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - To be eaten. - I mean- </garnt>
<connor> - The writing was on the wall. </connor>
<connor> - There are some animals where I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> without humans you'd be fucking, you'd be on your last legs. </connor>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<connor> - We saved you. You should grateful, snow leopard. </connor>
<connor> - How did pandas become China's national animal, right? </connor>
<connor> Because, isn't it like panda's, isn't it like they have to- </connor>
<connor> - They don't fuck. </connor>
<connor> - They do not fuck. </connor>
<connor> They just refuse to have fucking have offspring and fuck. </connor>
<connor> And I'm just like, if you have an animal </connor>
<connor> that just does anything that it possibly could </connor>
<connor> to willingly not fucking breed, </connor>
<connor> at which point do you just like, </connor>
<connor> maybe they just don't wanna exist anymore. </connor>
<joey> - They don't wanna exist anymore. </joey>
<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<connor> What, the panda's just like, we just wanna die. </connor>
<connor> Could you stop? </connor>
<connor> - Here's the problem with us as humans when, </connor>
<connor> I think, it comes to us with extinct animals. </connor>
<connor> The amount of shit we give about saving an animal </connor>
<garnt> is inherently tied to how cute it is. </garnt>
<garnt> That is such a... </garnt>
<garnt> I refuse to believe any other explanation. </garnt>
<garnt> - That is true. </garnt>
<garnt> - If you told us, </garnt>
<connor> "Oh, we have to save this one species of flounder", </connor>
<connor> people would be like, "Oh." </connor>
<connor> "I think we can live without a flounder." </connor>
<garnt> - But it's delicious. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, it's like, oh. </connor>
<connor> - There's two things people care about. </connor>
<connor> Is it delicious? </connor>
<connor> - And is it cute? - And is it cute? </connor>
<connor> - Right, if a panda wasn't as cute as it is, would we care? </connor>
<connor> - Probably not as much. - Let's be honest. </connor>
<garnt> We are so fucking biased. </garnt>
<garnt> All the animals we wanna save </garnt>
<garnt> are either cool as fuck or cute as fuck. </garnt>
<connor> - That is true. - Think about it. </connor>
<connor> Think of an animal off top of the head </connor>
<connor> that people are trying to help, </connor>
<connor> like you see campaigns about and stuff, </connor>
<connor> where the animal isn't cute or cool. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, I don't know how, </garnt>
<garnt> The most endangered species I know are pandas. </garnt>
<connor> - [Connor] Cute. - Tigers, maybe? </connor>
<connor> - Name an extinct animals, </connor>
<connor> that are going extinct. - Tigers. </connor>
<connor> - Cool. </connor>
<connor> - Cool, yeah. - Cool. </connor>
<garnt> I mean, it's just any animal with good PR, right? </garnt>
<connor> - That's it. </connor>
<connor> But to get good PR, you need to be cute, right? </connor>
<joey> - Cute or like badass. </joey>
<joey> - Like, if a species of snake was dying out </joey>
<connor> yeah, those snake people online would, oh, no. </connor>
<connor> - Snake people. - Snake people. </connor>
<joey> - You know who I'm talking about, </joey>
<connor> but most people wouldn't give a shit, let's be honest. </connor>
<connor> You're not gonna see the fundraisers about it. </connor>
<garnt> I'm just being honest, that's how we are. </garnt>
<garnt> We're so fucking biased as humans. </garnt>
<garnt> We love to be like, oh yeah, save all the animals, </garnt>
<joey> except the ugly ones. </joey>
<connor> Fuck 'em, they can die. </connor>
<joey> - Unless they're like exceptionally ugly, </joey>
<connor> like the blob fish where it just becomes a meme, </connor>
<garnt> then it's like, well now we gotta save it </garnt>
<connor> because look at this motherfucker. </connor>
<garnt> - Now it's fugly, now it's just great. </garnt>
<joey> - Now it's like, it's so ugly, it's cute. </joey>
<joey> - Now I'm fucking cheering for it </joey>
<connor> because it's the fucking underdog. </connor>
<connor> Now look at it. No-one's gonna cheer for that. </connor>
<connor> So now I'm gonna cheer for that. </connor>
<garnt> - [Joey] He's doing his best. </garnt>
<connor> - We're like, oh, we need to save the tooth fish. </connor>
<joey> And it's just a fish that is just like, literally, </joey>
<joey> razor blades and like no eyes or face. </joey>
<joey> - They're like, well, no one gives a fuck if it dies. </joey>
<joey> I mean, I... don't get me wrong. </joey>
<connor> I'm sure the scientists who spend their life </connor>
<connor> researching these stuff will be very sad, </connor>
<connor> but the general population doesn't care </connor>
<connor> and let's not pretend like we do. </connor>
<joey> We don't, we don't, let's not... </joey>
<connor> - No, we don't. </connor>
<garnt> - We only care when it's already happened. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - Yeah. I guess so. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, animals have been going extinct </garnt>
<connor> for the entire history of nature itself. </connor>
<connor> - I'm not saying we should just let them go extinct. </connor>
<connor> - No, no, no, I'm not saying that. </connor>
<connor> I'm saying I feel like... - Fuck 'em. </connor>
<joey> - I feel like we should try to preserve nature </joey>
<joey> as much as we can. </joey>
<joey> - Of course. - Of course. </joey>
<garnt> - But you know. </garnt>
<garnt> - We're not gonna be like, weak mindset, see ya. </garnt>
<joey> - What are we, the board meeting of the fucking "Lorax"? </joey>
<connor> What is this? </connor>
<connor> I think we should get rid of all the plants, </connor>
<connor> make more museums. </connor>
<garnt> We need more water parks. </garnt>
<connor> Fuck them, fuck the planet. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, if humans have had a direct effect </connor>
<connor> on making this animal extinct, </connor>
<connor> I think, yeah, we should take responsibility. </connor>
<connor> We should be like, okay, yeah, </connor>
<connor> we kind of fucked up their entire environment, </connor>
<connor> their entire habitat. </connor>
<garnt> Let's try not to do that again, </garnt>
<connor> unless they're delicious of course. </connor>
<garnt> - You think rabbits have this meeting? </garnt>
<garnt> (all laugh) </garnt>
<garnt> Should we start fucking? </garnt>
<joey> Does seem like we're taking over a lot of things. </joey>
<connor> - He's enjoying it too much. </connor>
<connor> - Consume, consume, fuck, consume. </connor>
<joey> - This episode is sponsored by ExpressVPN. </joey>
<connor> - [Connor] Watching Netflix without using ExpressVPN </connor>
<connor> is like buying tickets to a Taylor Swift concert, </connor>
<connor> but only being able to watch the opening act. </connor>
<garnt> - That's horrible. - I wanna see Taylor. </garnt>
<garnt> - As you know, a lot of content on Netflix is region locked. </garnt>
<garnt> Luckily we get all the anime, </garnt>
<garnt> but I'm missing a lot of good old British TV shows. </garnt>
<garnt> But thanks to ExpressVPN, that's a problem of the past. </garnt>
<joey> - [Joey] Because ExpressVPN lets you change </joey>
<joey> your online location to wherever you want. </joey>
<joey> Control where you want Netflix or other streaming websites </joey>
<joey> to think you're located and boom, </joey>
<joey> all of those libraries will be open to you like that. </joey>
<connor> - I actually use ExpressVPN quite often. </connor>
<joey> Just one tap on the app. </joey>
<joey> It's very easy. - Very easy. </joey>
<joey> - It's very easy. </joey>
<joey> - I dunno what else there is to say. </joey>
<joey> It's easy. </joey>
<joey> You can pick any country you want. </joey>
<joey> And if you wanna change your region for whatever reason, </joey>
<connor> be it content or if you're shopping, </connor>
<connor> buying tickets for stuff. </connor>
<connor> You know, you sometimes get cheaper flights. </connor>
<connor> So yeah, it's really easy to use. </connor>
<garnt> - So, what are you waiting for? </garnt>
<garnt> Be smart. </garnt>
<garnt> Stop paying full prices for streaming services </garnt>
<garnt> and only getting a fraction of their content. </garnt>
<garnt> Get your money's worth at expressvpn.com/trashtaste. </garnt>
<joey> That's expressvpn.com/trashtaste </joey>
<joey> to get an extra three months of ExpressVPN for free. </joey>
<joey> - Back to the episode. </joey>
<joey> - Have you ever had to clear out </joey>
<joey> wasp infestation or whatever. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> It sucks. </joey>
<joey> - What's the process around that. </joey>
<connor> - A broom and running shoes? </connor>
<connor> - Well, in the UK, I think you just call a specialist. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But I think a lot of people </joey>
<connor> just take matters into their own hands. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, we just take matters into our own hands. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, because I know, </garnt>
<garnt> I've had to see Sydney's dad deal with a wasp nest, </garnt>
<connor> a wasp nest being just newly formed. </connor>
<connor> And even that was just like, I am standing behind, </connor>
<garnt> it's like six foot of bulletproof glass </garnt>
<garnt> while I'm watching you do this because I- </garnt>
<connor> - How did he deal with it? Did he shoot it? </connor>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<connor> That's the most American thing. </connor>
<connor> Not on my property. - Bang. </connor>
<connor> - Honey, get the shotgun. </connor>
<connor> - He had a broom, he had a broom as well. </connor>
<connor> But yeah, he had a shotgun just in case. </connor>
<connor> - There is no good reason to own an M16 </connor>
<garnt> unless there's a wasp. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. I have seen- </joey>
<garnt> - I'm gonna shoot them down one at a time. </garnt>
<garnt> - I seen a video on YouTube of Americans </garnt>
<garnt> and I think they were Texans </garnt>
<garnt> getting rid of wasps nest with a shotgun </garnt>
<garnt> and it went exactly how you think it went. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, shit. (Joey imitates shooting) </garnt>
<connor> Wasps immediately come and attack. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Is there any fucking animals that terrify you, </garnt>
<garnt> that you'd see and you're like, (blows raspberry) </garnt>
<joey> - I think Australia's just conditioned me to be like, </joey>
<joey> as long as it doesn't kill me, I'm not really afraid of it. </joey>
<connor> - There's no one particular animal or bug </connor>
<connor> that scares me the most. </connor>
<connor> If there's a deer or a bear in front of me, </connor>
<joey> yeah, I'm gonna be scared. </joey>
<joey> We've already spoke about this. </joey>
<connor> Yeah, we have. - Scared. </connor>
<joey> - It's not so much me being scared of a lot of animals, </joey>
<joey> it's just being creeped out or cautious about them. </joey>
<joey> I'm not scared of a cockroach, </joey>
<joey> but I'm not like, "Ooh yay, little cockroach." </joey>
<joey> You know, I don't love it. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, you know what's... </connor>
<connor> Okay, one bug, not scary. </connor>
<connor> Like 50 bugs together, freaks me the fuck out. </connor>
<garnt> - Ah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I'm actually the same. </garnt>
<joey> Like, I fucking hate spiders. </joey>
<joey> I mean, only a few people don't hate spiders, </joey>
<connor> but I actually prefer, the bigger the spider is, </connor>
<joey> the more comforting it is for me </joey>
<joey> because at least I can see it. </joey>
<joey> It never leaves my view. - Easier to kill. </joey>
<joey> - Right. </joey>
<joey> - It is, it's like... </joey>
<joey> - Get the shotgun. </joey>
<joey> - A larger hit box. </joey>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<connor> - Literally, it's got like a larger hit box, right. </connor>
<connor> In case I wanna do something. </connor>
<connor> Those fucking small spiders that scurry about, </connor>
<garnt> those are the ones that fucking keep me up at night. </garnt>
<garnt> And I dunno why, I dunno why. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's the one thing I don't miss about the UK. </garnt>
<connor> I had a lot of spiders in my house in Wales. </connor>
<joey> - Are any of them poisonous there? </joey>
<connor> - No, no, no, you just don't wanna see, </connor>
<connor> like when they go under your bed and you've lost them. </connor>
<joey> - Weak mindset. (laughs) </joey>
<connor> - It does suck when you see a spider go underneath your bed </connor>
<joey> and you're like, I'm dead. </joey>
<joey> - Oh no, the worst one is when you're sleeping </joey>
<connor> and you see it on the ceiling </connor>
<connor> and you blink and it's just disappeared. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - I've had like loads of mice and rat problems in the UK. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. - Have I told you about that? </garnt>
<garnt> - No. Actually I think you have. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think so. </garnt>
<connor> - I've had rats in Swansea and I had mice in London. </connor>
<garnt> - Right, what's the difference between a mouse and rat? </garnt>
<connor> - Oh, you know the difference. </connor>
<joey> - Rat is like a huge mouse. </joey>
<joey> - Rats are like, well they're massive, dude. </joey>
<joey> They're fucking disgusting. </joey>
<connor> Rats are like the mega Chads. - Okay. </connor>
<joey> - And the mice is just like civilians. </joey>
<connor> - Mice aren't that scary but mice are so fast. </connor>
<connor> - Rats are fast. </connor>
<connor> - Mice move at like the fucking speed of light though. </connor>
<connor> And also the thing that sucks about mice </connor>
<connor> is that they can... no gap is too small for mice. </connor>
<joey> - Sure. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - They can fit through anything. </joey>
<joey> So they would go under the door, </joey>
<joey> even though the clearance is like this, </joey>
<joey> they would like squeeze underneath. </joey>
<joey> - They turn into a liquid form. </joey>
<joey> - Literally, literally dude. </joey>
<joey> I remember 'cause we were... </joey>
<connor> it was so funny 'cause this maisonette in London </connor>
<connor> that was created, it was being touted </connor>
<connor> as being rat and mouse proof. </connor>
<connor> That was the whole point behind the building. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And the landlord was extremely furious </connor>
<connor> when I told him about it. </connor>
<connor> I was like, "Yeah man, oh, we got mice." </connor>
<connor> And he's like, "What? </connor>
<connor> I bought this place specifically </connor>
<connor> 'cause I was told that it couldn't have mice." </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Well we got mice". And so he- </connor>
<joey> - How do you make a place mouse and rat free? </joey>
<connor> - It's not possible. I don't think it's possible. </connor>
<connor> And so we had these mice </connor>
<connor> and they always came out at night. </connor>
<garnt> I dunno if that's normal. - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I never saw them during the day, but- </garnt>
<garnt> - Are they nocturnal? </garnt>
<garnt> - I dunno, it was horrible though </garnt>
<connor> 'cause I'd be in my bed watching Netflix. </connor>
<connor> TV's there, door is here and I'd just see a shadow. </connor>
<joey> (imitates air whooshing) </joey>
<garnt> - Oh shit. </garnt>
<connor> - In my room. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I've had that before. </garnt>
<connor> - And I was like, what the fuck? </connor>
<joey> - That's so weird, we don't get mice and rats in Australia. </joey>
<connor> - Might be too hot. - I don't know. </connor>
<connor> - Well I think it's 'cause all the snakes </connor>
<connor> are fucking eating them. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. - Right. </joey>
<joey> - They get like fucked by snakes and stuff like that. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - And cats and stuff. </connor>
<connor> We tried all this expensive stuff for killing them. </connor>
<connor> In the end, the thing that killed them the most was just- </connor>
<connor> - Mouse trap? </connor>
<connor> - The basic Amazon mouse trap. </connor>
<joey> It would clap their cheese. </joey>
<joey> - Don't fix something that's not broken, right? </joey>
<connor> - I think the poison killed some of them, </connor>
<garnt> but we ended up just needing to like clog it. </garnt>
<garnt> But the thing is, they chew through everything. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - Yeah yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - No matter what you clog it with, they just, </garnt>
<garnt> they get through it. </garnt>
<connor> Like in New York, the rats can chew through concrete. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah. Yeah. - Holy shit. </garnt>
<connor> - Little by little, right? </connor>
<connor> - Insane, it's insane. </connor>
<connor> - The one pest that- - That's some Shawshank shit. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, the one pest that terrifies me, </connor>
<connor> of ever getting, is termites. </connor>
<joey> I've never known anyone with termites. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, we had termites. </joey>
<connor> - It's not really a problem unless you have a wood house, </connor>
<connor> though, isn't it? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah yeah, yeah, 'cause at my parents' place </connor>
<joey> had a termite infestation and it was scary </joey>
<joey> because it's like, oh the house might come down. </joey>
<garnt> - It's the one of the few pests that, </garnt>
<garnt> if you have it in your house, </garnt>
<garnt> and under the right conditions, it could just kill you. </garnt>
<connor> Right, because you- </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, 'cause wooden houses in Australia mainly, right? </connor>
<garnt> - Yes. - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - So yeah. </connor>
<connor> - How'd you deal with termites, </connor>
<garnt> like what's the process around getting rid of termites? </garnt>
<joey> - When it comes to termites, </joey>
<joey> you just have to call a specialist for that. </joey>
<connor> - Don't they just like gas the place? </connor>
<joey> - Pretty much. They like smoke it out basically. </joey>
<connor> - Right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, we had a termite, </connor>
<connor> it wasn't a massive infestation, but we were like, </connor>
<connor> yeah, we should probably get rid of these now </connor>
<joey> because if they expand, yeah, the house is gonna come down. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Like, so fuck that. </joey>
<connor> - That's fucking terrifying. </connor>
<joey> - It's so scary. </joey>
<joey> - That's so sick that when they do that, </joey>
<joey> like when they just put gas all in the house. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - I find that so cool. </joey>
<connor> - Well, why? - Why is that cool? </connor>
<garnt> - It's like, wow, they just put like a tent </garnt>
<garnt> over the house and gas it. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, that's so badass. </garnt>
<garnt> Who thought, "Oh, we gotta kill these rats. </garnt>
<joey> Oh, Oh we gotta use these rat poison." </joey>
<joey> And the guy's like, "Hold up. </joey>
<joey> Boys, what if we gas the whole house." </joey>
<joey> - What if we nuke the house? </joey>
<joey> - And I'm like, the first time someone suggested that </joey>
<joey> someone must been like, you're crazy. </joey>
<garnt> Like, no, no, hold on. </garnt>
<garnt> What if we put a big tent, </garnt>
<garnt> a comically large tent around the house. </garnt>
<connor> Someone's like, you're a genius. </connor>
<garnt> Let's try it. </garnt>
<garnt> - How else are they gonna get rid of thousands </garnt>
<joey> of tiny insects just living in every single crevice. </joey>
<joey> - They're not gonna be like... </joey>
<joey> - You're gonna be like, </joey>
<joey> well it's either like the tent or the flame thrower. </joey>
<connor> And I'm like, before we get the flame thrower out, </connor>
<connor> maybe we should throw out a tent, maybe. </connor>
<connor> - I think the one job on earth, </connor>
<connor> sort of somewhat related to this, </connor>
<joey> not dealing with getting rid of bugs and stuff, but. </joey>
<joey> You know people who clean houses </joey>
<joey> after people have died. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> That's the one job I don't think I could do. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, it depends how horribly they die. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Well, 'cause normally, you know, when you get older, </joey>
<joey> you struggle to take care of yourself, </joey>
<connor> so the house gets really like, you know, fucked. </connor>
<connor> And I saw one on Japan, so depressing and it's just like- </connor>
<joey> - No, it happens very often in Japan. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> And they go in and they're just like, </connor>
<connor> well, we're just gonna take all this guy's possessions </connor>
<connor> and trash them and stuff. </connor>
<garnt> It's like, "Oh, oh, don't break my heart, dude. </garnt>
<garnt> Just go into someone's house trying to figure out, </garnt>
<garnt> what their life was and stuff, I couldn't do it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, I mean, I guess, I mean like. </garnt>
<connor> - You're like, oh, I don't give a fuck. </connor>
<joey> Bring in the trash truck. </joey>
<joey> - I thought you meant people </joey>
<joey> who had been brutally murdered or something. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, that's what I thought. </connor>
<garnt> - I was like, yeah, that's a pretty bad job. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, that's probably one part of it, </garnt>
<garnt> but what if you're a guy who couldn't take care of yourself, </garnt>
<connor> you're like 70 and you know, </connor>
<connor> maybe you couldn't make it to the toilet and stuff. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't know, I feel like- </garnt>
<connor> - And the room smells- - Like you shit yourself. </connor>
<connor> - Well yeah, it happens, it happens. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, of course. </joey>
<joey> I mean, I think that'd be like a fine job. </joey>
<connor> I mean, it's- </connor>
<connor> - What? Can't say I'll do it. </connor>
<connor> Gimme a tenner. </connor>
<connor> - I mean, it's not a pleasant job, </connor>
<garnt> but I feel like it's... </garnt>
<connor> - Would it not freak you out, </connor>
<connor> just knowing that someone was there, </connor>
<connor> and living there, like a week ago. </connor>
<connor> That'll freak me out. </connor>
<joey> - I think you'd get pretty numb to it after a while, though. </joey>
<garnt> - Dunno. - I mean, </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like cleaning out all of their stuff, </garnt>
<garnt> you'd just be like, "Oh, this is someone's legacy. </garnt>
<connor> This is someone's entire life". </connor>
<garnt> Why would that freak you out? </garnt>
<connor> - I dunno, just trying to figure out what happened? </connor>
<garnt> Like, what was their life like? </garnt>
<garnt> - Maybe that wouldn't, I think that's super interesting. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - You get a peak into someone's... </connor>
<connor> not saying this is like a glorious job or something, </connor>
<connor> but I think, if someone died peacefully </connor>
<connor> of old age or something and you're cleaning their house, </connor>
<joey> I think that would be a really interesting way </joey>
<joey> to really piece together what kind of person they are- </joey>
<garnt> - I'm think, unfortunately, in the modern era, </garnt>
<garnt> we have this peaceful ignorance </garnt>
<garnt> that we think that a lot of deaths are this pleasant. </garnt>
<connor> He passed away with his friends and family. </connor>
<connor> Especially in Japan and stuff. </connor>
<connor> It's like, "No, Tanaka San died age 90 in his apartment </connor>
<garnt> and his family hadn't seen him in five years </garnt>
<connor> and he doesn't have any friends. </connor>
<connor> - And he's just a skeleton now. </connor>
<joey> - And it's yeah- - It happens. </joey>
<connor> - 'Cause the video was following this guy, that I watched, </connor>
<connor> and he was cleaning it out and he was like, </connor>
<connor> "Yep, it looks like he tried to make some food </connor>
<connor> right before he passed, but he wasn't able to." </connor>
<connor> And it's like, "Oh". - Heartbreaking, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Man just wanted a curry, dude. </joey>
<connor> We all deserve that, we all deserve just a nice meal. </connor>
<garnt> - Before the curry. </garnt>
<garnt> - Wait, so how did they die then? </garnt>
<connor> - Well, you know, if you are getting really old </connor>
<connor> and you're not able to make it to the toilet and stuff </connor>
<connor> and you can barely get outta bed </connor>
<connor> and no one's there to help you. </connor>
<connor> You know, it can be really fucked. </connor>
<joey> - Oh, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - You know, one day your heart could just be like, </joey>
<joey> "I don't think so", and then just stop, you know? </joey>
<joey> - Wow. Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - I mean, I think there are worse ways </garnt>
<garnt> to pass away than that. </garnt>
<garnt> They died in their home and you know, </garnt>
<garnt> I think that would be something </garnt>
<garnt> where a lot of people wish to pass away. </garnt>
<joey> - I think a worst job is the people </joey>
<joey> who have to clean up after train accidents. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, that would be traumatic for you. </garnt>
<joey> - That would suck ass. </joey>
<joey> - Like to me, if I knew a guy died peacefully, </joey>
<joey> peacefully of old age in their own house, </joey>
<joey> I'm like, you know what? </joey>
<joey> Death is never a nice thing, </joey>
<joey> but if there was a way that I would want to go </joey>
<joey> it would be like that, you know. </joey>
<joey> Just nice and peaceful in the comfort of my own home. </joey>
<joey> - Just like very quietly, you know, </joey>
<joey> just like reflecting on that person's life. </joey>
<joey> Meanwhile, it's like, oh cool. </joey>
<joey> This guy jumped in front of a train. </joey>
<garnt> I have to pick up his fucking pieces of his skull. </garnt>
<garnt> You know, I would much rather do the house job </garnt>
<joey> than the other one. </joey>
<garnt> - I know. </garnt>
<garnt> - I know. </garnt>
<garnt> I remember I stayed at an Airbnb once </garnt>
<garnt> and the guy running this Airbnb </garnt>
<garnt> was this old Japanese guy. </garnt>
<garnt> He was in his seventies or something. </garnt>
<garnt> And he was showing us, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> giving us a tour around the house. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's a bit morbid actually, </garnt>
<garnt> but just one block away from the house was a graveyard. </garnt>
<garnt> Right? - Oh yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And we had to walk through this graveyard </garnt>
<garnt> to get to his house, right. </garnt>
<garnt> And he pauses at one of the graves </garnt>
<garnt> and he talks about, oh, this is, </garnt>
<garnt> you know, my dad's here, my granddad is here </garnt>
<garnt> and I'm gonna be right there. </garnt>
<garnt> And me and Sydney go. </garnt>
<connor> - He's always prepared. He's prepared. </connor>
<connor> - Cool. </connor>
<connor> How do you react to that? </connor>
<connor> How'd you react to, I got an old guy being like, </connor>
<connor> yeah, I'm gonna be there in a few years. </connor>
<joey> I'm like- - Why wait, let's do it now. </joey>
<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<connor> Hoe came outta nowhere. </connor>
<connor> - But I mean, I can't even begin to empathize </connor>
<joey> what my thoughts would be like at that age. </joey>
<joey> At what point do you just accept your own mortality- </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] I think that's kind of badass. </joey>
<garnt> - Come to terms with it, come to peace with it. </garnt>
<joey> - I think it's kind of badass though, </joey>
<garnt> to be like, just kind of facing reality </garnt>
<garnt> and being like, you know what, I'm gonna be there soon. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just gonna enjoy life, while I still have it, </garnt>
<garnt> kind of thing, you know? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. - He's pre-ordering. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<garnt> He pre-ordered his gravestone. </garnt>
<connor> - He pre-ordered the gravestone. </connor>
<joey> - Pre-ordered death. </joey>
<connor> - He had the space, and everything. </connor>
<connor> I was just like, "Oh fuck." </connor>
<connor> To me, as a young guy, </connor>
<connor> to me as a guy in his thirties, </connor>
<connor> I was like, "Dude, that's a bit morbid to me." </connor>
<garnt> But I mean, I don't know, </garnt>
<garnt> at that age, I dunno how I'd feel. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, people in Japan like everything planned out. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's true. </garnt>
<connor> - They like everything to be predictable. </connor>
<connor> They're like, "I wanna know when I'm dying </connor>
<garnt> so I can fucking figure out how many crochets I need to do." </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, at which age would you ever consider </garnt>
<connor> getting life insurance? </connor>
<connor> Right, 'cause, okay. </connor>
<connor> - Isn't it when you get kids you're supposed to. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, usually. </joey>
<joey> - Or like writing a will? </joey>
<connor> Right. - Right. </connor>
<garnt> It's something you never really think about. </garnt>
<joey> - But don't they say that you should write a will </joey>
<joey> in your 20's? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, I've wanted to, I've been meaning to. </connor>
<connor> - We're at that age group </connor>
<joey> where we should have a will already. </joey>
<connor> - Well, okay, okay. Here's the thing, </connor>
<connor> I think it's when you have something. </connor>
<garnt> You know, we're quite successful, we've done well. </garnt>
<garnt> And so if you have some savings that could be of great help </garnt>
<connor> to your family members or something. </connor>
<connor> Fuck the government. </connor>
<connor> Don't give it to them. </connor>
<garnt> Make sure you know who in your family who gets it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - Yeah yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> So I think if you have anything </garnt>
<garnt> worth giving to your family that is significant, </garnt>
<connor> you should do a will at any age. </connor>
<connor> You know, God forbid something happens, but- </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, God forbid. </garnt>
<joey> - And to my sister, I give my entire body pillow collection. </joey>
<garnt> Nothing else. </garnt>
<garnt> Do not touch the bank money. </garnt>
<joey> - Who am I giving my YouTube channel to? </joey>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<connor> I'm literally giving away clout. </connor>
<garnt> Who wants the clout on my YouTube channel. </garnt>
<connor> - I have already decided that I want my, </connor>
<connor> the reading of my will to be a comical endeavor. </connor>
<joey> So I'm gonna add the most stupid items to my will </joey>
<joey> and be extremely specific with instructions </joey>
<connor> just to get a good laugh from the grave. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I dunno because I don't have any brothers or sisters </garnt>
<garnt> and I would hope that I pass away after my parents, </garnt>
<garnt> and I don't have any kids right now. </garnt>
<garnt> So, at this point, I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> when is there, if that like awkward conversation </garnt>
<garnt> or that awkward realization to be like, </garnt>
<joey> I should write a will or I should look into life insurance </joey>
<joey> because, I don't know... </joey>
<joey> I dunno about your parents, but I remember a few years ago, </joey>
<joey> my parents told me that they had started writing their wills </joey>
<joey> and I'm just like, "Mom, Dad, </joey>
<joey> I don't wanna think about that right now. </joey>
<joey> Just don't tell me, I don't wanna... </joey>
<joey> I acknowledge it, but at the same time, </joey>
<garnt> I don't want to hear about." </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, my dad just used to meme his will </joey>
<joey> all the time growing up. </joey>
<joey> If I ever did a good deed, my dad would be like, </joey>
<joey> "I'm adding that to the will." </joey>
<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<joey> "You get an extra item on my will". </joey>
<joey> It's like, "Yes." </joey>
<garnt> And my sister would be like, "What the fuck"? </garnt>
<joey> - It's like a fucking competition. </joey>
<garnt> Who wants the house in the will? Who's it gonna be? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, 'cause I told the story </joey>
<garnt> of how I gave my dad, my dad wanted a car engine. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And he's like, "Son, the entire record collection </connor>
<connor> that I have, was to your sister, </connor>
<joey> but now it's under your name now." </joey>
<joey> I was like, "Yes'. </joey>
<connor> - I'd like to think your dad doesn't even have a will. </connor>
<joey> He's just making shit up. - He making it up. </joey>
<connor> - He's just saying shit as he goes along. </connor>
<joey> - Probably, but yeah, I remember I read somewhere. </joey>
<joey> I think I was on a Japanese program </joey>
<joey> that they recommend that you should just write a will, </joey>
<joey> as soon as you just have awareness. </joey>
<connor> - I think it's pretty cheap. </connor>
<connor> I think any document and then you get it witnessed, I think? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't think it's that complicated. </garnt>
<garnt> I think it's just going out of your way to be like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Hey, I'm going to write about the moment </garnt>
<garnt> after I've passed away and who gets my belongings". </garnt>
<garnt> And before you think to yourself and you're like, </garnt>
<garnt> "I don't have any belongings </garnt>
<garnt> worth giving away to begin with, </garnt>
<garnt> why would I write a will?" </garnt>
<connor> - Well, my JuJu collection needs to go somewhere. </connor>
<garnt> - Who would you give that to? </garnt>
<garnt> Who would you give that to? </garnt>
<connor> Would you trust one of your family members to it? </connor>
<connor> - I would trust the boys with my JuJu figures. </connor>
<garnt> I'd like to think you'd keep onto them. </garnt>
<connor> - Thank you very much. </connor>
<connor> - You'd treat them well. </connor>
<garnt> - You would- </garnt>
<joey> - Definitely not recently, man. </joey>
<connor> - You can resell it if you want. </connor>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<connor> I better get good prowess, it's my JuJu. </connor>
<joey> - Like on your death bed, I'll be like, </joey>
<joey> "Could you just like quickly sign these." </joey>
<joey> - Hopefully my name won't be worthless at that point. </joey>
<joey> Maybe it'll worth something. I don't know. </joey>
<joey> - How do you go about... </joey>
<joey> like what is the structure of writing a will though? </joey>
<joey> That's what I've always wanted to know. </joey>
<joey> Do you write it like a novel or like a letter? </joey>
<connor> - I think you can be as- </connor>
<joey> - Can you write it like a poem? </joey>
<joey> - I think you can be as playful as you want with it. </joey>
<joey> You ever thought about doing a video will? </joey>
<joey> - A video... Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - What's up guys? Welcome to my will. </connor>
<connor> So I'm dead. </connor>
<garnt> - Is that like the new YouTuber fucking trend? </garnt>
<garnt> We've had apology videos, now we just have- </garnt>
<garnt> - Make sure to subscribe. Just kidding. </garnt>
<joey> You're not gonna get another video after this. </joey>
<joey> - You've heard of, </joey>
<joey> I made this video five years ago and uploaded it. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Get ready for, I made this video when I was alive </joey>
<connor> and you can play it when I die. </connor>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<connor> I think that would be fucking cool. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. - I think that would be cool. </garnt>
<joey> - Kind of like, so if you're watching this video, I'm dead. </joey>
<connor> - But also the payoff might not work </connor>
<connor> if YouTube doesn't exist in like 60 years. </connor>
<garnt> - Or it's probably gonna be like age restricted </garnt>
<garnt> and fucking banned off YouTube. </garnt>
<garnt> Imagine that, someone dies of a terminal cancer. </garnt>
<connor> - You can play a video of a dead person on YouTube. </connor>
<connor> - Well, I mean... </connor>
<connor> - It's not you showing the fucking footage of you dying. </connor>
<garnt> - I mean the... </garnt>
<garnt> - It's like me now, age 20, I record something. </garnt>
<connor> I'm like, "This is to be played..." </connor>
<connor> Not me like, "Bye guys." Boom. </connor>
<connor> It's not that, it's... </connor>
<garnt> - I mean, the only closest thing I could think of </garnt>
<connor> was the unfortunate thing of what happened with Etika. </connor>
<connor> And that got removed by YouTube. </connor>
<garnt> So, I don't know, we've never had it before, </garnt>
<garnt> so I guess we've never had like a precedent before, </garnt>
<garnt> like what would happen- </garnt>
<connor> - Well, there's YouTubers who have died </connor>
<garnt> and their video's still up. </garnt>
<garnt> I think that was a special circumstance. </garnt>
<garnt> - But, has there been a YouTuber who has recorded their, </garnt>
<connor> like a goodbye video? </connor>
<joey> - Right before they died? </joey>
<connor> - No, no, no, like a goodbye video </connor>
<garnt> that would be uploaded postmortem. </garnt>
<garnt> Does that make sense? </garnt>
<connor> - Without, okay, can I ask a morbid question? </connor>
<connor> Are you asking that without the intention </connor>
<connor> of then doing something very sinister? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, without the intention. </garnt>
<garnt> Let's say they have a terminal illness or something. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh yes, there is. </connor>
<garnt> - There has been? </garnt>
<garnt> - There is. - I'm sure there has been. </garnt>
<garnt> - There was a... it's a powerful watch. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't think I could, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't think I have the heart to watch that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, I don't think I could watch that. </garnt>
<garnt> - The guy was logging his cancer journey. </garnt>
<garnt> I forgot the name. </garnt>
<garnt> I wish I knew the name off by heart, </garnt>
<garnt> but it's hard to watch 'cause- - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - You know, he's doing well at some points </garnt>
<garnt> and then it's unfortunately, </garnt>
<garnt> it takes a turn for the worst. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And the last few videos he uploads are very painful. </garnt>
<garnt> He's in the hospice and- - Oh God. </garnt>
<garnt> - And you know, it's really... </garnt>
<garnt> I think that it was very rare </garnt>
<joey> that we had footage of watching that, but yeah, </joey>
<joey> he was uploading videos and he unfortunately passed away, </joey>
<joey> but all the videos are there and his whole journey's there </joey>
<connor> and it's very inspiring. </connor>
<joey> - But how cool is it that at least </joey>
<connor> all of that is now documented forever. </connor>
<connor> And that's just out there for people to watch </connor>
<connor> and be inspired by. </connor>
<connor> - I can imagine that a lot of people </connor>
<joey> have found comfort with it. </joey>
<joey> I mean, yeah, it's hard to watch. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - I don't think I could. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - This is going on a tangent </connor>
<connor> because we are talking about terminal illnesses </connor>
<connor> and stuff like that. - Right. </connor>
<connor> - Do you feel like, watching that, </connor>
<connor> watching something like that happen in your eyes, </connor>
<connor> in front of your eyes, do you feel like, </connor>
<connor> with how awful that situation is, </connor>
<joey> that seeing that kind of thing portrayed in media so often </joey>
<joey> has kind of like desensitized or desensitized you </joey>
<joey> to like how awful that is in reality, </joey>
<joey> just because, you know, the cancer patient </joey>
<joey> or someone dying of cancer has been used </joey>
<joey> as such a common writing trope in every sad anime film </joey>
<garnt> and just every sad plot point in general. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. I mean, it's... </connor>
<connor> I guess, until you experience it, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - And it's someone close to you or even yourself, </garnt>
<garnt> you'd experience it, I think it's impossible </garnt>
<connor> to portray it in an authentic way. </connor>
<joey> - I think though, just the sole fact that, </joey>
<joey> that trope has been used so many times in fiction </joey>
<connor> and yet it still continues to draw emotion </connor>
<connor> out of the viewer or the listener, whatever it is. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Stories about the main character </connor>
<connor> has a terminal illness, slowly dying, </connor>
<connor> and it shows all of that. </connor>
<connor> First time you consume anything like that, </connor>
<connor> 99% of people will be very emotional, you know, cry. </connor>
<connor> But it's interesting how you could watch </connor>
<connor> 10 different shows like that, </connor>
<connor> and you'd probably still cry on the 10th one as well. </connor>
<connor> So I think, even though it's been overused in fiction, </connor>
<connor> I think just that is so powerful and potent enough </connor>
<connor> that it'll just continue to evoke some kind of emotion. </connor>
<connor> Let alone if you yourself experience that shit. </connor>
<connor> That just adds onto it, I feel. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And I'm sure, </connor>
<connor> some people would be desensitized to it, sure. </connor>
<connor> You know? - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - But I think at the end of the day, </joey>
<joey> there's a reason why writers still use that trope. </joey>
<garnt> - I guess for me, I went through a weird experience </garnt>
<garnt> where I had seen so many stories like this, </garnt>
<garnt> that there was a point where I got desensitized to the media </garnt>
<garnt> where I was just like, "Oh, it's a character dying </garnt>
<connor> because of a terminal illness." </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And then I unfortunately experienced </connor>
<connor> a family member passing away </connor>
<connor> because of something like this and it was just like, </connor>
<connor> it definitely grounded me in a way that I never... </connor>
<connor> not that I never thought I would, </connor>
<connor> it just put things into perspective for me. </connor>
<connor> And it just, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> I haven't, since that has happened, </connor>
<connor> I've actively avoided any stories around that </connor>
<connor> because it seems way more real to me. </connor>
<connor> So I dunno how I would react to that. </connor>
<connor> Part of the reason, for example, </connor>
<connor> that I couldn't watch "Clannad", right, </connor>
<connor> or I couldn't finish "Clannad" </connor>
<connor> was because at the time I was watching it, </connor>
<connor> it just felt like cry porn, right? </connor>
<connor> It just felt like cry porn </connor>
<connor> where I was so disconnected, </connor>
<connor> disconnected with what was happening on screen, </connor>
<connor> because I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> this is Key just trying to make me cry. </connor>
<connor> You know, he's trying to make me cry. </connor>
<connor> But yeah, I dunno if I had a point. </connor>
<connor> I dunno if I would react differently </connor>
<connor> to watching those types of media </connor>
<connor> now that I have grown up and have more experience </connor>
<garnt> about the real events that, I guess, </garnt>
<garnt> influence stories like this. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Joey] Mm. </garnt>
<garnt> - And if I would still feel the same way, </garnt>
<garnt> or if I would still be desensitized, </garnt>
<garnt> because it is a fictional story </garnt>
<garnt> that has been told many, many, many times. </garnt>
<joey> - I think when it gets to that point, though, </joey>
<joey> it just revolves around how well written </joey>
<connor> those stories and characters are. </connor>
<connor> - That's true, that's true. </connor>
<connor> - There are so many stories where they use that trope. </connor>
<connor> but you're just like, </connor>
<connor> "Okay, I know I'm supposed to feel sad </connor>
<connor> for this character right now, </connor>
<connor> but the writing is so mediocre </connor>
<joey> that it hasn't given me enough emotional storage </joey>
<joey> for me to care about this character. </joey>
<joey> - That's true, that's true. </joey>
<connor> - I think it's impossible to replicate </connor>
<connor> the feeling of going through it in real life, </connor>
<joey> just because no matter how good the writing is, </joey>
<joey> 'cause you know, you're talking about, </joey>
<joey> let's say it's a movie. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - He tries to do it in two hours, </joey>
<joey> what would take essentially a lifetime to build up? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - The reason it's so crippling in real life </garnt>
<garnt> and it hurts so much, </garnt>
<garnt> is because if it's your friend and it happens at 20. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, alright, well you have 20 years </garnt>
<connor> of being their friend. </connor>
<connor> And now it feels like it's being robbed. </connor>
<connor> So I feel like it's almost impossible </connor>
<connor> to portray it in a way that will give you the same emotion. </connor>
<joey> I think it can give you a sense of empathy </joey>
<joey> in a very deep way, </joey>
<joey> but nowhere near can it compare to the feeling </joey>
<connor> that you might feel if you go through it? </connor>
<connor> I think. - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Well, I think one of the biggest, not issues, </garnt>
<garnt> but one of the biggest hurdles </garnt>
<garnt> between communicating your experiences </garnt>
<connor> to an audience member or to someone </connor>
<connor> who hasn't experienced the same thing as you, </connor>
<connor> is that there is such a massive difference </connor>
<connor> between sympathy and empathy. </connor>
<connor> There'll be people I talk to </connor>
<connor> and they talk about their experiences </connor>
<connor> and I can definitely sympathize </connor>
<connor> with the emotion that they're feeling, </connor>
<connor> but there's also like... </connor>
<connor> do you guys ever feel a connection with someone </connor>
<connor> who has actually shared the same experience with you, </connor>
<connor> the same emotional experience with you? </connor>
<connor> There's a connection there when you share that experience </connor>
<connor> that cannot be replicated </connor>
<connor> no matter how much other people </connor>
<connor> will try to understand you </connor>
<connor> and try to understand your feelings </connor>
<connor> and everything like that. </connor>
<connor> There is a feeling that cannot be replicated </connor>
<connor> without the same empathy. </connor>
<connor> To me there's something special </connor>
<connor> about being able to communicate that empathy </connor>
<connor> through fictional media. Right? </connor>
<connor> 'Cause there are some times where I watch a film </connor>
<connor> and I feel something that's not just, </connor>
<connor> "Hey, you should cry or you should feel this </connor>
<connor> because this character went through that. </connor>
<connor> It's wow, I really feel like an actual connection </connor>
<connor> with the creator now </connor>
<connor> because he's portraying an emotion </connor>
<connor> that I know is impossible to depict </connor>
<connor> unless you have been through that exact experience. </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And I'm trying to feel, </connor>
<connor> I'm trying to think of when was the latest time, </connor>
<connor> I mean off the top of my head, </connor>
<garnt> I think of "Evangelion", right, </garnt>
<garnt> why I have such a close, emotional connection to that. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's so weird for me with "Ava" </garnt>
<garnt> because I've watched "Ava" in several stages of my life. </garnt>
<garnt> And the reason it's the most important for me </garnt>
<garnt> was because there was a point </garnt>
<garnt> where I felt like I was going through </garnt>
<garnt> the exact same emotions the creator was, </garnt>
<garnt> and this is going on a complete fucking tangent, by the way. </garnt>
<garnt> And yeah, I guess to me, that's why, </garnt>
<garnt> going on a different tangent, </garnt>
<garnt> that's why media is such a big part of my life </garnt>
<garnt> and why I'm a fucking anime YouTuber, I guess, </garnt>
<garnt> is because, I guess, that's what I search for in media, </garnt>
<garnt> which is not just to be entertained, </garnt>
<garnt> but this connection with a person and a creator. </garnt>
<garnt> And that's why I try to make content. </garnt>
<garnt> And I dunno where to go from there, but that was- </garnt>
<joey> - Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk. </joey>
<garnt> - Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk. Wow. </garnt>
<garnt> I guess this is where you go </garnt>
<garnt> from talking about people dying from cancer, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Where do you go from here? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, I dunno. </joey>
<joey> It's tough because I think the one emotion </joey>
<joey> that I personally feel </joey>
<connor> when it comes to real life situations and stuff like that, </connor>
<connor> it's not even like... </connor>
<connor> 'cause you know, when you're watching media </connor>
<connor> that revolves around a death of a character, </connor>
<connor> in any situation, most people think of sadness. </connor>
<connor> You know, like a depression or some rooted emotion. </connor>
<connor> People who have experienced, at least for me, </connor>
<connor> when I experience a real death that happened </connor>
<connor> you don't feel anything. </connor>
<connor> It's like you feel empty. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And I think this feeling of emptiness </connor>
<connor> is extremely difficult to portray in fiction. </connor>
<garnt> Because it's like, how do you try to show </garnt>
<garnt> or evoke an emotion that is not an emotion? </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> 'Cause I remember when one of my friends from high school, </connor>
<connor> he unfortunately passed away very suddenly </connor>
<connor> from an illness. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Right. </connor>
<connor> - You know, I had never experienced that. </connor>
<connor> That was the first time I had experienced death </connor>
<connor> in a close, like a real death in a close vicinity. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yep. </connor>
<connor> - And it was so weird because you know, </connor>
<connor> media and people who haven't experienced that </connor>
<connor> would lead you to believe that you go to a funeral. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - And everyone's crying. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. - And everyone's sad. </connor>
<connor> And I thought I was the weird one </connor>
<connor> because I didn't cry at his funeral. </connor>
<garnt> And I was like, "Am I weird? Am I being desensitized?" </garnt>
<garnt> I should be sad. I should be crying. </garnt>
<garnt> I should be grieving, you know, all that kind of stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> And not to say that I wasn't. </garnt>
<garnt> But I think because I'd never experienced </garnt>
<garnt> anything like that before. </garnt>
<garnt> That's when I realized I was like, "Oh, I'm feeling empty." </garnt>
<connor> Because that, it's beyond sadness. It's beyond grief. </connor>
<connor> And it was almost this weird thing </connor>
<joey> where I didn't start crying about his death </joey>
<joey> until I got home. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] That was- </joey>
<joey> - And that's when it hit. </joey>
<garnt> - That was the exact same experience </garnt>
<connor> I had with my grandma as well. </connor>
<connor> At the funeral, I was just like, </connor>
<garnt> "Am I broken? Am I a broken human being?" </garnt>
<garnt> I feel nothing. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's like, I should be crying right now. </garnt>
<garnt> You hear back on like, you know, </garnt>
<connor> I was hearing back on my friend's life </connor>
<connor> and hearing speeches from my classmates and whatnot. </connor>
<connor> And I was just like, "Why am I not crying? Am I weird?" </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And then it's like, you grieve, everyone's sad. </connor>
<connor> And then I went home and I remember, </connor>
<connor> I went into my room and I lay on the bed </connor>
<connor> and then I just broke down crying. </connor>
<connor> And it's like, "Oh, that's what that feeling is." </connor>
<connor> And it's like, </connor>
<connor> I personally have never seen a piece of fiction </connor>
<connor> that can properly evoke that emotion. </connor>
<connor> Like it's, I don't know, it's weird to say. </connor>
<connor> It's not like it's faking an emotion </connor>
<garnt> or anything like that, when it comes to fiction. </garnt>
<garnt> I wouldn't say it's like... it's not the correct emotion. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. I feel. </garnt>
<garnt> - And I think that's just because </garnt>
<connor> it's just so incredibly difficult to show that real emotion, </connor>
<connor> especially when it's with a bunch of characters </connor>
<connor> that you didn't spend your entire </connor>
<joey> fucking high school life with. </joey>
<garnt> - Exactly, so like personal question. </garnt>
<garnt> What's the most you've ever cried </garnt>
<garnt> to a piece of fiction at all? </garnt>
<joey> - The most? - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Probably the second half of "Clannad: After Story" </joey>
<joey> The last six episodes, I was like... </joey>
<garnt> Episode 14, 15, I'm obviously not gonna spoil it. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - Around episode 14, 15 of "Clannad: After Story" </garnt>
<garnt> something happens, and it's like, you break down crying. </garnt>
<connor> And you think to yourself, </connor>
<connor> "Okay, it's all out of my system." </connor>
<connor> And then the next episode starts </connor>
<connor> and it's just like, fuck man, why? </connor>
<garnt> And then it's just that, </garnt>
<garnt> for the rest of the episodes until it's over, </garnt>
<joey> and you're just a fucking mess. </joey>
<connor> - I just cry at everything. </connor>
<connor> A lot of (indistinct), stuff that isn't even sad, I cry. </connor>
<connor> - Like what? </connor>
<connor> - I don't know. </connor>
<connor> Becky will be fighting, and I'll hear my name </connor>
<connor> and I'll just start crying. </connor>
<connor> (both laugh) </connor>
<connor> Yeah, it depends on my mood, right. </connor>
<connor> Some days I'm like a fucking rock and it's like, </connor>
<garnt> it could be like the worst thing on earth and I'll be like. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's really weird 'cause I've found myself, </garnt>
<garnt> and I think this is healthy </garnt>
<garnt> because I found myself more easily crying </garnt>
<joey> towards pieces of media and fictional pieces of media </joey>
<joey> now than I did like five- </joey>
<connor> - Oh God, yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Five years ago? - I cry at everything. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> And I thing the one that broke the camels back </joey>
<connor> was like, "Anohana". </connor>
<connor> - I cried a lot at "Anohana". </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I think before "Anohana", </connor>
<garnt> I don't think I had ever cried watching an anime. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm trying to think back. - For me it was weird. </garnt>
<connor> It's like very early on when I was watching a lot of anime, </connor>
<connor> 'cause I think I first cried at "Clannad" </connor>
<garnt> and then it was just like a chain reaction of like... </garnt>
<garnt> and then I watched "Anohana" and then I watched "Air" </garnt>
<garnt> and then I watch all these shows that made you cry. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And then for a while I had this blank period where I- </garnt>
<connor> - It's 'cause you exhausted yourself. </connor>
<connor> - Maybe, and then the one that broke the camels back </connor>
<garnt> for me was "Maquia". </garnt>
<garnt> - "Maquia", ah. </garnt>
<garnt> - "Angel Beats" made me cry a lot. </garnt>
<connor> - "Angel Beats" made me cry, but I didn't cry. </connor>
<connor> There was so many sad shows that people would like cry. </connor>
<garnt> I didn't cry at the end of "Your lie in April", </garnt>
<garnt> even though a lot of people did. </garnt>
<garnt> - I didn't either. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know, and I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Am I weird for thinking that? </garnt>
<garnt> Am I just like overexposed to this kind of media?" </garnt>
<connor> And then I watched "Maquia" on a fucking plane, </connor>
<connor> tiny screen like this with shitty headphones. </connor>
<connor> - Crying in warm pee. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> And crying to three pixels, and I was like... </connor>
<garnt> And then the ending to that just destroyed me. </garnt>
<joey> I was like, "Why is it this one </joey>
<joey> that made me cry after all this time?" </joey>
<garnt> - It's weird because before, anytime I would cry, </garnt>
<garnt> just cry towards something, </garnt>
<connor> that thing would be really, really fucking special </connor>
<connor> to break down the brick wall that I am. </connor>
<connor> But nowadays- - You stone of a man. </connor>
<connor> The obelisk known as Garnt's emotions. </connor>
<garnt> - Exactly, but nowadays, because I cry way more easily. </garnt>
<garnt> I dunno, it's weird, sometimes I have empty cries </garnt>
<garnt> where I cry and I'm just like, it's over, </garnt>
<connor> and then I feel nothing. </connor>
<connor> It's just like, I dunno, it's weird. </connor>
<garnt> - I'm like, I cry and I feel amazing. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah, right. </garnt>
<garnt> - I just do it. - It's like a release. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like I order a McDonald's the other day, </garnt>
<connor> and I was like, "Why did I do this?", I cried. </connor>
<garnt> - I fucking cried to "Demon Slayer" </garnt>
<connor> And I'm just like, "Why did I fucking cry..." </connor>
<connor> - I get it, I get it, I get it. </connor>
<connor> The moment I feel sad, I'm just like, (imitates crying). </connor>
<joey> (Joey imitates crying) </joey>
<connor> (Garnt imitates crying) </connor>
<connor> - I just get it over with man. I just do it. </connor>
<joey> - Have you ever had those cries though, </joey>
<connor> where it doesn't feel like you've released? </connor>
<connor> Where you just feel shittier? </connor>
<connor> - Are we talking about edging with tears? </connor>
<connor> - Not edging, you cry and then you- </connor>
<connor> - And then I climax with tears? </connor>
<connor> - No, there's those times where, you know, </connor>
<connor> you'd watch something really sad </connor>
<connor> and then you just let the emotions out. </connor>
<connor> And then after your tears have subsided, </connor>
<connor> you're just like, "Whew. All right. I'm glad that's out." </connor>
<connor> You know, I feel good. </connor>
<connor> All of my emotions, all my emotional baggage is out. </connor>
<connor> And then there are some times where you would start crying, </connor>
<connor> and then once the tears have subsided, </connor>
<joey> you're just like, "Man, now I'm more sad </joey>
<connor> than I was before I started crying." </connor>
<connor> - That's like when I was 15 with breakups. </connor>
<garnt> I'd cry and I'd feel worse. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, yeah yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Why did she leave me? (imitates crying) </garnt>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> And you know, getting back to funerals. </connor>
<connor> I wouldn't... like even if I wasn't, </connor>
<connor> 'cause you know, sometimes when you're like 10, </connor>
<connor> you didn't really understand what's going on. </connor>
<joey> And then maybe when you get older, </joey>
<joey> you're like 15, 16 and it's like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, it's this person that you barely ever met, </joey>
<joey> but you have to 'cause you're all connected." </joey>
<joey> I wouldn't know them so I wasn't sad, </joey>
<joey> but I would just get, I would just cry, </joey>
<joey> 'cause I'm like, "Why is everyone crying? This is so sad." </joey>
<joey> - Aw. </joey>
<joey> You cry because everyone around you is crying. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, 'cause if everyone else is crying around me, </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "Fuck, well I gotta do it now." </joey>
<garnt> Like a psychopath, like Mark Zuckerberg. </garnt>
<connor> - This is human emotion, I must cry now. </connor>
<garnt> - Sad.exe. </garnt>
<connor> - There something about being around people who, </connor>
<connor> when a room is filled with sad energy, </connor>
<connor> it just makes me get like that. </connor>
<joey> - It depends for me, because say for example, </joey>
<joey> like the "Demon Slayer" movie, </joey>
<joey> everyone was crying like fucking crazy at the end of that. </joey>
<connor> And I'm looking around like, </connor>
<connor> "Oh, it's now. I have to cry now." </connor>
<joey> I can't get the tears out right now. </joey>
<garnt> - Like to me, I cannot cry to a piece of media, </garnt>
<connor> if there's someone else in the room. </connor>
<connor> Like, there's... </connor>
<garnt> - I can't show the manly tears. </garnt>
<connor> - Wait, wait. Sydney as well? </connor>
<garnt> - Huh? - Sydney as well? </garnt>
<connor> - Especially Sydney. - What? </connor>
<joey> - Really? - Do you know why? </joey>
<garnt> - 'Cause she'll be like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh baby man, you want a little." (imitates crying) </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no, no, no, no, no. </garnt>
<garnt> Because, 10 minutes before the tears </garnt>
<connor> even start forming in my eyes, </connor>
<connor> she's bawling her eyes out already. </connor>
<connor> She is, Sydney's... </connor>
<connor> - You're on cleanup duty. - Yeah yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Sydney is so emotionally receptive, </connor>
<connor> that she will start crying five minutes </connor>
<connor> before the sad moments happen and she'll be like in tears. </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> If I'm watching with Sydney, I am on emotional cleanup duty. </joey>
<joey> I'm like, "Oh, it's okay baby. Don't worry." </joey>
<garnt> I'm like, baby, I didn't even get my point. </garnt>
<garnt> I didn't even like... </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, I guess you can't really be like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh baby, are you okay?" (imitates crying) </joey>
<joey> Hold on, gimme a second. (imitates crying) </joey>
<connor> - You've heard about relationships </connor>
<connor> where the guy comes too fast and then it ruins it. </connor>
<connor> What about the one who cries too fast? </connor>
<joey> I can't get my tears in. </joey>
<connor> She's already decided it's over before I've even started. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause I remember, </connor>
<connor> "Your Name", I cried like a fucking baby, </connor>
<connor> the first time I watched "Your Name". </connor>
<connor> And it wasn't even because it was sad. </connor>
<connor> "Your Name" was to me, </connor>
<connor> the reason it's one of my favorite anime films </connor>
<connor> is 'cause to me it's like the perfect cinema experience </connor>
<garnt> where there are so many things happening on screen </garnt>
<garnt> that there's so many emotions </garnt>
<garnt> that I just get so absorbed </garnt>
<garnt> that my body doesn't know how to react, </garnt>
<garnt> other than just crying. </garnt>
<connor> Sometimes I get emotional </connor>
<garnt> and I don't know what to do with it, and I cry. </garnt>
<connor> - It's like an overwhelmed cry. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's like an overwhelmed cry. </garnt>
<joey> - Music normally does that for me? </joey>
<joey> I fucking cry at like an E key. I don't know. </joey>
<joey> It's always the music for me. </joey>
<joey> - First note to "Black Parade". (imitates crying) </joey>
<connor> - That is the music, the music will make me cry instantly. </connor>
<connor> Like "My Hero Academia". </connor>
<connor> I don't know why I tear up whenever I fucking hear </connor>
<connor> "You Say Run" with (indistinct) screaming. </connor>
<garnt> I'm like, "Why, what's going on?" </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I don't- - Really? </connor>
<connor> - It's like I've been programmed to a certain tune, </connor>
<connor> I'm like, (imitates crying) </connor>
<connor> - It's like Pavlov. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah yeah, yeah, I am literally like a fucking dog. </connor>
<garnt> - And so I remember second time </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause the first time I went by myself. </garnt>
<connor> - Sorry Mark Zuckerberg, by the way, watching this. </connor>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<connor> I know you normally like these segments. </connor>
<connor> I know you can't relate to this. Sorry. </connor>
<garnt> - So the first time I went by myself </garnt>
<garnt> and the second time I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> "Sydney, you gotta see this film." </garnt>
<garnt> It's fucking, fucking amazing film, </garnt>
<joey> gotta come see it with me." </joey>
<joey> And I remember, it was the moment </joey>
<joey> just before Radwimps start playing, </joey>
<joey> and that is the moment where I start crying. </joey>
<connor> And I remember sitting in this film </connor>
<connor> and it was the second time, </connor>
<connor> I was getting as emotional, I was getting as into it, </connor>
<connor> I was like getting absorbed and I'm like, (imitates crying) </connor>
<connor> "It's coming, it's coming. Radwimps about to play." </connor>
<connor> And then like a minute before they start playing, </connor>
<garnt> I'm just hear, (imitates crying) next to me. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, "Oh God." </garnt>
<garnt> And it just took me out, I'm like... </garnt>
<connor> of course, it's Sydney balling her eyes out. </connor>
<connor> But yeah, that's why, as much as I love Sydney </connor>
<connor> if I'm watching a sad thing, </connor>
<connor> if I want to have an emotional release, </connor>
<connor> I cannot watch it with her in the room. </connor>
<connor> - It's like, "Shut the fuck up". </connor>
<connor> - I'm like, "Sydney, can you stop being emotional </connor>
<connor> for one second?" </connor>
<garnt> - Did you watch his new movie? </garnt>
<garnt> - His, "Weathering with You"? </garnt>
<joey> - Oh, "Weathering with You". </joey>
<joey> Yeah, "Weathering with You" </joey>
<connor> - "Weathering with you"? Yes, I did watch it. </connor>
<connor> - Did you cry? </connor>
<garnt> - I did not cry at that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Did you cry at, who's the other director who's good? </garnt>
<garnt> - Mamoru Hosoda. - Mamoru Hosoda </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, what's his? "Belle". </connor>
<garnt> - I thought "Belle" was okay. </garnt>
<connor> (Joey gasps) </connor>
<joey> It was... </joey>
<joey> - Would you say it was mid? </joey>
<joey> - Okay, here's... </joey>
<joey> - I watched it by the way. </joey>
<joey> - You watched it? </joey>
<joey> - I haven't seen it yet. </joey>
<garnt> - What did you think of it? </garnt>
<garnt> Okay, did you watch it in cinemas? </garnt>
<garnt> - No. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay, I feel like that's a movie </garnt>
<garnt> you have to experience in cinemas </garnt>
<garnt> because everyone I've talked to who has seen "Belle", </garnt>
<garnt> they've talked about how it's a fucking incredible </garnt>
<garnt> cinema experience with the sound and the music. </garnt>
<garnt> There are definitely scenes in "Belle" </garnt>
<garnt> where I'm like, "I get that". </garnt>
<garnt> It feels like, especially with the musical scenes, </garnt>
<garnt> the musical numbers, it feels like these scenes </garnt>
<garnt> were made to be experienced in a theater, </garnt>
<garnt> with the surrounds sound and everything. </garnt>
<garnt> In terms of the plots and everything else, </garnt>
<garnt> it was not his greatest movie, in my opinion. </garnt>
<joey> - Was it one of those movies though, </joey>
<joey> that it was like cry bait? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So it was like the... because that's the thing. </connor>
<connor> - I felt like it didn't earn it. </connor>
<connor> - But that's the thing is like, </connor>
<connor> sometimes it's so weird with fiction </connor>
<connor> that is obvious cry bait. </connor>
<garnt> Where it's like, sometimes, </garnt>
<garnt> yes, I will buy into the cry bait very happily. </garnt>
<garnt> Thank you very much. </garnt>
<connor> And then there are other times where it's like, </connor>
<connor> "Okay, you don't have to push this in my face this much. </connor>
<joey> I'll cry when I wanna cry or if I can cry." </joey>
<connor> - They have a digital world in the show and a movie. </connor>
<connor> I just wasn't invested in this world. </connor>
<connor> I just didn't think it was like, </connor>
<connor> I couldn't see it being a thing or why people would care, </connor>
<joey> 'cause it was like, we're just gonna make an online world </joey>
<joey> where you can be anything except you can't </joey>
<connor> and your avatars chosen for you, and also, </connor>
<connor> there seems to be like a class system </connor>
<connor> where some people are more important </connor>
<joey> than others in this world. </joey>
<joey> - Why does that just sound like "Summer Wars"? </joey>
<joey> - And I was like this is- </joey>
<connor> - It is exactly "Summer Wars". </connor>
<garnt> - Oh, okay. - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - I was like, how do you know it's a Hosoda Mamoru movie? </connor>
<joey> - He's made the same movie again, </joey>
<connor> with "Beauty and the Beast" this time. </connor>
<connor> - Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it was "Beauty and the Beast". </connor>
<garnt> That's what I was also like, what's this? </garnt>
<connor> I wasn't... It was okay. </connor>
<garnt> - It was okay. </garnt>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<garnt> I agree with you. </garnt>
<joey> - You know what I watched in the cinema? </joey>
<joey> - What? - The Batman. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, how was it? </joey>
<garnt> - Very, very good. - Really? </garnt>
<joey> - Have you watched it yet? </joey>
<garnt> - No, no yet. - Was it three hours? </garnt>
<connor> - Yes. </connor>
<garnt> - Okay. - And I loved it. </garnt>
<garnt> - How was Robert Pattinson in it? </garnt>
<garnt> - Delightful, just a treat. - Yeah? </garnt>
<garnt> - What a great guy, what a great guy. </garnt>
<connor> - What a bloke. </connor>
<joey> - I saw a meme the other day. </joey>
<joey> It was like 2010, women fawning over Robert Pattinson. </joey>
<joey> It was like 2020, men fawning over Robert Pattinson. </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> It's so true, dude. </joey>
<garnt> - Hell yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - It's good, it's a good movie, it's good movie. </connor>
<garnt> - Is it a good movie or is it a good Batman movie? </garnt>
<connor> - I think it's not that much of a Batman movie. </connor>
<connor> - Really? - Really? </connor>
<connor> - I'd give it an 8.5. </connor>
<garnt> - Because I'm like one of the weird people </garnt>
<connor> who really don't give that much of a shit about Batman. </connor>
<garnt> I don't know, to me, it's just... </garnt>
<connor> - I really like this portrayal by Robert Pattinson. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. - I thought- </joey>
<joey> - Is it kind of more like... </joey>
<connor> Is it kinda more like on the Joker side of storytelling? </connor>
<connor> - No, no. </connor>
<connor> - Or is it more like a Batman being- </connor>
<connor> - Oh, oh, well I suppose, </connor>
<joey> if that's the scale that we're going with, </joey>
<joey> I guess it would lean more towards the Joker side. </joey>
<joey> - Okay. Okay. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - But I wouldn't compare it to the Joker either. </joey>
<joey> It's more like they clearly wanna tell Batman as a character </joey>
<connor> through this kind of somewhat realistic lens </connor>
<connor> of like, if Batman was a real person, </connor>
<joey> he would be a fucking weirdo. </joey>
<joey> - More like a human drama side of things. </joey>
<connor> - Well it's kind of detective movie, but also, </connor>
<connor> they don't shy away from showing Batman as being, </connor>
<connor> having a lot of issues. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Like the man's got problems. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - You know, and... </joey>
<joey> - More money, more problems. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, dude. </joey>
<joey> I liked the villain. I thought it was pretty good. </joey>
<joey> - The Riddler this time. - The Riddler. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, it's Riddler, oh shit. </joey>
<joey> - I thought they had a good, </joey>
<joey> a really interesting take on the Riddler that I liked. </joey>
<garnt> I just had fun. </garnt>
<garnt> I was there for three hours. </garnt>
<garnt> Maybe towards the end, </garnt>
<garnt> I felt like it could have hurried up a little bit, </garnt>
<garnt> but overall I wasn't bored, I really enjoyed it. </garnt>
<connor> I had a great time. </connor>
<joey> - I'm interested to see what Riddler is like </joey>
<joey> in a movie of that caliber, </joey>
<connor> because to me, the Riddler is Jim Carrey. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> - It's literally the opposite. </connor>
<joey> - It is opposite. Okay, okay. </joey>
<joey> - I think you'd both like it if you watched it. </joey>
<garnt> - I'm sure I would, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - And it's a great cinema experience. </connor>
<connor> It was fucking... </connor>
<connor> - The thing that's always wondered me about the Riddler </connor>
<joey> is how the fuck would that work in the age of Google? </joey>
<joey> You know, the Riddler comes up with a riddle or something </joey>
<connor> and Batman's like, "Hold on a second. </connor>
<garnt> Okay, I got the answer now. I got the answer." </garnt>
<garnt> - I think I saw that in a Buzzfeed article once. </garnt>
<garnt> (all laugh) </garnt>
<joey> - It's like the one YouTube short </joey>
<garnt> that he watched the other day. </garnt>
<garnt> And he's just like, "I remember that one. </garnt>
<garnt> I know the answer to that one." </garnt>
<joey> - Oh fuck, I would look it up, </joey>
<garnt> I would show you on TikTok, </garnt>
<joey> but it's the algorithm's so shit. </joey>
<connor> - The only issue with the movie is that I wish </connor>
<connor> Robert Pattinson was just out of the costume more. </connor>
<connor> He's just so good, why- </connor>
<joey> - Does he do the gravelly, like "I'm Batman"? </joey>
<connor> - Oh yeah, he does, yeah. - Oh, okay. </connor>
<garnt> - He's pretty good at it. - Oh, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - He's just really good at doing voices in general, </garnt>
<garnt> actually. </garnt>
<garnt> - He's just a good actor. - He's a good actor. </garnt>
<connor> - Right? - Definitely. </connor>
<connor> - I watched "Good Time" again after. </connor>
<connor> I was like, you gotta watch "Good Time". </connor>
<connor> It's so good. </connor>
<connor> Please watch "Good Time", it's so good. </connor>
<joey> - This episode is sponsored by Harry's. </joey>
<joey> - As you guys know from all the other </joey>
<joey> Harry's ad reads we've done, I use Harry's. </joey>
<joey> It's the only razor I use when I wanna shave my face. </joey>
<joey> It's the only razor I trust </joey>
<connor> that actually does a clean shave, </connor>
<connor> even after the first few times you've used it, </connor>
<connor> unlike the other razors that I've used in the past. </connor>
<connor> So much so, that when I went to the UK, </connor>
<connor> I brought a suitcase full of Harry's back to Japan </connor>
<connor> 'cause you can't get it here. </connor>
<garnt> - And new customers can redeem </garnt>
<garnt> Harry's trial set for just $3 </garnt>
<garnt> when you go to harrys.com/trashtaste. </garnt>
<joey> - Harry's believes you shouldn't have to choose </joey>
<joey> between a close, comfortable shave and a fair price. </joey>
<joey> So they give you both. - [Both] Both? </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] In fact, Harry's blades </joey>
<joey> are designed to stay sharp longer. </joey>
<joey> In a recent study, guys who shaved four times a week </joey>
<joey> said their eighth shave was as smooth as their first. </joey>
<connor> - What are you waiting for? </connor>
<connor> Harry's is giving their best offers to you guys, </connor>

<joey> to protect your blades when you're on the go. </joey>
<joey> That's a $13 value for just $3. </joey>

<connor> - $3. - Back to the episode. </connor>
<connor> - It's $3. - Back to the episode. </connor>
<garnt> - I can't think of, </garnt>
<connor> has there ever been a Batman that I thought was interesting? </connor>
<connor> 'Cause before the, okay, </connor>
<connor> I feel like before "The Dark Knight Rises", </connor>
<connor> Batman just had an awful streak of just bad movies </connor>
<connor> and that just made his... </connor>
<connor> - With DC in general. - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Come on, mate, you don't like the George Clooney Batman? </joey>
<garnt> - What, with the fucking Bat credit card </garnt>
<connor> and the fucking Bat nipples and all that fucking shit. </connor>
<connor> Even the best thing about that </connor>
<joey> was fucking Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze. </joey>
<joey> - Ice to meet you. </joey>
<connor> - Ice to meet you. </connor>
<connor> - I just feel like for the longest time </connor>
<connor> Batman was just either a boring or comical character to me </connor>
<joey> and the most interesting characters </joey>
<joey> were the villains of Batman. </joey>
<joey> - [Joey] Yeah yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - The only time I thought Batman </joey>
<joey> was an interesting character </joey>
<joey> was actually during the animated series. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, very, very good. </joey>
<garnt> - That was peak Batman for me. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, definitely. </joey>
<joey> - Have you seen the animated series? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I love the animated series. </joey>
<garnt> - How does this compare to the animated series, then? </garnt>
<garnt> 'Cause that, to me, that is good Batman. </garnt>
<connor> - It's a different experience there entirely. </connor>
<connor> I feel like it's hard to compare them both </connor>
<connor> when they're both trying to do wildly different things. </connor>
<garnt> - Right. </garnt>
<connor> - I think. </connor>
<connor> That's also so good 'cause Mark Hamill </connor>
<connor> is the Joker in that, he's amazing. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. Yeah. - Yeah yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Fucking so good. </connor>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<joey> I don't feel comfortable comparing it, almost. </joey>
<joey> I feel like it's not fair. </joey>
<joey> - It's apples and oranges. - Not a fair fight. </joey>
<joey> I think you should just watch it. You won't regret it. </joey>
<joey> Just watch it. - Conclusion, watch it. </joey>
<garnt> - Genuinely, it's definitely... </garnt>
<connor> - No, I want to, I definitely wanna. </connor>
<connor> - This is just Connor talking about media in general. </connor>
<connor> Go on, Connor, sell me on it. </connor>
<connor> - Oh. - Just watch it. </connor>
<connor> - No, there's a lot of stuff I'll tell you not to watch, </connor>
<connor> if I don't think it's worth your time. </connor>
<connor> This however is worth your time. </connor>
<garnt> - Did you play the "Batman Arkham" games as well? </garnt>
<connor> - I loved the "Batman Arkham" saga games, dude. </connor>
<garnt> - My God, a story based game that you play. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was hardly story. </garnt>
<connor> The combat was fun and punching, exploring and stuff. </connor>
<connor> - That's true, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know what the story was. </connor>
<connor> I know Joker was- </connor>
<connor> (both laugh) </connor>
<garnt> - God dammit, I thought we had one thing </garnt>
<connor> in common for once when- </connor>
<connor> - He's got goopy gamer brain. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah, goopy gamer brain. </connor>
<joey> - I liked it, and there was also the combat trials. </joey>
<joey> That shit was fun as fuck. </joey>
<joey> - You did the combat trials? </joey>
<garnt> - Because I was like... </garnt>
<garnt> I was addicted to getting all the achievements on Xbox. </garnt>
<garnt> - Wait, you did side stories? </garnt>
<connor> - Well, no, so I was obsessed with gamer score. </connor>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - That's like the last thing I do. </garnt>
<garnt> I hate it when there is like a fucking, </garnt>
<connor> when there's a point in the game </connor>
<garnt> where you can like do a trial for the combat </garnt>
<connor> or one of the game mechanics. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Get this shit outta my face. I don't wanna- </connor>
<connor> - No, me too, me too. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - Unless there's achievements. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well. </garnt>
<garnt> - Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - So you're an achievement hunter. </garnt>
<connor> - I was, I was an achievement hunter. </connor>
<garnt> So here's what happened, right. </garnt>
<connor> When I first got my Xbox </connor>
<connor> and I discovered these achievement things, </connor>
<connor> I thought, "Oh well that's pretty cool." </connor>
<connor> That's a pretty cool thing to strive towards. </connor>
<connor> And then my friend was an achievement hunter </connor>
<connor> and I was like, "I wanna be better than him at this"." </connor>
<connor> And so I was like, "Well, I'm gonna start doing it. </connor>
<connor> And then I got kind of addicted to it. </connor>
<connor> I would research games that were easy </connor>
<connor> to get all of the achievements on, </connor>
<garnt> and then buy them and do them </garnt>
<garnt> just to get the achievement score. </garnt>
<garnt> I had like 60,000 gamer score or something. </garnt>
<garnt> You could only get about a thousand a game normally. </garnt>
<garnt> So I had, but you got DLC for some stuff as well. </garnt>
<connor> I bought, "Lost", the game, like this TV show "Lost" </connor>
<connor> specifically because you could get </connor>
<joey> all the achievements in like two hours. </joey>
<connor> - Really? - Yeah, I don't know why. </connor>
<connor> - You just speed ran it? </connor>
<connor> - I was absolutely addicted to getting these achievements </connor>
<connor> and "Arkham Asylum" was one of them I got 100% on. </connor>
<garnt> And it was really hard </garnt>
<connor> because you had to do one of the trials </connor>
<connor> and maintain a combo of like a hundred or something. </connor>
<garnt> I can't remember what it was. </garnt>
<connor> I remember it took a lot of attempts. </connor>
<garnt> - You also had to collect all the- </garnt>
<connor> - All the trophies. </connor>
<garnt> - All the fucking Riddler trophies. </garnt>
<garnt> - Did all of that, and there was also, </garnt>
<garnt> you had to do all the stealth missions perfectly as well, </garnt>
<garnt> Or something like that, I can't remember exactly. </garnt>
<connor> I remember it was really hard getting all the achievements, </connor>
<connor> but that was such a good game, </connor>
<connor> that I didn't mind doing it. </connor>
<garnt> - When was the last time you did that then? </garnt>
<connor> - Achievement collectors? - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Not since I was like, oh, 18, 19. </connor>
<connor> When I went to university and I had less time, </connor>
<garnt> kind of realized that, that wasn't that fun? </garnt>
<garnt> - It's not fun, it's not fun. </garnt>
<garnt> - I had gotten one of the hardest achievements on Xbox, </garnt>
<joey> ever. - Right. </joey>
<connor> - Which is like staying alive on "Dead Rising" for- </connor>
<joey> - Oh, for seven days straight. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> - [Garnt] You did that? </joey>
<garnt> - No, not that one. </garnt>
<garnt> It was another "Dead Rising" one. </garnt>
<joey> Not the seven day one. </joey>
<joey> - What makes it so hard? </joey>
<connor> - Wait, that's on the first game, right? </connor>
<joey> - That's "Dead Rising 1". </joey>
<connor> - I've done all of them on "Dead Rising 2". </connor>
<joey> - Oh shit. </joey>
<joey> - Which is I think... </joey>
<joey> no, they have like kill 1 million zombies </joey>
<joey> or something stupid. - Right, right. </joey>
<connor> - Sorry, another three days on, my mom would've killed me. </connor>
<joey> - You had to be, that that one was, </joey>
<connor> you had to be alive in like hardcore, </connor>
<connor> "Dead Rising Analyst" for seven real days, </connor>
<garnt> like in the real world. </garnt>
<garnt> - How do you get that? - What was the other one? </garnt>
<connor> - You'd have to go in shifts, </connor>
<garnt> surely, with other people, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - What was the one I did on... </garnt>
<garnt> All of them on "Dead Rising 2" are really hard. </garnt>
<joey> I remember that took so long. </joey>
<joey> - That's just like a difficult game. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, there's some games that, you know what? </joey>
<garnt> Oh, maybe this is why I hate JRPGs. </garnt>
<garnt> JRPGs always had the hardest achievements. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yep, they did. - Hands down, the most. </garnt>
<connor> And they had the most cruelest ones where like, </connor>
<connor> get this item, that if you miss it, </connor>
<connor> you can't go back and get it. Fuck you. </connor>
<garnt> So that's I think that is what, genuinely, </garnt>
<garnt> stopped me from ever buying a JRPG, for a long time. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause, people have to be psychopaths. </garnt>
<connor> - You do, you have to psychopaths. </connor>
<connor> - 100%, to do JRPGs. - You do. </connor>
<connor> - We're looking at you, Joe. </connor>
<garnt> Well, to be fair, how many times </garnt>
<garnt> did you have to play "Persona 5" before you 100%- </garnt>
<joey> - Like six times. - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<joey> - But I also 100% at "Final Fantasy VII Remake" as well. </joey>
<joey> - Oh my. </joey>
<garnt> Well that one's not too bad, I guess. </garnt>
<joey> - That one's not too bad. </joey>
<joey> - Because I feel like that's a third of the original game. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly, exactly. </joey>
<joey> - I wouldn't dare do it with the original. </joey>
<joey> - Oh no. - No, no, no, fuck that. </joey>
<joey> - I feel like they've become a lot more accommodating </joey>
<joey> in these modern times, - Yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Compared to like OG JRPG games </garnt>
<garnt> where they assume that that's the only game </garnt>
<garnt> you're playing for the entire year. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, they just assume that's the only game </joey>
<joey> you have on that console. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, and it's just gonna last you </garnt>
<garnt> the entire fucking time. - Exactly, exactly. </garnt>
<connor> - I'm trying to find my Xbox profile </connor>
<connor> so I can see what I've done. </connor>
<connor> I think it's this one? </connor>
<joey> - Isn't the hardest Xbox achievement </joey>
<connor> the fucking "Mega Man 9" one? </connor>
<connor> - What's that one? - What's that one? </connor>
<connor> - It's the one where you have to beat the entire game </connor>
<joey> without getting hit a single time. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh, so that's just a no hit run, </garnt>
<garnt> but an actual achievement. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, which if you've played any "Mega Man" game </joey>
<joey> is practically fucking impossible. </joey>
<connor> - No, what's the game? </connor>
<connor> One of the Tom Clancy games had an achievement </connor>
<joey> for being the number one ranked player in the world. </joey>
<joey> - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. </joey>
<connor> - No joke. </connor>
<joey> - I remember, I think I saw a WatchMojo video </joey>
<joey> a long time ago, which was like, </joey>
<joey> "The top 10 hardest Xbox achievements". </joey>
<connor> - I was like, top 10 list of games </connor>
<connor> that I'm never gonna buy. </connor>
<connor> And one of them, I already owned, it's like "Gears of War". </connor>
<connor> So it was like, got to get </connor>
<connor> like a hundred thousand online kills. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - In the first game, </connor>
<connor> but no one was playing the first game </connor>
<connor> after the third one came out. </connor>
<garnt> - How would that even be possible? </garnt>
<garnt> Like how much, how many hours- </garnt>
<joey> - You have to go a hundred thousand matches with your mates. </joey>
<garnt> - Right. Right. - No. No, it's kills. </garnt>
<garnt> So you have to be averaging like fucking hundreds. </garnt>
<connor> - It's ridiculous. - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - That is, and "Gears of War" </garnt>
<garnt> is not an easy game to get kills in. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. - So, it's very difficult. </garnt>
<connor> I can find this, I can find it. </connor>
<connor> All right, I've got the list of all of these. </connor>
<connor> Some of these games are just fucking stupid. </connor>
<joey> So, I have 51,000 gamer score in Xbox. Right? </joey>
<joey> - So that's like what? 50 games? 45 Games? </joey>
<joey> - I have every single "C.O.D." game , </joey>
<joey> I have every single achievement. </joey>
<joey> Every single "Halo" game, I have every single achievement. </joey>
<joey> - Of course. - Except for the newer ones. </joey>
<connor> Like, "Halo Wars 2" and "Halo Infinite". </connor>
<joey> I have all of them. </joey>
<joey> I did all of the, I don't know, </joey>
<joey> Did you ever do "Halo"? </joey>
<connor> There was those challenges </connor>
<connor> where you had to do certain things without dying, </connor>
<joey> like the skull ones. </joey>
<joey> I did all of those. </joey>
<connor> - I only played "Halo 1". </connor>
<connor> - I've only played "Halo 1" and "Halo 3" </connor>
<garnt> I didn't play "Halo 2". </garnt>
<connor> - I got every single achievement in "Blue Dragon", </connor>
<joey> which I remember having- - "Blue Dragon"? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - The JRPG? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Oh, shit. </joey>
<joey> - I remember you were talking about "Blue Dragon". </joey>
<joey> - Yeah yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I think... </joey>
<connor> What's this one, what's... </connor>
<connor> Most rare, what's the rarest one? Head trauma. </connor>
<joey> - Every type of melee weapon in his army. </joey>
<connor> - That's so weird, there's like rarity- </connor>
<joey> - That features a lot in "Dead Rising", </joey>
<joey> 'cause everything is a weapon. </joey>
<joey> - I've killed, yeah, okay. </joey>
<joey> Some of these are like really low. </joey>
<garnt> Some funny games I've done. "Dorito's Crash Course 2". </garnt>
<garnt> - What? - I've got all </garnt>
<connor> of the achievements on "Dorito's Crash Course 2". </connor>
<connor> - Why would you buy that game? </connor>
<connor> - It was free. </connor>
<connor> - No, the other question is, why is there two of them? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, it was really popular. (Joey laughs) </connor>
<joey> I've got all the achievements on "Red Dead". </joey>
<joey> I think that wasn't too hard. </joey>
<connor> What else have I done? What weird games are these? </connor>
<garnt> - So like, would you basically do nothing? </garnt>
<connor> Would you basically do nothing </connor>
<connor> until you were 100% at these games? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - I've played- </connor>
<garnt> - "South Park" games. </garnt>
<connor> - I've played the "South Park Tower Defense" game. "Lost". </connor>
<connor> I have "Terminator: Salvation", </connor>
<connor> which I think I got 'cause that was easy. </connor>
<connor> But then it turned out to be really fucking hard. </connor>
<connor> What's weird? What other games do I have here? </connor>
<connor> God, most of these are "C.O.D." and "Assassins Creed". </connor>
<connor> - "Happy Wars"? </connor>
<connor> - I don't even know what that is. </connor>
<connor> I didn't even do that one. </connor>
<connor> That must have been too hard. </connor>
<joey> - Guaca.. Wait, hold on. </joey>
<joey> What was that one out there? </joey>
<joey> "Guacamelee Super Turbo Championship". </joey>
<connor> - Dude, that was a good game, dude. </connor>
<joey> That's a good- - "Guacamelee" </joey>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<connor> - And then other games, I couldn't do them all. </connor>
<connor> They're quite a lot of games, actually. </connor>
<garnt> A lot of the "Gears of Wars" ones were just like fucked. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - "Forza", "Destiny". </garnt>
<connor> Fuck dude, I've played some weird ass games. </connor>
<connor> What's wrong with me? </connor>
<garnt> - Well, I think as a kid, you just played any game </garnt>
<connor> that you could get your hands on. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah yeah, exactly. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And now they're like- - FIFA. </connor>
<garnt> - "FIFA", of course, of course. </garnt>
<connor> - You've got one achievement on "FIFA". </connor>
<connor> - I don't know, I have "FIFA 09". </connor>
<garnt> I got all the achievements on "Halo:Wars", </garnt>
<garnt> which one of them included getting to the highest rank, </garnt>
<garnt> which takes like an absurd amount of hours. </garnt>
<garnt> - Geez. - Stupid amount of hours. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I mean, like. - Stupid amount of hours. </connor>
<connor> - I don't think I've ever got addicted to a game </connor>
<connor> that much that I wanted to 100% it. </connor>
<connor> - [Connor] No way. </connor>
<joey> - 'Cause, I think, the closest I've come, </joey>
<joey> actually, surprisingly, is "Tales of Arise", </joey>
<joey> which was last year. </joey>
<joey> - Oh. - Oh, shit. </joey>
<joey> - It's the first time where I actually </joey>
<joey> did the fishing mini game. </joey>
<connor> 'Cause you know how every game has a fishing mini game. </connor>
<connor> I was like, "What the fuck... who's the fucking </connor>
<connor> what fucking loser plays the fishing mini game? </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, this is actually pretty fucking damn fun. </connor>
<connor> Collecting all the fish. </connor>
<connor> But yeah, I mean, recently I've been playing, </connor>
<connor> "Horizon Forbidden West". </connor>
<connor> I'm like the one fucking person, </connor>
<connor> 'cause everyone's playing "Elden Ring" right now. </connor>
<garnt> And I'm like, I'll get to "Elden Ring" eventually </garnt>
<garnt> after I finish "Horizon Forbidden West". </garnt>
<garnt> And yeah, I mean it's- </garnt>
<joey> - Is there a fishing mini game in that one as well? </joey>
<garnt> - I don't think there is. </garnt>
<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<joey> I was like, I was like... </joey>
<connor> - You're like, God, I wish. </connor>
<connor> - Can you fish in "Elden Ring"? </connor>
<connor> I think so. </connor>
<connor> - I dunno. </connor>
<connor> We're not like dark souls or like souls born. </connor>
<garnt> - I'd like to think there's fishing, </garnt>
<joey> in an ideal world. </joey>
<connor> - We need a Twitter account to be like, </connor>
<joey> "Yes, you can fish in "Elden Ring". </joey>
<garnt> - I feel like it's just every JRPG, right, </garnt>
<joey> that you can fish. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - It's like a staple. </connor>
<garnt> - I dunno how, why did that become a trope? </garnt>
<connor> - Because Japanese people love fishing. </connor>
<garnt> - Do they? </garnt>
<connor> - They love fish. </connor>
<garnt> (Garnt laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - Okay, they love eating fish, that doesn't necessarily- </connor>
<connor> - They don't like catching it, though. </connor>
<connor> - A nation of fisherman. </connor>
<garnt> - By the same logic, </garnt>
<garnt> shouldn't us British to love fishing, </garnt>
<garnt> 'cause we're a fucking island nation as well. Right? </garnt>
<connor> - We're shit, we don't eat fish. We're fucking idiots. </connor>
<joey> - What do you mean, you got fish and chips. </joey>
<connor> - That's it. - [Garnt] We eat cods. </connor>
<connor> - We eat one fish and like salmon, if you're rich. </connor>
<joey> (Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, why is that? Why is that? </joey>
<joey> Not only why is there a fishing mini game in every JRPG, </joey>
<joey> but why is that 99% of them </joey>
<joey> have no effect on the main story whatsoever? </joey>
<connor> - I'd be pretty shit if you're fighting Zephyr off </connor>
<connor> and you're about to fight him and he's like, </connor>
<connor> "Sorry, you haven't collected </connor>
<joey> all of the 19 different species of fish. </joey>
<joey> You are not ready to face me." </joey>
<joey> It's like, "Well, yeah, well, fuck." </joey>
<joey> I guess that would be weird. </joey>
<joey> - I think I would want a JRPG where you're actually rewarded </joey>
<connor> at the final boss. </connor>
<connor> It would be like, the boss is like, </connor>
<joey> "You've done the fishing mini game. Ah." </joey>
<connor> - How did you know that sea bream scales are my weakness. </connor>
<joey> Stop. </joey>
<joey> - They start with like half health. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. (Connor hums) </joey>
<connor> Oh, where's my health bar gone? </connor>
<garnt> - Well, I know some people who are deadly addicted </garnt>
<joey> to every fishing mini game in JRPGs. </joey>
<joey> I mean, Alan is that guy. </joey>
<joey> Alan is that guy who boots up "Final Fantasy", </joey>
<joey> and then he spends like the first 10 hours </joey>
<garnt> on the mini fishing mini game. </garnt>
<garnt> And then after he gets bored of that, </garnt>
<garnt> then he actually goes to play the game. </garnt>
<joey> - Alan's that guy who actually does </joey>
<joey> the Mahjong mini game in "Yakuza". </joey>
<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<joey> Let's be real, every "Yakuza" player is like, </joey>
<joey> "Don't mess with us, we don't know how to play Mahjong, </joey>
<joey> 'cause no one fucking does that mini game </joey>
<joey> in the "Yakuza" games. </joey>
<garnt> - Well, isn't the mini games the main game in "Yakuza". </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, exactly. </joey>
<garnt> Except the Mahjong mini game </garnt>
<joey> 'cause no one fucking knows how to play it. </joey>
<garnt> - Well, that is until you've come along and played- </garnt>
<garnt> - And then I'm like, "Lemme show you. </garnt>
<joey> Lemme show you how to do it". </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, how's your Mahjong coming along, Joey? </garnt>
<joey> - Really good, my addiction is growing. </joey>
<connor> - Your speed running an old Asian man. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I am. I am. </connor>
<connor> I went to a Mahjong parlor </connor>
<garnt> for the first time, the other day. </garnt>
<connor> - [Garnt] Oh, how was that? </connor>
<connor> - It's really fucking fun. </connor>
<connor> I mean like, you know... </connor>
<garnt> I think that the general stereotype of a Mahjong parlor </garnt>
<garnt> is it's fucking dark, it's like smoke is everywhere. </garnt>
<garnt> Like basically fucking "Akagi", right. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> But I walk in and I've never seen that many lights on, </garnt>
<connor> in one room. </connor>
<connor> I came in, I was like, "Ah, fuck". </connor>
<connor> It's so bright. </connor>
<garnt> And like, no one's smoking in there. </garnt>
<garnt> A lot of really young people, as well. </garnt>
<connor> There was maybe two tables that had older gentlemen </connor>
<connor> and everyone else was around our age. </connor>
<connor> - Was it all men? </connor>
<connor> - No, surprisingly. </connor>
<connor> Half of them, I'd say like half, maybe 40%, were ladies. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh. - There were a couple tables </garnt>
<garnt> where it was just full of ladies, </garnt>
<garnt> just like sitting around. - Right. </garnt>
<connor> - But yeah, I went in. </connor>
<connor> I went with one of my childhood friends </connor>
<connor> 'cause he's been getting into Mahjong as well. </connor>
<connor> And he was like, "Oh, we're gonna go to this one </connor>
<connor> in Ebisu". - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, "Why this one in particular"? </connor>
<connor> And he's like, "Oh, the fried rice here is fucking lit." </connor>
<connor> And I was like, "So are we're gonna and play Mahjong </connor>
<connor> or are we gonna go for the fried rice"? </connor>
<connor> - You had fried rice with the... </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, you can order food there, and to be honest, </connor>
<joey> probably some of the best fried rice I've had. </joey>
<connor> - Wow. - In Japan. </connor>
<connor> - Nice, while playing Mahjong. </connor>
<joey> - I'd believe it. </joey>
<garnt> It feels like the kind of place </garnt>
<connor> where you get a weirdly good meal. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I wonder, where did Mahjong get this image </garnt>
<garnt> of it being a game for old guys or old people? </garnt>
<connor> - 'Cause it's always old people playing it </connor>
<connor> on the street and betting, normally. </connor>
<connor> - Is it, I never see that? </connor>
<connor> Normally, my entire- - That's an assumption. </connor>
<joey> - My entire image of Mahjong comes from media basically. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause before moving to Japan, I'd never, </joey>
<garnt> I guess I'd never seen anyone playing Mahjong. </garnt>
<connor> - I know where you're getting this, right. </connor>
<connor> POV. You're watching a movie, right? </connor>
<connor> It's a spy movie. </connor>
<connor> Let's say a spy movie or any kind of movie. </connor>
<connor> They're undercover in Indonesia, let's say. </connor>
<connor> Do they play Mahjong in Indonesia? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, Southeast Asia, it's pretty popular. </connor>
<connor> So they're playing, </connor>
<connor> let's say they're in Indonesia on a mission. </connor>
<connor> Oh no, their cover's been blown. </connor>
<connor> We gotta start running through buildings. </connor>
<connor> Charge in the one building. </connor>
<joey> Oh, it's a food store. Chicken everywhere. </joey>
<joey> Run in the next room. </joey>
<joey> Oh God, it's a bunch of old people playing Mahjong. </joey>
<joey> You've seen this scene like 500 times. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, every time. </joey>
<joey> - It's always just old people in a smokey room </joey>
<joey> playing Mahjong. - Every Jackie Chan movie. </joey>
<joey> - When they bust through the thing, and they're like, </joey>
<joey> they keep running through. </joey>
<connor> It's always there, always. </connor>
<connor> - And then they always do some kind of corny one liner, </connor>
<garnt> right, as they're running out of the room. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well it's either that or it's like an old- </garnt>
<connor> - Indistinct Asian shouting. </connor>
<connor> - It's almost like an old Kung Fu movie. </connor>
<connor> And you get into the bad guys' lair. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - What's he doing? </connor>
<connor> He's sitting down playing Mahjong. </connor>
<garnt> With his fellow, with his guys asserting dominance, right. </garnt>
<garnt> That's the image I have of Mahjong. </garnt>
<garnt> Like in that dark smokey room and everything like that. </garnt>
<connor> - Well, I feel like it's the poker of Japan </connor>
<joey> or like poker of Asia really? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, definitely. </joey>
<joey> - It's like the kind of game where gambling's not legal, </joey>
<connor> but me and the boys can have a little wager or two, </connor>
<connor> you know. </connor>
<connor> - As long as it's under the table, you know? </connor>
<connor> (both laugh) </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause like, yeah, </connor>
<garnt> have you guys ever played bridge before? </garnt>
<connor> - No, I'm not 90. </connor>
<garnt> - No, no, exactly. - I've heard of that game. </garnt>
<garnt> What is that? </garnt>
<garnt> That's a game, which I dunno- </garnt>
<joey> - Is it a card game? </joey>
<joey> - QI them. (imitates siren) </joey>
<connor> It would've gone off an hour ago. </connor>
<connor> - It is a card game. </connor>
<connor> I dunno what the images, </connor>
<garnt> I dunno if it's famous outside of the UK </garnt>
<connor> or anything like that. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah, it's famous in the US. </connor>
<connor> And again, for being the thing </connor>
<garnt> that people play in retirement homes. </garnt>
<connor> - Old people play it, right? - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And I remember, </connor>
<garnt> I think it was in high school or something. </garnt>
<garnt> One of our teachers for like this... </garnt>
<garnt> you know you have a free period sometimes, </garnt>
<connor> and it's the end of term. </connor>
<connor> You could do whatever you like. </connor>
<garnt> So this teacher decided to teach us bridge, </garnt>
<garnt> just teach us the rules. </garnt>
<garnt> I got addicted at a point where I'd joined the bridge club. </garnt>
<garnt> Yes, I was that kid </garnt>
<connor> who actually joined the bridge club. </connor>
<garnt> 'Cause it had this image of, like Mahjong, </garnt>
<garnt> being what old retired people play in retirement homes. </garnt>
<garnt> But like, it is fun as fuck. </garnt>
<connor> Right? - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - It's kind of similar to Mahjong </garnt>
<garnt> in a sense where you get given a bunch of... </garnt>
<garnt> it is kinda like poker where it is luck based, </garnt>
<joey> but it's also skill based. </joey>
<joey> But what I found most interesting to bridge </joey>
<joey> is that it's a team game. Right? </joey>
<joey> So the basic concept is before each game </joey>
<joey> you have a partner who sits opposite you. </joey>
<joey> And you basically have to make a bet </joey>
<joey> on how many points you'd be able to get </joey>
<joey> in the hand you're about to play. </joey>
<joey> So you're kind of communicating with your partner </joey>
<joey> and communicating and trying to assess what everyone has, </joey>
<joey> by the bets that they're placing. </joey>
<joey> And I thought that was like, I think that's super genius. </joey>
<joey> It's basically like UNO, but before the UNO game starts, </joey>
<joey> you have to try and guess what everyone else has. </joey>
<joey> You're working in a team. - Cool. </joey>
<joey> - To me, I wanted to talk about it, </joey>
<joey> 'cause bridge has this image </joey>
<joey> of being a boring game that old people play, </joey>
<garnt> but I think it's interesting as fuck. </garnt>
<garnt> And I haven't played bridge since I was in school. </garnt>
<garnt> When I was in bridge club, I got super addicted for a while </garnt>
<garnt> because I think it's a genuinely fun game's. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, it's the same with Mahjong, right. </joey>
<joey> I was like, before I started playing it, </joey>
<connor> I was like, "No, I'm not gonna get into this. </connor>
<connor> This is what my grandma was into." </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But then when you actually start playing it </connor>
<joey> you realize just how like intricate it is, </joey>
<joey> and it's not just like a fucking, you know. </joey>
<connor> - Well, I didn't think of it as an old people thing. </connor>
<connor> I think of it as a really complicated thing. </connor>
<joey> - But it's interesting though, how, </joey>
<joey> even something like Mahjong, </joey>
<joey> which is a very complicated, deep, </joey>
<garnt> and very mind intensive game is associated with old people. </garnt>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - If you look at like the pro scene, for example, </garnt>
<joey> most people are like dudes and chicks in their 20's. </joey>
<joey> - Well yeah, of course. </joey>
<connor> It's like chess in the parks in New York. </connor>
<garnt> It's like, yeah, all the old dudes are playing it </garnt>
<garnt> but it's the young people who are the best. </garnt>
<connor> - It's a PR thing, right? </connor>
<garnt> When are we gonna get a Twitch category? </garnt>
<connor> - Everything's a branding issue, isn't it, guys? </connor>
<connor> Nothing can't be fixed with a bit of branding and PR. </connor>
<connor> - Remember, literally just two years ago </connor>
<connor> where chess had the same thing </connor>
<joey> and then suddenly chess had a fucking second Renaissance </joey>
<joey> with the explosion it's had on Twitch. </joey>
<joey> And now it's seen as like this cool thing that- </joey>
<joey> - Mahjong's next. - Mahjong's next. </joey>
<joey> - I'm gonna call it, Mahjong is next. </joey>
<joey> - You know what I wanna learn? </joey>
<joey> - The Vtubers are already on that shit. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> That's the secret. </joey>
<joey> We need to get the Vtubers to all start playing it. </joey>
<joey> - The Japanese Vtubers have been on that shit for so long. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. Right. - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think, weirdly chess is one of those sports </garnt>
<garnt> where when you look at it on paper, </garnt>
<connor> it just shouldn't be a spectator sport. </connor>
<connor> - Mm. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Everything about it makes it almost a bad spectator sport. </connor>
<garnt> There's long gaps in between moves. </garnt>
<garnt> It's not that engaging. </garnt>
<joey> Storylines are a little harder to get across, </joey>
<joey> and it's visually not that exciting. </joey>
<connor> You look at a board for like 15 minutes at a time. </connor>
<connor> If you're lucky, they'll make a move every 15 minutes, </connor>
<connor> in the World Championship. </connor>
<connor> But somehow I think just out of pure, </connor>
<connor> like being a very solid and ubiquitous game, </connor>
<connor> it's managed to somehow carve a good niche </connor>
<connor> and a pretty strong one. </connor>
<connor> But also chess has also had great success </connor>
<garnt> by having the branding of being the smart mans skill. </garnt>
<garnt> The smartest of smarts play chess. </garnt>
<garnt> - Well, I think the problem with chess </garnt>
<garnt> as a spectator sport is that, with a lot of sports, </garnt>
<garnt> you look at the higher level players, </garnt>
<garnt> you look at, you know, traditional sports like football, </garnt>
<joey> basketball, maybe even like league or whatever. </joey>
<joey> And you can, even as a normal person, </joey>
<joey> you can appreciate the skill being showed. </joey>
<joey> You see someone doing a speed run of Mario 64 or something. </joey>
<joey> You're like, damn those are some- </joey>
<joey> - No words needed. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, no words needed. That's fucking speaks for itself. </joey>
<joey> But me watching a high level chess game, </joey>
<joey> the chessboard championships is like, </joey>
<joey> I've never understood the feeling </joey>
<joey> of that side character in "Dragon Ball Z", </joey>
<joey> where the characters- - That explains the moves. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, no, like where the main characters </joey>
<joey> are following the fight perfectly. </joey>
<garnt> and you just see, like you just see nothing. </garnt>
<garnt> This is me watching high level chess. </garnt>
<connor> - That's why I think chess has gotten really good </connor>
<connor> in recent years at having the, </connor>
<garnt> kind of what a lot of e-sports are doing </garnt>
<garnt> and what traditional sports are doing for a long time </garnt>
<garnt> where one of them is the one that's saying what's going on, </garnt>
<connor> and one of them's helping add color </connor>
<connor> and break it down and really explain it. </connor>
<connor> Chess has been really good at that recently. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause I mean, I like watching the World Championships, </connor>
<connor> but even then there are periods </connor>
<connor> where nothing happens for 20 minutes </connor>
<connor> and it's like, I got shit to do, man, like, come on. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, sometimes I get recommended a clip </garnt>
<connor> of Magnus Carlsen streaming or something like that. </connor>
<connor> And it's just like an out of context clip </connor>
<garnt> of this fucking 500 IQ move. </garnt>
<connor> And then the move happens </connor>
<connor> and I don't even know it's happened. </connor>
<garnt> Because it was like five moves ago that he reacted to it. </garnt>
<garnt> And I remember, </garnt>
<connor> I think one of the funniest videos I've seen is just like, </connor>
<connor> I can't remember the exact video, </connor>
<garnt> but it's a parody video of someone commentating </garnt>
<connor> on a Magnus Carlsen stream. </connor>
<joey> And it's just a normal person commenting on his stream. </joey>
<joey> And it's just like, </joey>
<joey> "And Magnus Carlsen leaves his knight hanging. </joey>
<joey> Is he gonna take it? </joey>
<joey> Is the opponent gonna take it? </joey>
<joey> No, he doesn't take it. </joey>
<joey> He doesn't take the free knight. </joey>
<joey> Oh, now he's left his queen hanging. </joey>
<joey> Is he gonna take the queen? </joey>
<joey> Magnus, the queen is right there. </joey>
<joey> No, he doesn't take the queen. </joey>
<joey> And he looks like he's in an awful position right now. </joey>
<joey> And he resigns, Magnus Carlsen resigns. </joey>
<joey> I don't know what's going on. </joey>
<joey> And it's just... </joey>
<joey> It's exactly how I feel watching, </joey>
<joey> a high level chess game when I'm just like, </joey>
<joey> there is the hanging queen right there. </joey>
<joey> Why is Magnus Carlsen not taking the hanging? Oh. </joey>
<joey> And he's just resigned for no reason. </joey>
<joey> And he scrolls to the comments section </joey>
<connor> and it's never the top comment </connor>
<connor> that's explaining what's happening. </connor>
<connor> It's always buried a few comments down. </connor>
<connor> Just be like, can someone just explain to me </connor>
<connor> what I just witnessed, please. </connor>
<connor> But yeah, I mean like that's why, </connor>
<connor> one game I really want to get into, </connor>
<connor> 'cause it sounds super interest, </connor>
<connor> it always looks super interesting to me, </connor>
<connor> but I'm fucking terrified of possibly getting into, is go. </connor>
<garnt> Go seems to me like, that is just like... </garnt>
<garnt> chess is complicated by itself. </garnt>
<garnt> Go, to me, even just the concept of go, </garnt>
<garnt> it seems like what viewing a bottomless pit </garnt>
<garnt> that you cannot see the end of. </garnt>
<joey> - My granddad was into go and he was really good at it. </joey>
<garnt> And he tried to teach me when I was in high school </garnt>
<garnt> and I was like, "I don't know what the fuck is happening". </garnt>
<garnt> I know you're showing me the ropes really nicely and kindly. </garnt>
<garnt> But all I'm thinking is, "Ooh, black and white stones". </garnt>
<connor> - All I know is that Google's documentary </connor>
<connor> about the AI they built to beat the best player. </connor>
<joey> - And then I read, "Hikaru No Go" </joey>
<joey> and I was like, "I understand what's happening." </joey>
<garnt> - No, I like, because I also read "Hikaru No Go" as well. </garnt>
<garnt> I read all of it. </garnt>
<garnt> And I remember there was a point where they tried to explain </garnt>
<garnt> what was going on to the viewer. </garnt>
<garnt> And I think halfway through the manga, they just stopped. </garnt>
<garnt> They just stopped showing the matches, </garnt>
<garnt> and they just like, </garnt>
<garnt> "I'm not even gonna try and explain it. This guy wins." </garnt>
<garnt> And you see...it's a manga that just, </garnt>
<garnt> it bases its hype on of people, </garnt>
<garnt> off of like character reactions, </garnt>
<garnt> as opposed to what's going on in the match. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's not very good, is it? </garnt>
<garnt> - I think it's because they just assume you are like... </garnt>
<garnt> - They figure, you got it. </garnt>
<garnt> - You're 15 volumes in, </garnt>
<connor> you should know how this works by now. </connor>
<joey> We're not gonna explain it to you. </joey>
<connor> - I still don't think I understand how football works </connor>
<garnt> and I watched all of.. </garnt>
<garnt> - What you mean football? </garnt>
<garnt> - Sorry, American football. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh. - Oh, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - Sorry, football. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know how it football works. </garnt>
<connor> And I watched, I read all of "Eyeshield 21". </connor>
<connor> I think I understand how it works. </connor>
<joey> - I don't think that's very realistic. </joey>
<joey> You're not gonna be like, </joey>
<joey> you're not gonna be watching the Super Bowl and be like, </joey>
<joey> "Well, he could have done a devil bat ghost there. </joey>
<joey> Why didn't he?" </joey>
<connor> - But you know, when you're watching something, </connor>
<connor> you're like, "I feel like I should understand </connor>
<connor> how this base game works yet I don't". </connor>
<connor> Baseball's another one that I've watched stuff about </connor>
<connor> and I'm like, "I think I understand the baseball, </connor>
<joey> but I'm not so sure." </joey>
<joey> - Really? Baseball's fairly easy to figure out. </joey>
<connor> - I don't understand when they swap that much, </connor>
<joey> but then again, I've never watched- </joey>
<joey> - After three strikes, right? </joey>
<joey> - Three strikes, right? </joey>
<joey> - And they swap teams. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - So you get three goes and then everyone... </joey>
<connor> No, 'cause then they all, everyone on the field swaps? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Oh. </connor>
<connor> - [Crew Member] Better strike out. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah yeah, yeah, so, it's not three throws, right? </connor>
<joey> - No, it's three... - Three strikes. </joey>
<garnt> So when you throw in baseball, </garnt>
<connor> it can either be a strike or a ball. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - And you have a strike zone. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - That pitchers have to throw into. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. I know that, I know that. </connor>
<connor> - So when it's three strikes- </connor>
<connor> - That's one batter out. - And then they're out, </connor>
<connor> and when it's three outs, they switch. </connor>
<connor> - Right. Right. </connor>
<joey> - And there are usually nine innings. </joey>
<connor> - I never really like, even when I read stuff about it, </connor>
<connor> I'm like, baseball just doesn't look fun. </connor>
<joey> Am I bad? Am I wrong? </joey>
<connor> - No, baseball's hella fun, dude. </connor>
<garnt> - Really? - Yeah. </garnt>
<joey> I love watching baseball. </joey>
<garnt> - There's a lot of sports that are fun to play, </garnt>
<garnt> but not fun to watch. </garnt>
<connor> - I feel like it would be fun to play, </connor>
<garnt> but not fun to watch. </garnt>
<garnt> - To me, that's baseball, that's golf. </garnt>
<connor> That's cricket. Sorry Indians. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> - I'm offended. </connor>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<connor> - Like I have fun playing them, </connor>
<connor> but watching them, I kind of fall asleep. </connor>
<garnt> I mean, I think kind of same with American football as well, </garnt>
<joey> 'cause I think my problem with a lot of American sports </joey>
<joey> growing up with somebody watch, </joey>
<joey> you know, real football and a lot of Europeans... </joey>
<joey> - Whoa. - Whoa. </joey>
<joey> Yes, I fucking said it. Yes, I fucking said it. </joey>
<joey> It's the amount of starting and stopping </joey>
<garnt> and the advertisements that go in between. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. - That's, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - That's what I don't really like about the NFL, </joey>
<connor> the American football is like, yeah </connor>
<connor> it's just way too many starts and stops. </connor>
<connor> - I'm just like, right when a play is happening </connor>
<joey> and you're like, "Oh shit, here we go. Oh, they stopped." </joey>
<connor> - I don't understand, </connor>
<connor> this is again for someone who's... </connor>
<connor> Again, I think I understand how American football works. </connor>
<connor> I don't, I'm not sure entirely. </connor>
<garnt> - What do you mean, you think you understand how it works? </garnt>
<connor> - I think I understand the rules. </connor>
<connor> Right. - Okay. </connor>
<joey> - But even when I'm watching it, </joey>
<joey> my older brother really likes American football, </joey>
<joey> but I'm just thinking like, </joey>
<joey> why would I ever wanna watch this over rugby? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I'd much rather watch rugby. </joey>
<joey> - There's no point where I've ever watched </joey>
<joey> a American football game and thought, </joey>
<connor> "Fuck, I wish this was rugby." </connor>
<garnt> - I think... </garnt>
<garnt> - Sorry, there's no point that I haven't thought that. </garnt>
<garnt> Every single time I watch American football, </garnt>
<connor> I'm like, "I just wish this was rugby". </connor>
<connor> - I think just because... </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna be the American here. </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna be the American stick... </connor>
<connor> - Tell me why, 'cause I don't know. </connor>
<connor> - Sticking up for American football. </connor>
<connor> Because, I think, </connor>
<connor> even though I just complained about the stop start, </connor>
<connor> I think the beauty of American football </connor>
<connor> is that it comes in bursts, right. </connor>
<connor> And when that burst happens, </connor>
<connor> I don't think there's another sport </connor>
<joey> that could really compete with American football </joey>
<joey> with just the amount of- - Hype. </joey>
<joey> - The amount of small things happening </joey>
<joey> in such a short period of time. </joey>
<joey> 'Cause there are so many things going on when it's in play. </joey>
<joey> - Australian football would like to have a word with you. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, I haven't watched Australian football, Joey, okay. </joey>
<joey> - That's our footy. </joey>
<joey> - Okay, Joey. Okay, Joey. </joey>
<garnt> But, to me, that is the real strength of American football. </garnt>
<joey> - It's super intricate, especially when you know, </joey>
<connor> when you have an idea of like, "Oh, that's this plan, </connor>
<garnt> they're doing all these different things. </garnt>
<garnt> That's fun to watch, but it's like, it happens- </garnt>
<garnt> - So quickly. </garnt>
<garnt> - It happens so quickly. </garnt>
<joey> And then by the time you're like, </joey>
<joey> "Oh, that was kind of cool", then they're stopped. </joey>
<connor> - Also that's why I love basketball. </connor>
<joey> Basketball is so fun to watch. </joey>
<connor> - Basketball's really fun. - Basketball's hella fun. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, it's sports that have a constant movement going. </joey>
<connor> That's why rugby is so fun because it's like, </connor>
<garnt> except if it's a penalty or whatever, </garnt>
<garnt> it's just like constantly moving, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, like to me...this is a preference. </garnt>
<joey> As a spectator sport, I do like when the rules are... </joey>
<joey> how can I word this? Like, fluid? </joey>
<joey> You know, there's like the offense and defense </joey>
<joey> can change at any time. </joey>
<joey> If there's a sport where, you know, </joey>
<joey> you have an offensive team and a defensive team, </joey>
<joey> and then they swap at certain intervals, </joey>
<connor> like American football, like </connor>
<connor> - Baseball - Baseball. </connor>
<connor> cricket or whatever. </connor>
<connor> Then that's like... I like it when anything can happen. </connor>
<connor> When there's more randomness of someone- </connor>
<connor> - You want "Mario Party"? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, basically. </connor>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<connor> - What are the items? </connor>
<joey> Banana, put some banana peels on the baseball field, </joey>
<connor> and then I'll watch. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, I mean every sport has- </garnt>
<garnt> - You should play the "Mario Baseball" game. </garnt>
<joey> You'd love that game. </joey>
<joey> - Didn't they bring out a new "Mario Soccer"? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, they are. </joey>
<joey> - Is there a "Mario Baseball" game? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, on Game Q. </joey>
<connor> - "Super Mario Strikers" </connor>
<garnt> - No, "Strikers" is the soccer. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's the football- </garnt>
<joey> - "Sluggers" is the baseball. - Oh, "Sluggers". </joey>
<garnt> - Oh my God, dude, that's a blast from the past, bro. </garnt>
<joey> I tried to get that game for Christmas for so god damn long. </joey>
<joey> My parents had to buy it off some shady Chinese website </joey>
<joey> and it turned up and my parents, and I also was too young. </joey>
<joey> I didn't know about region lock. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - And my mom, bless her, she tried so god damn hard </joey>
<connor> to get a copy of this game, </connor>
<connor> but they never sold it in Europe. </connor>
<joey> - I found "Sluggers" the other day, actually, </joey>
<connor> in Akihabara and I bought it </connor>
<garnt> and I played it for the first time since I was 12 </garnt>
<garnt> and I was like, "This game's godlike". </garnt>
<joey> Easily the best "Mario" sports game. </joey>
<connor> - No, "Strikers" was really good. </connor>
<joey> - "Strikers" is good, but- - "Strikers" was so good. </joey>
<connor> - I'm just, I'm more of a a fan of- </connor>
<connor> - I hope they bring out a new one. </connor>
<joey> - But I'm more of a fan of baseball than foot, than soccer. </joey>
<connor> - No, no football, you were right. </connor>
<joey> You were right the first time, Joe. </joey>
<joey> - No, it's soccer. </joey>
<garnt> - You were right the first time. </garnt>
<connor> - It's soccer. It's soccer. </connor>
<joey> - You were right the first time, Joey. </joey>
<joey> - It's soccer. </joey>
<joey> I refuse to call soccer football. Oh my God. </joey>
<joey> - But anyway, that's been this episode of "Trash Taste". </joey>
<garnt> So we did talk about a wide bunch of things today. </garnt>
<connor> - Very random episode. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, very random episode, </garnt>
<garnt> from wildlife to sad boys to back to video games. Right? </garnt>
<connor> - God, I wanna eat a fucking tortoise so bad, dude. </connor>
<garnt> God, I wish I could have tried that tortoise, man. </garnt>
<connor> I bet it's so good. </connor>
<connor> - What is it with you and extinct food. </connor>
<connor> - Oh. </connor>
<connor> - First it's the extinct banana. </connor>
<connor> - I was born in the British Empire. </connor>
<garnt> I would've been the one guy there, like fuck, </garnt>
<connor> don't let him on the fucking boat, dude. </connor>
<connor> He's just gonna start bringing on </connor>
<connor> weird fucking animals to eat. </connor>
<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<joey> - The reason why it hasn't had a genome name </joey>
<joey> is because Connor cooked it. </joey>
<connor> - Dude, I would've been like, </connor>
<garnt> "Sorry, scientists. Man, you gotta try it. </garnt>
<connor> Oh wait, you can't, I ate it all". </connor>
<connor> - Okay, here's the thing. </connor>
<connor> Since we're past the era of discovery where you- </connor>
<connor> - Are we adding in another topic before we end this? </connor>
<connor> - I guess so, I guess so. </connor>
<connor> Now that you mention it. - Go on, then. </connor>
<connor> - Since we're past the era of discovery, </connor>
<connor> I'm jealous of, not the people who were the first </connor>
<garnt> to discover this new land, </garnt>
<garnt> but imagine discovering a new animal </garnt>
<garnt> and being the first person to ever taste it? </garnt>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<connor> - Well, the people who tasted it of your type of people. </connor>
<connor> - What do you mean? </connor>
<connor> - Well, I feel like, you know, in Australia, </connor>
<garnt> I'm sure Aboriginal people had eaten a bunch </garnt>
<garnt> of the stuff that was there. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, of course. - Sure, sure, sure. </garnt>
<garnt> - But yeah, I guess you would be the first foreigner </garnt>
<garnt> to try it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah yeah, yeah. - To document it. </garnt>
<connor> - I guess. </connor>
<garnt> I think to me, that's way more exciting </garnt>
<garnt> than discovering new land mass. </garnt>
<connor> - Think about all the foods that might have tasted good, </connor>
<connor> but the first guy who had it thought it tasted bad. </connor>
<connor> So he never, we never tasted it. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. but it's also like, </joey>
<joey> there's a terrifying element to it, right? </joey>
<joey> Because you don't like... </joey>
<joey> could you imagine the first person who drank cows milk? </joey>
<joey> That would've been fucking terrifying. </joey>
<garnt> - Would it have been terrifying or just really weird? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, it's like, "Ooh, this weird white shit </joey>
<joey> just came out from the tit of a cow." </joey>
