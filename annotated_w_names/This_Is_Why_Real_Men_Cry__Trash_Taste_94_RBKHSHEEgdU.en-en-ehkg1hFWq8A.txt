<SPEAKER_03> (Joey beatboxing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Connor thumping) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Connor claps) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Can't believe you used the wrong mike. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm sorry. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (gentle music) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Hello and welcome to another
episode of "Trash Taste". </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm your host for today, Garnt </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and joining me once again are the boys. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey sneezes) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Jesus Christ.
- Sorry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] God dammit Joey. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We had it, we had it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We had the perfect take, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which was the only take
we've ever done today. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> You know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Outtakes on
patreon.com/trashtaste, of course. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Damn, trying to lash it out early. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, of course, of course. Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I spilled half of this on me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, my fucking... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Guys, I thought we were professionals. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We've been doing this- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The hay fever season's fucking... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We've been doing this for
almost like two years, now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> We should be on this man,
we should be on this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fucking hell.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Sheez, a vine boom sound effect. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Boom. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just, yeah, I've been just... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> hay fever's been kicking
my ass this season. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Really?
- Yeah, all of a sudden. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I hate it.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And especially like now, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when you're sniffling on a train </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and you just see like all these like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Ey, oh. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Is this boy sick or- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Some Japanese guys have like these </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> most aggressive gravelly coughs, dude. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
- They come out of nowhere. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't how they have cough- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt coughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You hear that every so often. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Always-
- I don't know how they do it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Exactly that noise.
- Especially in COVID. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Deep in COVID season as well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're just like, you're
on high fucking alert, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like one of those
guards in (indistinct), </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the fucking alert pops
up and I'm just like, oh. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I actually saw at my local bookstore, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> they were selling these
pins during the pandemic, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in the middle of the
pandemic, that just said, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like during hay fever season. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was a pin that just said, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Don't worry, I have hay fever". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And so people would like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> if there was sniffling on the train, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you'd just like show off
the badge and be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I don't have COVID guys,
it's just hay fever." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - But what if you had COVID
and you bought that anyway, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> just to be like, guys it's hay fever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Trust me. Trust me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What if you had both? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause I remember, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I also had like a
little bit of hay fever, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but also I remember one week, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just got like a cough or something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and getting a cough
during the pandemic time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is like the worst, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause normally it feels bad
to cough in public anyway. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But you're like, when you have like just, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's just like a dry cough, especially, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're so conscious about it, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> About how often you're coughing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and it just makes the cough, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when you are thinking about it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it just makes the cough 10 times worse. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know what I mean?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And especially on public
transport, you're just... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember like normally,
going to my old place, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it would be stressful if I
needed to take a shit. Right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know, when you're holding it in, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was holding in this fucking cough </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and fucking spacing this
cough out that I had, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for a good 40 minutes or
however long that journey was. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I dunno if anyone
around me noticed it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I was like, I dunno, I was just, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I was fucking sweating from how much </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I was trying to hold in this cough. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I thought you were holding in the cough, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause you didn't wanna shit
yourself in the process, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like (imitates cough) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just gonna be like, I'm gonna do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Who cares? What are they gonna do? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It's not like a zombie apocalypse, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If you've been bitten,
they're gonna kill you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Have you ever coughed
and shit at the same time? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, what, what? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - No? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We were not talking about shitting yet. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, Twitter. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll leave it for the vlogs. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do you have a story, Joey? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - No.
(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Just curious. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I dunno, just... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You've never done that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Of course I've done it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've never done that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't have a story about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Of course I've done it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I have also, we've all done it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We haven't all done that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I have never done
that, unfortunately Joey. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Sorry I can't... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sorry, I'm sorry man, I wish we could... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's a sensation. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So, are you on the toilet or? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, of course I'm on the toilet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, that doesn't
count, that doesn't count. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, that's what I mean,
I don't mean like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm not asking you to be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have you shat yourself before? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like in public? I think we've already- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I shat myself on the toilet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We've talked about that one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, but yeah, no, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just like on the toilet and you just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's not coming out and then
you use the power of the cough </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> to exert your body. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (both laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's how you get hemorrhoids. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - You know what, let's change the subject. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is how you get
hemorrhoids, I'm pretty sure. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think the only thing
that comes close to that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> isn't like shitting yourself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> But it's when you go back to the gym </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> for the first time in ages. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You have ab day or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And the day after your entire body aches </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and the one time you sneeze, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it just pushed your entire
body into pain mode. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like (screams) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I literally did this like two weeks ago. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I did ab day for the first time in months. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And not one day, it was
like five days afterwards. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh really?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why was it lagging? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Dude, no, no, it was like
for the next five days. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, like in a row.
- It hurt so much. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I see, I see. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Damn, you went hard. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just went too hard,
man, I just went too hard. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know, what can I say? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Talking about seasons though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Can Japan chill with
its changing of seasons? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I dunno. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Last week it felt like winter. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It felt like it was coming
on the tail end of winter. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was warming up a little bit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I think we had two days of spring, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like spring weather. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I remember going out yesterday </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> or the day before in this jacket </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was sweating my ass
off already and I just... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Japan, I've just noticed, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it doesn't have a transition period. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You just wake up one day
and it's a new season. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - And they say Japan has four seasons. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What a load of shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's such a lie, Japan has two seasons. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It's hot or cold.
- It is, it is two. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's winter and summer,
that's all they have. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like different stages of cold </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then just different stages of hot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> There's no warm. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There's no warm period, you get like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - The warm period is maybe in the evening </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> when the sun's just gone down </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and the residue of the
concrete heat is escaping. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> That's when it's like, "Okay,
that's kind of pleasant". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But then immediately
afterwards it's just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, now it's cold as shit, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause you're in a t-shirt like an idiot." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I always forget how hot it
is until the summer comes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And then I'm like, "Oh
yeah, this is hell". </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think it's like trauma for me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I forget about it and
I'm like, "Summer, what?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm winter game, bro. I'm wearing a coat. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And I forget that for
half the year in Japan, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you just can't wear more than one t-shirt. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Unless you're a Japanese person- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Who can wear a full
suit and an overcoat. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, and it'd be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, it's a little dab
of sweat right here". </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - What temperature is in the office? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Can we have 30 degree
Celsius, please? What? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I dunno how I
walk around in the summer </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and just see business
people in full on suits, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> running along with their briefcase </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm here dying in
my t-shirts and shorts. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm a sweater, I'm a big sweater boy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I am as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I sweat like a motherfucker. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I am. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm the complete opposite of Sydney </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because she doesn't sweat enough </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when it comes to heat. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> We're deep in summer
and I feel her forehead </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's just like,
there's zero perspiration. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, Aki's exactly the same. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, that's how you get heat stroke. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - My body's working.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - If you sweat a lot, that's healthy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Technically. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Water away
- Is it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Get all the water away. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's why I weigh so much. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - To me, it's like it's
a copium, it's healthy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like the tiniest bit of heat </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and my armpits, especially,
just start perspirating. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And there's no way, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that doesn't ruin anything you
fucking wear, unfortunately. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> So I just have to be
worried in the summer, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> even if I'm not... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> even if I'm underneath air conditioning, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I still sweat sometimes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - For me, it's weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't sweat through my armpits as much. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> For me, it's all in the face, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is horrible because
you can't hide that shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're literally like
that meme of that guy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know, he's on the radio. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He's like (imitates sweating) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fuck it, fuck it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like that Key & Peele gif, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> where it's just like dripping wet, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but the rest of my body
is okay, I hate it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - But yeah, I guess that's why... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we're from England, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Do you feel like being British </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> has conditioned you to like cold weather </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or do you feel like you've
gotten used to other climates? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't think it's the temperature. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It's more so the sun, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think we're... I'm allergic to the sun. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't like the sun.
- Is that 'cause you're white? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, no, very white, very white. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Very white, indeed actually. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - But you know, I would understand </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because you guys have that lack of sun, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> right, in the UK.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But in Australia we
have an overdose of sun. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I'm also traumatized by too much sun. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- As well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because in Japan it's like
sometimes the sun works </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and then sometimes it works overtime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I still think the summer </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> was worse in the UK than it was in Japan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because we don't have AC.
- How hot does it get, though? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - So it's three, four weeks of... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> at least the last time I was there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was like three, four weeks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of just uncomfortable sweating, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I can't do anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> At least in Japan I can game all day </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> in a comfortable AC climate room. Right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, okay, when I go outside it sucks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I sweat, but I'd take that
over having, be in my bedroom, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sweating and being able to do nothing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's true, that's true. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's horrible. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You get one of those fans that blows air, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I feel like that's
literally like a copium. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. Yeah.
- It doesn't do anything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - You just blowing the air around. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's just blowing the
hot air into my face. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I actually like the fan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like sometimes I- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think that's a Southeast Asian thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think it is, I think it is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think Asian people, they love fans. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I swear, they just like fans all the time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - To me, you admit defeat if
you are putting on the AC. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Right, that means you are more weak- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why is the fan any different? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I dunno, the fan, I
like the feeling of hot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Not exactly cold air. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Would you say you're a fan? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Fuck off Joe, fuck off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I dunno.
- Just stand under the AC. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because to me, the
AC, it just feels like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> how can I put this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It feels like artificial air. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I get it... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Does that make sense? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, I understand that the AC air </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> is not one you wanna be breathing in? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know why.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It feels weird. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause I feel the
same way about heaters, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where if you have... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There's a difference in having a warm room </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and having a room that's
been warmed up by a heater, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause it feels 10 times
more stuffy for some reason. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't like the feeling
of just the artificial heat </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as opposed to just being in a country </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or in a temperature that is comfortable, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like naturally outside. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Same thing with AC, for me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> With AC, if you have a
room that's cooled with AC, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it just feels, I don't
know, like the air... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> How can I describe this? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It feels like, it feels sterile. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Connor and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know what I mean?
You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, I don't know what you mean. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] It feels sterile. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - This is first world problems. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It is first world problems. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I agree, I agree. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I breathe it in, it's
just unnaturally dry. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Sometimes, my asthma, my lungs, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> feel the dry air way more with AC air </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> than with just cold air in general. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know, it's completely something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that is just a me issue, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but that's why I much prefer having a fan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as opposed to having the AC. Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Did I tell about why my
apartment smelled like shit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for the first two months? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Your current apartment?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, it involves the AC. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like literal shit, or... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like literal shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is it 'cause of the AC? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, so you know I moved
into this apartment building. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Something just kept smelling weird. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I couldn't put my finger on it. Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like, "What the
fuck is this thing?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I turn the AC off, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- It's still coming in. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So my apartment still smells like shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This is brand new, I just got this place. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Why does it smell of shit? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's not me, I'm definitely flushing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Looks down, I'm covered in shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I foul up, but it's not that kind of... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like a lingering. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No matter where I am,
I'm getting this, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I go to my balcony, right,
and there's like, bird shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, "Well, it can't
be that 'cause I clean it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it still smells of shit". </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, "What the fuck is going on? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Why does it smell of shit?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Turns out that there was this one place </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where these birds were shitting, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that was like, the
intake fan was right here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and all the birds were just shitting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right next to the intake. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I couldn't see it
'cause it's right next... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's this much gap between the roof </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and the box they're shitting on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah yeah, yeah.
- Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's literal perfect size
for one pigeon to fit in. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they loved, loved, shitting there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know why they loved it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Maybe 'cause they felt like the
roof was close, it was nice- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - So you basically were
huffing in bird shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I literally, for two
months, was just huffing in, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm pretty sure that pigeon poop </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> is one of the poops you
don't wanna be breathing in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think any poop is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't wanna breathe
in any poop, to be honest. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - As in, I think they have one of the more </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> dirty poops out there, I believe. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know if this is correct. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Compared-
- As compared to what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Compared to what poop? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Listen, if I laid a log there, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's not gonna smell as bad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is there a poop scale
of hygiene quality? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think it's just like
all poop, right, surely. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I remember, when I Googled
cleaning pigeon poop, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> there's a bunch of things that were like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> warning, please make sure you
don't actually touch the poop, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause it's filled with
disgusting parasites and stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - When isn't it filled with
disgusting germs and parasites? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know, I play
with mine all the time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's not that bad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It could have been just a generic warning. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Anyway, so I cleaned
it and then I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Great, this is amazing, it's all fixed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> My apartment doesn't smell of shit." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Two days later I start
smelling shit again. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They just kept coming back. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, fuck... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, I then had to install
those spikes on it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah.
- To get rid of it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And finally, now my apartment
doesn't smell of shit, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> unless I leave the door
open and take a shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Then it does smell of shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was gonna ask how you've
sorted the problem, 'cause I... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - My apartment is a... my
balcony is like a joke. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like half reflective now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've put reflective stuff everywhere </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it doesn't stop them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They just find a new spot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I noticed that 'cause in my house </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and in my home in Thailand, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's on the outskirts of the city. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So it's more next to nature,
the nature side of things. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I notice the spikes
do fucking nothing, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The spikes is a great place
for birds to start a nest. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> So like-
- Oh, really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> These are like comically large spikes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, okay, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I literally don't get
any birds on my balcony. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're so lucky. How does that work? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How do pigeons decide </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is the building
that I'm gonna fuck up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Maybe one pigeon is
like, "Oy, check it out." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, 'cause sometimes-
- Come on, come on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sometimes we get that one fucking pigeon </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that's hanging out outside
the toilet of this office </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I can hear fucking it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know why... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's here and in Thailand as well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> why the first thing I hear when I wake up, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> is just these birds going at each other. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey imitates pigeons cooing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's not even that, right,
it's not even pigeon. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Sometimes it's just like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> sometimes it is, I swear, it's
just like the fucking ghetto. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like it's the fucking
ghetto of the birds, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And I can just hear is like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oi, oi mate, what you doing here? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What are you doing here, mate? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Bruv, bruv, what are you doing?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm just like-
(Joey imitates shooting) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (both laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Every fuck morning, I
don't know what it is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And so we installed spikes
to try and stop these birds </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> from hanging out outside,
like stop 'em loitering. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Stop the youths from loitering
outside of our window. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I wanna see these spikes you're using. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's just like the plastic spikes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's just like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Maybe use plastic and they
just didn't do anything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know, but we thought, okay, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we're gonna install them to stop the birds </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hanging out here every morning. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It did the entire fuck opposite </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because now they found out that the spikes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are great for propping up a nest there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> So they just built a nest there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> So, we literally helped them settle down. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - At that point, you just
gotta give them credit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> That's just impressive. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Big brain. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So yeah, unfortunately- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'd rather the birds though, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause in Australia I would wake up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to possums fucking on our roof. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What does that sound like? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It just sounds... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just like a lot of rattling like this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and a lot of like (screeches)
at two in the morning. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, "Oh my God, please stop." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - That sounds pretty good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, it's not. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> How does that sound good? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do they make a mess? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I hope not. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, if you hope not, that
means you don't know. Right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So that must mean they
probably don't make a mess. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, the mess is
like half the problem. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's the fact that I can't get to sleep </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause these possums are- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'd rather have trouble sleeping </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> than have to clean the
shit up every two months. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's awful, they shit on
my Ikea furniture as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, because you got furniture
out on your balcony as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - So, wherever I put the
reflective stuff down, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they just move </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then I put the
reflective stuff right above- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - What is the reflective stuff? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like-
- Like CDs? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What's those? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The Coloso scopes? No,
what are they called? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Kaleidoscopes?
- That's it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> The kaleidoscopes kind
of patterns that reflect </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it just scares them off. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But sometimes it doesn't
and then other times </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they just, it's like they're edging. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> They'll find a spot and
they'll have one foot on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they'll just start shitting off of it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like, "How am I
supposed to predict this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This is insane." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - That was very different edging to watch. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - But then they're. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - They're standing on the edge, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was like, the pigeons are doing what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - They're probably edging as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They're just like, ah, ah, ah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - They're probably doing that as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Direct eye contacts,
just like, ah, ah, ah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's awful. It's awful. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And they're like...they... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> oh, it's such a pain in the ass. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, 'cause...
- Pain in their ass, too. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you ever have to deal with
annoying wildlife in the UK? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you guy's have
any wildlife in the UK? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like the most annoying
thing for me in the UK is, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I dunno if you have it in Wales, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but in the city, in Brighton at least, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or at least when I was living
in London as well, foxes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> The sound that they make
sometimes at night just is, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> is the worst screech I've
ever heard in my life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You guys have foxes? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, we do have foxes.
- Oh, wow. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like the deadliest animal we have. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They're fucking pussies, though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, they are, they run away. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because you make eye
contact with 'em, they run, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they're already down the road, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like fucking legging it down a mile. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I used to live above
a bunch of restaurants, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so always saw foxes, but
they never made noise. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - They never made noise?
- No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, actually they never make noise </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if they're in the vicinity
of guys or humans. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I would sometimes hear them </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just screeching off in the background. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And they literally sound like, I dunno, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a kid being assaulted
or something, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Because I remember the first
time Sydney moved to England, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> she heard this noise and she
was about to phone the police. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, "No Sydney,
that's just a fox." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause it just sounds like (screeches) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You just hear that in the background, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm just like... the
first time I heard it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, "What is that noise?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - At least that's what they tell you, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like, "It's the foxes." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's the foxes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Trust. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Enters the door with plastic gloves on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It's the foxes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's the foxes, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. I know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We only had ants. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Ants? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, we had ants. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Ants that would get into the house. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> They're pretty good, ants are. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They're really good at
getting into your house. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But the British ants are tiny though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Like fucking... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Can they even be called ants? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - But when there's a lot of them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, but that's the problem with it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's not just a single ant. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Ants don't travel solo. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> They're not like fucking
wolves. They're not like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - You don't see a single
ant in your house, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you're like, "Oh, fuck." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - They're normally like,
they're very kind though, ants. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> They have a nice line that directs you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to exactly where they came from. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They're really, really
considerate in that sense. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> But they'd get into
the bread bin and stuff </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they'd get into like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, like the sugar
containers and stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - They're really good at finding it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - We had that a lot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - They're so good at finding it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - You think you've sealed
that bread box up tight. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can't find where the snacks are hidden </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> in my house, sometimes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So I have to follow the trail. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - My parents would hide them, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but the ants would always find them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They'd always lead me to them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'd never really had such
a big ant problem in the UK. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was more when I was in Thailand. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] It might be where you live. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, 'cause
whenever I'm in Thailand, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you have a piece of food out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or you drop a tiny bit
of crumb or something, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> a timer starts right before you, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the timer starts before
you can clean it up, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> otherwise the ants are
gonna clean up for you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then you're just
kinda have a line of ants </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> just marching through your home. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And the thing about Thai ants </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is that they're pretty
fucking big as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'd rather them be big
though, easier to kill. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> No, no, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Assume it's like a super villain. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know when you step on an ant? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- And it doesn't die. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And you're like, what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This is how the villains feel in movies </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> when their attack doesn't work. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What do you mean my attack failed? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But, in the UK, ants are
just a slight annoyance, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because what the fuck can
they do to you, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - What do you mean,
they can eat your food. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> They make it like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yes, slight annoyance. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Slight annoyance. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's very big annoyance. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They don't bite you or
anything, like some do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'd rather them bite
me than take my food. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Really?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Have you ever been bitten by an ant? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Not yet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I don't think
you'll say the same thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> once you get bitten by one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Not like the fucking... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What's that guy called on YouTube? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Coyote Peterson or whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Not those kind of ants where he's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Well, my hand has swollen in
19 times the original size. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I could scarcely breathe,
but this is mildly painful." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Even if it's something like, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> even if it's not like
toxic or super painful, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that is more of an annoyance
than the ants eating your food. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If it was a mild pain, I'd
rather that than have to like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - What if it's a lot of mild pains </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause it's a lot of ants. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - A lot of mild pains.
- A lot of mild pains. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - A lot of mild pains,
what does that mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because you're not gonna get- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Can you an example
of a lot of mild pain? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, because, you know, there is... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Can you give me another example? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because you're not gonna, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because when an ant bites you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that just invites the
other ants to also attack. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - What's going on where I'm
gonna give them a second chance? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - You never know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - What is this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You'd be like, "Ooh, that hurt. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Another, another please." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Again, yes, again.
- One more time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Put them on my nipples, please. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Bite me again. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do you have to deal with any
annoying pests in Australia? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That is the entry requirement. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> When you get in the border, they're like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh mate, do you mind if a
koala bites on your toes, mate? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, for what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't even think I've ever
seen a koala in the wild. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Dude, I wanna see a koala. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They're extremely rare in the wild </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because they're so hidden. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But, my house, we used to have these wasps </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that flew around all the time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Fuck, how'd you get rid of wasps? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You don't. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> The last time I went home,
I remember I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> my dad was like, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Son, come and join me
for a beer on the balcony, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's a nice day", and
I'm like, "Yeah, sure." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I walk out and there's like
20 wasps just flying around. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause I had to-
- And I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Father, there are a lot of wasps </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> flying around your face right now." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he's like, "Yeah, it's all right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They won't sting you." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, "Okay". </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why do wasps exist? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Do they do anything good for anyone? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> They are the dickheads of the internet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Not the internet, the insect world. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - You can say that about
so many creatures though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - But like, so a lot of creatures </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't actively try to be
dickheads and sting you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And the thing is at least nature- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Are you judging an animal's worth </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> based on how annoying it is to people? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Kind of, kind of, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fair enough. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - What do wasps do for nature? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because, you know, bees, they make honey, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they pollinise flowers and you know what, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> at least nature had the
decency to Nerf bees, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They get one shot.
- One shot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's like their nuclear option, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> That's like they'll fight for their lives. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is how super villains are born? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It starts with wasps, Garnt,
what's the next step? Huh? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Like I would be- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - People under six foot, is that the next? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] I would be happy- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - What the point of people under six foot? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They can't reach the
shelves I've designed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I would gladly be racist towards wasps. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - All right, well that's an out of context </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> clip in the making, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I would gladly be racist, cut. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - No 'cause- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Garnt's the kind of guy,
where if he got a death note, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the first thing he'd write is wasp. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Wasps. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just every wasp. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Everything that annoys me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like one by one, one by one,
by name, every single wasp. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is that a syntax error
for the death note? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It comes back, it's like,
"Sorry, did not spell correctly." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I should preface, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I actually have a phobia
of bees and wasps. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I dunno if I've ever talked about this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You have told us. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> You got stung in the eye as a kid. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, I forgot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. Okay, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I would have that, for sure. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, but the thing is, I've grown, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> even though I'm fucking
deadly scared of them, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I still in my heart, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I still understand why bees are a thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think, you know, after
years of conditioning, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like bumble bees, they look kind of cute. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They look like furry and
big and they pollinise- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They're chunky.
- Yeah, they're chunky. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, let's give them a hug. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Have you taken any steps </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> towards trying to
conquer you fear of bees? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Erm, bees- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Maybe we should do like a
fear factoresque kind of thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> where we have a- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - What would the steps be though? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why don't we play
Dark Souls music, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, (hums tune) and then we bring out, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and Garnt, your punishment for
the "Trash Taste After Dark" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is that you have to put
your head in a box of bees. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - What?
- What? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - What, is this fear factor? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, let's do it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Would you do that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - If you told me, if... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Okay, here's the thing,
right, I'm an idiot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> If some guy came on, he's
probably, he's always Australian. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause on every single wildlife show </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where there's a wildlife expert, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the fucker's always Australian. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Of course.
- He'll come on and be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh yeah, they won't sting you." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And then 10 seconds later,
you're like, (screams). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And he'll like, "Oh, you're
fine though. You're fine." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You're gonna die, don't worry. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It changes to, "Oh, you won't die." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah yeah, yeah.
- But yeah, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If some wildlife expert told me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that it's safe to do it, I'd do it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - What, stick your head in a box of bees? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- I would not do it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> You couldn't pay me to do that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's a big fucking step. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean like, I dunno if- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - How much for you to put
your hand in a box of bees? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - For how long? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - How much you're willing to pay me? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - One minute. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - One minute? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - One minute. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> What is the minimum price you'd do it for? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know.
- 10. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I would gladly do it for like five. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Five? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, five Gs. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Five Gs. Yeah, 10 G for me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh no, it would have to
be more than 10 for me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know, maybe. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Or maybe just for content. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - For that sweet ad revenue, baby. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - That sweet ad revenue. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - If I'm just chilling in
my living room, and you, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Connor, how much to put
your hand in a box of bees". </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I'd be like, "Ah, five
grand" and then they do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But if it's for content,
I probably do it for free. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, here's the thing, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because before, like when I was a kid, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I couldn't even look at... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I couldn't even look at videos of bees. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'd see a bee and I'd literally scream </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and run inside and shut the screen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - So if we got a box of bees, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you would do it for content. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> How do we get a box of bees? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Maybe, maybe. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Don't give the audience an idea. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How do they do this on shows? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> How do they get a box of bees? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I go through phases where, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe out of a sense of morbid curiosity, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I look at bee cleaning
or bee videos on YouTube. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And just seeing these beekeepers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> just fucking scooping
up these pile of bees. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And just them casually being like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh, you know, they're
very friendly today. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've only been stung three times." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, you've been stung three times </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and that's it, that's it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'd be fucking... one time
is more than enough for me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I wonder how many
times would you get stung </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if your hand was in that box for a minute, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with like a hundred bees? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think if you just stay still- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Nothing.
- Probably nothing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - But if you're doing this... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is ignorant wilful, what is it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Wilful ignorance? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, wilful ignorance, I think. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, I'm sure we could get some. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Bees maybe, because bees
maybe, wasps, get the fuck out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm coming here with a flame thrower. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Bees, bees, bees. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - If you come here with
wasps, 'cause like, I think- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - How about we put your hand in a box </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> with a feral hyena, Garnt? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What do you reckon? For a minute? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - For one minute.
- For one minute. We all win. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - For content. For content. (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - For content. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I dunno, it's like, I've
also like been glad... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Have you ever seen a hornet as well? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Those are fucking terrifying.
I think I've seen one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We have the killer hornets here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You have the killer hornets here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, those, I don't
wanna fuck with those. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Those are like scary. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Those are scary. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, especially, I
remember seeing the video </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of just hornet... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it sounds like a fucking
anime fight or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like hornets versus
bees and it's the- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Dude, that video's epic. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Where the bees surround it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, the bees surround it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's not even like
a war, it's a massacre. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause the hornet, like one hornet </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> takes down a fucking hundred
bees or something, and it's... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like-
- No, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The bees fuck up the hornet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, really?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We've seen different videos
then, 'cause I've seen- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's two different fights. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I dunno which bee it
is, but there's videos </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where there is a way
that they kill the hornet </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> by basically they all just
compact themselves on the hornet. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right.
- And they roll around </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they do it with such energy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that it actually just
burns the hornet alive. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - What, like through friction? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it kills the
hornet by being so hot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Holy shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's fucking metal. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Japanese.
- Japanese honeybees. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Crew Member] Japanese honeybees. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They kill the Japanese, they surround it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and they compact like a ball and they roll </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and keep suffocating it and burning it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What the fuck? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] It's so badass.
- What? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That is fucking badass.
- It's so cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm sure there'll be a clip
on the screen right now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It's fucking cool, it's so cool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like nature sometimes is like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That just sounds like a Shonen power. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I just love it that these
bees figured this out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They're like, fuck it,
just throw ourselves at it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - How the bees figure that out? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know, man.
- Fucking hell. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Have you heard of friction? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We could use that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, because the only video I've seen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is where it's just these
bees, this hive of bees, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> just fucking chilling, making honey. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Then these fucking group
of 10 hornets or something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just come on and start fucking
biting their heads off, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> massacre this entire
hive and then fuck off. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, Jesus Christ.
(Connor hums) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Where was that in "Bee Movie"? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, fucking nature can
be fucking metal sometimes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I remember seeing this video, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not about bees, but I think it was ants. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And scientists were like... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they were studying fire ants
because fire ants have a way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when they're moving in a
group or have, they have... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> How can I word this? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> When they're, what do
you call a group of ants. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - A colony? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, colony of ants, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the way they act and behave sometimes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can behave like a liquid </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and sometimes can behave like a solid. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is certain ants, I think,
can do it, not all of them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, not all of them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think is it was fire ants. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They can cross water
by bunching together. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And basically becoming
kind of like a pseudo solid. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then they can kind of like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, so they can have, these
ants can have, as a colony, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have properties of a liquid or a solid, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> depending on the situation.
- That's so dope. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And they were like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> scientists were literally studying them </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to try and apply this
to like real life metals </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and real life applications. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just like, "That
sounds so fucking metal" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Can humans become liquid
if we try hard enough? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm solid Joey now,
soon I'll be liquid Joey. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I am solid Joey. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But no, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> That's the weird nature videos </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've seen every now and again. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Did you guys watch a lot of nature videos? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah, I fucking love
nature documentaries. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] I think... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I grew up watching... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause they used to
just do constant reruns </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> of every David Attenborough documentary. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I suppose in fucking Australia,
they would have had loads. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah, we love that shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Go outside and you'll
see your local kangaroo </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fighting a koala bear. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, the only kangaroo club was the one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where the guy punched
the kangaroo in the face. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, that was a good one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That one was all over Australian
news for like two months. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah, I remember. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - He was saving his dog. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - What's that about? What's that like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - The kangaroo was like...
- Yeah, the kangaroo- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - He had the dog.
- Yeah, he had his dog </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> in a grip, in like a vice group. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How does that happen? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> The clip literally starts
with the guy in his truck, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just calling out to the dog being like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh no, fucking Terry", </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or whatever the fuck his name was, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't remember what it was. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And he jumps out and the camera pans over </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and this red kangaroo, like, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> beefy motherfucker, standing
like two meters tall </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> just has the dog in a grip like this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And the dog's just like, "Help me." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It has the most like, help
face that I've ever seen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And he squares up and the
kangaroo's fucking squaring up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and that's really dangerous </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because one kick from this red kangaroo, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the chest, that dude is dead. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> A hundred percent.
- Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But no, this guy's like the biggest </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> mega chat on the planet, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which just goes whack and
just socks him in the face. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And the kangaroo's like, "What the fuck?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He looks around and he's like, "No". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He just jumps away. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And he saves the dog. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think as well, the kangaroo
felt threatened by the dog, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think, so the kangaroo also
tried to kick the dog as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> So the dog could have died too. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But what do kangaroo
eat? What do they eat? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Grass. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Are they herbivores?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But they're also very- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Pretty fucking strong for herbivores. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - But they're also extremely
territorial as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is the picture I've
seen of jacked kangaroos, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is that Photoshopped or is that real? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I could never tell if it...
I've seen it in memes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Some of them are real </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm sure some of them are overdone. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But red kangaroos, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> which are like the biggest
breed of kangaroos, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they on average stand
like two meters tall. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean Australia has the
most interesting wildlife. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean that's because it was Pangaea, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on its own for like hundreds
of thousands of years. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- So all these weird animals. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was like one of the
first ones to break off. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, so it's had hundreds
of thousands of years. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> But that's also why
it's also super delicate </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and why when they introduce foreign pests, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it completely fucked up Australia. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They have a rabbit problem. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know about this,
do you know about this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But they can't kill the rabbits. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Do you know why?
- Why? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because people don't want
'em to kill the rabbits, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but the rabbits are
literally killing everything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Everyone's like, "Oh, the
bunnies are so cute though". </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And farmers are like, "Er." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - They eat everything and
there's nothing left for the... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you know, 'cause rabbits are like insane. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They're so good at taking everything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- And fucking. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like the British.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They literally, well, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I think it was brought
over by a British guy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Of course it was. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because the guy wanted to hunt rabbits </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in Australia.
- In Australia. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So he brought over some rabbits. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I could be incorrect on this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And obviously rabbits are
very, very good at expanding. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so they have a terrible problem </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they've been trying to, they had a... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> they were gonna start culling
them and getting rid of them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But obviously trying
to pass a thing saying, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Hey, we're gonna murder
a million plus rabbits. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Is that cool with everyone?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> A lot of people are like,
"No, rabbits are so cute. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We can't get rid of rabbits." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But it's like, "But our wildlife is..." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "But, but rabbits are cute." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Brings up a really interesting question </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> of is it, you know, obviously- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just because it's cute. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - At which point do you count something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> as a pest that needs control? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, I think when it's actively- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - When it's actively fucking
up the natural wildlife. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, that's the problem, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is that the delicate
ecosystem that Australia has, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because it's so susceptible
to pests and stuff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think the rabbit, which
just like went crazy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and so many of the natural- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - What does it fuck up? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What do the rabbits fuck up? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, they eat everything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> They take everything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because they eat all the food </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that the natural animals are supposed to. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Or native, rather.
- Rabbits are only, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from what I understand,
they are only limited </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> by how much food there is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They can breed and make
as many of themselves </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as they need to. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just, is there enough food available? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And they're really good
at getting it as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, what are those fucking tiny rats </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> with big ears and a tail, in Australia? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, Bilbies. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, those things eat
shit compared to the rabbits. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The rabbits absolutely
cream them in everything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And also rabbits, like
rabbits eat their own babies. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do they?
- Yeah. Google it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Do they actually?
- Do they? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- That's metal as fuck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Crew Member] A lot of that
animals eat their babies. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Rabbits don't give a fuck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Everyone's like, "Oh,
rabbits are so cute." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Rabbits eat their fucking babies, bro. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Well, you gonna call something cute </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when it's devouring its first born child. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like, all right, if I eat this one, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I can just make another one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Crew Member] They
do, but only sometimes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, sometimes.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - But, like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - The fact that that's
even an option is nasty. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, let's be honest, humans are... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> let's not pretend like
humans haven't done it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> All right, we're not great. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If we judge the whole species
by one or two rogue rabbits, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> then maybe. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, the one thing that
doesn't make sense to me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I guess.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is okay, rabbits are
fucking thriving in Australia. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They're beating the shit
out of Australian wildlife. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Why is it not a problem in the UK? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well-
- Because you guys </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> don't have enough native animals, maybe? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, rabbits are,
as far as I understand, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> they're native to the UK. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So the whole ecosystem in
the UK had been created </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> with rabbits being in
it for a very long time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If I'm correct. Can you Google this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Crew Member] Foxes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Foxes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, the foxes eat the rabbits, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, you need to
have the balance, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm just finding it funny </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that rabbits can survive
fucking Australia, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> where you look at a spider
wrong and you're fucking dead. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And then in the UK, what the? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> In the UK, foxes are
like the biggest pussies </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> of the animal kingdom- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Australia has a lot of
species that are like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, you're playing
on the the easy server. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like-
- What? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - A lot of these, even though we know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Australia is like one of
these super scary animals </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with these snakes and stuff, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they have a lot of species of animals </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that can only survive in Australia. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - And it's very delicate. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well like koalas, for
example, only eat eucalyptus </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and a specific type of eucalyptus </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that's grown only in Australia natively. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So that's why you don't
see koalas in the wildlife, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> outside anywhere else because
they literally can't survive. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - In any other continent, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the animal probably wouldn't have evolved </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> to just eat one type of plant
that is very not popular. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know what I mean?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - You would have to adapt. Go on, sir. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. So. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay.
- But in Australia, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're like, it's our
territory now, baby. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - If you introduce a species
it's a problem why these, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> obviously people didn't
understand this in the 1900's. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> We didn't fucking know what was going on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They were like, "Just bring my pets over. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm sure it'll be fine." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - What I understand is that the argument </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> of why we shouldn't be
getting rid of these rabbits. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, "Oh, they're so cute though." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Meanwhile, when the Australian
government was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> "Eat the kangaroos, right now", </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no one was like, "But they're so cute." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, this is also a
common thing with cats. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Cats are more often, a
very big pest in places. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> People don't wanna get rid of cats </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because people have pets, they have cats. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If the government is
like, " Hey, you at home, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are you okay with us
killing all of this animal?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And you look down and you see
that animal staring at you, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that you've loved and named and fed, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's really hard and- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - So what you're saying is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> less people need to keep rabbits as pets. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughs)
- No, no, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I understand both-
- To change the status quo. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What he's saying, is
rabbits have way too good PR. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] That is literally-
- That PR is too fucking good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They're like the McDonald's of animals. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> They've got it down, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You can tell them that McDonald's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> puts all the shit in their food, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It doesn't fucking matter.
People are gonna eat it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like I understand both sides, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I empathize with both. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I empathize with these poor people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who care about the natural
wildlife, who are like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "We need to keep it the
way it was supposed to be." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I also understand why that
person with 10 rabbits at home </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> might not wanna have all of
the rabbit population culled. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I get both, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Also, another fun fact, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> while we're on fun facts about animals. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Go on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Did you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I love this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I was watching an episode
of QI the other day </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they talking about this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do you know why, for the longest time, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they never gave the
giant tortoise a genome, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like an official genome name. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why? What's a genome? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - You know how every name,
every animal has a Greek name. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right.
- Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do you know why they never
gave the giant turtle a name? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - No.
- No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - They knew about this
animal for a very long time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Right?
- Problem was- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - These are the motherfuckers
that can live like 300 years. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Problem was people
couldn't stop eating them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They never ever made it back. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, I did hear about this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Every time they tried
to ship the tortoise- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - People would just eat them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it would never survive the journey </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause they were too delicious. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Apparently through the... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause we don't eat it anymore, obviously. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Crew Member] 'Cause there's none left. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause there's none left, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they're an endangered species now, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - In the writing, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it is literally like the perfect storm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> of unfortunate for the giant tortoise. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, apparently, in all of the documents </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> left about the giant tortoise, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it tastes better than any meat. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It tastes better than lamb.
It tastes better than beef. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It tastes better than pork. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Everyone almost unanimously
agreed, who tried this meat, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> agreed that it tasted better
than all of them, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Damn, I wanna try it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right. Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Another unfortunate evolutional part </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of the giant tortoise is that it also, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> this is just so sad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It evolved so that it could store </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> up to one gallon or one liter of water, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I can't remember which one it was. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Inside of its body, almost
perfectly like a sack. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> So when you would eat it as a human, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there was almost perfectly
this one liter capsule. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - So basically, it came with a drink. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laugh)
- It came with a... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like a meal. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Imagine it, you've just had
this, you're living in this- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's just a survival pack. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - At the end of the day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You're living in the time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where beer was drank more than water, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because water was, more
often than not, poisonous. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was hard to get a
hold of in certain places. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So you had this animal
that tasted amazing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That was this perfect kind of, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like it could store very easily. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was very easy to eat.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Or a lot of the meat
was edible in it as well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it had this one gallon sack of water </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that you could just drink. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So sailors would, when
they would take them back, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they were like, "Well
fuck, we're gonna eat it." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because not only was
it delicious and amazing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they also had a free gallon
of water they could drink. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So it never made it back. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wait, so does it have a genome now? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It did, it did after
after many, many years, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it finally got one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just, food. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But it never survived the journey </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> back to the UK or something.
- Wow. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Unfortunately, it could
never be classified. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just... (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's just so good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's really fucked up,
but that's hilarious. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, that was really funny. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Can you imagine it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You're just on the boat,
and you're like, fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just wanna imagine
the scientists waiting. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> They're like, "All right,
I wanna see this animal </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so I can figure it out." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They're like, "What do
you mean you ate it?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They're like, they're on the port back. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They're like, we're gonna bring back 10. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We're gonna eat nine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We're gonna let one go back. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> All right, we all agree, one can go back. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We only need one to name it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then that's like
one week left on the ship </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they're like, "Fuck, dude. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Remember that flambeed giant
tortoise we had, dude." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Ooh. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's looking kind of
delicious right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm getting real parched. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just makes me wonder how
good must it have tasted. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it must have been amazing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> They come back to port. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> They're like, "All right,
we brought 10 back. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We got one, how many shells? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We got like one, two, three... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Fuck, we ate them all." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> What the fuck? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Next trip guys, next trip. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This time we're gonna bring 11. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - The way they wrote about it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was that it was so delicious that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it sounded like they genuinely </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just couldn't resist eating it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But like, imagine it's that delicious. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We were like, "Boys, do you fancy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> just going for a quick
voyage to the islands </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to go and get some more giant tortoises." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And they just keep eating it every time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'd like to think it was that good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that they would go back
to go and get more. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Me and the boys on the
way to get giant tortoises. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Oh. Oh, dude. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's an endangered species now, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It's an endangered species now, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Crew Member] It's extinct. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's... (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, I thought it was just endangered </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, we fucked up.
- Okay, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Crew Member] We ate all of them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - So it's kind like the
Dodo as well, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Crew Member] I don't
think we ate the Dodo. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But, I would rather it
was... okay, I'm not... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't want us to
extinct any animal, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But I would rather us extinct an animal </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause it's too damn delicious, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not that we wanted its horn or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That feels so wasteful. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If we're like, "Dude,
we made an amazing stew </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> out of the giant tortoise", </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> part of me is like, "That's fucked up". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay, at least you used it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - At which point do you think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> natural selection should
just take its course? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right.
- Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay, I'm just saying... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Are you saying, it's your fault </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for being born this delicious. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know, I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - He's got a point. He's got a point. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> If this...why the fuck? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This animal just was so unfortunate </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that it evolved to be the
perfect food for humans to eat. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - You fucked up in some way in evolution </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> by being super delicious. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And having a free sack of clean water. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm sorry, you kind of
are, you kind of are, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> They just didn't survive, obviously. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Again, every part of the
tortoise was also edible. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The marrow apparently was also
delicious in soups and stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was, every single part of
this fucker was delicious. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This tortoise had evolved somehow </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to be so goddamn delicious. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't get it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm angry that I'm
never gonna get to try it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I'm angry that I'm
never gonna try it now as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> So, I mean, I'm more
angry that it's extinct </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I can't try it now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fuck it's feelings, I wanna eat it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Listen, listen, we care about- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Can it be like the McRib or something, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just come back for a month. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We care about nature or
something, all that bullshit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but you know, the delicious animal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, we've talked about
eating possible dinosaurs </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and all the dinosaurs we might
not possibly be able to eat. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Where's the Jurassic Park episode </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where they bring back a extinct animal </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so they can just serve
it as a delicacy, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's all I'm saying. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - We brought, the sign is like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> we brought back the T-Rex </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> because we heard flambeing
this shit, mm, so good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's what Jurassic
Park would actually be. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It wouldn't be a... it
would be a restaurant. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It wouldn't be a theme park. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It wouldn't be a theme
park, it would be... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause like, come on, come on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If you bring back an extinct animal, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's gonna be that
one fucker who's like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Me, I'm gonna be that fucker. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How do they taste? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Come on, there's gotta... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> there's definitely gonna
be a dinosaur restaurant </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> somewhere in the world. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Of course. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, it's, you know, the turtle, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's unfortunate that it
was perfectly evolved to be- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - To be eaten.
- I mean- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - The writing was on the wall. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - There are some animals
where I'm just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> without humans you'd be fucking,
you'd be on your last legs. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We saved you. You should
grateful, snow leopard. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How did pandas become
China's national animal, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Because, isn't it like panda's,
isn't it like they have to- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - They don't fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - They do not fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They just refuse to have
fucking have offspring and fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm just like, if you have an animal </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that just does anything
that it possibly could </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> to willingly not fucking breed, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at which point do you just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe they just don't wanna exist anymore. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - They don't wanna exist anymore. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> What, the panda's just
like, we just wanna die. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Could you stop? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Here's the problem
with us as humans when, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think, it comes to us
with extinct animals. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The amount of shit we give
about saving an animal </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> is inherently tied to how cute it is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That is such a... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I refuse to believe any other explanation. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That is true. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - If you told us, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh, we have to save this
one species of flounder", </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people would be like, "Oh." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "I think we can live without a flounder." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - But it's delicious. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it's like, oh. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's two things people care about. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Is it delicious? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And is it cute?
- And is it cute? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right, if a panda wasn't as
cute as it is, would we care? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Probably not as much.
- Let's be honest. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> We are so fucking biased. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> All the animals we wanna save </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> are either cool as fuck or cute as fuck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - That is true.
- Think about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Think of an animal off top of the head </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that people are trying to help, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like you see campaigns about and stuff, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where the animal isn't cute or cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, I don't know how, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The most endangered
species I know are pandas. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Cute.
- Tigers, maybe? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Name an extinct animals, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that are going extinct.
- Tigers. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Cool, yeah.
- Cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, it's just any
animal with good PR, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> But to get good PR, you
need to be cute, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Cute or like badass. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like, if a species
of snake was dying out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah, those snake people
online would, oh, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Snake people.
- Snake people. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know who I'm talking about, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but most people wouldn't
give a shit, let's be honest. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You're not gonna see the
fundraisers about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just being honest, that's how we are. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We're so fucking biased as humans. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We love to be like, oh
yeah, save all the animals, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> except the ugly ones. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Fuck 'em, they can die. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Unless they're like exceptionally ugly, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like the blob fish where
it just becomes a meme, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> then it's like, well now we gotta save it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> because look at this motherfucker. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Now it's fugly, now it's just great. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Now it's like, it's so ugly, it's cute. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Now I'm fucking cheering for it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> because it's the fucking underdog. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Now look at it. No-one's
gonna cheer for that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So now I'm gonna cheer for that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] He's doing his best. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - We're like, oh, we need
to save the tooth fish. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's just a fish that
is just like, literally, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> razor blades and like no eyes or face. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They're like, well, no
one gives a fuck if it dies. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, I... don't get me wrong. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm sure the scientists
who spend their life </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> researching these stuff will be very sad, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but the general population doesn't care </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and let's not pretend like we do. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> We don't, we don't, let's not... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, we don't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - We only care when it's already happened. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah. I guess so. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, animals have been going extinct </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> for the entire history of nature itself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm not saying we should
just let them go extinct. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, no, I'm not saying that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm saying I feel like...
- Fuck 'em. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel like we should
try to preserve nature </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as much as we can. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Of course.
- Of course. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - But you know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We're not gonna be like,
weak mindset, see ya. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - What are we, the board
meeting of the fucking "Lorax"? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> What is this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think we should get
rid of all the plants, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> make more museums. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> We need more water parks. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Fuck them, fuck the planet. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, if humans
have had a direct effect </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> on making this animal extinct, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think, yeah, we should
take responsibility. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We should be like, okay, yeah, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we kind of fucked up
their entire environment, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> their entire habitat. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Let's try not to do that again, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> unless they're delicious of course. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - You think rabbits have this meeting? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Should we start fucking? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Does seem like we're taking
over a lot of things. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - He's enjoying it too much. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Consume, consume, fuck, consume. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - This episode is sponsored by ExpressVPN. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Watching Netflix
without using ExpressVPN </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is like buying tickets to
a Taylor Swift concert, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but only being able to
watch the opening act. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's horrible.
- I wanna see Taylor. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - As you know, a lot of content
on Netflix is region locked. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Luckily we get all the anime, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I'm missing a lot of
good old British TV shows. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But thanks to ExpressVPN,
that's a problem of the past. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Because
ExpressVPN lets you change </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> your online location to wherever you want. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Control where you want Netflix
or other streaming websites </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to think you're located and boom, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all of those libraries will
be open to you like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I actually use ExpressVPN quite often. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Just one tap on the app. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's very easy.
- Very easy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's very easy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I dunno what else there is to say. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's easy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You can pick any country you want. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And if you wanna change your
region for whatever reason, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> be it content or if you're shopping, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> buying tickets for stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know, you sometimes
get cheaper flights. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So yeah, it's really easy to use. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - So, what are you waiting for? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Be smart. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Stop paying full prices
for streaming services </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and only getting a
fraction of their content. </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_00> - Back to the episode. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Have you ever had to clear out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wasp infestation or whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It sucks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What's the process around that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - A broom and running shoes? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, in the UK, I think
you just call a specialist. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But I think a lot of people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> just take matters into their own hands. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, we just take
matters into our own hands. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, because I know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've had to see Sydney's
dad deal with a wasp nest, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> a wasp nest being just newly formed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And even that was just
like, I am standing behind, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like six foot of bulletproof glass </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> while I'm watching you do this because I- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - How did he deal with
it? Did he shoot it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's the most American thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Not on my property.
- Bang. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Honey, get the shotgun. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - He had a broom, he had a broom as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> But yeah, he had a shotgun just in case. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - There is no good reason to own an M16 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> unless there's a wasp. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. I have seen- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm gonna shoot them down one at a time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I seen a video on YouTube of Americans </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I think they were Texans </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> getting rid of wasps nest with a shotgun </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it went exactly how you think it went. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, shit.
(Joey imitates shooting) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Wasps immediately come and attack. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Is there any fucking
animals that terrify you, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you'd see and you're
like, (blows raspberry) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think Australia's just
conditioned me to be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as long as it doesn't kill me,
I'm not really afraid of it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's no one particular animal or bug </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that scares me the most. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If there's a deer or
a bear in front of me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah, I'm gonna be scared. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We've already spoke about this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, we have.
- Scared. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's not so much me being
scared of a lot of animals, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just being creeped
out or cautious about them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not scared of a cockroach, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I'm not like, "Ooh
yay, little cockroach." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, I don't love it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, you know what's... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay, one bug, not scary. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like 50 bugs together,
freaks me the fuck out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Ah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I'm actually the same. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, I fucking hate spiders. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, only a few people
don't hate spiders, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but I actually prefer,
the bigger the spider is, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> the more comforting it is for me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because at least I can see it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It never leaves my view.
- Easier to kill. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It is, it's like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Get the shotgun. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - A larger hit box. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Literally, it's got like
a larger hit box, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> In case I wanna do something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Those fucking small
spiders that scurry about, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> those are the ones that
fucking keep me up at night. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I dunno why, I dunno why. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's the one thing I
don't miss about the UK. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I had a lot of spiders
in my house in Wales. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Are any of them poisonous there? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, no, you just don't wanna see, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like when they go under your
bed and you've lost them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Weak mindset. (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It does suck when you see a
spider go underneath your bed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and you're like, I'm dead. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh no, the worst one
is when you're sleeping </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and you see it on the ceiling </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you blink and it's just disappeared. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've had like loads of mice
and rat problems in the UK. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Have I told you about that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No. Actually I think you have. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think so. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've had rats in Swansea
and I had mice in London. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right, what's the difference
between a mouse and rat? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, you know the difference. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Rat is like a huge mouse. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Rats are like, well
they're massive, dude. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They're fucking disgusting. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Rats are like the mega Chads.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - And the mice is just like civilians. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Mice aren't that scary
but mice are so fast. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Rats are fast. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Mice move at like the
fucking speed of light though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And also the thing that sucks about mice </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is that they can... no
gap is too small for mice. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Sure.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They can fit through anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So they would go under the door, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even though the clearance is like this, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they would like squeeze underneath. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They turn into a liquid form. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Literally, literally dude. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember 'cause we were... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it was so funny 'cause
this maisonette in London </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that was created, it was being touted </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as being rat and mouse proof. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That was the whole point
behind the building. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And the landlord was extremely furious </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when I told him about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, "Yeah man, oh, we got mice." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And he's like, "What? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I bought this place specifically </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I was told that
it couldn't have mice." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, "Well we got mice". And so he- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - How do you make a
place mouse and rat free? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's not possible. I
don't think it's possible. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And so we had these mice </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and they always came out at night. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I dunno if that's normal.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I never saw them during the day, but- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Are they nocturnal? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I dunno, it was horrible though </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I'd be in my bed watching Netflix. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> TV's there, door is here
and I'd just see a shadow. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (imitates air whooshing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - In my room. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I've had that before. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I was like, what the fuck? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's so weird, we don't
get mice and rats in Australia. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Might be too hot.
- I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well I think it's 'cause all the snakes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are fucking eating them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They get like fucked by
snakes and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - And cats and stuff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We tried all this expensive
stuff for killing them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> In the end, the thing that
killed them the most was just- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Mouse trap? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - The basic Amazon mouse trap. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It would clap their cheese. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Don't fix something
that's not broken, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think the poison killed some of them, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but we ended up just
needing to like clog it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But the thing is, they
chew through everything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No matter what you
clog it with, they just, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they get through it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Like in New York, the rats
can chew through concrete. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. Yeah.
- Holy shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Little by little, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Insane, it's insane. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The one pest that-
- That's some Shawshank shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, the one pest that terrifies me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of ever getting, is termites. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I've never known anyone with termites. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, we had termites. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's not really a problem
unless you have a wood house, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> though, isn't it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah yeah, yeah, 'cause
at my parents' place </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> had a termite infestation and it was scary </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it's like, oh the
house might come down. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's the one of the few pests that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you have it in your house, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and under the right conditions,
it could just kill you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Right, because you- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, 'cause wooden houses
in Australia mainly, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yes.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - So yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How'd you deal with termites, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like what's the process around
getting rid of termites? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - When it comes to termites, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you just have to call
a specialist for that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Don't they just like gas the place? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Pretty much. They like
smoke it out basically. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, we had a termite, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it wasn't a massive
infestation, but we were like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah, we should probably
get rid of these now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> because if they expand, yeah,
the house is gonna come down. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Like, so fuck that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's fucking terrifying. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's so scary. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's so sick that when they do that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like when they just put
gas all in the house. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- I find that so cool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, why?
- Why is that cool? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like, wow, they
just put like a tent </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> over the house and gas it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, that's so badass. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Who thought, "Oh, we
gotta kill these rats. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh, Oh we gotta use these rat poison." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And the guy's like, "Hold up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Boys, what if we gas the whole house." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What if we nuke the house? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I'm like, the first
time someone suggested that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> someone must been like, you're crazy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, no, no, hold on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What if we put a big tent, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a comically large tent around the house. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Someone's like, you're a genius. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Let's try it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - How else are they gonna
get rid of thousands </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> of tiny insects just living
in every single crevice. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They're not gonna be like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're gonna be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> well it's either like the
tent or the flame thrower. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like, before we
get the flame thrower out, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> maybe we should throw out a tent, maybe. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think the one job on earth, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sort of somewhat related to this, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> not dealing with getting
rid of bugs and stuff, but. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know people who clean houses </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> after people have died.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's the one job I
don't think I could do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, it depends how horribly they die. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, 'cause normally, you
know, when you get older, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you struggle to take care of yourself, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> so the house gets really
like, you know, fucked. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And I saw one on Japan, so
depressing and it's just like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, it happens very often in Japan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And they go in and they're just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> well, we're just gonna take
all this guy's possessions </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and trash them and stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, "Oh, oh, don't
break my heart, dude. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Just go into someone's
house trying to figure out, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what their life was and
stuff, I couldn't do it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, I mean, I guess, I mean like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're like, oh, I don't give a fuck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Bring in the trash truck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I thought you meant people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who had been brutally
murdered or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, that's what I thought. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was like, yeah,
that's a pretty bad job. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, that's probably one part of it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but what if you're a guy who
couldn't take care of yourself, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you're like 70 and you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> maybe you couldn't make it
to the toilet and stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know, I feel like- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - And the room smells-
- Like you shit yourself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well yeah, it happens, it happens. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, I think that'd be like a fine job. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, it's- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What? Can't say I'll do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Gimme a tenner. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, it's not a pleasant job, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but I feel like it's... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Would it not freak you out, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just knowing that someone was there, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and living there, like a week ago. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That'll freak me out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think you'd get pretty numb
to it after a while, though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Dunno.
- I mean, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel like cleaning
out all of their stuff, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you'd just be like, "Oh,
this is someone's legacy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> This is someone's entire life". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Why would that freak you out? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I dunno, just trying to
figure out what happened? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, what was their life like? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Maybe that wouldn't, I think
that's super interesting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You get a peak into someone's... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not saying this is like a
glorious job or something, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I think, if someone died peacefully </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of old age or something and
you're cleaning their house, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I think that would be a
really interesting way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to really piece together
what kind of person they are- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm think, unfortunately,
in the modern era, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we have this peaceful ignorance </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that we think that a lot of
deaths are this pleasant. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> He passed away with
his friends and family. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Especially in Japan and stuff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, "No, Tanaka San
died age 90 in his apartment </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and his family hadn't
seen him in five years </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and he doesn't have any friends. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And he's just a skeleton now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it's yeah-
- It happens. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause the video was following
this guy, that I watched, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and he was cleaning it
out and he was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Yep, it looks like he
tried to make some food </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right before he passed,
but he wasn't able to." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's like, "Oh".
- Heartbreaking, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Man just wanted a curry, dude. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> We all deserve that, we all
deserve just a nice meal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Before the curry. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Wait, so how did they die then? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, you know, if you
are getting really old </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you're not able to make
it to the toilet and stuff </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you can barely get outta bed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and no one's there to help you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know, it can be really fucked. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know, one day your
heart could just be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I don't think so", and
then just stop, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wow. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, I think there are worse ways </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to pass away than that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They died in their home and you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think that would be something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where a lot of people wish to pass away. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think a worst job is the people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who have to clean up
after train accidents. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, that would be traumatic for you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - That would suck ass. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like to me, if I knew
a guy died peacefully, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> peacefully of old age in their own house, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, you know what? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Death is never a nice thing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but if there was a way
that I would want to go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it would be like that, you know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just nice and peaceful in
the comfort of my own home. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just like very quietly, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just like reflecting
on that person's life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Meanwhile, it's like, oh cool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This guy jumped in front of a train. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I have to pick up his
fucking pieces of his skull. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know, I would much
rather do the house job </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> than the other one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I remember I stayed at an Airbnb once </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and the guy running this Airbnb </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was this old Japanese guy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He was in his seventies or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And he was showing us, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> giving us a tour around the house. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's a bit morbid actually, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but just one block away from
the house was a graveyard. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Right?
- Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And we had to walk
through this graveyard </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to get to his house, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And he pauses at one of the graves </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and he talks about, oh, this is, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, my dad's here,
my granddad is here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm gonna be right there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And me and Sydney go. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - He's always prepared. He's prepared. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> How do you react to that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> How'd you react to, I got
an old guy being like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah, I'm gonna be there in a few years. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like-
- Why wait, let's do it now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Hoe came outta nowhere. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But I mean, I can't
even begin to empathize </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> what my thoughts would
be like at that age. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> At what point do you just
accept your own mortality- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] I think that's kind of badass. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Come to terms with it,
come to peace with it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think it's kind of badass though, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> to be like, just kind of facing reality </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and being like, you know
what, I'm gonna be there soon. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just gonna enjoy life,
while I still have it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of thing, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- He's pre-ordering. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> He pre-ordered his gravestone. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - He pre-ordered the gravestone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Pre-ordered death. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - He had the space, and everything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was just like, "Oh fuck." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> To me, as a young guy, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to me as a guy in his thirties, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, "Dude, that's
a bit morbid to me." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> But I mean, I don't know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> at that age, I dunno how I'd feel. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, people in Japan
like everything planned out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's true. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - They like everything to be predictable. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They're like, "I wanna know when I'm dying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> so I can fucking figure out how
many crochets I need to do." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, at which age
would you ever consider </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> getting life insurance? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Right, 'cause, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Isn't it when you get
kids you're supposed to. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, usually. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Or like writing a will? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Right.
- Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It's something you never
really think about. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - But don't they say that
you should write a will </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in your 20's? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I've wanted to,
I've been meaning to. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We're at that age group </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> where we should have a will already. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, okay, okay. Here's the thing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think it's when you have something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> You know, we're quite
successful, we've done well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so if you have some savings
that could be of great help </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to your family members or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Fuck the government. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Don't give it to them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Make sure you know who in
your family who gets it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I think if you have anything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> worth giving to your
family that is significant, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you should do a will at any age. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know, God forbid
something happens, but- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, God forbid. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - And to my sister, I give my
entire body pillow collection. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Nothing else. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Do not touch the bank money. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Who am I giving my YouTube channel to? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm literally giving away clout. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Who wants the clout on my YouTube channel. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I have already decided that I want my, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the reading of my will
to be a comical endeavor. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> So I'm gonna add the most
stupid items to my will </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and be extremely specific
with instructions </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> just to get a good laugh from the grave. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I dunno because I don't
have any brothers or sisters </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I would hope that I
pass away after my parents, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I don't have any kids right now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So, at this point, I'm just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when is there, if that
like awkward conversation </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or that awkward realization to be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I should write a will or I
should look into life insurance </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because, I don't know... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I dunno about your parents,
but I remember a few years ago, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my parents told me that they
had started writing their wills </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm just like, "Mom, Dad, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't wanna think about that right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just don't tell me, I don't wanna... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I acknowledge it, but at the same time, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't want to hear about." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, my dad just
used to meme his will </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all the time growing up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If I ever did a good deed,
my dad would be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I'm adding that to the will." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "You get an extra item on my will". </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, "Yes." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And my sister would be
like, "What the fuck"? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like a fucking competition. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Who wants the house in the
will? Who's it gonna be? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, 'cause I told the story </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> of how I gave my dad, my
dad wanted a car engine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And he's like, "Son, the
entire record collection </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I have, was to your sister, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but now it's under your name now." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, "Yes'. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'd like to think your dad
doesn't even have a will. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> He's just making shit up.
- He making it up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - He's just saying shit as he goes along. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Probably, but yeah, I
remember I read somewhere. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think I was on a Japanese program </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that they recommend that you
should just write a will, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as soon as you just have awareness. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think it's pretty cheap. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I think any document and then
you get it witnessed, I think? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't think it's that complicated. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think it's just going
out of your way to be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Hey, I'm going to write about the moment </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> after I've passed away and
who gets my belongings". </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And before you think to
yourself and you're like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "I don't have any belongings </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> worth giving away to begin with, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> why would I write a will?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, my JuJu collection
needs to go somewhere. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Who would you give that to? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Who would you give that to? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Would you trust one of
your family members to it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I would trust the boys
with my JuJu figures. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'd like to think you'd keep onto them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Thank you very much. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You'd treat them well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - You would- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Definitely not recently, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - You can resell it if you want. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I better get good prowess, it's my JuJu. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like on your death bed, I'll be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Could you just like quickly sign these." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Hopefully my name won't
be worthless at that point. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Maybe it'll worth something. I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - How do you go about... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like what is the structure
of writing a will though? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's what I've always wanted to know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Do you write it like a
novel or like a letter? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think you can be as- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Can you write it like a poem? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think you can be as
playful as you want with it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You ever thought about doing a video will? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - A video... Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - What's up guys? Welcome to my will. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I'm dead. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is that like the new
YouTuber fucking trend? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We've had apology
videos, now we just have- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Make sure to subscribe. Just kidding. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> You're not gonna get
another video after this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You've heard of, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I made this video five
years ago and uploaded it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Get ready for, I made
this video when I was alive </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and you can play it when I die. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think that would be fucking cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- I think that would be cool. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Kind of like, so if you're
watching this video, I'm dead. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - But also the payoff might not work </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if YouTube doesn't exist in like 60 years. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Or it's probably gonna
be like age restricted </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and fucking banned off YouTube. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Imagine that, someone
dies of a terminal cancer. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - You can play a video of
a dead person on YouTube. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, I mean... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's not you showing the
fucking footage of you dying. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean the... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like me now, age
20, I record something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, "This is to be played..." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Not me like, "Bye guys." Boom. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's not that, it's... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, the only closest
thing I could think of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> was the unfortunate thing
of what happened with Etika. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And that got removed by YouTube. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> So, I don't know, we've
never had it before, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so I guess we've never had
like a precedent before, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like what would happen- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, there's YouTubers who have died </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and their video's still up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think that was a special circumstance. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But, has there been a
YouTuber who has recorded their, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like a goodbye video? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right before they died? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, no, like a goodbye video </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that would be uploaded postmortem. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Does that make sense? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Without, okay, can I
ask a morbid question? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Are you asking that without the intention </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of then doing something very sinister? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, without the intention. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Let's say they have a
terminal illness or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yes, there is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - There has been? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - There is.
- I'm sure there has been. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - There was a... it's a powerful watch. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't think I could, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't think I have
the heart to watch that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I don't think I could watch that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The guy was logging his cancer journey. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I forgot the name. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I wish I knew the name off by heart, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but it's hard to watch 'cause-
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You know, he's doing well at some points </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then it's unfortunately, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it takes a turn for the worst. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And the last few videos
he uploads are very painful. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He's in the hospice and-
- Oh God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And you know, it's really... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think that it was very rare </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that we had footage of
watching that, but yeah, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he was uploading videos and
he unfortunately passed away, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but all the videos are there
and his whole journey's there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's very inspiring. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - But how cool is it that at least </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> all of that is now documented forever. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And that's just out
there for people to watch </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and be inspired by. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can imagine that a lot of people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> have found comfort with it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, yeah, it's hard to watch. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't think I could. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is going on a tangent </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because we are talking
about terminal illnesses </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and stuff like that.
- Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you feel like, watching that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> watching something like
that happen in your eyes, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in front of your eyes, do you feel like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with how awful that situation is, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that seeing that kind of thing
portrayed in media so often </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> has kind of like desensitized
or desensitized you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to like how awful that is in reality, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just because, you know, the cancer patient </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or someone dying of cancer has been used </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as such a common writing
trope in every sad anime film </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and just every sad plot point in general. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. I mean, it's... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I guess, until you experience it, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - And it's someone close
to you or even yourself, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you'd experience it, I
think it's impossible </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> to portray it in an authentic way. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think though, just the sole fact that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that trope has been used
so many times in fiction </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and yet it still continues to draw emotion </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> out of the viewer or the
listener, whatever it is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Stories about the main character </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> has a terminal illness, slowly dying, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it shows all of that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> First time you consume anything like that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 99% of people will be very
emotional, you know, cry. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But it's interesting how you could watch </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 10 different shows like that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you'd probably still
cry on the 10th one as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I think, even though it's
been overused in fiction, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think just that is so
powerful and potent enough </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that it'll just continue to
evoke some kind of emotion. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Let alone if you yourself
experience that shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That just adds onto it, I feel. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I'm sure, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> some people would be
desensitized to it, sure. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - But I think at the end of the day, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's a reason why writers
still use that trope. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I guess for me, I went
through a weird experience </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where I had seen so
many stories like this, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that there was a point where I
got desensitized to the media </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where I was just like,
"Oh, it's a character dying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> because of a terminal illness." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then I unfortunately experienced </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a family member passing away </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because of something like
this and it was just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it definitely grounded me
in a way that I never... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not that I never thought I would, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it just put things into
perspective for me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it just, I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I haven't, since that has happened, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've actively avoided
any stories around that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because it seems way more real to me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I dunno how I would react to that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Part of the reason, for example, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I couldn't watch "Clannad", right, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or I couldn't finish "Clannad" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was because at the time I was watching it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it just felt like cry porn, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It just felt like cry porn </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where I was so disconnected, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> disconnected with what
was happening on screen, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I'm just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is Key just trying to make me cry. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know, he's trying to make me cry. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But yeah, I dunno if I had a point. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I dunno if I would react differently </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to watching those types of media </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> now that I have grown up
and have more experience </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> about the real events that, I guess, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> influence stories like this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Mm. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And if I would still feel the same way, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or if I would still be desensitized, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because it is a fictional story </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that has been told many, many, many times. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think when it gets
to that point, though, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it just revolves around how well written </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> those stories and characters are. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's true, that's true. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There are so many stories
where they use that trope. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but you're just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Okay, I know I'm supposed to feel sad </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for this character right now, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but the writing is so mediocre </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that it hasn't given me
enough emotional storage </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for me to care about this character. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's true, that's true. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think it's impossible to replicate </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the feeling of going
through it in real life, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> just because no matter
how good the writing is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause you know, you're talking about, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> let's say it's a movie.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - He tries to do it in two hours, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what would take essentially
a lifetime to build up? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The reason it's so
crippling in real life </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it hurts so much, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is because if it's your
friend and it happens at 20. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, alright, well you have 20 years </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> of being their friend. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And now it feels like it's being robbed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I feel like it's almost impossible </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to portray it in a way that
will give you the same emotion. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I think it can give you a sense of empathy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in a very deep way, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but nowhere near can it
compare to the feeling </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that you might feel if you go through it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, I think one of
the biggest, not issues, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but one of the biggest hurdles </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> between communicating your experiences </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to an audience member or to someone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who hasn't experienced
the same thing as you, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is that there is such a massive difference </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> between sympathy and empathy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There'll be people I talk to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and they talk about their experiences </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I can definitely sympathize </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with the emotion that they're feeling, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but there's also like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> do you guys ever feel a
connection with someone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who has actually shared the
same experience with you, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the same emotional experience with you? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There's a connection there
when you share that experience </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that cannot be replicated </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no matter how much other people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> will try to understand you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and try to understand your feelings </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and everything like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There is a feeling that
cannot be replicated </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> without the same empathy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> To me there's something special </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about being able to
communicate that empathy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> through fictional media. Right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause there are some
times where I watch a film </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I feel something that's not just, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Hey, you should cry
or you should feel this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because this character went through that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's wow, I really feel
like an actual connection </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with the creator now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because he's portraying an emotion </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I know is impossible to depict </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> unless you have been through
that exact experience. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I'm trying to feel, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm trying to think of
when was the latest time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean off the top of my head, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I think of "Evangelion", right, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> why I have such a close,
emotional connection to that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's so weird for me with "Ava" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I've watched "Ava"
in several stages of my life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And the reason it's the
most important for me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was because there was a point </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where I felt like I was going through </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the exact same emotions the creator was, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and this is going on a complete
fucking tangent, by the way. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And yeah, I guess to me, that's why, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> going on a different tangent, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's why media is such
a big part of my life </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and why I'm a fucking
anime YouTuber, I guess, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is because, I guess, that's
what I search for in media, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which is not just to be entertained, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but this connection with
a person and a creator. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And that's why I try to make content. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I dunno where to go
from there, but that was- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Thank you for coming
to my Ted Talk. Wow. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I guess this is where you go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from talking about people
dying from cancer, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Where do you go from here? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I dunno. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's tough because I think the one emotion </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I personally feel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> when it comes to real life
situations and stuff like that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's not even like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause you know, when
you're watching media </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that revolves around a
death of a character, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in any situation, most
people think of sadness. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know, like a depression
or some rooted emotion. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> People who have experienced,
at least for me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when I experience a
real death that happened </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you don't feel anything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like you feel empty. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I think this feeling of emptiness </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is extremely difficult
to portray in fiction. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Because it's like, how do you try to show </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or evoke an emotion
that is not an emotion? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I remember when one of
my friends from high school, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he unfortunately passed away very suddenly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> from an illness. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know, I had never experienced that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That was the first time
I had experienced death </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in a close, like a real
death in a close vicinity. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yep. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And it was so weird because you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> media and people who
haven't experienced that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> would lead you to believe
that you go to a funeral. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- And everyone's crying. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah.
- And everyone's sad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I thought I was the weird one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I didn't cry at his funeral. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, "Am I weird?
Am I being desensitized?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I should be sad. I should be crying. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I should be grieving, you
know, all that kind of stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And not to say that I wasn't. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But I think because I'd never experienced </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anything like that before. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's when I realized I was
like, "Oh, I'm feeling empty." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Because that, it's beyond
sadness. It's beyond grief. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it was almost this weird thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> where I didn't start
crying about his death </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> until I got home. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] That was- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And that's when it hit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - That was the exact same experience </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I had with my grandma as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> At the funeral, I was just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> "Am I broken? Am I a broken human being?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel nothing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it's like, I
should be crying right now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You hear back on like, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I was hearing back on my friend's life </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and hearing speeches from
my classmates and whatnot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was just like, "Why am
I not crying? Am I weird?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then it's like, you
grieve, everyone's sad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then I went home and I remember, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I went into my room and I lay on the bed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then I just broke down crying. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's like, "Oh, that's
what that feeling is." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I personally have never
seen a piece of fiction </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that can properly evoke that emotion. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like it's, I don't
know, it's weird to say. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's not like it's faking an emotion </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> or anything like that,
when it comes to fiction. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I wouldn't say it's like...
it's not the correct emotion. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah. I feel. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I think that's just because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just so incredibly difficult
to show that real emotion, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> especially when it's with
a bunch of characters </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that you didn't spend your entire </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> fucking high school life with. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Exactly, so like personal question. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What's the most you've ever cried </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to a piece of fiction at all? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - The most?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Probably the second half
of "Clannad: After Story" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The last six episodes, I was like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Episode 14, 15, I'm
obviously not gonna spoil it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah. (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Around episode 14, 15
of "Clannad: After Story" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> something happens, and it's
like, you break down crying. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And you think to yourself, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Okay, it's all out of my system." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then the next episode starts </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's just like, fuck man, why? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And then it's just that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for the rest of the
episodes until it's over, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and you're just a fucking mess. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just cry at everything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> A lot of (indistinct), stuff
that isn't even sad, I cry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Becky will be fighting,
and I'll hear my name </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'll just start crying. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (both laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, it depends on my mood, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Some days I'm like a
fucking rock and it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it could be like the worst
thing on earth and I'll be like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's really weird
'cause I've found myself, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I think this is healthy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I found myself more easily crying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> towards pieces of media and
fictional pieces of media </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> now than I did like five- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh God, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Five years ago?
- I cry at everything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And I thing the one that
broke the camels back </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> was like, "Anohana". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I cried a lot at "Anohana". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think before "Anohana", </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't think I had ever
cried watching an anime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm trying to think back.
- For me it was weird. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like very early on when
I was watching a lot of anime, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause I think I first cried at "Clannad" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and then it was just like
a chain reaction of like... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then I watched "Anohana"
and then I watched "Air" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then I watch all these
shows that made you cry. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then for a while I had
this blank period where I- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's 'cause you exhausted yourself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Maybe, and then the one
that broke the camels back </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> for me was "Maquia". </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - "Maquia", ah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - "Angel Beats" made me cry a lot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Angel Beats" made me
cry, but I didn't cry. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There was so many sad shows
that people would like cry. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I didn't cry at the end
of "Your lie in April", </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> even though a lot of people did. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I didn't either. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know, and I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Am I weird for thinking that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Am I just like overexposed
to this kind of media?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And then I watched "Maquia"
on a fucking plane, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> tiny screen like this
with shitty headphones. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Crying in warm pee.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And crying to three
pixels, and I was like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And then the ending to
that just destroyed me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, "Why is it this one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that made me cry after all this time?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's weird because
before, anytime I would cry, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just cry towards something, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that thing would be really,
really fucking special </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to break down the brick wall that I am. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But nowadays-
- You stone of a man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The obelisk known as Garnt's emotions. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Exactly, but nowadays,
because I cry way more easily. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I dunno, it's weird,
sometimes I have empty cries </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where I cry and I'm just like, it's over, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and then I feel nothing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just like, I dunno, it's weird. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm like, I cry and I feel amazing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just do it.
- It's like a release. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like I order a McDonald's the other day, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and I was like, "Why did
I do this?", I cried. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I fucking cried to "Demon Slayer" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm just like, "Why
did I fucking cry..." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I get it, I get it, I get it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The moment I feel sad, I'm
just like, (imitates crying). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey imitates crying) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt imitates crying) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just get it over
with man. I just do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Have you ever had those cries though, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> where it doesn't feel
like you've released? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Where you just feel shittier? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Are we talking about edging with tears? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Not edging, you cry and then you- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then I climax with tears? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, there's those times where, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you'd watch something really sad </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then you just let the emotions out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And then after your tears have subsided, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're just like, "Whew. All
right. I'm glad that's out." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know, I feel good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> All of my emotions, all my
emotional baggage is out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then there are some times
where you would start crying, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then once the tears have subsided, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you're just like, "Man, now I'm more sad </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> than I was before I started crying." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's like when I was 15 with breakups. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I'd cry and I'd feel worse. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, yeah yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why did she leave me? (imitates crying) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And you know, getting back to funerals. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I wouldn't... like even if I wasn't, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause you know, sometimes
when you're like 10, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you didn't really
understand what's going on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And then maybe when you get older, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're like 15, 16 and it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, it's this person
that you barely ever met, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but you have to 'cause
you're all connected." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I wouldn't know them so I wasn't sad, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I would just get, I would just cry, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I'm like, "Why is
everyone crying? This is so sad." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Aw. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You cry because everyone
around you is crying. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, 'cause if everyone
else is crying around me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, "Fuck, well I gotta do it now." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Like a psychopath, like Mark Zuckerberg. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is human emotion, I must cry now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sad.exe. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - There something about
being around people who, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when a room is filled with sad energy, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it just makes me get like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It depends for me,
because say for example, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the "Demon Slayer" movie, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone was crying like fucking
crazy at the end of that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm looking around like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh, it's now. I have to cry now." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't get the tears out right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like to me, I cannot
cry to a piece of media, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> if there's someone else in the room. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, there's... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I can't show the manly tears. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wait, wait. Sydney as well? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Huh?
- Sydney as well? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Especially Sydney.
- What? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Really?
- Do you know why? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause she'll be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh baby man, you want a
little." (imitates crying) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, no, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because, 10 minutes before the tears </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> even start forming in my eyes, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> she's bawling her eyes out already. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> She is, Sydney's... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're on cleanup duty.
- Yeah yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Sydney is so emotionally receptive, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that she will start crying five minutes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> before the sad moments happen
and she'll be like in tears. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> If I'm watching with Sydney, I
am on emotional cleanup duty. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, "Oh, it's
okay baby. Don't worry." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, baby, I didn't
even get my point. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I didn't even like... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I guess you can't really be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh baby, are you okay?" (imitates crying) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Hold on, gimme a second. (imitates crying) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - You've heard about relationships </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> where the guy comes too
fast and then it ruins it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What about the one who cries too fast? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't get my tears in. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> She's already decided it's
over before I've even started. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause I remember, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Your Name", I cried like a fucking baby, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the first time I watched "Your Name". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it wasn't even because it was sad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Your Name" was to me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the reason it's one of
my favorite anime films </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is 'cause to me it's like
the perfect cinema experience </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> where there are so many
things happening on screen </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that there's so many emotions </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I just get so absorbed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that my body doesn't know how to react, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> other than just crying. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Sometimes I get emotional </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and I don't know what to
do with it, and I cry. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like an overwhelmed cry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it's like an overwhelmed cry. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Music normally does that for me? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I fucking cry at like
an E key. I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's always the music for me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - First note to "Black
Parade". (imitates crying) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - That is the music, the music
will make me cry instantly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Like "My Hero Academia". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know why I tear
up whenever I fucking hear </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "You Say Run" with (indistinct) screaming. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, "Why, what's going on?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I don't-
- Really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like I've been
programmed to a certain tune, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, (imitates crying) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like Pavlov. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah yeah, yeah, I am
literally like a fucking dog. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - And so I remember second time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause the first time I went by myself. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Sorry Mark Zuckerberg,
by the way, watching this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I know you normally like these segments. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I know you can't relate to this. Sorry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - So the first time I went by myself </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and the second time I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Sydney, you gotta see this film." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's fucking, fucking amazing film, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> gotta come see it with me." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I remember, it was the moment </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just before Radwimps start playing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and that is the moment
where I start crying. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And I remember sitting in this film </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it was the second time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was getting as emotional,
I was getting as into it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like getting absorbed
and I'm like, (imitates crying) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "It's coming, it's coming.
Radwimps about to play." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then like a minute
before they start playing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just hear, (imitates
crying) next to me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, "Oh God." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it just took me out, I'm like... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> of course, it's Sydney
balling her eyes out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But yeah, that's why,
as much as I love Sydney </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if I'm watching a sad thing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if I want to have an emotional release, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I cannot watch it with her in the room. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like, "Shut the fuck up". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm like, "Sydney, can
you stop being emotional </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> for one second?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Did you watch his new movie? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - His, "Weathering with You"? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, "Weathering with You". </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, "Weathering with You" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - "Weathering with you"?
Yes, I did watch it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Did you cry? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I did not cry at that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Did you cry at, who's the
other director who's good? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Mamoru Hosoda.
- Mamoru Hosoda </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, what's his? "Belle". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I thought "Belle" was okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey gasps) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It was... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Would you say it was mid? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay, here's... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I watched it by the way. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You watched it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I haven't seen it yet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - What did you think of it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Okay, did you watch it in cinemas? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, I feel like that's a movie </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you have to experience in cinemas </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because everyone I've talked
to who has seen "Belle", </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they've talked about how
it's a fucking incredible </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cinema experience with
the sound and the music. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There are definitely scenes in "Belle" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where I'm like, "I get that". </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It feels like, especially
with the musical scenes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the musical numbers, it
feels like these scenes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> were made to be experienced in a theater, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with the surrounds sound and everything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> In terms of the plots and everything else, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was not his greatest
movie, in my opinion. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Was it one of those movies though, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that it was like cry bait? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So it was like the...
because that's the thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I felt like it didn't earn it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - But that's the thing is like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sometimes it's so weird with fiction </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that is obvious cry bait. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Where it's like, sometimes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yes, I will buy into the
cry bait very happily. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Thank you very much. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And then there are other
times where it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Okay, you don't have to push
this in my face this much. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll cry when I wanna
cry or if I can cry." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - They have a digital world
in the show and a movie. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just wasn't invested in this world. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just didn't think it was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I couldn't see it being a
thing or why people would care, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause it was like, we're just
gonna make an online world </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where you can be anything except you can't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and your avatars chosen for you, and also, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there seems to be like a class system </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where some people are more important </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> than others in this world. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why does that just
sound like "Summer Wars"? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I was like this is- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It is exactly "Summer Wars". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, okay.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was like, how do you know
it's a Hosoda Mamoru movie? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - He's made the same movie again, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> with "Beauty and the Beast" this time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it was "Beauty and the Beast". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> That's what I was also like, what's this? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I wasn't... It was okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I agree with you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know what I watched in the cinema? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What?
- The Batman. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, how was it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Very, very good.
- Really? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Have you watched it yet? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no yet.
- Was it three hours? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay.
- And I loved it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - How was Robert Pattinson in it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Delightful, just a treat.
- Yeah? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What a great guy, what a great guy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - What a bloke. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I saw a meme the other day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was like 2010, women
fawning over Robert Pattinson. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was like 2020, men fawning
over Robert Pattinson. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's so true, dude. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Hell yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's good, it's a good
movie, it's good movie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is it a good movie or
is it a good Batman movie? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think it's not that
much of a Batman movie. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Really?
- Really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'd give it an 8.5. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because I'm like one of the weird people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> who really don't give that
much of a shit about Batman. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know, to me, it's just... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I really like this
portrayal by Robert Pattinson. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- I thought- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is it kind of more like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Is it kinda more like on the
Joker side of storytelling? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Or is it more like a Batman being- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, oh, well I suppose, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> if that's the scale that we're going with, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I guess it would lean more
towards the Joker side. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay. Okay. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But I wouldn't compare
it to the Joker either. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's more like they clearly
wanna tell Batman as a character </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> through this kind of
somewhat realistic lens </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> of like, if Batman was a real person, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> he would be a fucking weirdo. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - More like a human drama side of things. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well it's kind of
detective movie, but also, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they don't shy away from
showing Batman as being, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> having a lot of issues. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like the man's got problems. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know, and... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - More money, more problems. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, dude. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I liked the villain. I
thought it was pretty good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The Riddler this time.
- The Riddler. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, it's Riddler, oh shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I thought they had a good, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a really interesting take
on the Riddler that I liked. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I just had fun. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was there for three hours. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Maybe towards the end, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I felt like it could have
hurried up a little bit, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but overall I wasn't
bored, I really enjoyed it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I had a great time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm interested to see
what Riddler is like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in a movie of that caliber, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> because to me, the Riddler is Jim Carrey. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's literally the opposite. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It is opposite. Okay, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think you'd both like
it if you watched it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm sure I would, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - And it's a great cinema experience. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was fucking... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The thing that's always
wondered me about the Riddler </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> is how the fuck would that
work in the age of Google? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, the Riddler comes
up with a riddle or something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and Batman's like, "Hold on a second. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Okay, I got the answer
now. I got the answer." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think I saw that in
a Buzzfeed article once. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like the one YouTube short </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that he watched the other day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And he's just like, "I remember that one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I know the answer to that one." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh fuck, I would look it up, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I would show you on TikTok, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's the algorithm's so shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - The only issue with
the movie is that I wish </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Robert Pattinson was just
out of the costume more. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He's just so good, why- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Does he do the gravelly,
like "I'm Batman"? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah, he does, yeah.
- Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - He's pretty good at it.
- Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - He's just really good at
doing voices in general, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> actually. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - He's just a good actor.
- He's a good actor. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right?
- Definitely. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I watched "Good Time" again after. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, you gotta watch "Good Time". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's so good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Please watch "Good Time", it's so good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - This episode is sponsored by Harry's. </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> It's the only razor I use
when I wanna shave my face. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's the only razor I trust </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that actually does a clean shave, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> even after the first few
times you've used it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> unlike the other razors
that I've used in the past. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So much so, that when I went to the UK, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I brought a suitcase full
of Harry's back to Japan </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_01> - I can't think of, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> has there ever been a Batman
that I thought was interesting? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause before the, okay, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like before "The
Dark Knight Rises", </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Batman just had an awful
streak of just bad movies </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and that just made his... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - With DC in general.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Come on, mate, you don't
like the George Clooney Batman? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - What, with the fucking Bat credit card </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and the fucking Bat nipples
and all that fucking shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Even the best thing about that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> was fucking Arnold
Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Ice to meet you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Ice to meet you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just feel like for the longest time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Batman was just either a boring
or comical character to me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and the most interesting characters </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> were the villains of Batman. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The only time I thought Batman </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was an interesting character </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was actually during the animated series. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah, very, very good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - That was peak Batman for me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, definitely. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Have you seen the animated series? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I love the animated series. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - How does this compare to
the animated series, then? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause that, to me, that is good Batman. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's a different
experience there entirely. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like it's hard to compare them both </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> when they're both trying to
do wildly different things. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's also so good 'cause Mark Hamill </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> is the Joker in that, he's amazing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Fucking so good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't feel comfortable
comparing it, almost. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like it's not fair. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's apples and oranges.
- Not a fair fight. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think you should just watch
it. You won't regret it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just watch it.
- Conclusion, watch it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Genuinely, it's definitely... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I want to, I definitely wanna. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is just Connor talking
about media in general. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Go on, Connor, sell me on it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh.
- Just watch it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, there's a lot of stuff
I'll tell you not to watch, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if I don't think it's worth your time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> This however is worth your time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Did you play the "Batman
Arkham" games as well? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I loved the "Batman
Arkham" saga games, dude. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - My God, a story based
game that you play. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was hardly story. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> The combat was fun and
punching, exploring and stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's true, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know what the story was. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I know Joker was- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (both laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - God dammit, I thought we had one thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> in common for once when- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He's got goopy gamer brain. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah, goopy gamer brain. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I liked it, and there
was also the combat trials. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That shit was fun as fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You did the combat trials? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because I was like... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was addicted to getting
all the achievements on Xbox. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Wait, you did side stories? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, no, so I was
obsessed with gamer score. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's like the last thing I do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I hate it when there is like a fucking, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> when there's a point in the game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> where you can like do
a trial for the combat </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> or one of the game mechanics. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, "Get this shit
outta my face. I don't wanna- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, me too, me too. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Unless there's achievements. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So you're an achievement hunter. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was, I was an achievement hunter. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> So here's what happened, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> When I first got my Xbox </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I discovered these achievement things, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I thought, "Oh well that's pretty cool." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's a pretty cool
thing to strive towards. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then my friend was
an achievement hunter </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was like, "I wanna be
better than him at this"." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And so I was like, "Well,
I'm gonna start doing it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then I got kind of addicted to it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I would research games that were easy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to get all of the achievements on, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and then buy them and do them </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just to get the achievement score. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I had like 60,000 gamer
score or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You could only get about a
thousand a game normally. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I had, but you got DLC
for some stuff as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I bought, "Lost", the game,
like this TV show "Lost" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> specifically because you could get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> all the achievements in like two hours. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Really?
- Yeah, I don't know why. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - You just speed ran it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was absolutely addicted
to getting these achievements </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and "Arkham Asylum" was
one of them I got 100% on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And it was really hard </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> because you had to do one of the trials </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and maintain a combo of
like a hundred or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I can't remember what it was. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember it took a lot of attempts. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - You also had to collect all the- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - All the trophies. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - All the fucking Riddler trophies. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Did all of that, and there was also, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you had to do all the stealth
missions perfectly as well, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Or something like that,
I can't remember exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember it was really hard
getting all the achievements, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but that was such a good game, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I didn't mind doing it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - When was the last
time you did that then? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Achievement collectors?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Not since I was like, oh, 18, 19. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> When I went to university
and I had less time, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of realized that,
that wasn't that fun? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's not fun, it's not fun. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I had gotten one of the
hardest achievements on Xbox, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> ever.
- Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which is like staying
alive on "Dead Rising" for- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, for seven days straight. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] You did that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, not that one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was another "Dead Rising" one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Not the seven day one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What makes it so hard? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wait, that's on the first game, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's "Dead Rising 1". </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've done all of them
on "Dead Rising 2". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Which is I think... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no, they have like kill 1 million zombies </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or something stupid.
- Right, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Sorry, another three days
on, my mom would've killed me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - You had to be, that that one was, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you had to be alive in like hardcore, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Dead Rising Analyst" for seven real days, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like in the real world. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - How do you get that?
- What was the other one? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - You'd have to go in shifts, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> surely, with other people, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What was the one I did on... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> All of them on "Dead
Rising 2" are really hard. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember that took so long. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's just like a difficult game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, there's some
games that, you know what? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh, maybe this is why I hate JRPGs. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> JRPGs always had the hardest achievements. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yep, they did.
- Hands down, the most. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And they had the most
cruelest ones where like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> get this item, that if you miss it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you can't go back and get it. Fuck you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> So that's I think that is what, genuinely, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> stopped me from ever buying
a JRPG, for a long time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause, people have to be psychopaths. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - You do, you have to psychopaths. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 100%, to do JRPGs.
- You do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We're looking at you, Joe. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Well, to be fair, how many times </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> did you have to play
"Persona 5" before you 100%- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like six times.
- Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But I also 100% at "Final
Fantasy VII Remake" as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh my. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Well that one's not too bad, I guess. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - That one's not too bad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because I feel like that's
a third of the original game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, exactly, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I wouldn't dare do it with the original. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh no.
- No, no, no, fuck that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel like they've become
a lot more accommodating </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in these modern times,
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Compared to like OG JRPG games </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where they assume that
that's the only game </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're playing for the entire year. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, they just assume
that's the only game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you have on that console. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, and it's just gonna last you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the entire fucking time.
- Exactly, exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm trying to find my Xbox profile </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> so I can see what I've done. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I think it's this one? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Isn't the hardest Xbox achievement </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the fucking "Mega Man 9" one? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What's that one?
- What's that one? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's the one where you
have to beat the entire game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> without getting hit a single time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, so that's just a no hit run, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but an actual achievement. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, which if you've
played any "Mega Man" game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is practically fucking impossible. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, what's the game? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> One of the Tom Clancy
games had an achievement </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> for being the number one
ranked player in the world. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - No joke. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I remember, I think
I saw a WatchMojo video </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a long time ago, which was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "The top 10 hardest Xbox achievements". </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was like, top 10 list of games </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I'm never gonna buy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And one of them, I already
owned, it's like "Gears of War". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So it was like, got to get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a hundred thousand online kills. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- In the first game, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but no one was playing the first game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> after the third one came out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - How would that even be possible? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like how much, how many hours- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You have to go a hundred
thousand matches with your mates. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right. Right.
- No. No, it's kills. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So you have to be averaging
like fucking hundreds. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's ridiculous.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - That is, and "Gears of War" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is not an easy game to get kills in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- So, it's very difficult. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I can find this, I can find it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> All right, I've got the
list of all of these. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Some of these games are
just fucking stupid. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> So, I have 51,000 gamer
score in Xbox. Right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So that's like what? 50 games? 45 Games? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I have every single "C.O.D." game , </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I have every single achievement. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Every single "Halo" game, I
have every single achievement. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Of course.
- Except for the newer ones. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, "Halo Wars 2" and "Halo Infinite". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I have all of them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I did all of the, I don't know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Did you ever do "Halo"? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> There was those challenges </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where you had to do certain
things without dying, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like the skull ones. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I did all of those. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I only played "Halo 1". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've only played "Halo 1" and "Halo 3" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I didn't play "Halo 2". </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I got every single
achievement in "Blue Dragon", </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> which I remember having-
- "Blue Dragon"? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- The JRPG? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Oh, shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I remember you were
talking about "Blue Dragon". </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> What's this one, what's... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Most rare, what's the
rarest one? Head trauma. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Every type of melee weapon in his army. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's so weird, there's like rarity- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - That features a lot in "Dead Rising", </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause everything is a weapon. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've killed, yeah, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Some of these are like really low. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Some funny games I've done.
"Dorito's Crash Course 2". </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What?
- I've got all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> of the achievements on
"Dorito's Crash Course 2". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why would you buy that game? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was free. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, the other question is,
why is there two of them? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it was really popular.
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I've got all the
achievements on "Red Dead". </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think that wasn't too hard. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> What else have I done?
What weird games are these? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - So like, would you basically do nothing? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Would you basically do nothing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> until you were 100% at these games? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- I've played- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - "South Park" games. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've played the "South Park
Tower Defense" game. "Lost". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I have "Terminator: Salvation", </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which I think I got 'cause that was easy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But then it turned out to
be really fucking hard. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> What's weird? What other
games do I have here? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> God, most of these are
"C.O.D." and "Assassins Creed". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - "Happy Wars"? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't even know what that is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I didn't even do that one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That must have been too hard. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Guaca.. Wait, hold on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What was that one out there? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Guacamelee Super Turbo Championship". </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Dude, that was a good game, dude. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> That's a good-
- "Guacamelee" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then other games,
I couldn't do them all. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They're quite a lot of games, actually. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> A lot of the "Gears of Wars"
ones were just like fucked. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - "Forza", "Destiny". </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Fuck dude, I've played
some weird ass games. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What's wrong with me? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, I think as a kid,
you just played any game </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that you could get your hands on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah yeah, exactly.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - And now they're like-
- FIFA. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - "FIFA", of course, of course. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - You've got one achievement on "FIFA". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know, I have "FIFA 09". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I got all the achievements on "Halo:Wars", </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which one of them included
getting to the highest rank, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which takes like an
absurd amount of hours. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Geez.
- Stupid amount of hours. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I mean, like.
- Stupid amount of hours. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't think I've ever
got addicted to a game </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that much that I wanted to 100% it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] No way. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause, I think, the closest I've come, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> actually, surprisingly,
is "Tales of Arise", </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which was last year. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh.
- Oh, shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's the first time where I actually </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> did the fishing mini game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause you know how every
game has a fishing mini game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, "What the
fuck... who's the fucking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what fucking loser plays
the fishing mini game? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like, this is actually
pretty fucking damn fun. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Collecting all the fish. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But yeah, I mean, recently
I've been playing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Horizon Forbidden West". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like the one fucking person, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause everyone's playing
"Elden Ring" right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, I'll get to
"Elden Ring" eventually </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> after I finish "Horizon Forbidden West". </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And yeah, I mean it's- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is there a fishing mini
game in that one as well? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't think there is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, I was like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're like, God, I wish. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Can you fish in "Elden Ring"? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think so. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I dunno. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We're not like dark
souls or like souls born. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'd like to think there's fishing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> in an ideal world. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - We need a Twitter account to be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> "Yes, you can fish in "Elden Ring". </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel like it's just every JRPG, right, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that you can fish. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like a staple. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I dunno how, why did
that become a trope? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because Japanese people love fishing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Do they? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - They love fish. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, they love eating fish,
that doesn't necessarily- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - They don't like catching it, though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - A nation of fisherman. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - By the same logic, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> shouldn't us British to love fishing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause we're a fucking
island nation as well. Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - We're shit, we don't eat
fish. We're fucking idiots. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - What do you mean,
you got fish and chips. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's it.
- [Garnt] We eat cods. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We eat one fish and like
salmon, if you're rich. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, why is that? Why is that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Not only why is there a fishing
mini game in every JRPG, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but why is that 99% of them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have no effect on the
main story whatsoever? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'd be pretty shit if
you're fighting Zephyr off </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you're about to
fight him and he's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Sorry, you haven't collected </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> all of the 19 different species of fish. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You are not ready to face me." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, "Well, yeah, well, fuck." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I guess that would be weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think I would want a JRPG
where you're actually rewarded </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> at the final boss. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It would be like, the boss is like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> "You've done the fishing mini game. Ah." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - How did you know that sea
bream scales are my weakness. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Stop. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They start with like half health. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. (Connor hums) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh, where's my health bar gone? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, I know some people
who are deadly addicted </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to every fishing mini game in JRPGs. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, Alan is that guy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Alan is that guy who
boots up "Final Fantasy", </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then he spends like the first 10 hours </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> on the mini fishing mini game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then after he gets bored of that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then he actually goes to play the game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Alan's that guy who actually does </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the Mahjong mini game in "Yakuza". </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Let's be real, every
"Yakuza" player is like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Don't mess with us, we don't
know how to play Mahjong, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause no one fucking does that mini game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the "Yakuza" games. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, isn't the mini games
the main game in "Yakuza". </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Except the Mahjong mini game </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause no one fucking
knows how to play it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, that is until you've
come along and played- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then I'm like, "Lemme show you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Lemme show you how to do it". </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, how's your Mahjong
coming along, Joey? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Really good, my addiction is growing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Your speed running an old Asian man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I am. I am. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I went to a Mahjong parlor </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> for the first time, the other day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Oh, how was that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's really fucking fun. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean like, you know... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I think that the general
stereotype of a Mahjong parlor </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is it's fucking dark, it's
like smoke is everywhere. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like basically fucking "Akagi", right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But I walk in and I've never
seen that many lights on, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> in one room. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I came in, I was like, "Ah, fuck". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's so bright. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And like, no one's smoking in there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> A lot of really young people, as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> There was maybe two tables
that had older gentlemen </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and everyone else was around our age. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Was it all men? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, surprisingly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Half of them, I'd say like
half, maybe 40%, were ladies. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh.
- There were a couple tables </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where it was just full of ladies, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just like sitting around.
- Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - But yeah, I went in. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I went with one of my childhood friends </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause he's been getting
into Mahjong as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And he was like, "Oh,
we're gonna go to this one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> in Ebisu".
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like, "Why
this one in particular"? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And he's like, "Oh, the fried
rice here is fucking lit." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like, "So are
we're gonna and play Mahjong </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or are we gonna go for the fried rice"? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You had fried rice with the... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, you can order food
there, and to be honest, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> probably some of the
best fried rice I've had. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wow.
- In Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Nice, while playing Mahjong. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'd believe it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It feels like the kind of place </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> where you get a weirdly good meal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I wonder, where did
Mahjong get this image </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of it being a game for
old guys or old people? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause it's always old people playing it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on the street and betting, normally. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is it, I never see that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Normally, my entire-
- That's an assumption. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - My entire image of Mahjong
comes from media basically. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause before moving to Japan, I'd never, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I guess I'd never seen
anyone playing Mahjong. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I know where you're getting this, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> POV. You're watching a movie, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's a spy movie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Let's say a spy movie
or any kind of movie. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They're undercover in
Indonesia, let's say. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Do they play Mahjong in Indonesia? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, Southeast Asia,
it's pretty popular. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So they're playing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> let's say they're in
Indonesia on a mission. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh no, their cover's been blown. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We gotta start running through buildings. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Charge in the one building. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh, it's a food store. Chicken everywhere. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Run in the next room. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh God, it's a bunch of
old people playing Mahjong. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You've seen this scene like 500 times. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, every time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's always just old
people in a smokey room </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> playing Mahjong.
- Every Jackie Chan movie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - When they bust through
the thing, and they're like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they keep running through. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It's always there, always. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then they always do
some kind of corny one liner, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> right, as they're running out of the room. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well it's either that
or it's like an old- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Indistinct Asian shouting. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's almost like an old Kung Fu movie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And you get into the bad guys' lair. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- What's he doing? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He's sitting down playing Mahjong. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> With his fellow, with his guys
asserting dominance, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's the image I have of Mahjong. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like in that dark smokey room
and everything like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, I feel like
it's the poker of Japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> or like poker of Asia really? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, definitely. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like the kind of game
where gambling's not legal, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but me and the boys can
have a little wager or two, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - As long as it's under
the table, you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (both laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause like, yeah, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> have you guys ever played bridge before? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I'm not 90. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, exactly.
- I've heard of that game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What is that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's a game, which I dunno- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is it a card game? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - QI them. (imitates siren) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It would've gone off an hour ago. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It is a card game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I dunno what the images, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I dunno if it's famous outside of the UK </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> or anything like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah, it's famous in the US. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And again, for being the thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that people play in retirement homes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Old people play it, right?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I remember, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I think it was in high
school or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> One of our teachers for like this... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know you have a free period sometimes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's the end of term. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You could do whatever you like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> So this teacher decided
to teach us bridge, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just teach us the rules. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I got addicted at a point where
I'd joined the bridge club. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yes, I was that kid </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> who actually joined the bridge club. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause it had this image of, like Mahjong, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> being what old retired people
play in retirement homes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But like, it is fun as fuck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Right?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's kind of similar to Mahjong </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in a sense where you
get given a bunch of... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it is kinda like poker
where it is luck based, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's also skill based. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But what I found most
interesting to bridge </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is that it's a team game. Right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So the basic concept is before each game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you have a partner who sits opposite you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And you basically have to make a bet </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on how many points you'd be able to get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the hand you're about to play. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So you're kind of
communicating with your partner </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and communicating and trying
to assess what everyone has, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> by the bets that they're placing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I thought that was like,
I think that's super genius. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's basically like UNO, but
before the UNO game starts, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you have to try and guess
what everyone else has. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You're working in a team.
- Cool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - To me, I wanted to talk about it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause bridge has this image </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of being a boring game
that old people play, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but I think it's interesting as fuck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I haven't played bridge
since I was in school. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> When I was in bridge club, I
got super addicted for a while </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I think it's a
genuinely fun game's. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it's the same with Mahjong, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, before I started playing it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, "No, I'm
not gonna get into this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This is what my grandma was into." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But then when you
actually start playing it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you realize just how like intricate it is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's not just like
a fucking, you know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, I didn't think of
it as an old people thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think of it as a
really complicated thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - But it's interesting though, how, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even something like Mahjong, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is a very complicated, deep, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and very mind intensive game
is associated with old people. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - If you look at like the
pro scene, for example, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> most people are like dudes
and chicks in their 20's. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like chess in the parks in New York. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, yeah, all the
old dudes are playing it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but it's the young
people who are the best. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's a PR thing, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> When are we gonna get a Twitch category? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Everything's a branding
issue, isn't it, guys? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Nothing can't be fixed with
a bit of branding and PR. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Remember, literally just two years ago </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where chess had the same thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and then suddenly chess had
a fucking second Renaissance </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with the explosion it's had on Twitch. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And now it's seen as like
this cool thing that- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Mahjong's next.
- Mahjong's next. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm gonna call it, Mahjong is next. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know what I wanna learn? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The Vtubers are already on that shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's the secret. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We need to get the Vtubers
to all start playing it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The Japanese Vtubers have
been on that shit for so long. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. Right.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think, weirdly chess
is one of those sports </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where when you look at it on paper, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it just shouldn't be a spectator sport. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Mm.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Everything about it makes it
almost a bad spectator sport. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> There's long gaps in between moves. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's not that engaging. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Storylines are a little
harder to get across, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's visually not that exciting. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> You look at a board for
like 15 minutes at a time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If you're lucky, they'll
make a move every 15 minutes, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in the World Championship. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But somehow I think just out of pure, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like being a very solid
and ubiquitous game, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's managed to somehow carve a good niche </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and a pretty strong one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But also chess has also had great success </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> by having the branding of
being the smart mans skill. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The smartest of smarts play chess. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, I think the problem with chess </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as a spectator sport is
that, with a lot of sports, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you look at the higher level players, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you look at, you know,
traditional sports like football, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> basketball, maybe even
like league or whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And you can, even as a normal person, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can appreciate the skill being showed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You see someone doing a speed
run of Mario 64 or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You're like, damn those are some- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No words needed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, no words needed. That's
fucking speaks for itself. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But me watching a high level chess game, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the chessboard championships is like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've never understood the feeling </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of that side character in "Dragon Ball Z", </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where the characters-
- That explains the moves. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, no, like
where the main characters </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are following the fight perfectly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and you just see, like
you just see nothing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This is me watching high level chess. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's why I think chess
has gotten really good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in recent years at having the, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of what a lot of e-sports are doing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and what traditional sports
are doing for a long time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where one of them is the one
that's saying what's going on, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and one of them's helping add color </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and break it down and really explain it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Chess has been really
good at that recently. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I mean, I like watching
the World Championships, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but even then there are periods </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where nothing happens for 20 minutes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's like, I got shit
to do, man, like, come on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, sometimes I get recommended a clip </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> of Magnus Carlsen streaming
or something like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's just like an out of context clip </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> of this fucking 500 IQ move. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And then the move happens </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I don't even know it's happened. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Because it was like five moves
ago that he reacted to it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I remember, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I think one of the funniest
videos I've seen is just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can't remember the exact video, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but it's a parody video
of someone commentating </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> on a Magnus Carlsen stream. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's just a normal person
commenting on his stream. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "And Magnus Carlsen
leaves his knight hanging. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Is he gonna take it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Is the opponent gonna take it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No, he doesn't take it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He doesn't take the free knight. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh, now he's left his queen hanging. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Is he gonna take the queen? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Magnus, the queen is right there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No, he doesn't take the queen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he looks like he's in
an awful position right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he resigns, Magnus Carlsen resigns. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know what's going on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's just... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's exactly how I feel watching, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a high level chess game
when I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there is the hanging queen right there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Why is Magnus Carlsen not
taking the hanging? Oh. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he's just resigned for no reason. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he scrolls to the comments section </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's never the top comment </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's explaining what's happening. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's always buried a few comments down. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just be like, can someone
just explain to me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what I just witnessed, please. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But yeah, I mean like that's why, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one game I really want to get into, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause it sounds super interest, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it always looks super interesting to me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I'm fucking terrified of
possibly getting into, is go. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Go seems to me like, that is just like... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> chess is complicated by itself. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Go, to me, even just the concept of go, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it seems like what
viewing a bottomless pit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you cannot see the end of. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - My granddad was into go
and he was really good at it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And he tried to teach me
when I was in high school </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I was like, "I don't know
what the fuck is happening". </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I know you're showing me the
ropes really nicely and kindly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But all I'm thinking is,
"Ooh, black and white stones". </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - All I know is that Google's documentary </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about the AI they built
to beat the best player. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then I read, "Hikaru No Go" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was like, "I
understand what's happening." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, I like, because I also
read "Hikaru No Go" as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I read all of it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I remember there was a point
where they tried to explain </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what was going on to the viewer. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I think halfway through
the manga, they just stopped. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They just stopped showing the matches, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "I'm not even gonna try and
explain it. This guy wins." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And you see...it's a manga that just, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it bases its hype on of people, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> off of like character reactions, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as opposed to what's
going on in the match. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's not very good, is it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think it's because they
just assume you are like... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They figure, you got it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You're 15 volumes in, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you should know how this works by now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> We're not gonna explain it to you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I still don't think I
understand how football works </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and I watched all of.. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What you mean football? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sorry, American football. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh.
- Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sorry, football. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know how it football works. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And I watched, I read
all of "Eyeshield 21". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think I understand how it works. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't think that's very realistic. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You're not gonna be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're not gonna be watching
the Super Bowl and be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Well, he could have done
a devil bat ghost there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Why didn't he?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - But you know, when
you're watching something, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're like, "I feel
like I should understand </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how this base game works yet I don't". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Baseball's another one that
I've watched stuff about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm like, "I think I
understand the baseball, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> but I'm not so sure." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Really? Baseball's
fairly easy to figure out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't understand
when they swap that much, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> but then again, I've never watched- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - After three strikes, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Three strikes, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And they swap teams. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So you get three goes
and then everyone... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> No, 'cause then they all,
everyone on the field swaps? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Crew Member] Better strike out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah yeah, yeah, so, it's
not three throws, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, it's three...
- Three strikes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> So when you throw in baseball, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it can either be a strike or a ball. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - And you have a strike zone.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That pitchers have to throw into. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah. I know that, I know that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So when it's three strikes- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's one batter out.
- And then they're out, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and when it's three outs, they switch. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right. Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - And there are usually nine innings. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I never really like, even
when I read stuff about it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, baseball just doesn't look fun. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Am I bad? Am I wrong? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, baseball's hella fun, dude. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Really?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I love watching baseball. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's a lot of sports
that are fun to play, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but not fun to watch. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like it would be fun to play, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but not fun to watch. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - To me, that's baseball, that's golf. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> That's cricket. Sorry Indians. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm offended. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like I have fun playing them, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but watching them, I kind of fall asleep. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, I think kind of same
with American football as well, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I think my problem
with a lot of American sports </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> growing up with somebody watch, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, real football
and a lot of Europeans... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Whoa.
- Whoa. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yes, I fucking said it.
Yes, I fucking said it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's the amount of starting and stopping </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and the advertisements that go in between. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- That's, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's what I don't
really like about the NFL, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> the American football is like, yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just way too many starts and stops. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm just like, right
when a play is happening </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and you're like, "Oh shit,
here we go. Oh, they stopped." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't understand, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is again for someone who's... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Again, I think I understand
how American football works. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't, I'm not sure entirely. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - What do you mean, you think
you understand how it works? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think I understand the rules. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Right.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - But even when I'm watching it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my older brother really
likes American football, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I'm just thinking like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> why would I ever wanna
watch this over rugby? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I'd much rather watch rugby. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's no point where I've ever watched </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a American football game and thought, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> "Fuck, I wish this was rugby." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sorry, there's no point
that I haven't thought that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Every single time I
watch American football, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, "I just wish this was rugby". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think just because... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm gonna be the American here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm gonna be the American stick... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Tell me why, 'cause I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Sticking up for American football. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because, I think, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> even though I just complained
about the stop start, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think the beauty of American football </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is that it comes in bursts, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And when that burst happens, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't think there's another sport </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that could really compete
with American football </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with just the amount of-
- Hype. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The amount of small things happening </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in such a short period of time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause there are so many things
going on when it's in play. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Australian football would
like to have a word with you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay, I haven't watched
Australian football, Joey, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's our footy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay, Joey. Okay, Joey. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> But, to me, that is the real
strength of American football. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's super intricate,
especially when you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> when you have an idea of
like, "Oh, that's this plan, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> they're doing all these different things. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's fun to watch, but
it's like, it happens- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So quickly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It happens so quickly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And then by the time you're like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, that was kind of
cool", then they're stopped. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Also that's why I love basketball. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Basketball is so fun to watch. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Basketball's really fun.
- Basketball's hella fun. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it's sports that have
a constant movement going. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> That's why rugby is so
fun because it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> except if it's a penalty or whatever, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's just like constantly
moving, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, like to me...this is a preference. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> As a spectator sport, I do
like when the rules are... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how can I word this? Like, fluid? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, there's like
the offense and defense </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can change at any time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If there's a sport where, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you have an offensive
team and a defensive team, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then they swap at certain intervals, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like American football, like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Baseball
- Baseball. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cricket or whatever. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Then that's like... I like
it when anything can happen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> When there's more randomness of someone- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You want "Mario Party"? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, basically. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What are the items? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Banana, put some banana
peels on the baseball field, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and then I'll watch. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I mean every sport has- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You should play the
"Mario Baseball" game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> You'd love that game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Didn't they bring out
a new "Mario Soccer"? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, they are. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is there a "Mario Baseball" game? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, on Game Q. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - "Super Mario Strikers" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, "Strikers" is the soccer. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's the football- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - "Sluggers" is the baseball.
- Oh, "Sluggers". </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my God, dude, that's
a blast from the past, bro. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I tried to get that game for
Christmas for so god damn long. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> My parents had to buy it off
some shady Chinese website </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it turned up and my parents,
and I also was too young. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't know about region lock. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And my mom, bless her,
she tried so god damn hard </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> to get a copy of this game, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but they never sold it in Europe. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I found "Sluggers"
the other day, actually, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> in Akihabara and I bought it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and I played it for the
first time since I was 12 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I was like, "This game's godlike". </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Easily the best "Mario" sports game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, "Strikers" was really good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - "Strikers" is good, but-
- "Strikers" was so good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm just, I'm more of a a fan of- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I hope they bring out a new one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - But I'm more of a fan of
baseball than foot, than soccer. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no football, you were right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> You were right the first time, Joe. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, it's soccer. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - You were right the first time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's soccer. It's soccer. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - You were right the first time, Joey. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's soccer. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I refuse to call soccer
football. Oh my God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But anyway, that's been
this episode of "Trash Taste". </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> So we did talk about a
wide bunch of things today. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Very random episode. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, very random episode, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from wildlife to sad boys to
back to video games. Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - God, I wanna eat a fucking
tortoise so bad, dude. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> God, I wish I could have
tried that tortoise, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I bet it's so good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What is it with you and extinct food. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - First it's the extinct banana. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was born in the British Empire. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I would've been the one
guy there, like fuck, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> don't let him on the fucking boat, dude. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He's just gonna start bringing on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> weird fucking animals to eat. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The reason why it
hasn't had a genome name </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is because Connor cooked it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Dude, I would've been like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> "Sorry, scientists. Man, you gotta try it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh wait, you can't, I ate it all". </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, here's the thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Since we're past the era
of discovery where you- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Are we adding in another
topic before we end this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I guess so, I guess so. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Now that you mention it.
- Go on, then. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Since we're past the era of discovery, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm jealous of, not the
people who were the first </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> to discover this new land, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but imagine discovering a new animal </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and being the first
person to ever taste it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, the people who tasted
it of your type of people. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - What do you mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, I feel like,
you know, in Australia, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm sure Aboriginal
people had eaten a bunch </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of the stuff that was there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, of course.
- Sure, sure, sure. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But yeah, I guess you
would be the first foreigner </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to try it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah yeah, yeah.
- To document it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I guess. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I think to me, that's way more exciting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> than discovering new land mass. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Think about all the foods
that might have tasted good, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but the first guy who had
it thought it tasted bad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So he never, we never tasted it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. but it's also like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's a terrifying element to it, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because you don't like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> could you imagine the first
person who drank cows milk? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That would've been fucking terrifying. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Would it have been terrifying
or just really weird? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it's like, "Ooh,
this weird white shit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just came out from the tit of a cow." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I'ma drink it, you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I respect it, I respect it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Got big balls, big balls. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, they probably saw
the little cow drinking it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and thought, "I'll have that". </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like, "Oh, if he's..." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Can't blame that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Anyway, that's been-
- That's been "Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's been "Trash Taste". </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know who else
likes milk? Our patreons. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They love milk. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And probably giant tortoise too. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was thinking the entire time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> how the fuck am I gonna
segue way into the patreons? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Milk.
- Milk. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - You like milk, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This guy loves giant
tortoise, right here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I thought you said something
completely different, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I thought you said, do you
know who we love to milk? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Our patreons. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wow, Garnt. </SPEAKER_02>
