<garnt> - Bu de bop, bop, bop, bop, bop. </garnt>
<connor> - Ski di bop, bop, bop, bop, bop. </connor>
<connor> - Ah! </connor>
<garnt> - We all good? </garnt>
<garnt> Recording audio? </garnt>
<garnt> - No, we're not good. </garnt>
<connor> Something's wrong with us. </connor>
<connor> - Go ahead Garnt, do the intro. </connor>
<garnt> (intro music plays) </garnt>
<garnt> - Good evening mouth breathers. </garnt>
<connor> I am your host for today. </connor>
<connor> (co-hosts laugh) - Oh my God </connor>
<connor> - I am your host for today nose breather Garnt. </connor>
<connor> And today are my fellow nose breathers Connor, and Joey, </connor>
<joey> as you can see, they love my intro right now. </joey>
<joey> - I actually did. (Garnt laughs) </joey>
<garnt> - That was like a me-you dude. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt laughs) - I know right? </garnt>
<joey> I'm just like </joey>
<garnt> how can I make the most Joey intro of all times? </garnt>
<joey> - Just like every convention of interest. </joey>
<joey> Throw that out the window. </joey>
<garnt> Just make some shit up. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> So how are you boys been? </connor>
<connor> - Good. </connor>
<connor> - Sweaty. </connor>
<connor> - Sweaty. - Moist. </connor>
<connor> - It is still very hot. </connor>
<connor> We've talked about summer already, </connor>
<garnt> but it is still very hot. </garnt>
<garnt> Very moist. </garnt>
<garnt> It's still very. </garnt>
<garnt> - This feels like a conversation with my fucking dad. </garnt>
<garnt> - I know right? </garnt>
<connor> I'm just like, oh, I got to. </connor>
<connor> I have to talk about the weather </connor>
<connor> before we jump into a conversation </connor>
<connor> (co-host laughs) </connor>
<connor> All is well yeah, by the way you're dying granddad, </connor>
<connor> but how is the weather though? </connor>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<connor> This feels like that warming us up </connor>
<connor> for the Trash Taste Episode. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause I feel like when you're British, </connor>
<connor> the first thing you want to do </connor>
<connor> is just talk about the weather, right? </connor>
<connor> Or just complain about the weather. </connor>
<connor> That's just part of British culture. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - It's I don't know why </connor>
<garnt> it's like everywhere </garnt>
<connor> - because the weather is shit in the UK? </connor>
<garnt> - I feel like it's a test. </garnt>
<garnt> It's like, oh, are we going to socialize </garnt>
<garnt> in the normal capacity of the British standards? </garnt>
<joey> When talk about British people for the first time </joey>
<joey> okay, I'm good, I know what I can talk about and do now. </joey>
<joey> - Or are we getting super deep? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah I get it. </joey>
<joey> Cause if they come at me with something like way left field, </joey>
<garnt> I'm like, you're a weirdo. </garnt>
<connor> I gotta think about what's kind of coming next. </connor>
<connor> - It's like the only icebreaker </connor>
<connor> that's acceptable in British culture. </connor>
<garnt> If they're saying you're having a nice day, </garnt>
<joey> I think I'm talking to a psychopath. </joey>
<joey> If they just asked me how the weather is, I'm like, okay, </joey>
<garnt> I can, I can engage in a minimal conversation. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh even that's a left field like intro? </joey>
<joey> I thought we were going super like </joey>
<connor> Oh so the price of gold recently is skyrocketing. </connor>
<joey> - I think you have to understand </joey>
<connor> the sheer amount of skepticism that British people have </connor>
<joey> like asking how your day is, is like, is it good? </joey>
<joey> And then you're asking if something's good </joey>
<joey> and no it's not. - It's like trick question. </joey>
<joey> - You're British. (Joey laughs) </joey>
<joey> So inherently it's not good. </joey>
<joey> So you know asking how someone's day was </joey>
<connor> and expecting any other response than, "oh, it's okay." </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Is, is you know reasonable. </connor>
<garnt> - And when I say you start off talking about the weather, </garnt>
<connor> you never compliment the weather. </connor>
<connor> It could be the best they ever, </connor>
<garnt> your British people will find something wrong with it. </garnt>
<garnt> You know? </garnt>
<garnt> "Oh, it's a bit breezy today innit." </garnt>
<garnt> And it's just like fucking 25 degrees outside you know, </garnt>
<garnt> which is very hot in British terms by the way. </garnt>
<garnt> Now that I'm out there, it's perfect temperature, but yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> How have you, what have you guys been up to this past week? </garnt>
<garnt> - Something's been on my mind, gentlemen, </garnt>
<garnt> - What? - I want to ask you. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause I was thinking about this last night, </garnt>
<garnt> I was turning over my bed wondering, </garnt>
<garnt> - Really? - Just, oh geez. </garnt>
<connor> I was like, I was like, </connor>
<connor> do I have a weird opinion on this or not? </connor>
<connor> So do you read fan mail? </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<garnt> - Honest answer. </garnt>
<connor> - Honest answer? - Honest answer. </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<connor> - Okay, okay. </connor>
<connor> You didn't have to say it like that Joey. </connor>
<connor> Just like, those fucking fans! </connor>
<garnt> No! </garnt>
<connor> - Wait, wait, wait, let me rephrase that. </connor>
<connor> It depends. Okay. (co-hosts laugh) </connor>
<connor> - I don't want to sound like an asshole. </connor>
<connor> - No, no, no. </connor>
<connor> Because a lot of fan mail I get is just </connor>
<connor> sometimes you get really weird fan mail. </connor>
<connor> And we have GeeXPlus for a reason right? </connor>
<joey> It's to filter out the like the, uh. </joey>
<joey> - Are you talking like physical fan mail? </joey>
<joey> Are you talking like emails? </joey>
<connor> - Both, both. </connor>
<joey> - Okay. Well I read physical letters. </joey>
<connor> Obviously. </connor>
<connor> - You get physical letters? </connor>
<joey> - Well sometimes I do. Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - How do you get physical letters? </connor>
<joey> How do they know where to send it to? </joey>
<joey> - I don't know, they just send it to GeeXPlus I guess. </joey>
<connor> - Oh my god. </connor>
<connor> Oh god. - But like even like back </connor>
<connor> during like the convention days and stuff like that, </connor>
<connor> if it's handwritten right, </connor>
<connor> then of course I'm going to take the time to read it. </connor>
<connor> Cause you know, they put some time into it. </connor>
<connor> Anyone can write up an email in five seconds. Right? </connor>
<joey> So it's like, you know, emails, it's different story. </joey>
<joey> - If it's more than like two paragraphs, then I'll read it. </joey>
<joey> Just to see what's going on. </joey>
<garnt> - You know, I was thinking about this. </garnt>
<connor> Cause I remembered this whole thing </connor>
<connor> that happened a long time ago </connor>
<connor> with this YouTuber I knew. </connor>
<connor> And it was this whole stupid drama. </connor>
<connor> And you know, one of the points that this guy proud, </connor>
<connor> prided himself on was the fact that </connor>
<connor> he responded to every single fan mail he got. </connor>
<connor> - Okay? </connor>
<connor> - Now, when you hear that as a viewer, </connor>
<joey> you're probably thinking that's amazing. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, what an amazing guy. </joey>
<joey> - That's great. </joey>
<joey> As a YouTuber when I hear that, I'm like, </joey>
<joey> oh, he's a psychopath. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - That guy's bad news. </connor>
<connor> (Connor laughs) </connor>
<connor> That's sounds so bad as a viewer I know. </connor>
<connor> But this is like, this is honestly one of the biggest </connor>
<connor> - Yeah that's honest to God. </connor>
<connor> - It is, like if you're a YouTuber, </connor>
<connor> you know that it depends on how big he is. Right? </connor>
<joey> Because you reach a point as a YouTube where you're like, </joey>
<joey> I'm going to reply to every comment and </joey>
<joey> be thankful to everyone. </joey>
<joey> - I'm gonna read all the comments. </joey>
<joey> - Which like, obviously we're thankful to our viewers, </joey>
<garnt> but you get past the point where it becomes unmanageable </garnt>
<connor> to respond to everyone. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. Which is why it's like the thing of, you know, </connor>
<garnt> I'm not saying that, oh, you can't check them. </garnt>
<garnt> You can check them right? - [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - But like people who are so proud </garnt>
<garnt> about the fact that they keep up with so much of it, </garnt>
<connor> it's like, you know, you have to wonder </connor>
<connor> you're like that isn't healthy for anyone </connor>
<connor> keeping up with that amount of, </connor>
<connor> - No, no. </connor>
<connor> I mean, let's just be honest. </connor>
<connor> I mean, most of it's praise, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And I feel like when someone is so into hearing about, </connor>
<connor> you know, "oh God, I love reading all these letters </connor>
<connor> of people thanking me." </connor>
<connor> I'm like, - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You're just a massive narcissist </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, well yeah. (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> - At the end of the day what you like reading </connor>
<connor> is you like reading hundreds and hundreds of letters </connor>
<connor> of people saying how amazing you are </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Or how much they like your stuff. </connor>
<joey> - And like, I guess, you know, </joey>
<joey> self-confidence aside all right like, </joey>
<joey> it gets to a point where it's like, Hmm. </joey>
<connor> - Even when I got like loads of physical letters, </connor>
<connor> like there was only so many I could read in the day </connor>
<connor> before I got like, - Overwhelmed? </connor>
<connor> - I felt like I was doing a disservice to the letters, </connor>
<connor> just reading them all in a sequence. </connor>
<connor> Cause I'm like, all right, </connor>
<connor> now I'm, now I'm doing what my human brain does. </connor>
<connor> And just spotting patterns. </connor>
<connor> And I'm spotting patterns between the letters </connor>
<connor> and I'm, and I'm forming a baseline. </connor>
<connor> - You start to get numb to it right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah you do, and I don't like the fact that </connor>
<connor> it kind of ruins fan mail for you </connor>
<connor> that you read it so much. </connor>
<connor> - I agree with that, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But I was having this thought and I'm like, I was, </connor>
<connor> I was thinking about it and I'm like, huh, </connor>
<connor> I don't think I've ever seen YouTubers who are like, </connor>
<connor> I don't fucking read any of my fan mail. </connor>
<connor> I don't read any of my fan mail or anything like that </connor>
<connor> because people are scared to say it, </connor>
<connor> but I guarantee 90% of the YouTubers out there </connor>
<connor> don't read their fan mail. (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> - I know it sounds bad. - Exposed! </connor>
<connor> - And this is one of those topics that I'd love. </connor>
<connor> This is why I like Trash Taste. </connor>
<connor> Cause we can talk about this. Right? </connor>
<connor> And we can kind of come at it from an angle </connor>
<connor> where I can kind of explain it in a way where it's like, </connor>
<connor> I hope that I don't come off as the asshole </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - Because it certainly sounds like it. (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - I mean it, I feel, yeah. </connor>
<connor> No, I get it. </connor>
<connor> It's definitely a topic that as a YouTuber </connor>
<connor> you're kind of scared touch on right. </connor>
<connor> - Because a lot of the people. </connor>
<connor> And I know this is so anecdotal, </connor>
<connor> but you know, I do see the line there </connor>
<joey> and the connection there </joey>
<connor> where I've met, I've met a lot of YouTubers who, </connor>
<joey> you know, they've uh, few of them are fallen off now. </joey>
<joey> A few of them still do it, whatever. </joey>
<joey> But you know, they, they prided themselves on it. </joey>
<joey> One interacting with their fans </joey>
<connor> and two, read all the fan mail and read all the comments. </connor>
<joey> - Interacted, how so? </joey>
<connor> - Well that's, okay because that's a whole nother thing. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah right? </joey>
<joey> - I don't trust YouTubers who </joey>
<joey> spend all their day, </joey>
<joey> in their Discord interacting with their community. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. - Right? </joey>
<joey> - Yes. </joey>
<joey> - That's one of the biggest red flags to me </joey>
<connor> as a YouTuber that I don't really wanna interact. </connor>
<connor> - I'm just like, one, </connor>
<connor> how'd you find the time to do this? </connor>
<connor> Because you have to find the time. </connor>
<connor> Basically if your interacting too much with your community </connor>
<connor> and reading fan mails and stuff, </connor>
<connor> and then doing YouTube on top of that, </connor>
<garnt> that to me says </garnt>
<garnt> you have no time to do anything else in your life. </garnt>
<garnt> I barely have enough time to do anything else in my life. </garnt>
<garnt> I had to cut this down a lot </garnt>
<garnt> just to make it manageable. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. Because, when I had my Discord in the start </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You know, it can be a very intoxicating feeling </connor>
<connor> to feel like, "oh wow, everyone's here for me." </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Look at all these people wanting to talk to me, </connor>
<connor> I'm so popular. </connor>
<connor> I've never had this before, you know? </connor>
<connor> Cause you know, </connor>
<connor> you cut back a year or two before this </connor>
<connor> and I'm the guy who can barely </connor>
<connor> get four people to turn up to a fucking event. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? Like. </connor>
<connor> So you kind of get intoxicated on this, </connor>
<connor> like almost narcissistic tendency of the fact that </connor>
<connor> you love the fact that everyone wants to talk to you </connor>
<garnt> - Right. </garnt>
<garnt> - And that everyone wants to comfort you. </garnt>
<garnt> And again, it's, it's not, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm not trying to slate the viewers or I'm trying to, </garnt>
<garnt> - It's completely different from my Discord. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, well this is </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm a fucking clown in my Discord. </garnt>
<garnt> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </garnt>
<garnt> - This private versus, even then. Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Even though your, your Discord is private, right? </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - They still want your time. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. - Right? </connor>
<connor> And so that's a, </connor>
<connor> that's a really difficult juggling act </connor>
<connor> because you have to separate yourself </connor>
<connor> to a certain extent to be able to, </connor>
<connor> you know, have a healthy relationship with it </connor>
<connor> because you know, I could talk about this forever, </connor>
<connor> but like there's, there's differences of audiences as well. </connor>
<connor> - We've got time don't worry. (co-hosts laugh) </connor>
<joey> - We do, we do. </joey>
<connor> - Maybe we can. </connor>
<joey> - I wanna stick on one topic for now, </joey>
<joey> but I will go into that because </joey>
<connor> there's a whole nother thing between the difference </connor>
<garnt> between male audiences, female audience </garnt>
<garnt> Which is kind of what we touched on before. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh God. Yeah, yeah. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And they have totally different things, but yeah. </connor>
<connor> Going back to the whole Discord and interacting and stuff. </connor>
<connor> So yeah, there's, there's two kinds of interacting. </connor>
<garnt> There's reading fan mail and all that. </garnt>
<garnt> Where to me reading the whole fan mail thing </garnt>
<garnt> is a very one-sided. (giggles) </garnt>
<garnt> - Thank you, thank you very much Ashley. </garnt>
<connor> - A one sided </connor>
<garnt> - For my Trash Taste coffee. - Fuck! </garnt>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<connor> - I'm trying to get in the middle of something here Garnt. </connor>
<connor> Fuck you! </connor>
<garnt> - 29.99 Plus shipping. </garnt>
<joey> Get it now. - Yeah at trashtastemugs.com </joey>
<connor> - I'ma drink water, you know while you promote. </connor>
<connor> - Go, go ahead Connor. </connor>
<connor> Go ahead. Go ahead. </connor>
<garnt> - [Ashley] I'm sorry can I get that? </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my God. (Garnt laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - The Trash Taste mug? </connor>
<connor> 29.99 Plus shipping. </connor>
<joey> - You know, I dunno. </joey>
<connor> Cause I just sat there and I thought, man, </connor>
<connor> this is so hard to bring up talking about the fact that you </connor>
<connor> don't read fan mail and not sound like an asshole. </connor>
<joey> - Wait, wait. </joey>
<joey> What got you onto this thought process? </joey>
<joey> Did something happen? </joey>
<connor> - Because I was just thinking back and I had this, </connor>
<connor> that moment of realization you get in the movies </connor>
<connor> and I've thought about this a lot. </connor>
<connor> And I just remember this like I said, </connor>
<connor> I remembered this situation with this YouTuber </connor>
<connor> who I had kind of a weird interaction with </connor>
<connor> and I didn't really like him. </connor>
<connor> And I always thought he was quite strange. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And one thing that he did that was just bizarre </connor>
<connor> is that he's one of those YouTubers who made like </connor>
<connor> 500 parts of opening fan mail. </connor>
<connor> And on one part, I understand because I did this </connor>
<connor> because for a little while I felt guilty that </connor>
<connor> people were sending this stuff </connor>
<connor> and they weren't getting to see my reaction to their stuff. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - But also once you, </connor>
<connor> once I got three episodes into doing this, </connor>
<connor> I realized, okay, well </connor>
<connor> there's only so many different ways </connor>
<connor> I can react to these fan mail. </connor>
<connor> - [Co-Hosts] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You know what I mean? Like this, you know, </connor>
<connor> and some of these stories that people would send you </connor>
<connor> are so deep and really intense, you know, and not, </connor>
<connor> not to take away from any of them, </connor>
<connor> but some of them would be really fucking deep. </connor>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Like, very emotionally exhausting. </connor>
<joey> - And I think that it especially feels weird </joey>
<joey> to like share that on video. </joey>
<connor> - Feels, one it feels weird to share them on camera. </connor>
<connor> And also, you know, as a YouTuber I'm thinking </connor>
<connor> when they wrote this story out, </connor>
<connor> you know, what do they want from me? </connor>
<connor> what did they expect when they wrote this story? </connor>
<connor> - Like do they want a response or something right? </connor>
<connor> - Like what kind of response that they want. </connor>
<connor> And also, you know, </connor>
<connor> is it impractical for me to write back now, </connor>
<connor> occasionally I'm saying this now </connor>
<connor> I'm probably gonna never do this again, </connor>
<connor> because this is probably going to be, </connor>
<connor> because I don't want people to take advantage of this. </connor>
<connor> Occasionally when people did send me like really touching </connor>
<connor> things to my email, you know, </connor>
<connor> all very like emotional things. </connor>
<connor> I would reply and just be like. </connor>
<connor> Hey man, keep your head up or whatever. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I would do that. </connor>
<connor> But I didn't want to advertise that I was doing that </connor>
<connor> because I didn't want people to think </connor>
<connor> that if they sent me a sob story, </connor>
<connor> I would reply being like, </connor>
<connor> "Hey champ, pick yourself up. </connor>
<connor> You know, here's a 10 bucks fuck off." </connor>
<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<connor> You know what I mean? But you know, </connor>
<connor> - You didn't want to like </connor>
<joey> sell yourself as the therapist right? </joey>
<connor> - No. 'Cause you know, </connor>
<connor> when you start doing the fan mail stuff more often than not, </connor>
<connor> I find that it does come to that. </connor>
<connor> Cause that's just how it is. You know, </connor>
<garnt> people realize you respond, </garnt>
<connor> people start taking advantage of that. </connor>
<garnt> - I think the biggest difference between you and us. </garnt>
<garnt> Well, at least me, </garnt>
<garnt> like when you were basically building your audiences, </garnt>
<connor> that your contents, </connor>
<connor> a lot of it revolved around fan interaction, </connor>
<connor> - Oh like 80% of it. </connor>
<connor> - Like fan calls and fan mails and like reading fan comments </connor>
<connor> and everything like that. </connor>
<connor> And to me, I've like I dunno, how many, </connor>
<connor> how much fan mail you get, </connor>
<connor> I probably get a lot less than what you had to go through. </connor>
<connor> So like to me, </connor>
<connor> whenever I get a really deep story or like a really long </connor>
<garnt> piece of email, a really long email, that's when I do, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm able to sit down and read it because I rarely, </garnt>
<connor> rarely get one of those. </connor>
<connor> Most of the time. </connor>
<garnt> It's just like, "can you review school days please?" </garnt>
<connor> - I've messaged studio with letting them know </connor>
<garnt> that you want, </garnt>
<connor> - Mikasa and Eren. - Mikasa and Eren. </connor>
<connor> Fuck. </connor>
<connor> - That's the kind of mail I get most of the time. </connor>
<connor> So to me it's like a nice break. </connor>
<connor> Whenever I can see someone who actually has, you know, </connor>
<garnt> put effort into their fan mail and that's that's to me, </garnt>
<garnt> that's why I always end up reading it. </garnt>
<garnt> And it does still like mean a lot to me that, hey, </garnt>
<garnt> I've done something for someone that I've never met before. </garnt>
<garnt> And we'll probably never meet that doesn't matter. You know? </garnt>
<connor> - I mean some of the shit just like </connor>
<connor> I got real fucked up after a while. </connor>
<connor> Cause I was just reading this shit for hours on end. </connor>
<connor> Like it was just extremely depressing, you know, </connor>
<connor> because I want to help everyone out there. </connor>
<connor> Who's going through shit like that. But yeah, you know, </connor>
<connor> it's just some of the, some of the stuff is just, </connor>
<connor> - You can't help everybody. </connor>
<connor> - Some of the stuff is like, </connor>
<connor> I don't even know where to begin. </connor>
<connor> Like what do I even do to this? You know, </connor>
<joey> like one time someone had sent me a thing and it was this </joey>
<connor> really nice story about their dogs, right. </connor>
<connor> And it was just give me the fucking thing. </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> - You couldn't see off camera but </connor>
<joey> Ashley was just standing with the coffees like that. </joey>
<joey> For like two minutes. </joey>
<connor> - Ashley's like, ready to go. - While I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> Oh God, Connor's going to get on </connor>
<connor> like a really long story right now. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, so I was like just give it, </connor>
<connor> just give it. </connor>
<connor> - You know, there was this, there was a story. </connor>
<connor> And I remember cause it was just so, </connor>
<connor> the way they wrote it, </connor>
<connor> it was like some kind of momentous thing, right. </connor>
<connor> Where it was just like, I didn't know it was coming. </connor>
<connor> And so she talked about how the, you know, </connor>
<connor> these two dogs were amazing </connor>
<connor> and she's been doing a lot better. </connor>
<connor> And it was like, </connor>
<connor> it was genuine like a three page letter and it was great. </connor>
<connor> It was like all positive. </connor>
<connor> And it was like, </connor>
<connor> "oh yeah, so I was doing really bad in life. </connor>
<connor> I got these new support dogs to help me. </connor>
<connor> And it was amazing." </connor>
<connor> And then I can't I'm sorry. </connor>
<connor> It was so morbid. </connor>
<connor> At the end of this thing, right. </connor>
<connor> Of this thing, that's going amazingly. </connor>
<connor> She was like, </connor>
<connor> "oh, and then my dogs died after they got hit by a truck." </connor>
<connor> And it was like, this two thing of it was like, </connor>
<connor> "and now it's not going so well, but I'm trying." </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, what, what, what? </connor>
<connor> I was like emotionally, </connor>
<connor> like I was like the biggest bungee jump. It was, </connor>
<connor> it was like some kind of Monte Python skit. </connor>
<connor> You couldn't make this up. It was. </connor>
<connor> So if this was a comedy show, </connor>
<connor> you'd have said the comedy was impeccably timed. </connor>
<connor> This was so, and I remember it, cause I was just like, what? </connor>
<connor> I was like, what happened? </connor>
<connor> - That had us in the first half. </connor>
<connor> - What happened? </connor>
<joey> And you can't help but laugh because you're like, </joey>
<joey> this is so fucked! </joey>
<joey> This is so, and I felt so sorry. </joey>
<connor> I was like what is happening? </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, sometimes you just have a moment in life where, </garnt>
<connor> you don't know how to react and you just, </connor>
<connor> your first gut reaction is just to laugh. </connor>
<connor> - Just like, I had to re-read it three times. </connor>
<connor> I couldn't believe it. </connor>
<connor> I was like, wait, what? </connor>
<connor> - I think it's just like a nervous, like reaction right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah! </connor>
<connor> - Where you're just like, how do I react to this? </connor>
<connor> - You just, I never had a writing like that before. </connor>
<connor> If this had been done in a book. </connor>
<connor> This would be like, award-winning </connor>
<connor> this caught me totally off. </connor>
<connor> I didn't even think it was going there. </connor>
<connor> It was not a single, there was no like hint, </connor>
<connor> there was no indicator. </connor>
<connor> - Like some M Night Shyamalan shit. </connor>
<joey> - There was no, it was all great. </joey>
<garnt> And I was like, what happened? </garnt>
<garnt> - Jesus. - What is this? </garnt>
<garnt> It was like someone had written, </garnt>
<connor> it was almost like she wrote in the letter completely </connor>
<connor> in like three days. </connor>
<connor> And then waited, like two weeks </connor>
<connor> before she sent it and then made an addendum </connor>
<connor> at the end, just being like, oh, </connor>
<connor> and by the way, </connor>
<connor> - Like a footnote. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah just being like PS, by the way, </connor>
<connor> - PS they're dead. - PS, it's not good now. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like, what? </connor>
<connor> And then this is also, this is just terrible. </connor>
<connor> I don't want to, it's horrible to deal with that stuff. </connor>
<joey> - And it's like, what. </joey>
<joey> What does that person expect you to like react? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah and so, yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> But you know, not to take anything away from her, </connor>
<connor> I do appreciate her sharing that makes obviously you know </connor>
<connor> - Very personal. - Very emotional, right. </connor>
<connor> And in one hand, I appreciate it. </connor>
<connor> But I'm also hand when I hear about people who are reading </connor>
<connor> tons and tons of these letters and, and they love it. </connor>
<connor> And it's just like, what? </connor>
<connor> Like, can you emotionally handle all of this? </connor>
<connor> And if you can, like, I have to like, are you a psychopath? </connor>
<connor> Like, this is a, this is a lot, you know? </connor>
<connor> It's like, </connor>
<garnt> imagine if you were speed running therapy for some people </garnt>
<garnt> you're just like, </garnt>
<garnt> you get the sob story. </garnt>
<garnt> Then you got to get to help. </garnt>
<garnt> Like they just, they leave. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's like, this is horrible. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. I mean and I think it's, </connor>
<connor> it's unfortunate that we can't listen to everyone </connor>
<connor> because I got into YouTube because </connor>
<connor> I wanted to like just find other people. </connor>
<connor> - I wanna connect to people. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah I wanted to connect to people. </connor>
<connor> I wanted to find people with the same interests that I had, </connor>
<connor> which is why, a lot of the friends </connor>
<connor> a lot of our close friends in England </connor>
<connor> that we have now </connor>
<connor> are like people I met through YouTube </connor>
<connor> or through being fans of my content. </connor>
<connor> And through that, I kind of like for, for the longest time, </connor>
<connor> I kind of prided myself of like, you know, if you're a fan, </connor>
<connor> come say hi, and maybe we can be friends one day, you know, </connor>
<connor> who knows? And that was, that was when that was manageable. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> Like some, some of my first, </connor>
<connor> some of my first fans are now like </connor>
<connor> some of my closest friends, </connor>
<connor> one of them is going to be like one of those, like, </connor>
<connor> you know, some of them are going to be at my wedding, </connor>
<connor> - Groomsmen, right. - Yeah, yeah exactly. </connor>
<connor> So it's gone from that to now </connor>
<connor> like I cannot, you know, even if I'm, </connor>
<connor> even if I'm sure there are a lot of you guys watching out </connor>
<connor> there who I know I'm probably, you know, </connor>
<connor> that we could be pretty close friends. </connor>
<connor> We're just not going to have the opportunity for that, </connor>
<connor> unfortunately, right. </connor>
<connor> - Most likely, most likely. - Because like, to me </connor>
<connor> - Because there's one of you. </connor>
<joey> - Because there's only one of me and there's literally </joey>
<connor> hundreds of thousands of you guys, and it's, </connor>
<connor> it's an unfortunate fact that I just had to like, </connor>
<connor> make peace with and just be like, you know, this, </connor>
<joey> this is it's part of the job is managing </joey>
<garnt> kind of like my fan interaction </garnt>
<garnt> and just interacting with the amount of people </garnt>
<garnt> you can physically and humanly interact with </garnt>
<joey> and get emotionally involved with. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. And I guess, </garnt>
<garnt> and it's like that massive difference between </garnt>
<connor> someone who has come to that realization in their career </connor>
<connor> and is able to manage it. </connor>
<connor> And some people who are just like, </connor>
<connor> "nope, if you're a fan of me, </connor>
<connor> you're not just a fan you're friend, </connor>
<connor> you can approach me at any time," kind of thing. </connor>
<connor> But then they forget that the larger they grow and the more </connor>
<connor> and more of those fans become friends, quote unquote, </connor>
<connor> then it gets to the point where they're just like, </connor>
<connor> that's just their entire life. Right. </connor>
<connor> You end up with people like what you were saying. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. I mean, that could have been, </connor>
<joey> - Interact with their fans 24/7. </joey>
<joey> - That could have been me you know. </joey>
<joey> - There are a lot of YouTubers out there who have </joey>
<joey> - Still do that? </joey>
<garnt> - Still or who I'd say of, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> at the cost of their own channel, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> have continued to do it because a lot of them get really, </garnt>
<connor> I've seen the so many YouTubers </connor>
<connor> who get so sucked into their Discord. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And you know, this is why I said it way, way back. </connor>
<connor> You know, my number one piece of advice </connor>
<connor> is to not make a Discord server. </connor>
<garnt> A public Discord server. </garnt>
<connor> - Which is why we haven't made a Trash Taste Discord server. </connor>
<garnt> - Even though people have asked. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, it's my number one piece of advice to </garnt>
<connor> any YouTuber, because it's, it's a time sink, you know, </connor>
<connor> managing a Discord server. </connor>
<connor> Luckily now I don't manage it. </connor>
<connor> I've gotten it. </connor>
<connor> I don't go on there. - Yeah me neither. </connor>
<connor> - Like I post updates you know, </connor>
<connor> people understand it now, but you know, </connor>
<connor> I remember when I first started stepping back from it, </connor>
<connor> I would get a lot of messages being like, </connor>
<connor> I can't believe you aren't active. </connor>
<connor> That's so wrong, </connor>
<connor> this is your Discord server. </connor>
<connor> You should be active. </connor>
<connor> It's like, why, what would you want to do? </connor>
<connor> You want me to sit here and message you? </connor>
<connor> So the other 2 million people can't have a video. </connor>
<connor> Like you want to take time away just so I can, </connor>
<connor> I can laugh at the meme you sent me like kitten lord XD. </connor>
<connor> You know what am I supposed to do? </connor>
<garnt> - I actually had to coach Sydney through this </garnt>
<garnt> because she actually, I think she had a, </garnt>
<connor> like a public Discord and you know, at the beginning, </connor>
<connor> everyone wants to interact with their fans. </connor>
<connor> - It's great in the start. </connor>
<connor> - It's great, it's great. </connor>
<connor> Everyone wants to interact with their fans </connor>
<connor> as much as they can. </connor>
<connor> And it got to the point where Sydney thought </connor>
<connor> that if she didn't do it, </connor>
<connor> then people would think that she was ungrateful </connor>
<connor> for the attention or for like </connor>
<connor> for them supporting her channel. </connor>
<connor> And I'm just like, and she grew to a point where </connor>
<connor> she was waking up, just stressed. </connor>
<connor> She was waking up and she was like, </connor>
<connor> I've just got so many notifications. </connor>
<connor> - No, mate me too, me too. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah and it was like, she woke up </connor>
<connor> and for full like month, </connor>
<connor> I think she was just depressed because she didn't know how </connor>
<connor> to handle everyone trying to get a piece of her attention. </connor>
<connor> I'm just like, look, you've got to, because, </connor>
<connor> because this was, this was back when, </connor>
<connor> like this was back when she started to, you know, </connor>
<connor> kind of get a bit of, a bit of momentum and so and I like, </connor>
<connor> luckily she had me to coach her through it because I, </connor>
<connor> - Literally had like a perfect coach. </connor>
<connor> - Cause I was just like, look, </connor>
<connor> you've gotta just get past this point where </connor>
<connor> you've just gotta realize that it is part of the job. </connor>
<connor> And part of the job is just understanding that you can't </connor>
<connor> give everyone attention. I know you want to, </connor>
<garnt> I know it kills you to show everyone how grateful you are </garnt>
<garnt> for their support and everything. </garnt>
<garnt> But it's physically impossible for one person </garnt>
<garnt> at a certain size. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. Like if someone meets me in person and you know, </connor>
<garnt> if they want to speak to me, </garnt>
<connor> I'll gladly speak to you at any, we'll talk. </connor>
<connor> And I would rather that so much more </connor>
<connor> than a message through the screen. I don't know. </connor>
<connor> It literally doesn't mean anything </connor>
<connor> when you're messaging through it. </connor>
<connor> Like Discord, if you don't know the person, </connor>
<connor> I don't even know who you are. </connor>
<connor> Like Thanos over here, bro. </connor>
<garnt> I don't know what's going on. </garnt>
<garnt> - Honestly I think like the best way to just have a casual </garnt>
<connor> conversation, is it, I mean, you can't plan it, </connor>
<connor> which is unfortunate, but if it's mostly conventions, right. </connor>
<connor> If you see us at a party at a convention or just like </connor>
<connor> hanging out, </connor>
<connor> we look like we're just not heading somewhere or like busy, </connor>
<connor> then we'll probably have time to like, </connor>
<connor> have like a quick chat or something. </connor>
<connor> - I'd love to man. </connor>
<connor> (group affirmation) </connor>
<connor> That's why I wanna go to conventions. </connor>
<joey> - The quick chats are always the best I think. </joey>
<joey> - and sometimes you meet an interesting character and you're </joey>
<joey> just like, yeah, we should hang out later. </joey>
<connor> You know at like one of the parties </connor>
<connor> that we're going to or something like that. </connor>
<connor> - I've had people where I'm like, yo come. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> - It'll be fun. </connor>
<connor> - Right. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. But like, you know, </connor>
<connor> unfortunately that's just not something you can plan, </connor>
<connor> you know, we're going to obviously going to find it creepy, </connor>
<connor> if they're going to be like, </connor>
<connor> "okay, so this person can be here, at this convention, </connor>
<connor> and he's going to be here, here, here, here. </connor>
<connor> I can say hello here. </connor>
<joey> And hopefully," </joey>
<joey> - Just like corkboard it out. </joey>
<garnt> "All right hear me out, </garnt>
<garnt> he's gonna be here, so we have to rendezvous right here." </garnt>
<garnt> (all laugh) </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause like I've had a really weird kind of like strange </garnt>
<garnt> evolution of like interactions. </garnt>
<garnt> Now that Trash Taste has started, right. </garnt>
<connor> Because obviously the world hasn't opened up yet, </connor>
<connor> but I've now met like a few people post Trash Taste that has </connor>
<connor> just been like, </connor>
<connor> so like we've met in like a normal social situation. </connor>
<connor> So it's just been like at a friend's party or at like some </connor>
<connor> kind of gathering, but they're like, </connor>
<connor> "yeah, I watch Trash Taste." </connor>
<connor> And the first thing they say is, </connor>
<connor> "look, I know about the para-social relationship thing, </connor>
<connor> but like, I'll just say it upfront. </connor>
<connor> And like, </connor>
<connor> I understand that there's like a difference between </connor>
<connor> knowledge between what I know about you </connor>
<connor> and what you know about me." And I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> this is actually really weird because I think that's the </connor>
<connor> best way to handle it. Just, just like acknowledging that. </connor>
<joey> Yeah. </joey>
<joey> They're an active viewer </joey>
<garnt> and they know more about me than I do about them so, </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah just in meeting them they're like, I might like you, </joey>
<garnt> but I know you're not my friend. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> So I'm just like, I'm just like, cool. </garnt>
<garnt> Let's close that gap then. </garnt>
<connor> - Did you see the clip of Felix talking about it? </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<connor> - Someone asked out loud, "do you know Connor?" </connor>
<connor> He's like, "yeah I do." </connor>
<connor> He was like "I watch Trash Taste. </connor>
<connor> It's weird. I feel like I know them, </connor>
<connor> but I don't know them at all." </connor>
<garnt> - God that coming from Felix. </garnt>
<connor> My god! (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Felix was like "I feel weird. </connor>
<connor> I feel like that my friends, </connor>
<connor> but I've never spoken to them." </connor>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<connor> I would say that's great. </connor>
<connor> Felix is saying that, I was like, that's the best. </connor>
<connor> - That's the thing though, </connor>
<connor> if Felix is saying that then fucking everyone </connor>
<connor> is susceptible to it right. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah so you can't, don't feel guilty. </garnt>
<garnt> - Don't feel guilty. </garnt>
<connor> - The big boss man himself feels it. It's all right. </connor>
<connor> - The thing I'm trying to say is we don't know </connor>
<joey> how to handle it correctly. </joey>
<joey> As much as you don't know how to handle it correctly, </joey>
<joey> we're all fucking in this together. </joey>
<joey> - It's a very strange situation </joey>
<joey> we've all found ourselves in. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> But like, that's, that's why I'm, </garnt>
<garnt> I'm also glad that we are quote unquote like famous on the </garnt>
<connor> internet because like, you know, because like that's, </connor>
<connor> that's why, like, </connor>
<connor> if there's one group of people who are fucking sociopath's </connor>
<connor> it's fucking papparazzi, right. </connor>
<connor> Cause if you've seen any interview or just any documentary </connor>
<garnt> or any story following the paparazzi, </garnt>
<garnt> they're fucking nutcases. </garnt>
<joey> - The fucking Anthony Padilla video. </joey>
<connor> Like that still blows my mind to this day. </connor>
<connor> Just like hearing just the audacity of some of these guys </connor>
<garnt> just being like, yeah, I don't give a fuck </garnt>
<garnt> if the opportunity is there, I'll take it, </garnt>
<joey> I'm like what the fuck? </joey>
<joey> - Because one thing I'm thankful for </joey>
<joey> is that because we've grown </joey>
<garnt> up in an age where I think a lot of our viewers are more </garnt>
<connor> aware of, you know, what it's like and you know, </connor>
<connor> social boundaries and stuff like that </connor>
<connor> because we have places like Trash Taste to talk about it, </connor>
<connor> but fucking celebrities back in the day, they, </connor>
<connor> they didn't have this, you know, they were, </connor>
<connor> they were basically put on a pedestal and kind of like </connor>
<connor> almost looked at like a commodity and you can do anything </connor>
<garnt> you wanted to celebrity. </garnt>
<garnt> You can break all kinds of social boundaries. </garnt>
<garnt> And it was acceptable back in the day. </garnt>
<garnt> And that's why papparazzis were able to do what the, </garnt>
<garnt> whatever the fuck they did right. </garnt>
<joey> - It was just that like weird stigma of like, </joey>
<garnt> oh, you are famous. </garnt>
<garnt> Therefore you are open to any criticism. </garnt>
<garnt> You are open to just getting your entire private life </garnt>
<garnt> exposed by anyone at any time. </garnt>
<garnt> And you have no right to say because </garnt>
<garnt> that's the cost of being famous. </garnt>
<garnt> That's like bullshit. </garnt>
<joey> - That is bullshit. </joey>
<joey> - Like it's complete bullshit. </joey>
<joey> - I remember one time I saw a clip of Toby Maguire trying to </joey>
<joey> like trying to just, just go out of his driveway </joey>
<joey> and just go wherever he wanted to that day. </joey>
<joey> And he just got swarmed by paparazzi right. </joey>
<joey> And so the paparazzi literally </joey>
<connor> were just in front of his car, </connor>
<connor> trying to look, like a group of locusts, right. </connor>
<connor> Trying to like snap this picture of Toby Maguire. </connor>
<connor> And he like moves out slowly. </connor>
<connor> And he's just like trying to politely say, "excuse me, </connor>
<connor> can you, can you guys get out of the way? </connor>
<connor> Can you guys get out of the way?" </connor>
<connor> They don't go out of the way </connor>
<connor> he moves an inch and he goes, "excuse me, can you, </connor>
<connor> I'm just trying to get out of my driveway. </connor>
<connor> Can you guys get out of my driveway?" And they don't move. </connor>
<connor> And then he, of course like any human being, </connor>
<connor> he fucking gets angry and he loses it and he goes, </connor>
<connor> "dude move out of the fucking driveway! </connor>
<connor> I'm just trying to get out!" </connor>
<connor> And then the paparazzi's like, </connor>
<connor> "wow, what an asshole." </connor>
<garnt> And I'm just like what? </garnt>
<garnt> How up your own arse you need to be </garnt>
<garnt> to have this kind of mentality right? </garnt>
<joey> - Guaranteed the moment he started screaming, </joey>
<joey> all the paparazzi just simultaneously started drooling, </joey>
<garnt> being like, "that's a story right there. </garnt>
<joey> Let's go!" </joey>
<connor> - Which is why this clip got posted out right. </connor>
<garnt> - No one respects the paparazzi anyway. </garnt>
<connor> So it doesn't, it doesn't fucking matter. </connor>
<garnt> - No. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. In terms of like the social hierarchy, </garnt>
<connor> I believe they're like below fucking like dung beetles man, </connor>
<connor> like honestly, zero respect for paparazzi. </connor>
<connor> - I mean people would rather cockroaches in their apartment </connor>
<garnt> than paparazzi. </garnt>
<connor> - Probably, probably. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah, 100% yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I guess, take that one how you will, but yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Exactly. </connor>
<connor> - But yeah, I mean, going back earlier to the whole, </connor>
<connor> you know, giving attention, I think, you know, </connor>
<connor> like I remember one thing that people would say. </connor>
<connor> And they would like, they would praise you if you would, </connor>
<connor> if you would interact with your viewers, it'd be like, </connor>
<connor> "wow, this is so refreshing. You know, </connor>
<connor> big YouTubers is don't talk to their audience." </connor>
<connor> And at the time when you, </connor>
<connor> when you have like 50K subs that probably gets to your </connor>
<connor> head, what do you think? </connor>
<connor> Yeah, I am, I'm doing great. </connor>
<connor> Like I'm why can't these people interact with their fans. </connor>
<connor> So fun. This is great. </connor>
<connor> This is going amazingly. </connor>
<connor> And then you realize all you should realize shortly after </connor>
<connor> why that is a bad idea, because then you have no free time. </connor>
<connor> Like I remember specifically, </connor>
<joey> - Then your content starts to deplete. </joey>
<connor> - Well, yeah, I remember I would spend like </connor>
<connor> at least two to three hours a day on my Discord, </connor>
<connor> like answering messages, </connor>
<connor> keeping up with the server, just doing that. </connor>
<connor> And I'm like two to three hours a day on what? Like on what. </connor>
<connor> - 'Cause the problem is it slowly creeps up on you, right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - At first it was like 15 minutes of your day. </connor>
<connor> You just get 15 minutes, 15 minutes where you feel happy. </connor>
<connor> You're like, oh, people, people like me, </connor>
<connor> people like people like what I do. That's great. </connor>
<connor> And then like it slowly, </connor>
<connor> like five minutes gets added on like in a month. </connor>
<connor> And then you do content for two years and suddenly you're </connor>
<garnt> wasting two hours of your days. </garnt>
<garnt> You have two hours just gone. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And then, you know, also, you know, </garnt>
<connor> someone gets banned from the server and if you're active on </connor>
<connor> the server, you definitely get the complaint for the, </connor>
<connor> the reasoning. You know, </connor>
<connor> one thing that I noticed when I was on the server was that </connor>
<connor> every goddamn week someone would come to you and be like, </connor>
<connor> "my friend unjustly got banned and this is, </connor>
<connor> Connor's a dickhead. </connor>
<connor> Connor's a piece of shit. </connor>
<connor> He banned my friend for no reason." </connor>
<connor> You check the log, </connor>
<connor> the guy who said like the N word, like 10 times. </connor>
<garnt> And he's like, what? </garnt>
<garnt> Like what, what are you on? </garnt>
<garnt> - It's just words bro. - What are you on? </garnt>
<connor> - It's just words. </connor>
<connor> - Is this how it feels to be YouTube? </connor>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<garnt> When they take down a video. </garnt>
<connor> - Like, this is why I feel sorry for YouTube, </connor>
<connor> this is how they feel sometimes, </connor>
<connor> someone uploads like a titty or something. </connor>
<connor> like, what do you mean bro? </connor>
<connor> (Connor imitates angry YouTuber) </connor>
<connor> - "I can't believe YouTube banned me, what an asshole." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, and it's, you know, </connor>
<connor> when the Discord server starts its great </connor>
<connor> and when you have to actually moderate a Discord server, </connor>
<connor> that's where it gets hell. </connor>
<connor> And then you know that, you know, </connor>
<connor> when you bring a moderators, you know, some, </connor>
<connor> sometimes I remember my moderators sort of sometimes start </connor>
<connor> like in fighting and I'm like, what the fuck is this? </connor>
<connor> What is this? </connor>
<connor> I'm just trying to, </connor>
<connor> I'm just trying to make a server where I can thank my fans </connor>
<connor> and now it's turned into a whole, </connor>
<connor> you know, House Of Cards-esque situation </connor>
<connor> what the is going on here? </connor>
<connor> What the fuck is going on? </connor>
<connor> And there's just so many downsides to it. </connor>
<connor> And I just, it's such a, it's such a complex situation </connor>
<garnt> and feeling if you haven't experienced it, </garnt>
<garnt> it's so hard to think about all the possibilities of stuff </garnt>
<garnt> that comes up because I didn't think about any of this shit. </garnt>
<garnt> And even when I was in the middle of it, I didn't know what, </garnt>
<connor> what could go wrong, you know. </connor>
<joey> - Hey everyone, it's me, Joey. </joey>
<joey> And just Joey, the other boys are not here, </joey>
<joey> but I'm here to tell you about the sponsor for today's video </joey>
<joey> Express VPN. </joey>
<joey> Internet service providers know </joey>
<joey> every single website you visit </joey>
<joey> and ISPs can sell this information. </joey>
<joey> Ad companies and tech giants, </joey>
<joey> who then use your data to target you. </joey>
<joey> You don't want to be targeted. </joey>
<joey> I don't want you to be targeted. </joey>
<joey> And that's why Express VPN is here a baby. </joey>
<joey> Express VPN creates a secure encrypted tunnel </joey>

<connor> I use express VPN to watch anime on Crunchy Roll because </connor>

<joey> back to the episode. </joey>
<garnt> - Do you guys still read YouTube comments. </garnt>
<garnt> - First day Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> Yeah, first day. </connor>
<connor> I kind of, I kind of want to get the consensus </connor>
<connor> of the feeling from the viewers. </connor>
<connor> Cause I feel like the people who watch on the first day </connor>
<connor> are the core audience. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And those are the people I care about </connor>
<connor> hearing about the most, you know, I want to know what my, </connor>
<connor> the people who watch my video day one think. </connor>
<connor> Cause you know, </connor>
<joey> when the video starts doing really well </joey>
<joey> and it goes outside of your audience </joey>
<joey> that's when you get really weird comments. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - You know, like uh. </joey>
<joey> - The ones that turn into not English. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, so like my Rent-A-Boyfriend video like blew up. </joey>
<joey> I knew, I knew it was going to do well </joey>
<connor> because it's very good clickbait. </connor>
<connor> Like you see that and like. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah I saw that and I'm just like this, </connor>
<garnt> this is going to be a banger. </garnt>
<connor> - Even if the video was me, </connor>
<connor> even if the video was me just going to a Denny's and </connor>
<connor> just texting a guy and saying I rented it. </connor>
<connor> I'm sure the video would have done a million views anyway, </connor>
<connor> because thumbnail and the title is so good. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah well, yeah yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And like I said, I knew it would. </connor>
<connor> So there's some of the comments that were on it </connor>
<connor> that were just like what the fuck? </connor>
<connor> what the fuck are these? </connor>
<connor> And it's like, "Ew is he gay? </connor>
<connor> Is man gay?" </connor>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<connor> - Is man gay? </connor>
<connor> - Its like and just weird stuff. </connor>
<connor> Like, "I bet he smells nice" and all that kind of stuff. </connor>
<connor> And just, you just start to get like </connor>
<connor> the really strange comments coming out. </connor>
<connor> So I don't really give a shit about them, but yeah, </connor>
<joey> definitely day one, I check. </joey>
<joey> Sorry, I went on a whole explanation about that. </joey>
<joey> - No. </joey>
<connor> - No, no, no yeah, like, yeah, </connor>
<connor> For me as well, day one is kind of like the consensus </connor>
<connor> of like, again, it's like, </connor>
<garnt> it's the ones who are subscribed to you </garnt>
<garnt> its the ones that's always waiting for your video. </garnt>
<garnt> So it's like, you know, usually </garnt>
<garnt> I also don't just look at the top comments either. </garnt>
<garnt> I always look at it from a new. </garnt>
<joey> - New, newest yeah, you can't, </joey>
<joey> you can't always look at the top comments </joey>
<joey> because those are the ones, like, </joey>
<garnt> if there's anything with constructive criticism, </garnt>
<garnt> it's going to be buried down somewhere. </garnt>
<garnt> And I want to, those are the ones I want to find. </garnt>
<joey> - The most liked ones are usually </joey>
<joey> some kind of meme that came out of the video. </joey>
<garnt> - Or quote from the video. </garnt>
<garnt> - Or a quote from the video and yeah, I get it. </garnt>
<joey> We all, we all watched the video. </joey>
<connor> - The problem is, </connor>
<connor> is that I actually don't want to check the comments </connor>
<garnt> half the time </garnt>
<garnt> because I don't want to check my YouTube analytics. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. That's me too. </garnt>
<connor> I literally click on the video. </connor>
<connor> I'm just like, don't, don't show me the views. </connor>
<connor> Don't show me the views. </connor>
<connor> - So to check the comments on the YouTube app </connor>
<garnt> on the studio YouTube studio app. </garnt>
<connor> The first thing that pops up when you open this app </connor>
<connor> is your views, how the video is doing </connor>
<connor> and the amount of money you're earning and all that stuff. </connor>
<connor> I don't want to see that stuff. </connor>
<joey> - And the elusive something out of 10. </joey>
<connor> - We've talked about that </connor>
<joey> (group mumbling agreement) </joey>
<joey> - I don't, I don't want to know </joey>
<connor> how my video is doing every day. </connor>
<connor> Counterintuitively I probably should care. </connor>
<connor> You know, any expert in analytics would tell you </connor>
<connor> that you should be checking it and studying it. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I've been doing YouTube for like five years </connor>
<connor> off pure gut feeling. </connor>
<connor> And I think I'm doing all right. </connor>
<connor> I think, I think I understand what's going on. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - So I don't, I don't want to look at that. </connor>
<connor> I don't care how much it's making. I don't, </connor>
<connor> I don't care how many views it's getting. I just, </connor>
<connor> I just want to read the comments. </connor>
<connor> I don't check it that often because I have to see that shit. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - So I kind of. </joey>
<joey> - For me, it's just like, is it monetized? </joey>
<joey> Good. I don't need to see anything else. </joey>
<connor> I'm satisfied. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. I'd say check every two to three days now. </connor>
<garnt> - Really? </garnt>
<connor> - Just like once yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. Cause I think I checked on the first day </garnt>
<garnt> and then that's just it, </garnt>
<garnt> like, I just check, is this are people enjoying this video? </garnt>
<garnt> That's all I need to know. </garnt>
<garnt> And then I just kind of leave it at that. </garnt>
<garnt> But I remember before, when I first started, you'd like, </garnt>
<garnt> that was a full fucking week. Right. </garnt>
<garnt> I call it the honeymoon period where you were just, </garnt>
<garnt> you were so proud of this video and you just like kept </garnt>
<garnt> refreshing the comments and you're just like, come on, </garnt>
<connor> there must be a new comment. There must be new comment. </connor>
<connor> And I like that, like that, </connor>
<connor> that period was like a full-on week for me before, when I, </connor>
<connor> when I released a video. </connor>
<connor> And then the longer you do YouTube, the lower, </connor>
<connor> the lower that honeymoon period is until like, </connor>
<connor> it's like, it's different. </connor>
<connor> Because if you're really, </connor>
<connor> if I'm really, really proud of a video, </connor>
<connor> I'm still like checking more comments than, </connor>
<connor> than like some other videos, for example. </connor>
<connor> And I was wondering like, is it the same for you guys? </connor>
<garnt> Or is it just like the same for every video now? </garnt>
<garnt> Like how much do you guys see YouTube as a job? </garnt>
<garnt> Is it just like a completely a job now? </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, I'd be lying if I said its no longer a hobby. </joey>
<garnt> - It is no longer a hobby. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah it's no longer a hobby at all. </garnt>
<connor> - I mean if it wasn't for, </connor>
<connor> I think the job is what makes me have to upload weekly. </connor>
<connor> I wouldn't upload weekly if it was on my own back, </connor>
<connor> I think I would do once a month. </connor>
<connor> Cause I love like some videos. </connor>
<connor> I absolutely adore making, </connor>
<connor> like, there's this one video that has been in the, </connor>
<connor> I can't talk about it yet, but it's been in the works. </connor>
<connor> A lot of approvals. </connor>
<connor> A lot of, a lot of things have had to have been done </connor>
<connor> to get this video done. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But I'm hoping that when it comes out, </connor>
<connor> it's gonna be amazing. </connor>
<connor> And it's been like a passion project for a while. </connor>
<garnt> And that, that's just like saying that I would've done. </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah you know, regardless, like, </garnt>
<connor> even if it didn't make any money, </connor>
<connor> even if it wasn't my job, </connor>
<connor> like I would've made that like regardless like nothing. </connor>
<garnt> And so that's amazing when you get that, </garnt>
<garnt> but that only comes around I feel like </garnt>
<garnt> twice a year at most, </garnt>
<garnt> you get like a truly, </garnt>
<garnt> - At most yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - A truly passionate, really amazing idea. </garnt>
<connor> And everything seems to be kind of working. </connor>
<connor> You know, you get all the approvals you want, </connor>
<connor> you get all the, go aheads, you get all the, you know, </connor>
<connor> cause you know, especially now it's, we, </connor>
<connor> we do a lot of filming outside of our house </connor>
<garnt> in Japan need a lot of approval stuff. </garnt>
<garnt> It takes a long time. </garnt>
<garnt> Before it was just kind of like </garnt>
<garnt> how many hours can I put in on this thing </garnt>
<garnt> now it's become the case of </garnt>
<connor> can I get the right approval. </connor>
<garnt> - Because sometimes you just have to have a passion project </garnt>
<garnt> that was like, I think I was me in like </garnt>
<connor> the Fate timeline I did. </connor>
<connor> Cause like how, when, when did I first mention that? </connor>
<connor> - A year ago. - Like over a year ago </connor>
<connor> and it just got released like a few weeks ago. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> Cause I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> - is that a passion project or a job? Sorry. </connor>
<connor> - Oh, that was a passion project. </connor>
<connor> Cause I'm just like do really people are, </connor>
<connor> do people really want to hear </connor>
<connor> someone explain Fate for 30 minutes? </connor>
<connor> - Answer, yes. </connor>
<connor> - But like I had so much fun filming that and I'm just like, </connor>
<garnt> this is just a fun thing to work on. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I think everyone enjoyed it except for the Fate community </connor>
<connor> for some reason they sort of got salty about. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, I mean like you gotta, you gotta, </garnt>
<garnt> you gotta take, you gotta take it with a grain of salt </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes being an anime YouTuber, </garnt>
<garnt> you can very much piss off a lot of </garnt>
<garnt> different anime fandoms it's you know, it's to me, </garnt>
<connor> it's part of the job right because I feel like, you know, </connor>
<connor> I feel like with you, you're more of like </connor>
<connor> a personality with like who sells himself on just, you know, </connor>
<connor> I'm a guy living in Japan and I like anime. Right. </connor>
<connor> Whereas I think me and Joey </connor>
<connor> have had our fair share of experiences where, </connor>
<connor> because we maybe say our opinions of an anime or maybe like </connor>
<garnt> we've gotten to a point where we can have like an effect on </garnt>
<garnt> the community then sometimes, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes people can be unhappy with what we say. </garnt>
<joey> - Unhappy is a, it's a very loose term. </joey>
<garnt> - I'm being very civil with the words I use right now. </garnt>
<garnt> - No, no. I mean, I I'm, I'm your guys' friend obviously. </garnt>
<garnt> So I understand, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> where you guys are coming from and </garnt>
<connor> yeah sometimes I feel like fucking hell man. </connor>
<connor> This guy's being real harsh on you guys. </connor>
<connor> Some of these comments so much, Jesus Christ. </connor>
<connor> You just made a video about Fate. </connor>
<connor> Shut up bro. </connor>
<connor> Chill out, why you have to be so mean? </connor>
<connor> - I mean, that's why that's like, </connor>
<connor> I'd be lying if I said like that, </connor>
<connor> wasn't one of the big reasons why I don't make videos on </connor>
<connor> like popular or big franchises anymore because it's like, </connor>
<connor> it doesn't matter if I'm praising the shit out of it. </connor>
<connor> It doesn't matter if I'm saying an unpopular opinion or </connor>
<joey> whatever the fan base is going to get off either way, </joey>
<joey> just purely because of the fact that I made a video on it. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. I think, cause I never really, I thought I, </connor>
<connor> whenever I made videos about stuff, </connor>
<connor> it was always like the kind of ah, </connor>
<connor> BL communities and they're always just really grateful that </connor>
<connor> anyone was making videos about that at all. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, it's weird right? Cause like, </joey>
<joey> cause I've also like slightly stepped into that when I made </joey>
<connor> a video on Killing Stalking </connor>
<connor> and that was one of the most like </connor>
<connor> praised by the community videos I ever got, I was like </connor>
<joey> I though I was gonna get shat on. </joey>
<connor> - Hand to God, bro. </connor>
<connor> BL fans are like the best fans ever, man. </connor>
<connor> They are so supportive of anyone getting into BL </connor>
<connor> in any capacity. </connor>
<connor> They'll only give a shit If you get shit wrong, </connor>
<joey> they're just like, we're just glad </joey>
<joey> that someone's appreciating it. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. - Because it's so niche. </joey>
<joey> - And some of it is like amazing work </joey>
<connor> that just gets overlooked because it's gay. </connor>
<connor> Like, I mean, you know, so it's amazing. </connor>
<connor> And you know, seeing some of these communities, you know, </connor>
<connor> there are a lot of some shounen communities </connor>
<connor> that get very defensive. </connor>
<connor> The Fate one. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, cause I remember Garnt did this video. </connor>
<connor> I'll talk about it cause Garnt doesn't want to say anything, </connor>
<joey> but other people will be so harsh to Garnt they were like, </joey>
<joey> ah, Garnt made this video about the Fate timeline. </joey>
<joey> Like, oh something are wrong or, </joey>
<joey> oh how dare he get, you know, make this video </joey>
<joey> that's just terrible and incorrect in so many ways. </joey>
<joey> I'm like bro chill out man. </joey>
<joey> And I think some of these were the smaller YouTubers. </joey>
<joey> I think they were getting (group chattering) </joey>
<joey> - I'm like do you want to make a video on it? </joey>
<joey> Go ahead. </joey>
<joey> - Well, I think they have and they were just like, </joey>
<joey> it's not as good as mine. </joey>
<joey> It's like the point is that you have to understand is that, </joey>
<connor> you know, if you're a Fate YouTuber, </connor>
<connor> if you're a specific YouTuber and you're going to be more </connor>
<connor> focused on the oriented details of it, </connor>
<connor> when you're a more general YouTuber who covers more, </connor>
<connor> more topics, you know, </connor>
<joey> and you're covering a wide span of things, </joey>
<joey> you're gonna be focused on entertainment. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - And I feel Garnt's video in a lot of ways </connor>
<connor> was more entertainment based. </connor>
<connor> - When I watch Garnt I'm not giving a shit. </connor>
<connor> I'm not watching it for Fate law. </connor>
<connor> I couldn't give a fuck. </connor>
<connor> I just want to watch something funny. </connor>
<connor> - If I wanted to see Fate law I would go onto the Wiki. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah I want something. I want something, </connor>
<joey> - I'm just being real. </joey>
<joey> - I want something funny. You know? </joey>
<joey> So when I saw people, when I saw people you know, </joey>
<garnt> I feel like I'm just defending my friend here. </garnt>
<garnt> - As we should. </garnt>
<connor> - Keep, keep going. </connor>
<connor> This is, this is, this is the rare time where we, </connor>
<connor> where we've like got each other's back I guess </connor>
<connor> - we got you homey. </connor>
<connor> - We're not shitting on each other for once. </connor>
<connor> I'm feeling weird right now. </connor>
<connor> It's like Connors defending me? </connor>
<connor> (Connor laughs) </connor>
<garnt> - What's, what's going on? </garnt>
<connor> - I saw this and I wanted that, </connor>
<connor> you know when you're gonna hold your friend back. </connor>
<connor> You're like no, no don't do that. </connor>
<connor> I'm gonna reply because I'm like, </connor>
<connor> bro, you're missing the entire fucking point. </connor>
<connor> It's not to make a video that's correct about Fate. </connor>
<connor> Let's make a video that's entertaining about Fate. </connor>
<connor> The point is that yes </connor>
<connor> it's not going to be a hundred percent correct. </connor>
<connor> If it is fantastic, </connor>
<connor> Garnt's done a great job researching. </connor>
<connor> The point is, is that yeah, that might annoy you, </connor>
<connor> that somebody tells it wrong </connor>
<connor> and you've put in all this hard work </connor>
<connor> and your video is not gonna get as many views. </connor>
<connor> But by, by making a video about Fate, </connor>
<connor> you're giving an avenue for more people to get into Fate, </connor>
<connor> which, you know, when someone big makes a video </connor>
<connor> about something that you do, </connor>
<connor> it's great because you get a kick down effect, </connor>
<connor> whether you like it or not, you get that effect. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You know, there's the Fate people who made videos about it </connor>
<connor> are gonna get views from that video, </connor>
<connor> because guess what's gonna be recommended on a Fate video </connor>
<connor> Fate. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And it's just very, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> It's just another case of people </connor>
<connor> just wanting to take shots at the big guys. </connor>
<connor> And I dunno, I've never really had to deal with it. </connor>
<connor> So I'm all right. But I feel bad for you two, </connor>
<garnt> cause for some reason you guys are like punching bags </garnt>
<connor> for all the people, I don't know why. </connor>
<connor> - I mean its, </connor>
<connor> - I think it's weird because </connor>
<connor> I obviously never intended this, </connor>
<joey> but I think it's just because we are seen as kind of, </joey>
<joey> kind of like pseudo critics or whatever. </joey>
<joey> Like I dunno, cause I don't see myself </joey>
<connor> as anything of the sort. </connor>
<garnt> I just see myself as like </garnt>
<garnt> one guy giving an opinion. </garnt>
<joey> - And I've said that so many times with videos, </joey>
<joey> but the moment you say that </joey>
<joey> to the reviewing and critic fanbase, </joey>
<garnt> they're like, oh, he's just trying to be a critic. </garnt>
<garnt> He's just trying to be a reviewer. </garnt>
<garnt> He's trying to take out jobs. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm like, no, I'm really not. </garnt>
<garnt> I just want to make a video on this </garnt>
<joey> because I'm passionate about it. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, like I think there's, there's two things, </garnt>
<garnt> especially in the anime community because the anime </garnt>
<garnt> community grew up from being like a very niche, </garnt>
<garnt> small community. Right? </garnt>
<garnt> So sometimes like sometimes I will make a video or I will </garnt>
<garnt> title my video in a certain way because I do it with the </garnt>
<garnt> assumption that the person watching it knows nothing about </garnt>
<connor> the topic I'm talking about. </connor>
<connor> And the thing is because anime fans were and still are, </connor>
<connor> especially in niche communities, very, </connor>
<connor> very dedicated to whatever niche or whatever fandom that </connor>
<connor> they are a fan of. </connor>
<connor> They get, I wouldn't say very defensive, </connor>
<connor> but at least like they are very judgmental about what any </connor>
<connor> kind of content that gets made. </connor>
<connor> Especially like where, I mean, we talked about Fate, </connor>
<connor> but like especially shounen community. </connor>
<connor> I don't know what it is about shounen community. </connor>
<connor> That is, they are just so competitive with one another. </connor>
<joey> - [Connor] They are. </joey>
<joey> - Because there's so many of them as well </joey>
<joey> in this day and age. </joey>
<joey> - Like you say, you say an opinion, you know, </joey>
<joey> like it's just basically impossible to have an opinion on </joey>
<joey> any, any singular shounen show. </joey>
<joey> Right. I'm not, it's, it's, it's especially difficult. </joey>
<garnt> Especially like if you just make a tweet or something or if </garnt>
<garnt> you say I'm enjoying X more than X or people, people, </garnt>
<garnt> people will like take those words and be like, </garnt>
<garnt> what the fuck did he just say? </garnt>
<garnt> No fucking way! </garnt>
<joey> - I remember I tweeted it out ages ago saying like, </joey>
<joey> you know what, after all these different manga </joey>
<joey> that I've read from like all </joey>
<connor> the popular stuff to like the niche stuff, </connor>
<connor> no one thinks about at the end of the day, </connor>
<connor> I'm always going to go back to shounen jump. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And the shounen jump like community got on my ass for it. </connor>
<connor> Be like I can't believe you're discrediting, </connor>
<garnt> shounen champion and shounen Sunday and I'm like, </garnt>
<garnt> I literally praised you guys. </garnt>
<joey> What do you want me to. </joey>
<joey> What more do you want me to say? </joey>
<joey> - But the thing I've noticed, right, is that this is, </joey>
<joey> for some reason it's it's for the most part only, </joey>
<joey> only contained in like the shounen community </joey>
<connor> and the shounen culture. </connor>
<connor> Like for example, </connor>
<connor> I let's look I'm the Isekai guy, right? </connor>
<connor> So let's say guys, </connor>
<connor> I prefer ReZero over No Game No Life. </connor>
<connor> Nobody bats an eye. </connor>
<connor> Nobody bats an eye. </connor>
<connor> I say I prefer Demon Slayer. </connor>
<connor> I say, I prefer a Demon Slayer for fucks sake. </connor>
<garnt> I say, I prefer Demon Slayer over? </garnt>
<garnt> Demon Slayer, Demon Slayer. </garnt>
<joey> - This is such a controversial opinion </joey>
<joey> that his brain is literally stopping. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, I'm like, my brain is like don't say it. </joey>
<joey> - Don't say it! - Stop, don't say it. </joey>
<connor> I say I prefer My Hero Academia to Jujutsu Kaisen </connor>
<connor> everyone loses their mind. </connor>
<joey> I don't, by the way, that was just a, </joey>
<joey> that was just a random quote that I just generated that </joey>
<garnt> that's going to turn the internet on fire. </garnt>
<joey> - But of course, someone's going to take that </joey>
<garnt> out of context and be like, I can't believe Garnt said that. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. I think cause nobody respects my opinion. So. </connor>
<garnt> (co-hosts laugh) </garnt>
<garnt> So that's kind of whenever I. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's what I want. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't want people to respect me. </garnt>
<joey> - I don't want people to take my opinion that seriously. </joey>
<joey> - Whatever I say, no one really bats an eye. </joey>
<joey> They're like oh well I guess </joey>
<connor> Connor's never really had a good opinion so it's whatever. </connor>
<joey> - But I want that at this point. </joey>
<joey> Like I get it that, you know. </joey>
<connor> I appreciate- </connor>
<connor> - Probably cause I've never really criticized shows. </connor>
<connor> I just kind of say, I like it or I don't, </connor>
<garnt> I've never really gone in, </garnt>
<connor> I think it's when you've criticized shows, </connor>
<connor> people get the, </connor>
<joey> people start to probably in some aspects </joey>
<joey> value your opinion. </joey>
<joey> - Which, you know. </joey>
<connor> - Which is up to them. </connor>
<connor> - I respect that. I respect in a lot of ways, </connor>
<connor> but at the same time, it's like, </connor>
<connor> there were some people there's a difference between </connor>
<joey> respecting and understanding and opinion and taking that </joey>
<joey> into consideration and also basing your entire life around </joey>
<joey> that person's opinions. </joey>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - You know, like even me, like I've, </garnt>
<garnt> I've tried to talking about anime content. </garnt>
<joey> I've tried to not be so negative or like I've tried to like </joey>
<joey> only focus on things that I do like, </joey>
<joey> and that I want to highlight. Right. </joey>
<joey> - And that's a big difference. </joey>
<connor> - No, because I didn't use to be that way. </connor>
<connor> I used to be like, </connor>
<connor> you know, I used to like clown on a lot of shows, but now, </connor>
<connor> now I at least try to try to just talk about things I like, </connor>
<connor> but even, </connor>
<connor> even if I've just make a quick joke about something that </connor>
<connor> then that one line from a video that had nothing to do with </connor>
<connor> that topic or that fandom, that, that, you know, </connor>
<connor> that one quote gets spread around on Twitter and spread </connor>
<connor> around everywhere. </connor>
<connor> And especially now that we stream </connor>
<connor> and we're on Trash Taste </connor>
<garnt> there are people that can just take one line out of context </garnt>
<garnt> from a conversation that's not even to do with the anime </garnt>
<garnt> I'm talking about and just be like, </garnt>
<connor> oh Garnt thinks this. </connor>
<connor> Or Garnt thinks that. </connor>
<connor> And I've, </connor>
<garnt> I guess it's just something I've had to learn to deal with </garnt>
<garnt> as, as my content has evolved. </garnt>
<garnt> - I said the exact same things as you, </garnt>
<garnt> I could say the exact same things as you </garnt>
<joey> and nobody will bat an eye, </joey>
<joey> but the way you say it, it's like, bro, shits going down. </joey>
<joey> - It's like, CdawgVA said an opinion. </joey>
<joey> No one cares. </joey>
<joey> - It's very strange yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Gigguk says and opinion (loud gasp) </joey>
<joey> I sure must offended that nobody gives a what I say. </joey>
<connor> But on the other hand, I'm like, great. </connor>
<connor> If it means I don't have to deal with this, like. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh God, I wish I was you. </garnt>
<garnt> Well, I think, </garnt>
<connor> I think part of it just comes with time as well, </connor>
<connor> because unfortunately the longer you are on the platform or </connor>
<connor> the internet than the more quote unquote, </connor>
<connor> like I hate calling them haters because that just, </connor>
<connor> I just like people who dislike you, the more, </connor>
<connor> the more people who dislike you will slowly build up. </connor>
<connor> Cause I remember, I, </connor>
<connor> I remember when I first started my YouTube channel and like, </connor>
<connor> I think it was like the first five years of content. </connor>
<connor> Most of the opinions I saw of me were mostly positive. </connor>
<connor> Right. </connor>
<connor> But then there would be one comment </connor>
<connor> that you know had a negative opinion of me </connor>
<connor> or like one small community and </connor>
<connor> the longer you're on YouTube, </connor>
<connor> the more like the more negativity that gets built up slowly </connor>
<connor> over time, just because one, </connor>
<connor> your audience is getting bigger. </connor>
<connor> And two, a lot of times when you get a hater or when you get </connor>
<garnt> something, someone who doesn't like your content, </garnt>
<garnt> they're just going to stay that way. </garnt>
<garnt> And they're just not going to give you </garnt>
<garnt> the chance or another opportunity </garnt>
<garnt> because they're not going to watch your content anymore. </garnt>
<garnt> So that one opinion they have you </garnt>
<garnt> is going to remain that way </garnt>
<garnt> throughout the rest of your YouTube career. Right. </garnt>
<garnt> So I think it's also a thing with time as well. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause I think a lot of big YouTubers who've been on this </garnt>
<garnt> platform for a long time have had to deal with negativity, </garnt>
<garnt> building up over time. And I think, </garnt>
<garnt> I think there's no one that epitomise is this more than </garnt>
<garnt> maybe Felix and I like, </garnt>
<garnt> I've never personally talked to the guy, </garnt>
<garnt> but from what you've said about what you've said to you at </garnt>
<garnt> about how he deals with it, it's just like, </garnt>
<garnt> it just seems like the most mature way away. It's just, </garnt>
<garnt> it's just something you just got to deal with. Right? </garnt>
<garnt> Yeah. Honestly. </garnt>
<connor> - Part of the job, </connor>
<connor> - Do you find that it's possibly a reflection of the content </connor>
<connor> you make, you know, when you're saying it's more than that, </connor>
<connor> you're new, you're more negative focused. </connor>
<connor> Do you find that </connor>
<connor> you tend to get a more negative response from. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah, definitely. </garnt>
<garnt> When you have, I mean, that's, </garnt>
<garnt> when you have a controversial opinion, </garnt>
<garnt> then you will get controversial comments as well. Right? </garnt>
<connor> - But like if you're always saying like shows are trash </connor>
<connor> or this is bad, do you find that, </connor>
<connor> or did you find that the viewers were more likely to be </connor>
<connor> negative about things? Are you saying like, </connor>
<connor> are they more positive now that you've swapped to being more </connor>
<garnt> positive about shows? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Definitely. Definitely like, like one, like I. </garnt>
<connor> - Cause maybe that could be it for the difference. </connor>
<connor> - No, I mean, like, I, I, because I, </connor>
<connor> the reason I changed my content wasn't because of only </connor>
<connor> because of that is because some of the content creators that </connor>
<connor> I used to watch, and maybe I watched back in the day, like, </connor>
<garnt> I kind of noticed that man being, being negative, </garnt>
<garnt> it's just not very fun. And sure. </garnt>
<garnt> There are shows that I don't like, </garnt>
<garnt> - It gets more views though. </garnt>
<garnt> It gets more views. </garnt>
<joey> - Because you know, </joey>
<connor> - And that's the tough part. </connor>
<connor> - Cause you know, I remember there was always like, </connor>
<connor> fuck what was it, </connor>
<connor> like the, The Completionist whatever. Right. </connor>
<connor> Don't know if you've seen his channel. </connor>
<connor> - No. </connor>
<joey> - He always does like these top tens at the end of the year, </joey>
<connor> top 10 worst and top 10 best games. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Right. </connor>
<connor> And he would release them like back-to-back </connor>
<connor> and always the top 10 worst would get more views. </connor>
<joey> - Oh yeah, all the time. </joey>
<joey> even though they were like way lesser known titles. Right. </joey>
<joey> People just want to know what the worst thing is. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah I mean Needle Drop does the same thing every year. </joey>
<joey> Where its like the top 10 worst albums of the year </joey>
<joey> always did like twice the number, of the top 10 best. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. And if, I mean, </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like top 10 worst is just better clickbait because </garnt>
<connor> nobody really wants to know the top 10 best. </connor>
<connor> Or like people are less interested in knowing </connor>
<connor> what the top 10 best is. </connor>
<garnt> They want to know what the trash is. </garnt>
<connor> - Well, that's why I, when I try and be, </connor>
<connor> I try and dunk on something, </connor>
<connor> I try choose something that's just unanimously, </connor>
<garnt> - No, exactly. Right. </garnt>
<connor> - Not great. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. Which is why top 10 worst is good. </connor>
<garnt> Because normally if it's like the worst of the worst, then, </garnt>
<connor> then people there's, people won't bat an eye. </connor>
<connor> Because it's just like, </connor>
<connor> it's there to be clowned on, you know. </connor>
<connor> like I can clown on xArm all I want </connor>
<connor> and people will fucking love it. </connor>
<connor> Cause it's hilarious. I mean, have you seen xArm? </connor>
<connor> You know, I know you have Joey. </connor>
<connor> - It's amazing, I love it. </connor>
<joey> That was great. But like, if you, for example, </joey>
<joey> have a controversial opinion of a popular show or a popular </joey>
<joey> thing, it's going to get a lot of views. </joey>
<joey> But I feel like in the long </joey>
<joey> - But at what cost right? </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, in the long term, </joey>
<joey> like it just, it just makes you seem </joey>
<joey> like a cynical shit head. </joey>
<joey> And did that just hates everything. I just like, </joey>
<connor> - Not wrong. - Even like, </connor>
<connor> even if you just make one video about one popular show, </connor>
<connor> but just shit on it, </connor>
<connor> people are going to remember that for years. </connor>
<connor> Right. I don't know why, but people have such long memories. </connor>
<garnt> You could, you could, you could just make, like, </garnt>
<garnt> you could spend five years. </garnt>
<connor> - Is there an example that you have in your head. </connor>
<joey> One video that- </joey>
<joey> - People to this day still think I'm like the guy who hates, </joey>
<joey> Sword Art Online, even though I literally made what, </joey>
<garnt> two videos on it, </garnt>
<joey> out of the thousands of videos I've made in my career. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, </garnt>
<joey> - Even though, even though there are so many channels, </joey>
<joey> I can think of that have done </joey>
<joey> way more videos shitting on Sword Art Online. </joey>
<joey> And yet I'm just known as the guy. </joey>
<joey> Who's like, oh yeah, you hate Sword Art Online, right? </joey>
<joey> I'm like, yeah. </joey>
<joey> But I'm also like all these other things. </joey>
<connor> - Did you really hate Sword Art Online that much? </connor>
<joey> Or was it, </joey>
<connor> - I mean, </connor>
<joey> - Or did you play it out for the camera? </joey>
<joey> - Well, I guess I'll say it now. </joey>
<connor> I played it out for the camera, for sure. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, I know you, I know you fucking did. </connor>
<connor> - But I thought that was pretty fucking obvious. </connor>
<connor> I made a Vegeta Review 69 video, </connor>
<connor> which is like the parody character I made back in the day. </connor>
<joey> Right. So it's like, obviously, and again, </joey>
<joey> because back then when I was a lot smaller and I was still </joey>
<joey> building on my channel. </joey>
<connor> - But that's what you do when you're growing. </connor>
<joey> - That's what you have to do to grow. </joey>
<joey> - You think you have to be this exaggerated </joey>
<garnt> and you have to hate everything. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right, right. </garnt>
<garnt> - 'Cause like, I remember YouTube, YouTube, like reviews, </garnt>
<garnt> I guess went through this phase where being negative was </garnt>
<garnt> like the cool thing. </garnt>
<connor> - Well, it was like around when I Hate Everything </connor>
<connor> started popping up. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah like, I Hate Everything, Nostalgic Critic, </garnt>
<connor> Angry Video Game Nerd where it's just like </connor>
<connor> - Grade A Under A. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </connor>
<connor> Grade A Under A. </connor>
<garnt> It was just like being cynical was like, was just cool. </garnt>
<garnt> You know, that was, that was a cool thing to do. </garnt>
<connor> And it was a dark period in two years of YouTube, </connor>
<connor> was it 2014 to 16 I wanna say. </connor>
<garnt> - Or something like that? Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, then people, people, I think the audience, </garnt>
<garnt> cause I just felt like I just got fucking bored of it. </garnt>
<connor> Cause I'm just like what, what, </connor>
<joey> what what's what's cool about being angry. </joey>
<joey> I don't want to be, I don't want to be angry. </joey>
<joey> Let me be happy, you know? </joey>
<connor> - Wow, what a controversial opinion. </connor>
<connor> I know right. </connor>
<connor> - I just want, I just want to talk about things I like, </connor>
<connor> I don't want to, I don't want to, like, </connor>
<connor> it got to the point where you just watched, </connor>
<connor> you just watched content and you could tell they were, </connor>
<connor> they were like playing up the anger for the camera. </connor>
<connor> Then they were like, let's, let's just nitpick. </connor>
<connor> And just, let's just find something that I'm just, </connor>
<connor> I can just like be angry about and make jokes about, </connor>
<connor> even if I don't genuinely feel it. </connor>
<garnt> Yeah, Sword Art Online. </garnt>
<garnt> But like, I'm kidding. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm kidding. That's all. </garnt>
<joey> - I mean, it was true. </joey>
<joey> And that's why I don't really make those kinds of videos </joey>
<joey> anymore either because after a while I just realized like </joey>
<joey> there's only so much you can do and say with that kind of </joey>
<joey> content after a while where it just becomes like, oh, </joey>
<garnt> here's, here's X YouTuber getting angry once again about the </garnt>
<garnt> hundredth thing that he hates. </garnt>
<garnt> And it's like, all right, cool. </garnt>
<garnt> Anything else you can offer to the, to the website? </garnt>
<garnt> No. Okay. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just going to stop watching you, you know. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like what are some of the best fan bases </garnt>
<joey> in the anime fandom that you think of? </joey>
<joey> Cause we've talked about the worst, </joey>
<joey> - Trick question. </joey>
<connor> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </connor>
<connor> - Trick question. </connor>
<connor> - I'm just kidding. </connor>
<connor> - They all are. </connor>
<connor> - Like I said, I like the BL one. </connor>
<connor> BL fans are chill as fuck. </connor>
<connor> - Honestly, BL fans seem so welcoming. </connor>
<connor> I wish more anime fandoms were like that. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I think as well, like in a lot of senses, I think the, </joey>
<joey> the manga community, but like more so the, </joey>
<joey> the manga community that delves more into like the more </joey>
<joey> niche titles I feel is a little more welcoming. Cause like, </joey>
<joey> now that a lot of my content </joey>
<connor> is a lot more in that community. </connor>
<connor> I've realized that when you mention a manga that, </connor>
<connor> no one else has heard of, </connor>
<connor> but this one person knows </connor>
<connor> that they're like, whoa, holy shit. </connor>
<connor> They fucking mentioned my favorite manga. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, I want more people to read this guy </connor>
<connor> much like the BL community. Right. </connor>
<connor> So it's like, I feel it's again, </connor>
<connor> it's like the niche communities. </connor>
<connor> I feel are definitely the most welcoming. </connor>
<joey> The nicest. </joey>
<connor> - Although I will say, I think the BL fandom, </connor>
<connor> They just don't like people who like Fujo Bei. </connor>
<connor> You know people who like try and like </connor>
<connor> take advantage of the whole gay thing </connor>
<connor> who don't actually give a shit </connor>
<connor> about like supporting anything like </connor>
<connor> LGBTQ. </connor>
<garnt> - Obviously, if you're just, there. </garnt>
<connor> - There are a lot of people and I swear out loud, </connor>
<connor> TikTok as well, so many like people </connor>
<joey> who try and take advantage of stuff like that. </joey>
<joey> That's about it. But I mean, that's justified, I'd say. </joey>
<connor> Yeah, no, I, I, I, yeah. </connor>
<connor> Sorry, we went on a massive tangent then. </connor>
<connor> Cause I just fucked it up. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I think we're talking about passion projects before. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah we were talking about passion projects. </connor>
<garnt> Yeah. To me like, yeah, go going back to the Fate fandom. </garnt>
<garnt> It's it's really weird because being like, being like, okay, </garnt>
<connor> I can't like, it's so weird saying you're a Fate fan. </connor>
<connor> Right? Cause like you say, you're a Fate fan and, </connor>
<connor> and there are so many different levels of Fate fans. </connor>
<connor> It's like being a martial artist. It's like, yo, </connor>
<connor> are you a first Dan black belt Fate fan? </connor>
<connor> Or are you, oh, oh, </connor>
<connor> this guy's a fifth Dan black belt Fate fan. </connor>
<connor> Holy fucking shit. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah but the problem is you're all, </connor>
<connor> you're all losing, right? </connor>
<connor> Your Fate fans right? </connor>
<garnt> So like you don't win it all. </garnt>
<connor> So why it's like the biggest loser man. </connor>
<connor> - It's really weird seeing this dichotomy, right. </connor>
<connor> Because a lot of, a lot of Fate fans </connor>
<connor> have always been very toxic. </connor>
<connor> And I, like I acknowledge that it is the vocal minority, </connor>
<connor> but that vocal minority is very, very fucking vocal. </connor>
<garnt> Right. </garnt>
<garnt> But there's such a dichotomy between the normal Fate fans </garnt>
<garnt> and then just the Fate GO fans who are just like the most </garnt>
<garnt> welcoming people in the world. </garnt>
<garnt> And like, it's, it's like they, </garnt>
<connor> - Cause they want you to, they want you to spend money, </connor>
<garnt> so they feel less shame. </garnt>
<connor> - Like the Fate GO fans, </connor>
<connor> they already know they're degenerates. </connor>
<connor> So just like we got nothing to prove. Right. </connor>
<connor> And then there's, let's just like the, like the, </connor>
<connor> I would say like it's, it's less Fate fans. </connor>
<connor> It's like Fate GO fans </connor>
<connor> and then there's Type Moon fans. Right. </connor>
<connor> And it's, it's, it's so weird. </connor>
<connor> Like seeing that toxicity evolve over time. </connor>
<connor> Because I remember back in the day when I was just starting </connor>
<connor> to be an anime fan and just discovering Fate as a whole, </connor>
<connor> Right. </connor>
<connor> They were being, they were being toxic </connor>
<connor> for completely different reasons than </connor>
<connor> they, than they, </connor>
<connor> I guess they are now because before I remember there was, </connor>
<connor> there was like, go, </connor>
<connor> I'm talking about like old boomer stuff now. </connor>
<connor> But I remember there was this, </connor>
<connor> there was this review on ANN that was revealing Fate Zero. </connor>
<connor> Right? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And apparently this guy, this guy who did, </connor>
<connor> who wrote this review, got so much hate </connor>
<connor> that he actually wrote like a blog post or </connor>
<connor> an article saying like, oh, what, like, </connor>
<connor> apparently I am watching Fate wrong. </connor>
<connor> Like people are giving him because he watched Fate Zero </connor>
<connor> before reading the visual novels or before like, or before </connor>
<connor> - Ain't nobody got time for that fuck off. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> And I guess like now I'm getting a lot of hate because </connor>
<connor> to a lot of hardcore Type Moon fans, </connor>
<garnt> it makes it seem like I'm making it harder to get people </garnt>
<garnt> into Fate because I'm memeing it up. </garnt>
<garnt> And like, I'm like, I'm memeing up about how many series and </garnt>
<garnt> how all daunting it looks for a newcomer. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah but most of those people are being like, </garnt>
<connor> why is he making it seem complicated? </connor>
<connor> I'm like fuck right off! </connor>
<connor> - Because it is complicated! </connor>
<connor> - I know and I'm just like okay, like, as a Fate fan </connor>
<connor> I know that I don't think it's that complicated, </connor>
<connor> but you just like have some self-awareness to like, </connor>
<connor> look at this chart, </connor>
<connor> I'll look at this graph and just see how's this going to </connor>
<garnt> look for the average person, you know, that's, that's like, </garnt>
<garnt> it's, you can try to fight the good fight </garnt>
<joey> as much as you want. </joey>
<joey> But at the end of the day, </joey>
<garnt> it's a daunting franchise to get into. </garnt>
<joey> And that's just, that's just something that. </joey>
<garnt> - It's all perspective right? </garnt>
<joey> Because again, like to the fan, to the Fate fan base, </joey>
<garnt> it doesn't look complicated </garnt>
<joey> because they've literally spent years of their life, </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Studying it. </connor>
<connor> - My definition of a complicated show. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> If you need to watch or research anything outside of the, </connor>
<joey> the main, like twenty-five episode run. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> It's considered, I consider a complicated show. </joey>
<joey> If you have to then go and do additional research, </joey>
<joey> - Right, but yeah, that's the other thing, yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Literally anything that requires you to, </joey>
<joey> to go off the website and look at something else </joey>
<connor> to understand the story </connor>
<connor> is categorized in my head as a complicated story, </connor>
<connor> - But I feel, </connor>
<connor> - Because that's not self-contained </connor>
<connor> I can't just watch the show and be like, </connor>
<connor> I understand the Fate. </connor>
<connor> I have to look that's that's complicated. </connor>
<connor> - I feel that most majority though. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, most people don't, </connor>
<connor> That's a lot of shows don't require you to do that. </connor>
<connor> Think about every show you do not, you know, </connor>
<connor> to understand Seven Deadly Sins. </connor>
<connor> You don't need to go and read the Wiki article page to </connor>
<connor> understand what's going on. </connor>
<connor> You don't even Jojo, which has, </connor>
<connor> you know, part, part six is a very odd ending. </connor>
<connor> You know, you can just start seven. </connor>
<connor> You might be a little confused. </connor>
<connor> But you kind of get what's happened. </connor>
<connor> Like, you know, it's inherent. </connor>
<joey> - And you can also enjoy the story </joey>
<connor> without fully understanding it though right. </connor>
<connor> - To me, if there's any additional reading information, </connor>
<joey> it's complicated flat out. </joey>
<connor> I don't give a shit what you think </connor>
<connor> is or isn't as complicated. </connor>
<connor> If you have to read something else, </connor>
<connor> it's complicated because they haven't been able to fit it </connor>
<connor> into the goddamn run at the show. </connor>
<joey> - And again the whole definition of like </joey>
<joey> what a show is, you know, how complicated a show is. </joey>
<joey> I feel it's just completely dependent on the person, right? </joey>
<connor> Like, you know, I feel you're speaking for the majority. </connor>
<connor> In that sense </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> I feel like you have to think of when you're a Fate fan, </connor>
<joey> clearly you have something that's gone wrong where you can, </joey>
<connor> you can invest this much time into something. </connor>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<connor> - But a normal person will see that and think that's absurd. </connor>
<connor> I'm not doing that. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. I mean, it's, </connor>
<connor> this is like me as a Fate fan commenting on what I see as </connor>
<connor> the, of the Fate community. </connor>
<connor> But like, like how as, as like the most hardcore Jojo fans, </connor>
<garnt> how'd you feel about the Jojo fandom? </garnt>
<garnt> - Actually, I was going to say like, </garnt>
<garnt> say what you will about Jojo fans </garnt>
<garnt> obnoxious a hundred percent. </garnt>
<garnt> But like I know many Jojo fans, </garnt>
<garnt> I can speak for about all of them, </garnt>
<connor> but who are extremely hyped from anyone? </connor>
<connor> Would anyone even gives us a shot on Netflix or whatever? </connor>
<connor> You don't give a shit If you read the manga, it's like, </connor>
<connor> don't just get into Jojo. </connor>
<joey> Like we don't give a fuck. </joey>
<connor> - For any means necessary. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, It's like, I don't care </joey>
<connor> if you have to play the games. I don't, </connor>
<connor> I don't care if you have to consume it through memes, </connor>
<connor> just get into Jojo. </connor>
<connor> I feel like that is like the numb, like Jojo fan. </connor>
<connor> That's all they care about is get into it. </connor>
<connor> I don't care how you do it. </connor>
<connor> Just don't skip parts. </connor>
<garnt> If you're going to just, </garnt>
<connor> - Just watch it in order man, just watch it in order. </connor>
<garnt> - Just, just don't skip parts. </garnt>
<garnt> - Netflix has this brilliant thing </garnt>
<garnt> where they play it in order, just do that. </garnt>
<connor> You know? I think that's it. Like, I, I, I could be wrong. </connor>
<garnt> - Okay, okay, okay, wait. </garnt>
<connor> Well there's also this thing where </connor>
<connor> - Play the devil's advocate, I don't know. </connor>
<connor> - Well, no, no, no, no. </connor>
<connor> I'm not going to say to skip parts. I'm not, </connor>
<connor> I'm not going to do something sacriligeous, but like, </connor>
<connor> but like there's, there's, there's a part of me though, </connor>
<connor> is just like, </connor>
<connor> sometimes I just think a series shouldn't get mainstream a </connor>
<connor> series shouldn't get popular. You know? </connor>
<connor> Like there are some people who are just like, for example, </connor>
<connor> Jojo, right? </connor>
<connor> It's, it's popular as hell now. </connor>
<connor> Right. But like, part of me is just like, </connor>
<connor> I don't think Jojo should be a mainstream series because </connor>
<connor> it's just way too weird. You know? </connor>
<connor> Like I like could, like sure. </connor>
<connor> If you skip parts, it might be easier to get into. </connor>
<connor> But I just feel like </connor>
<connor> it's just not a series that lends itself to being </connor>
<connor> like the fucking Marvel franchise. </connor>
<garnt> You know what I mean? It's, it's just, </garnt>
<garnt> it's just too out there, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> because I feel like being part of the Jojo fan and like </garnt>
<garnt> beating a fellow Jojo fan does like, there's like, </garnt>
<garnt> it's like a connection there. You know, </garnt>
<joey> - So you also like that weird thing I like. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, right? </garnt>
<connor> And I'm like, especially go- </connor>
<connor> - And they kiss. </connor>
<connor> - And like especi- </connor>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<connor> - And then you see an unsucked dick. </connor>
<connor> - That's one of my favorite images. </connor>
<connor> I don't know why it makes me laugh. </connor>
<connor> It's like the gif of the Hulk running in the desert. </connor>
<connor> And it's Jojo fans when they see an unsucked cock. </connor>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<connor> I don't know why, and you know, and I love it. </connor>
<connor> It's so fun. </connor>
<connor> - It's so funny. </connor>
<connor> - Cause Jojo for me has just become full circle </connor>
<connor> when Jojo fans just want a clown on themselves </connor>
<connor> being Jojo fans. </connor>
<connor> Because its so, I don't know, I love it. </connor>
<connor> - There are just some captions though. </connor>
<connor> We're going on another different tangent. </connor>
<garnt> There are just some captions that just stick out in my mind </garnt>
<garnt> for like some gif or something. </garnt>
<garnt> That's one of them. </garnt>
<connor> The other one is just like. </connor>
<connor> - That's why I love that its main stream. </connor>
<connor> It's just so fucking weird. </connor>
<connor> It's just like, that's why it is main stream. </connor>
<connor> It's so fucking stupid. </connor>
<garnt> - I think Jojo, just like, I don't know why, </garnt>
<connor> how it was just so head of its time, because like, </connor>
<connor> it was made way too early </connor>
<connor> - For meme culture. </connor>
<connor> - For meme culture. </connor>
<connor> But like, it's sort of like predicted meme culture, </connor>
<joey> not even predicted. It was just made for meme culture. </joey>
<joey> And I like now it's getting popular because of the memes. </joey>
<joey> Right? And I feel like you meet a Jojo fan and you like, </joey>
<garnt> I know you went through, I know you go through part one. </garnt>
<garnt> You are you a real one. </garnt>
<garnt> You stuck through. </garnt>
<garnt> You had faith, man. </garnt>
<connor> - You watched all 50 epi, 48 episodes of part three? </connor>
<connor> - You believed. </connor>
<connor> - Nice. </connor>
<connor> - I was bored in the middle two man. </connor>
<garnt> I was bored too, but I sat through it. </garnt>
<connor> - But we go through it together. </connor>
<connor> - We go through it together. </connor>
<connor> - I think something that's not often talked about Jojo </connor>
<connor> it's the fucking there's, there is some boring parts. </connor>
<garnt> There is a lot of boring parts to Jojo. </garnt>
<garnt> - You know, its not a perfect show. </garnt>
<garnt> - I've met a lot of people who have </garnt>
<connor> fell at part one and part three, like it is, </connor>
<connor> it is a hard show to watch at part, at times. </connor>
<garnt> - Part three especially I think. </garnt>
<garnt> - You're rewarded </garnt>
<connor> - I actually thought, I actually, </connor>
<connor> I actually thought part one </connor>
<garnt> was easier to get through </garnt>
<garnt> than some of part three. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. Unfortunately, you know, I love part three to death. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause it's brought us some of the most iconic parts, </garnt>
<garnt> but you know, as a Jojo fan, </garnt>
<connor> I recognize that part three is </connor>
<connor> especially the anime is long. </connor>
<connor> It is not good at times straight out it's I don't think </connor>
<connor> some, some fights are entertaining as much as I love the </connor>
<connor> Orangutan and then stuff like that. </connor>
<garnt> That, that fight was kind of boring. </garnt>
<connor> - Like yeah. - It ended really meh. </connor>
<connor> - It's just weird. </connor>
<connor> - I think part three needed, </connor>
<connor> was like twice as long as it needed to be like, </connor>
<connor> the ideas were less interesting </connor>
<connor> than what you saw in like other parts I would say. </connor>
<connor> - I'm sure people disagree. I don't care. </connor>
<connor> That's just personally how I felt. </connor>
<connor> - Because like with Jojo fans are like, </connor>
<connor> Jojo, that you only hear about positive things about Jojo </connor>
<connor> because Jojo fans just want more people </connor>
<connor> to get into the Jojo. </connor>
<joey> The right way. </joey>
<joey> But okay, okay. </joey>
<joey> Totally off topic though, kind of on topic. </joey>
<joey> How'd you guys feel about gate keeping then? </joey>
<joey> - Gate keeping like shows? </joey>
<connor> - Yeah, or just gate keeping fandoms. </connor>
<connor> - In general? </connor>
<garnt> - In general. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know if its just because </garnt>
<garnt> I've become wiser with age. </garnt>
<garnt> Now I don't give a shit. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, I don't really give a shit anymore. </connor>
<connor> - I think when I was like 18, 17, </connor>
<connor> I probably cared a bit more. I probably, </connor>
<joey> - I definitely cared, you know, </joey>
<connor> back when I was making those like negative shoulders. Right. </connor>
<connor> But now I'm just like, if you want to get into a dude, </connor>
<connor> just like just getting into it. And it's like, </connor>
<connor> cause at the end of the day you can gatekeep all you want. </connor>
<connor> But like, you know, </connor>
<connor> if people do come in and find it and they don't end up </connor>
<connor> liking it, then it's whatever. </connor>
<joey> Like it's not, that's not gonna make a difference for you. </joey>
<connor> - I mean, it's easier for me to say now, you know, </connor>
<connor> my wallet is dependent on people getting into anime. </connor>
<connor> People get an anime. I'm like, come on in, </connor>
<connor> come watch some videos about it. You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> I'm like, come over. </connor>
<garnt> You want to find more about some Black Butler dude? </garnt>
<garnt> - I got, I got the right stream. </garnt>
<connor> - Come on in bro. </connor>
<connor> You know, </connor>
<connor> when you, </connor>
<connor> you get some, </connor>
<connor> you want some medication, </connor>
<connor> you want some additional shots you come to me, you know? </connor>
<connor> - Ah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Now it's great. </connor>
<connor> Cause you know, odds are that if you watch anime, </connor>
<connor> you might get into us. </connor>
<connor> So I feel like it's way easier for us to be like, yeah, </connor>
<connor> dude, I don't give a fuck. </connor>
<joey> Yeah. Come, come watch. </joey>
<joey> - Well, I mean, but I feel again it's, as you said, </joey>
<connor> it's because we have matured a lot, </connor>
<connor> - Yeah but also </connor>
<joey> - We've just realized like, oh, it's kind of pointless. </joey>
<connor> At the end of the day. </connor>
<connor> - But looking back when I was 16, 17, 15, </connor>
<joey> you know, </joey>
<joey> I think at the time I was probably defensive of it because I </joey>
<connor> was, I was probably, this was probably all I had, you know, </connor>
<connor> that made me happy. </connor>
<connor> You know, when, when you're, when you're 15, 16, </connor>
<connor> you don't really have much to get happy about. </connor>
<connor> And to me it was probably a thing of, </connor>
<connor> I don't want someone in these normies getting into it </connor>
<joey> because there's something that I care so much about. </joey>
<joey> And I'm so knowledgeable. </joey>
<joey> - I'm, so the one that understands this truly. </joey>
<joey> - Well yeah, you meme about it, but I also, you know, </joey>
<joey> I feel for people who, </joey>
<connor> who tie a lot of their self-worth to these shows. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> And I try and you know, </connor>
<connor> when I do talk about these shows as much as I want to, </connor>
<connor> to not discredit them for caring about it, </connor>
<connor> I want to kind of do them justice, but also help, </connor>
<connor> help understand that people becoming into their show. </connor>
<connor> It's not affecting them enjoying the show. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah. Cause, </connor>
<connor> cause I think the thing about gatekeeping, gatekeeping is </connor>
<connor> that I understand the mentality of why people want to </connor>
<joey> gatekeep and why people would do it. You know? </joey>
<joey> I understand it. </joey>
<joey> And in even some ways I do even empathize with it. </joey>
<joey> I just like, I think I've just like grown past it because, </joey>
<connor> because like I remember like back in the day, </connor>
<connor> when you're an anime fan, </connor>
<connor> you met another anime fan and there was just like, </connor>
<connor> - No, it was nuts. </connor>
<connor> there was like just this fucking connection. </connor>
<connor> - You just kiss right away. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. You talk about sucking dick. </connor>
<connor> Like we were just skip straight to fucking, </connor>
<connor> - Drop those pants right now. </connor>
<connor> - Like anal sex man. Like fucking, like what. </connor>
<connor> - It literally, especially. </connor>
<connor> - I'm like, just no, just fucking no way. </connor>
<connor> It's like that fucking, </connor>
<joey> - Bite down on the pillow, </joey>
<joey> - You know that like fucking Sonic and Mario GIF </joey>
<connor> (group chattering) </connor>
<connor> anime fans when they made each other </connor>
<garnt> in the early two thousands, </garnt>
<garnt> that's what he was like, man. </garnt>
<connor> - Especially in like the UK </connor>
<connor> where you don't really have many avenues </connor>
<connor> to meet, anime fans, it was insane. </connor>
<connor> Like he was like, you immediately became friends. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> And then like there, </garnt>
<garnt> there was like so much that you had in common </garnt>
<garnt> with each other because you, </garnt>
<garnt> you just had never met another person that was just that </garnt>
<connor> just watched anime or even knew of it. </connor>
<connor> So there was just like this it's going to sound so cheesy, </connor>
<connor> but it was just like, </connor>
<connor> it was just like a special bond that you had with you'd </connor>
<connor> thought you had that like just everyone outside </connor>
<connor> just didn't have. </connor>
<connor> And then like slowly as anime got more and more and more </connor>
<connor> popular, it just started feeling less special. </connor>
<connor> I guess. I didn't, you know, that sounds really pretentious, </connor>
<connor> but you know, it, it, it was special to you because it felt, </connor>
<connor> it felt like something that only you had, </connor>
<connor> only a small group of people </connor>
<connor> that you could connect with had, </connor>
<connor> and then as that medium grew, </connor>
<connor> you found more and more people with that maybe you didn't </connor>
<connor> vibe with as much, or you didn't connect with as much. </connor>
<connor> And you're just like, well, </connor>
<connor> this just isn't as special anymore. </connor>
<connor> And I feel like most recently the community that's felt this </connor>
<connor> the most probably is the fucking VTubing community. </connor>
<connor> Cause my, my God, the amount of gate keeping </connor>
<connor> I've seen in the Vtube, Vtubing community </connor>
<garnt> is like fucking insane </garnt>
<garnt> when it started to blow up last year. </garnt>
<joey> Oh, you're a Vtuber fan? </joey>
<connor> Name every Vtuber. </connor>
<joey> (all laugh) </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, well remember when, </joey>
<joey> I feel like there's been like waves. Like, </joey>
<connor> so I feel like first gen anime fans, </connor>
<connor> people who had to somehow bootleg it </connor>
<connor> from Japan on a VHS tape. </connor>
<garnt> And the second gen is probably your gen where you were able </garnt>
<connor> to get some online, </connor>
<garnt> but it was mainly through DVDs </garnt>
<garnt> and sharing and stuff like that. </garnt>
<garnt> But you were able to download some, </garnt>
<garnt> but I feel like I was like next gen, like, </garnt>
<garnt> this is where like, </garnt>
<connor> my first experience was like espaniol sub </connor>
<connor> part one out of three. </connor>
<garnt> That was like, that was like the worst option for me. </garnt>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And I, I feel like, yeah, we, we, </connor>
<connor> we're definitely seeing that with VTubers now. </connor>
<connor> And it does make it more like less special, but I feel that, </connor>
<connor> oh, I forgot, what I was going to fucking say, man, </connor>
<connor> I had a point that I totally forgot. </connor>
<connor> Oh my God, I'm fucking stupid. </connor>
<connor> - I mean I was gonna say that, </connor>
<joey> what the anime community went through is basically </joey>
<connor> what the gaming community went through 30 Years ago, right. </connor>
<connor> Like, you know, you start like you go back in the eighties, </connor>
<connor> there were kids who were like, </connor>
<connor> oh, you play fucking video games, you fucking weirdo. </connor>
<connor> But then when you find that one person who was like, </connor>
<connor> you like Sonic too, I like Sonic as well oh my god. </connor>
<connor> - And that's what, you know, and then they kiss, right. </connor>
<garnt> And like, and then as gaming got popular, </garnt>
<garnt> - And then they saw Mario and they were just like, </garnt>
<garnt> - And then they were like oh my god! </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh my god! </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh! </garnt>
<garnt> - And then, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> like in the nineties and early two thousands, </garnt>
<joey> when gaming got more and more popular and then, you know, </joey>
<joey> the school bully would also be like, yeah, </joey>
<joey> I played video games as well. Did you know that? </joey>
<joey> And, and then, you know, you would just, yeah. </joey>
<joey> And then at that point it would be like, oh, </joey>
<connor> maybe this isn't like a special thing anymore because now </connor>
<connor> everybody is doing it. </connor>
<connor> But then at the same time, that's like a good thing </connor>
<connor> because now we've got so many more games </connor>
<connor> and so many more amazing games that are just like </connor>
<connor> openly talked about with everybody. </connor>
<connor> So like at the end of the day, </connor>
<connor> you know, all those people who are gate keeping, </connor>
<garnt> like video games and stuff like that, </garnt>
<garnt> didn't really get anything out of it. </garnt>
<garnt> If anything that was stopping the advancement of something. </garnt>
<garnt> - Like the thing with the thing that I understand, </garnt>
<garnt> having things feel less special. But at the end of the day, </garnt>
<connor> you got to realize that to like kind of claim this kind of </connor>
<connor> piece of media or kind of fandom thing as yours, </connor>
<connor> it's just selfish at the end of the day. </connor>
<connor> - But they didn't make it for you. </connor>
<connor> They don't give a shit about you. </connor>
<connor> They made the show cause they want to make money. </connor>
<connor> They don't give a fuck about you. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah exactly right? </connor>
<connor> - Why are you having some connection to this? </connor>
<connor> I get it. You love the thing. </connor>
<connor> And you know, there is some artistry behind it and whatnot, </connor>
<connor> but yeah, the end of the day, it's like, </connor>
<connor> you're not fucking special </connor>
<connor> and the show doesn't belong to you. </connor>
<connor> And so I feel like it's almost ignorant to believe that you </connor>
<connor> have some ownership over it because you, you care, </connor>
<connor> you know, like, even as YouTubers, you know, you, </connor>
<connor> you do see people who are like I was here first </connor>
<connor> and as a YouTuber, I'm thinking, I don't care who was first. </connor>
<connor> I mean It's great. </connor>
<connor> - It's like cool. </connor>
<connor> - I appreciate it. </connor>
<connor> And I appreciate people who have been watching me. </connor>
<connor> But at the end of the day, it's like, </connor>
<connor> I don't think you're any more important </connor>
<connor> than someone who just came in. You know, </connor>
<connor> the only difference is is that you were just at the, </connor>
<connor> on the YouTube algorithm at the right time, the right place, </connor>
<connor> you know, no one's searched for no one typed in CDwagVA. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> So it's, you know, I, to claim some ownership over that. </connor>
<joey> - It's like you, they found you </joey>
<joey> in the same way that the person who </joey>
<joey> subscribed to you yesterday found you mostly likely right. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah and I don't. </joey>
<connor> And I'm sure the people who made X anime or made X movie </connor>
<connor> feel the same way where it's like, I don't, </connor>
<connor> I don't care how you found us as long as you watch it. </connor>
<connor> - Feel like you were just talking about a site then. </connor>
<joey> So my, mind you were like x anime, I was like, </joey>
<joey> - No, x anime is like, any, any anime. </joey>
<joey> - I was like X videos? </joey>
<connor> - X Hamster. </connor>
<connor> - X Hamster. </connor>
<connor> I can't hear the word X on a word and not just think. </connor>
<connor> - The whole Trash Taste set is falling apart as we speak. </connor>
<connor> - Do we want to take a break? </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, let's take a break. </joey>
<garnt> - Let's, let's take a break while we, while we fix the set. </garnt>

<connor> Back to the episode. </connor>
<connor> - I mean,at the end of the day, Garnt, </connor>
<connor> it's hard to sit here and be like gate keeping? Good. </connor>
<connor> - Do it. </connor>
<connor> - It's like, I feel like it's such a dated arguement and us </connor>
<connor> being like, hey guys, gate keeping, bad. </connor>
<connor> Is like, shit gate keeping is ended. </connor>
<garnt> - [Garnt] Wow. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah wow. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yo gate keeping been real silenced </garnt>
<garnt> since they dropped that episode of Trash Taste, man. </garnt>
<garnt> That's all I'm saying. </garnt>
<garnt> - Where's the response? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. You know, its like what am I supposed to say? </connor>
<connor> I guess it's a good discussion to have, </connor>
<connor> and then I delve into it, but I end of the day, </connor>
<connor> it's quite hard to just be like, yeah, gate keeping? </connor>
<connor> Good? </connor>
<garnt> - When has gate-keeping ever worked out? </garnt>
<connor> - Never. Literally never. </connor>
<connor> - If things, if things get popular, things just get popular. </connor>
<connor> I'm sorry. That's just, that's just the end all be all. </connor>
<garnt> And it's going to get, if it gets popular, </garnt>
<garnt> then unfortunately we have no control over it. So. </garnt>
<joey> Might as well just live with it right? </joey>
<joey> - I don't think a single fan </joey>
<garnt> has any control over how popular a show is going to get. </garnt>
<garnt> Especially when they didn't make it you know. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> - It's like the only thing that can kill a creation </garnt>
<joey> is the creator, you know, at the end of the day. </joey>
<joey> - Even then. </joey>
<connor> - And even then its like, </connor>
<connor> - Is there like conspiracy theorists, gate keepers? </connor>
<garnt> - What do you mean? </garnt>
<connor> - Like people who like believe in conspiracy theories? </connor>
<garnt> Do they like gate keep? </garnt>
<connor> Like, like, they like hide? </connor>
<joey> Like oh yeah? The millennium was fake? </joey>
<joey> How fake? Tell me about it. </joey>
<joey> You know? Oh, you're just a fake one. </joey>
<joey> You just saw it on the news, bro. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, you're a conspiracy theorist? </joey>
<joey> Name every reptilian. </joey>
<garnt> - Do they like, like gate keep the intensity of the theory? </garnt>
<connor> - I remember when the anime fandom </connor>
<garnt> went through a phase with like, </garnt>
<garnt> it was like a genuine discussion </garnt>
<connor> about how to spot a fake anime fan. </connor>
<connor> Like, do you remember this Joey? </connor>
<connor> You, you must remember Joey. </connor>
<connor> He, he remembers it. </connor>
<garnt> - I made a video about it. </garnt>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </connor>
<connor> I think it was like the third or fourth video I ever made </connor>
<joey> was called, like how to spot a fake otaku. </joey>
<garnt> - Oh my god! </garnt>
<connor> - Oh my god what a throw back! </connor>
<connor> - Well, I'm just, I'm just calling it, </connor>
<connor> calling you out today. </connor>
<garnt> - Joey's been real sweaty. </garnt>
<garnt> - You've really like dated my content. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh my God! </joey>
<joey> - And I remember thinking like, damn! </joey>
<joey> I just made some biting commentary. </joey>
<joey> - So wait, wait, wait. </joey>
<joey> How did you stop and spot a fake? </joey>
<garnt> I'm genuinely curious. </garnt>
<garnt> - Geez. </garnt>
<joey> It was like eight years ago. </joey>
<connor> - But I feel like Joey was that stereotypical </connor>
<joey> gate keeping anime fan. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah absolutely! </joey>
<connor> Im not even going to pretend that I wasn't that guy </connor>
<connor> because I was absolutely that guy. </connor>
<connor> But then again, I think a lot of anitubers were back then </connor>
<connor> and I feel that it was, again, </connor>
<joey> it was those kinds of anitubers who got watched. </joey>
<connor> - I feel like you've, </connor>
<connor> you've read the room </connor>
<connor> pretty well as time has gone on. </connor>
<joey> Like, I feel like you've understood what to change. </joey>
<joey> - [Garnt] Yeah. </joey>
<connor> - Well, you know, I became an adult at the end of the day </connor>
<connor> I realized, oh, </connor>
<connor> all this shit about like gate keeping and you know, </connor>
<joey> hating on a show that's popular </joey>
<connor> to pose a controversial opinion, that shits childish. </connor>
<connor> It's a lot of energy man to get anything about this stuff. </connor>
<connor> So I'm sure it would gatekeep if I had the energy for it. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? </connor>
<joey> - And you know me in real life, </joey>
<connor> I'm like the least angry person. </connor>
<joey> I don't get angry about shit very often. </joey>
<joey> - I feel like I get angry about dumb shit in life. </joey>
<joey> I don't really get angry about stuff. </joey>
<joey> I get angry about like, oh my, my taxi is two minutes late. </joey>
<joey> I get like fake, angry over it. </joey>
<joey> I just want to get angry about stuff, </joey>
<connor> but I'm not actually angry about stuff. I just wanna make. </connor>
<connor> I just want to like get angry about something to go on. </connor>
<connor> I'd be like, this pissed me off. </connor>
<connor> I'm not actually pissed off. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, you're just saying it. </connor>
<connor> - But I just want to say, </connor>
<connor> I dunno why I like doing that. </connor>
<connor> - I think it's just part of being British. </connor>
<connor> - I think so. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah I think you're just British. </connor>
<connor> - And everyone will know that I'm not actually angry, </connor>
<connor> but it just, </connor>
<connor> I just don't know why </connor>
<connor> I like getting worked up into like a funny way. </connor>
<joey> - I know when you're actually angry </joey>
<joey> because you don't tell me you're angry. </joey>
<joey> - I think I actually get angry. I'm like silent. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah that's the silent anger. </connor>
<connor> Oh, he's actually angry. </connor>
<connor> - But like I never get angry about stuff. </connor>
<connor> I like or anything like that. </connor>
<connor> Cause I'm just like, oh, all right. Okay. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. I mean, okay, cool. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. It's to me, it's like, if I get angry </connor>
<connor> over someone's opinion or something like that, </connor>
<connor> which is why like, I fucking love Trash Taste </connor>
<connor> where I'm just like, you have a shit opinion </connor>
<connor> about food or music or gaming or whatever. </connor>
<connor> We can just be fake angry. </connor>
<connor> And that's why I love discussing it because I love </connor>
<connor> discussing with anyone. Right. </connor>
<connor> Because you can like, when, when I call someone, </connor>
<connor> when I say someone has Trash Taste ha ha ha </connor>
<connor> - Trash Taste is fake. </connor>
<connor> Trash Taste is fake. </connor>
<connor> We're not actually angry at each other. </connor>
<connor> - When I say someone has Trash Taste. </connor>
<connor> You can say it with the knowledge that you don't actually </connor>
<connor> mean it. You know? </connor>
<connor> And if someone actually takes that seriously, </connor>
<connor> then I can be like, good. </connor>
<connor> - I think I get angry, but the emotion isn't there. </connor>
<connor> But actually some of some opinions you've said, if I'm like, </connor>
<connor> what the fuck? </connor>
<connor> Like I'm actually pissed off, but like, </connor>
<joey> I'm not actually like upset. </joey>
<garnt> - Like, I mean, you're not going to be like, </garnt>
<garnt> after the camera turns I give a, </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah, I don't give a shit. </joey>
<joey> - You get a visceral reaction where I'm just like, </joey>
<connor> I need to say something right now. </connor>
<garnt> - Well, the fact that you just don't like the bidet thing, </garnt>
<connor> actually may be like kind of angry that time. </connor>
<connor> So I'm just like, imagine like, you know, getting to, </connor>
<connor> - It's the angriest I've been all year. </connor>
<garnt> - I'm just like I can't, </garnt>
<garnt> like you've had this amazing opportunity </garnt>
<garnt> to have your ass sprayed. </garnt>
<garnt> And it just pissed me off that you didn't want to anyway. </garnt>
<connor> But that's totally different argument. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. I mean, </connor>
<garnt> - Uh, these are flashing. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh yes. Should we stop? </connor>
<connor> What the fuck is going on here? </connor>
<connor> I'm angry. </connor>
<garnt> - Being fake angry. </garnt>
<connor> - It is what it is. </connor>
<connor> Just be angry. </connor>
<connor> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </connor>
<connor> It is what it is. </connor>
<garnt> - I can't remember what point we left off at. </garnt>
<connor> - It is, what it is. </connor>
<garnt> I don't know. I don't know. </garnt>
<garnt> Our cameras cut out. </garnt>
<connor> They rather, the SD cards were full so. </connor>
<garnt> - We completely lost the point that we were on. </garnt>
<connor> - Basically when I'm angry, I'm not angry. </connor>
<connor> When I'm angry, I might be angry. </connor>
<connor> - When I'm silent. I'm actually angry. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But like going back to, </connor>
<garnt> cause I, like going back to like </garnt>
<garnt> having haters that won't </garnt>
<garnt> give you a content another chance. </garnt>
<garnt> Have you ever like watched someone's content </garnt>
<garnt> said it wasn't for you, and then for some reason </garnt>
<garnt> you came back years later and you're just like, </garnt>
<garnt> damn, okay, this content is actually pretty good. </garnt>
<joey> - Oh yeah, I've had a few options, </joey>
<joey> like a few times where I'm been like that. </joey>
<connor> But I think it's also because like, you know, </connor>
<connor> as you grow older, </connor>
<connor> the type of content you watch is just going to be different. </connor>
<connor> Right. So, you know, I've had the opposite effect as well, </connor>
<connor> where it's like, you know, </connor>
<connor> I think it's very common to be like, oh, </connor>
<connor> I used to watch this YouTuber. I grew up and then, oh, </connor>
<connor> it's not so much for me anymore. </connor>
<garnt> So you kinda grow out of it. </garnt>
<joey> But I think like growing into a channel as well, </joey>
<joey> is very much a thing </joey>
<joey> - I think, I think that's more interesting. </joey>
<garnt> Cause like you grow out, you grow out of a lot of channels. </garnt>
<connor> You know, a lot of, a lot of content becomes dated, </connor>
<connor> you know, especially if the creator doesn't evolve. </connor>
<connor> But what I find more interesting is that if you find a </connor>
<joey> creator that you just think is not for you and then you come </joey>
<joey> back years later </joey>
<joey> - Oh 100%. </joey>
<joey> - And you're just like, damn, </joey>
<garnt> you're a, you're actually a cool guy. </garnt>
<garnt> And you make cool content. </garnt>
<joey> - You know, if like 10 years ago, right. </joey>
<joey> When I was in my teens, </joey>
<joey> like you would never catch me watching like a Tom Scott </joey>
<connor> video or a, or a Mark Rober video. </connor>
<connor> Right. </connor>
<connor> But like now I feel like I love those channels because it's </connor>
<garnt> like super interesting. </garnt>
<garnt> And I feel now that I have so much more of just a base </garnt>
<connor> knowledge to be able to appreciate content like that. </connor>
<connor> Whereas, you know, again, 10 years ago I'd be like, </connor>
<connor> give me the poopoo PP jokes, where are those? </connor>
<joey> And those don't exist on this channel. Boring. </joey>
<garnt> - I'm trying to think if there is any YouTuber... </garnt>
<joey> - I feel like the biggest example for me was probably Felix, </joey>
<joey> where like, </joey>
<connor> especially when he like debuted as like the Let's Play It </connor>
<connor> and the face of YouTube, I'm just like, I'm just like, </connor>
<connor> who is this guy? </connor>
<connor> Who's this guy like making like, you know, I, </connor>
<joey> I think he was like, </joey>
<joey> - Screaming every video. </joey>
<joey> - Screaming every video, </joey>
<joey> like fucking doing, fucking doing ear rapes, like every, </joey>
<connor> every five seconds or whatever. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, this is just not my kind of content. </connor>
<connor> And then like, </connor>
<connor> it's so it was so interesting seeing his content evolve over </connor>
<connor> time and just being like, okay, he's not, </connor>
<connor> he's not even close to the face of YouTube anymore, </connor>
<connor> at least officially. </connor>
<connor> And, and now, like, to me, he like makes content. </connor>
<connor> That was just like, </connor>
<connor> I just started watching him like years back, </connor>
<connor> like after he had stopped the Let's Play phase, </connor>
<connor> because I can't remember how long it took for him to like, </connor>
<connor> change his content for being like of the Let's Player guy to </connor>
<connor> just being like the I'm just, </connor>
<connor> I'm just a meme guy and I'm just going to do what I want </connor>
<connor> because that content appealled to me way more. </connor>
<connor> And it was just really interesting to be like, oh, </connor>
<garnt> he's a way cooler guy than I ever thought he was </garnt>
<garnt> when I was a kid. </garnt>
<garnt> And I thought, and I thought this was </garnt>
<garnt> the kind of content that he made. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah definitely. </joey>
<joey> I feel like during his Let's Play era, like, you know, </joey>
<joey> he was showing a, a lot of himself, you know, </joey>
<joey> because at the end of the day, like, </joey>
<joey> I think the best way for Let's Players to grow </joey>
<connor> is to have that personality that you can, you know, </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Kind of attach to. </connor>
<connor> But at the same time, </connor>
<connor> like now that I know him personally, </connor>
<connor> I'm like that wasn't you. </connor>
<joey> Like that was not Felix. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> I feel like you become a successful YouTuber when you stop </connor>
<connor> trying to be a YouTuber. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> I think the real goals to being good YouTuber, </garnt>
<joey> is to stop trying to be one, </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<joey> like when you just embrace just yourself, </joey>
<connor> - Who you are. </connor>
<connor> - And what you like, </connor>
<connor> you know, like he, </connor>
<garnt> he makes videos on like philosophy from time to time, </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - You know, even though I might not </garnt>
<garnt> particularly have an interest in that. </garnt>
<garnt> I think there is something that is very interesting about </garnt>
<connor> someone who just wants to talk about something they like. </connor>
<connor> And once you have that base understanding of how to make a </connor>
<connor> video entertaining, </connor>
<connor> you can then apply that to things that your audience </connor>
<connor> probably didn't know anything about. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> And kind of get them interested in it, </connor>
<connor> or at least have them entertained for four or five minutes. </connor>
<joey> You know what I mean. </joey>
<joey> - My favorite video from him </joey>
<joey> to this day is still the one that </joey>
<joey> it came completely out of left field </joey>
<connor> that he made a couple of years ago. </connor>
<connor> He just made this five minute video of him </connor>
<connor> - I know what you're about. </connor>
<joey> just spilling his love over Blame. </joey>
<joey> - Blame. </joey>
<garnt> And that was that's oh my God, </garnt>
<joey> that's my favorite Felix video as well. </joey>
<joey> - Because it was so just like, </joey>
<garnt> it was nothing like he'd ever made before. </garnt>
<garnt> Like he made, you know, anime content every now and then. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - But for him to like, he wasn't even on camera. </garnt>
<connor> It was just his voice and just pictures of panels and him </connor>
<connor> just spilling his love over this very, </connor>
<garnt> very niche yet amazing manga series. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm like, damn dude. </garnt>
<joey> Like that's the most human I've ever heard you being. </joey>
<garnt> - Honestly, like a little secret here, </garnt>
<garnt> but that video actually inspired me to do more personal </garnt>
<garnt> videos as well. It was, </garnt>
<connor> it was that single video that just came out left field. </connor>
<joey> I was like, yo what, what, Pewdie Pie is this? </joey>
<joey> - Where are the ear rapes? </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know right. </garnt>
<garnt> Because I think it was, it was that video </garnt>
<garnt> not only like got me back into his content, </garnt>
<garnt> but also inspired me and inspired me to change my own </garnt>
<garnt> content to just be like, </garnt>
<garnt> maybe I don't need to be always be the ha ha funny guy. </garnt>
<garnt> Maybe I can make serious content as well. Right. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Ha ha funny guy? Very ha ha. </connor>
<garnt> - I don't like, I think the biggest curve ball </garnt>
<garnt> I've like had recently was recently, </garnt>
<garnt> I like got recommended a video of </garnt>
<garnt> Logan Paul's editor. Right? </garnt>
<connor> - Right. </connor>
<garnt> - Who went through his, </garnt>
<garnt> who basically broke down </garnt>
<garnt> how he edited some of Logan Paul's newest videos. </garnt>
<garnt> So it was like, it was like a new, </garnt>
<garnt> I believe it's a new editor. </garnt>
<garnt> That has been around for the more recent content, </garnt>
<garnt> And he broke down what he did </garnt>
<garnt> during the editing phase and like how </garnt>
<garnt> he broke down the story and narrative </garnt>
<garnt> and how he made certain jokes work. </garnt>
<garnt> And I was just like, yo, this is he, </garnt>
<garnt> this guy knows what he's doing. Holy shit. </garnt>
<garnt> He's a really good editor. </garnt>
<garnt> And then I watched some of his more recent content and </garnt>
<garnt> obviously like separating the man from the content he makes. </garnt>
<garnt> It was just really good content. I was like, </garnt>
<garnt> I was like fucking blown away </garnt>
<garnt> that I was enjoying a Logan Paul video. </garnt>
<garnt> And I just genuinely thought it was like good content. </garnt>
<connor> Like, I dunno, </connor>
<garnt> he doesn't upload that often anymore because why would he, </garnt>
<garnt> when he's making millions of dollars boxing, </garnt>
<garnt> whoever the fuck he's going to box, but like, </garnt>
<connor> - God, I wanna box someone so bad, </connor>
<connor> (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> just, just for the money. </connor>
<connor> I don't even give a shit about the sport. </connor>
<connor> I just, have you seen how much money they're making? </connor>
<connor> Fuck me. </connor>
<joey> - No, but I, I agree though, like, you know, again, </joey>
<joey> like there was always a for the longest time, </joey>
<connor> there was always that stigma of, </connor>
<connor> you know, like, oh, Logan, Paul video equals bad. Right. </connor>
<connor> But again, like I feel Logan Paul's one of those people who, </connor>
<connor> you know, to his credit </connor>
<connor> has kind of done a 180 on his content. </connor>
<connor> And has really like showed that like, oh, </connor>
<connor> someone can actually kind of mature </connor>
<connor> and like make a better person of themselves. And you know, </connor>
<connor> like you might not be exactly a fan of him, </connor>
<joey> but you have to respect the fact that he has changed his </joey>
<joey> content in a lot of cases </joey>
<joey> and for a lot of people for the better. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - You know? </garnt>
<garnt> - And this is just me, like purely as a content creator, </garnt>
<garnt> appreciating when someone makes a good content, </garnt>
<garnt> you can tell when someone's making good content and I can at </garnt>
<garnt> least appreciate that, you know what you do off the camera. </garnt>
<connor> It's something completely fucking different, you know? </connor>
<connor> But yeah. I mean, like going back to the boxing thing, </connor>
<connor> is there anyone you want to box? </connor>
<connor> Sorry, you just mentioned that. </connor>
<garnt> And I was just like, I need to know. </garnt>
<connor> - Anyone, I should make a tier list of YouTubers, </connor>
<joey> I think I could. </joey>
<connor> - YouTubers I could beat in a fight. </connor>
<garnt> (group chattering) </garnt>
<joey> - Trash Taste boxing special. </joey>
<joey> That's number one on the list, Garnt. </joey>
<connor> - Garnt. </connor>
<connor> (all laugh) </connor>
<connor> - Let's do it, let's do it. </connor>
<connor> - Only Garnt. </connor>
<connor> - Someone who can help me get a lot of money from it. </connor>
<connor> That'd be good. Dude, why would anyone else do it? </connor>
<connor> What the fuck? </connor>
<connor> No, they're all doing it for the money. </connor>
<connor> I'll do it for the money. The money seemed crazy. </connor>
<garnt> - The money's like the money is actually insane, but like, </garnt>
<garnt> okay. Like one thing, </garnt>
<garnt> one thing that I'm always struggling with as a creator, </garnt>
<garnt> right. Is, is the kind of </garnt>
<connor> the upload schedule that you gave yourself. Right? </connor>
<connor> Because to me, </connor>
<connor> unfortunately success - LMAO upload schedule. </connor>
<connor> - LMAO. </connor>
<connor> - LMAO. - What's that? </connor>
<connor> - For me, it's like way less than you guys. Right. </connor>
<connor> But you see a lot of YouTubers </connor>
<connor> go through this phase, right. </connor>
<connor> Where they have, </connor>
<garnt> they have this very strict upload schedule and then </garnt>
<garnt> they get successful doing something else on their YouTube. </garnt>
<garnt> And then their upload, </garnt>
<garnt> you kind of noticed that the upload schedule </garnt>
<garnt> for their main channel or their original channel. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh so YouTubers get successful doing something </connor>
<garnt> outside of their own channel. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - Are you ever, </garnt>
<garnt> how much personal attachment do you have to your own channel </garnt>
<garnt> that you, would you ever be scared if it dies? </garnt>
<garnt> Even though you're doing well outside of it. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, we have Trash Taste now, which is... </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah I mean, obviously I don't like failing at anything. </connor>
<joey> I'm a competitive guy. </joey>
<joey> - I wanna win in every aspect of my life. </joey>
<joey> - I don't want to fail in something. </joey>
<connor> If your YouTube channels dies, </connor>
<connor> are you a successful YouTuber? </connor>
<garnt> - Well, I mean. </garnt>
<connor> (co-hosts laugh) </connor>
<garnt> - If your YouTube channel dies, </garnt>
<garnt> but was once successful were you, </garnt>
<connor> are you a successful YouTuber? </connor>
<garnt> - Well, it depends - Not anymore. </garnt>
<connor> - There's plenty of people who say- </connor>
<garnt> - Would you say you're a failed YouTuber? </garnt>
<garnt> - There's plenty of people </garnt>
<garnt> who are still succeeding on other platforms. </garnt>
<joey> - It depends how your channel dies. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. - You know? </garnt>
<connor> If you killed it with your own volition and like, </connor>
<joey> because of something you did then like, you know, maybe. </joey>
<connor> - Oh yeah, but I don't buy the whole thing. </connor>
<joey> The algorithm fucked me over. </joey>
<joey> Fuck off. - No, no, no, not like that. </joey>
<connor> - If someone just said, </connor>
<connor> if you're a really successful YouTuber </connor>
<connor> and one day you're just like, </connor>
<connor> "you know what, I kinda wanna do something else." </connor>
<connor> And then you're just like, "peace out." </connor>
<connor> Then I think you can say you're a successful YouTuber. </connor>
<connor> If you got canceled for some shit. </connor>
<joey> Maybe not. </joey>
<connor> - What if you had like a slow decline, </connor>
<connor> your videos weren't really improving. </connor>
<connor> You'd kind of stagnated, you know, </connor>
<connor> your channel kind of just fizzled out. </connor>
<connor> Were you, are you a successful YouTuber? </connor>
<connor> - I don't think in that case that you're a failed YouTuber. </connor>
<connor> Everyone, not everyone will peak eventually, you know, </connor>
<garnt> that's just a part of life. </garnt>
<garnt> And that's just a part of the platform. </garnt>
<joey> - It's just a matter of like, </joey>
<joey> when you think it's the right time to end it, you know, </joey>
<joey> cause some people. </joey>
<joey> - Or some people don't even end it, </joey>
<garnt> but they are you know, </garnt>
<connor> they're still living pretty comfortably </connor>
<connor> and they're still getting decent enough views </connor>
<connor> - [Joey] Yeah. - On what they do. </connor>
<garnt> It's just not nearly </garnt>
<garnt> the same level as what they were doing in their peak. </garnt>
<joey> - What's your definition of a successful YouTuber? </joey>
<garnt> - What's success to you Connor? (laughs) </garnt>
<joey> - Money, fame? - Pyramid. (laughs) </joey>
<connor> - Pyramid scheme. </connor>
<connor> - I don't know, just... </connor>
<garnt> - Cause there's so many YouTubers now, </garnt>
<garnt> then I'm just like, </garnt>
<garnt> whatever happened to them? </garnt>
<connor> - I mean, it's, you know, </connor>
<connor> it's one of those things where let's, </connor>
<connor> it's very hard to tell someone </connor>
<connor> to do the exact same thing they're doing </connor>
<connor> for half the money. - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You know, it's a mentally, </connor>
<connor> it's a hard thing to do </connor>
<connor> regardless of how good the money still is. </connor>
<connor> It's very difficult to tell someone, </connor>
<connor> "Hey, just accept, </connor>
<connor> you're doing half as good as you were last month." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> Because that's something that takes a toll on you. </connor>
<garnt> - It does. - Because you know </garnt>
<connor> you're capable of getting what you had. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And yet how do you, you know, </connor>
<connor> cause especially if it's like more than just one person. </connor>
<connor> If there's a team of you, </connor>
<connor> it's impossible to get the team </connor>
<connor> everyone on the team to be like, </connor>
<connor> "Yeah, dude, let's just keep doing what we're doing </connor>
<connor> for half the money." </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. (laughs) - You know? </connor>
<connor> Its just the reality of it. </connor>
<joey> - Do the same thing for half the paycheck. </joey>
<connor> - Cause it's stuff like, </connor>
<connor> God, I don't know, </connor>
<connor> like a Yogscast or whatever </connor>
<garnt> when they were making like, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't know, </garnt>
<garnt> fucking a billion dollars </garnt>
<garnt> or something from Minecraft. </garnt>
<garnt> - Or GameGrumps. - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> How do you, </garnt>
<garnt> how do you convince the gang to stay together </garnt>
<connor> when the money is going as well? </connor>
<connor> Is this, this sounds like a prelude for Trash Taste. </connor>
<connor> (co-hosts laugh) </connor>
<connor> What if we start getting less views? </connor>
<connor> We're getting 800K views an episode. </connor>
<garnt> See you guys. </garnt>
<garnt> Trash Taste is done. - We're done. </garnt>
<connor> - We're done. </connor>
<connor> - What's that Twitter page? </connor>
<connor> Where it's just like things that have aged horribly. </connor>
<connor> It's just to just see this clip getting posted </connor>
<connor> in like three years or something, man. </connor>
<garnt> - Well no, </garnt>
<connor> I feel like in terms of that, </connor>
<connor> I feel like it depends on what you are doing. </connor>
<connor> Like if you, if you have an insane schedule, </connor>
<connor> the likelihood is gonna be there </connor>
<connor> where you're gonna be more likely to quit. </connor>
<connor> If the money isn't as good. </connor>
<connor> If the schedule is intense. </connor>
<connor> You know Trash Taste, </connor>
<connor> We just turn up once a week and just fucking talk. </connor>
<connor> I can't see any time soon </connor>
<connor> where this becomes a burden to my life. </connor>
<connor> I'm like, "Oh fuck, I've gotta talk once a week." </connor>
<connor> Jesus Christ. - Oh my God, </connor>
<connor> I've gotta talk to my best mates. </connor>
<connor> What the fuck? - Oh my God! </connor>
<joey> - Is it worth my throat power? - I dunno. </joey>
<connor> - I'm just trying to say that </connor>
<joey> just in case people get fucking boring. </joey>
<joey> So there's always people like, </joey>
<connor> " What? They're mentioning groups declining." </connor>
<connor> - Well again like, okay. </connor>
<connor> So then taking that same, you know, </connor>
<connor> like hypothetical that you were saying. </connor>
<connor> Let's put that in the case with Trash Taste. </connor>
<connor> - Trash Taste, right. - Right. </connor>
<connor> So like, would you say- - We gotta half the views. </connor>
<connor> - Would you say that in like, </connor>
<connor> you know, - I wouldn't give a shit. </connor>
<connor> - However many years time, </connor>
<joey> if we were getting half or a quarter of the views, right? </joey>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I just wanna talk. </connor>
<connor> I don't give a shit. </connor>
<connor> I wasn't expecting a million views anyway. </connor>
<connor> - No, true. </connor>
<connor> I don't care if you know, </connor>
<garnt> I was prepared for like 100 to 50K. </garnt>
<connor> - We were prepared for 100K after a year. </connor>
<garnt> - [Joey] Yeah. - We've said this many times. </garnt>
<garnt> - We were gonna, </garnt>
<garnt> at the end of the day, this is, </garnt>
<garnt> and it always has been a passion project. </garnt>
<connor> And I just want to talk. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. I've got a big mouth. </connor>
<connor> I wanna- </connor>
<connor> (co-hosts laugh) </connor>
<connor> I wanna just talk with my friends. </connor>
<connor> You know? </connor>
<connor> And I wanna have an outlet to do that. </connor>
<garnt> Whether that's narcissistic, </garnt>
<connor> you can judge for yourself. </connor>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<connor> I don't know what it is. </connor>
<connor> I dunno if I need to see a psychiatrist about it. </connor>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<connor> But that was what it was for me. </connor>
<connor> It was never a business venture. </connor>
<joey> It was always. </joey>
<joey> - We never planned for this to be </joey>
<connor> as successful as our main. - Obviously. </connor>
<joey> - If not more successful. </joey>
<joey> - Obviously if we can make good money, </joey>
<joey> we'll make good money and we'll do what we can. </joey>
<connor> But obviously if it stops making money, </connor>
<connor> I'm not going to care. </connor>
<connor> But because I have, </connor>
<connor> I have other things that I'm doing </connor>
<connor> and I never try and put all my eggs in one basket. </connor>
<connor> But you know, </connor>
<connor> in cases where there were channels </connor>
<connor> where people's whole career was riding on it, </connor>
<garnt> it's hard to, </garnt>
<connor> I find it is hard to convince people to stay on board when </connor>
<connor> the money is like one third, one half, you know? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - It's hard. </connor>
<connor> - Well, I think in that case, </connor>
<connor> it does like, </connor>
<garnt> you do have to kind of follow your passion right? </garnt>
<garnt> Because you're not going to be happy, </garnt>
<garnt> grinding out the same, </garnt>
<garnt> the same content that you've been making. </garnt>
<connor> - But that really shows if you are passionate as well. </connor>
<garnt> If it does, </garnt>
<connor> if it does plummet for some reason. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah exactly. - But also again, </connor>
<connor> there has to be a question that has to be, </connor>
<connor> a question has to be answered there. </connor>
<connor> It's like, "okay, if the views did half </connor>
<connor> something has gone wrong." - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Whether you like to admit it or not, </connor>
<connor> something has gone wrong. </connor>
<connor> - And it's not always the algorithm. </connor>
<connor> - Sometimes okay. </connor>
<connor> On a freak accident you know? </connor>
<connor> With the whole, </connor>
<connor> okay I'm going back to Yogscast. </connor>
<connor> it didn't even fucking know. </connor>
<garnt> Yogscast is a show- - What happened to Yogscast? </garnt>
<garnt> - So Yogscast is a channel </garnt>
<garnt> that made Minecraft videos and they didn't really, </garnt>
<connor> you know, you could blame the algorithm. </connor>
<connor> - They were a big, big group. </connor>
<connor> You could blame the algorithm. </connor>
<connor> And yeah, there was a time when the algorithm was changing. </connor>
<connor> But if one thing has been proven, </connor>
<connor> Minecraft has been everlasting on YouTube. </connor>
<connor> - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> And clearly what's needed to be done </connor>
<connor> was to change the content, right? </connor>
<connor> And they didn't change the content. </connor>
<connor> So, you know, time and time again, </connor>
<garnt> YouTube has proven that it is more often than not, </garnt>
<garnt> not YouTube's fault. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> Yes if you're an animator, </garnt>
<garnt> you've been fucked over. </garnt>
<garnt> But also animation channels are still doing well. </garnt>
<garnt> So you have to change what you're doing. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, </garnt>
<garnt> there's animation channels that have done well because </garnt>
<garnt> they've adapted their kind of workflow. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> It's, you know, </garnt>
<connor> everyone wants to demonize YouTube and they, </connor>
<connor> they changed the algorithm and it is what it is, you know, </connor>
<connor> at the end of the day, </connor>
<connor> as YouTubers you're on borrowed time. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> It's always changing. </connor>
<connor> You should have known better. </connor>
<connor> When you were getting into this. </connor>
<connor> It was always changing. </connor>
<connor> You are building a foundation on quicksand. </connor>
<connor> You should have been changing that foundation </connor>
<connor> as you're building this tower. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> Constantly. </connor>
<connor> And so I get angry when I see these YouTubers </connor>
<connor> who complained about their YouTube video being demonetized. </connor>
<connor> On Twitter, </connor>
<connor> they're throw a fuss that it's not being, </connor>
<connor> it's not getting the same views and I wanna reply to them. </connor>
<connor> But we're mutuals and we're supposed to be civil. </connor>
<connor> and I wanna just slap them and be like, </connor>
<connor> "listen, you know, what's going on. </connor>
<connor> Don't try and get your fans to shout at YouTube. </connor>
<connor> They get enough shit you know? - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> And there are YouTubers, </connor>
<connor> I won't name them. </connor>
<connor> But there's a lot of them who still do it. </connor>
<connor> Who constantly complain at YouTube. </connor>
<connor> It pisses me off because I'm like, </connor>
<connor> this is not YouTubes fault. </connor>
<connor> This is your fault. - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> And the fact that you can't see that, </connor>
<connor> or maybe you do see it and you don't care, </connor>
<connor> Is really annoying. - [Garnt] Yeah. </connor>
<connor> Yogscast was the channel that made, </connor>
<connor> I should go into that. </connor>
<connor> It was to talk about Yogscast </connor>
<connor> which made Minecraft videos, </connor>
<connor> and their channel started dying </connor>
<connor> because they didn't really change it up. </connor>
<connor> And it's this over like two or three years. </connor>
<connor> So they had plenty of time to change it up. </connor>
<connor> And more often than not, </connor>
<joey> there is a obvious factor at play that went wrong. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - Whatever that might be, we don't do know. </joey>
<garnt> - Was that the end of the point? </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. (Garnt laughs) </connor>
<connor> - Aren't we gonna state the obvious point? </connor>
<garnt> - I'm just saying with Yogscast you know, </garnt>
<garnt> like they just didn't change the content. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh okay. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Cause the way you ended, </connor>
<connor> I was just like, </connor>
<garnt> and then there was an obvious reason why it declined. </garnt>
<joey> - You ended at. (laughs) </joey>
<joey> Like you ended that sentence in a comma. </joey>
<connor> - It's so obvious, it's so obvious. </connor>
<joey> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </joey>
<connor> - It's so obvious that I don't need to state it. </connor>
<connor> Name a channel, name a channel. </connor>
<connor> I'll tell you the reason, </connor>
<connor> I'm so knowledgeable about YouTube. </connor>
<connor> - Ryan Higa. </connor>
<connor> - Ryan Higa? - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - He just doesn't upload anymore. </connor>
<connor> What do you mean? </connor>
<connor> He just stopped uploading. - Yeah that's true. </connor>
<connor> - Every video that Ryan did outside of the podcast did well. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, yeah, yeah that's true. </connor>
<connor> - When he actually tried it did well. </connor>
<connor> He just wanted to become a Twitch streamer. </connor>
<connor> Congratulations Ryan. </connor>
<connor> You succeeded in doing what you wanted to do. </connor>
<garnt> - No exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> That's what I'm saying. </garnt>
<garnt> I still think he's a successful YouTuber. </garnt>
<garnt> He's not pulling the numbers of his peak, </garnt>
<garnt> but to me that doesn't matter. </garnt>
<garnt> because everyone will reach a point </garnt>
<garnt> where they've reached their peak. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean I even, </garnt>
<garnt> I think I've reached the peak that I can reach </garnt>
<garnt> making anime content right now. </garnt>
<garnt> To me there's just a cap of just purely anime content. </garnt>
<garnt> And I've tried for years to break through that cap, </garnt>
<garnt> but I just don't think the audience is there at the moment. </garnt>
<garnt> - For every 100 thousand YouTube channels, </garnt>
<garnt> there is one that'll get a breakout. </garnt>
<connor> That does well and blows up out of the, </connor>
<connor> those channels that blow up. </connor>
<connor> There's maybe one in 10 </connor>
<connor> that understands what they need to do </connor>
<connor> to change their content and to keep evolving. </connor>
<connor> To have an everlasting presence on the platform. </connor>
<connor> You know, people like Michael Reeves </connor>
<connor> had a few videos that blew up. </connor>
<connor> And he understood what he needed to do. </connor>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<connor> Maybe he did. </connor>
<connor> I don't know if he did, it could have been sheer dumb luck. </connor>
<connor> But he was making moves and he was making the content </connor>
<connor> and upgrading the things </connor>
<connor> in the places that needed to be upgraded. </connor>
<connor> I felt maybe Michael Reeves didn't feel like he'd blow up. </connor>
<connor> But when I watched Michael Reeves </connor>
<connor> where he did the whole fucking, </connor>
<connor> when his whole branding, </connor>
<connor> was the laser pointer in the eye guy, </connor>
<connor> that that was how he started. </connor>
<connor> And he just blew up from there and he kept riding the wave </connor>
<connor> and he kept doing what was right. </connor>
<connor> 'Cause a lot of people </connor>
<connor> and more often than not the channels that do die </connor>
<connor> are ones that had massive explosions in growth. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> That's still what scares me actually. </connor>
<connor> - Because if you have massive growth, </connor>
<connor> something is going, </connor>
<joey> you've kind of hit the nail on the head in so many ways, </joey>
<joey> and you probably don't understand why, </joey>
<joey> because this is just sheer luck to you. </joey>
<joey> - And the first instinct is to go, </joey>
<joey> - Keep doing the same thing, - "I'll do that again." </joey>
<joey> - Yeah because when you first do it </joey>
<joey> and you have a steady growth. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> - I think all of us have had pretty steady growth, </joey>
<connor> I'd say. </connor>
<connor> None of us have had months </connor>
<connor> where we've blown up insane amounts. </connor>
<connor> You afford the cushion to make the mistakes </connor>
<connor> of uploading repetitive content, </connor>
<connor> realizing that's not the way to do it. </connor>
<connor> You get to slowly make all these mistakes. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And it gives you kind of like a very nice cushion of, </connor>
<connor> I can make these mistakes and then I can learn from them. </connor>
<garnt> - It's like the buffer that you get. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah - Because to me, </connor>
<connor> the biggest thing that scares me when I see </connor>
<connor> like maybe an up and coming YouTuber, </connor>
<connor> or maybe like a new YouTuber </connor>
<connor> making content on the platform </connor>
<joey> is when they have one or two videos that blow up, </joey>
<joey> And then it's a pattern I see where you have one or two </joey>
<joey> videos that get millions and millions of views. </joey>
<joey> And then the next video gets like 20 K feels like I've seen </joey>
<garnt> that so many times. </garnt>
<connor> - Mr. Beast, right? </connor>
<connor> Mr. Beast blew up on some weird videos, </connor>
<joey> like counting tens or 100 thousand insane, 10,000 IQ bricks. </joey>
<connor> And then he just kept building on it. He never, </connor>
<connor> he never ever repeated something for too long. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> He repeated it a little bit, which is fine. </connor>
<connor> You can do that. I'm not saying don't repeat ideas, </connor>
<joey> - He deviated. - Yeah you evolve them. </joey>
<connor> - He made like a derivitation </connor>
<joey> of the content that would do well yeah. </joey>
<joey> You know, so then he would, </joey>
<connor> he would do something like watching Logan Paul </connor>
<connor> everyday bro for 10 hours or 24 hours. Right. </connor>
<connor> So he took what was successful about the one video. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - That was Jake Paul actually. </connor>
<connor> Sorry, Jake, Paul. </connor>
<connor> Wow. Fake YouTuber. </connor>
<connor> - Terrible. </connor>
<connor> - He took that. He took the aspect that people liked, </connor>
<connor> which is watching something for an absurd amount of time or </connor>
<connor> doing something and then applying it to something else and </connor>
<connor> it worked. And then he realized, okay, </connor>
<connor> now I'm getting all this success. How do I, then what's, </connor>
<connor> what's kind of the viralocity here. What's, </connor>
<connor> what's enticing people. It's just the insane, </connor>
<connor> absurd nature of what he's doing. </connor>
<connor> So then he decided I got to spend a shit ton of money, </connor>
<connor> which is like the next best step. </connor>
<connor> If you can waste a ton of time, </connor>
<connor> what goes hand-in-hand with wasting time </connor>
<connor> spending too much money, the two sides of the same coin, </connor>
<connor> like it's the same thing. And it's genius. </connor>
<joey> - He was just the master of making content. </joey>
<joey> That was so ridiculous that no one could emulate it. No. </joey>
<joey> - One, no one wanted to. </joey>
<garnt> - No one wanted to emulate. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean, watching Mr. Beast, right? </garnt>
<connor> It's just, it's just like, </connor>
<connor> - It's a master class in YouTube. </connor>
<connor> And I'm just like watching Mr. Beast. </connor>
<connor> Like every time he makes something new or makes new moves </connor>
<connor> or something, it's like, you know, you know, when, </connor>
<connor> like you feel like you feel, you, </connor>
<garnt> you feel like that side character in anime, </garnt>
<garnt> that's just like, okay, this is the genius character. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm just merely the side character in his story. </garnt>
<joey> That's what I feel like watching Mr. Beast. </joey>
<garnt> - You're the side character </garnt>
<joey> that has to commentate every move he's making, right. </joey>
<garnt> It's like, I can't believe he just did that move. </garnt>
<joey> What's that? I'll explain it. </joey>
<joey> - Like when, when he just like fucking </joey>
<joey> opened a burger chain, I was just like </joey>
<joey> - That's genius. - You are fucking mad. </joey>
<joey> But that is like the most genius move </joey>
<joey> I could ever see anyone doing. </joey>
<connor> Cause no one, no one's even close, to his a genius. </connor>
<connor> And like, I don't know, like I, </connor>
<connor> I think part of it is just experience because like </connor>
<connor> Mr. Beast went so many years </connor>
<connor> making so many different types of content </connor>
<connor> and then he blew up like, </connor>
<connor> I think like seven years into his YouTube career. </connor>
<connor> So he's just has a lot of experience under his belt, </connor>
<connor> but there is just a natural genius </connor>
<connor> to some of the stuff that he does </connor>
<connor> that it's just unmatched </connor>
<garnt> by every other content creator right now. Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - And, and, you know, </garnt>
<joey> God forbid, there are so many channels out there right now </joey>
<joey> that are trying to do something of similar taste </joey>
<joey> to what Mr.Beast is doing to varying levels of success. </joey>
<garnt> - I think we'd be lying if we hadn't taken some kind of idea </garnt>
<connor> or concept from Mr.Beast onto our own channel. </connor>
<garnt> - Of course of course. </garnt>
<garnt> - I mean he made spending money a cool thing. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> Right. That's why many of my titles, theres money in it. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause it just works. Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. Yeah, exactly. </connor>
<joey> I think every YouTuber has done at least one video where </joey>
<joey> they've tried to do something similar </joey>
<joey> to varying levels of success. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. I mean, I mean, you, you often you see kind of, </garnt>
<garnt> you see content creators, </garnt>
<garnt> like you see these sub content creators come to the platform </garnt>
<garnt> every so often where they just like this. </garnt>
<garnt> So ahead of the game that they just like completely </garnt>
<garnt> revolutionized the content on a platform like Casey Neistat. </garnt>
<connor> I remember when like every vlogger tried to be Casey Neistat </connor>
<connor> because he was just at when he first started making the </connor>
<connor> vlogs that he did, which was just like taking, taking a day. </connor>
<connor> And instead of just making like this Handycam vlog, </connor>
<connor> but just actually making it kind of like a short film. </connor>
<connor> And that was just like, that was revolutionary for the time. </connor>
<garnt> And like, nobody could touch him for the longest time. </garnt>
<connor> - Because you'd have to be insane </connor>
<connor> to do what he was doing - Yeah, oh my god! </connor>
<connor> - He only got like four hours of sleep </connor>
<connor> and he had like a family </connor>
<connor> and like, this shit was insane. </connor>
<connor> Like the amount of shit he was doing in a day, </connor>
<joey> I felt exhausted watching. </joey>
<joey> And he has like a factory full of cameras. </joey>
<joey> And then he went and then he went home and edited it. </joey>
<joey> And I'm like, I, I would rather shoot myself. </joey>
<connor> Like honestly, his videos looked insane. </connor>
<connor> - Dude just like daily vloggers just in general, </connor>
<joey> are like insane </joey>
<connor> Totally not surprised that he got burned out and quit doing. </connor>
<garnt> - Have you ever seen the film limitless? </garnt>
<connor> Yeah, like I feel like, </connor>
<connor> I feel like if there's any real life example of someone </connor>
<connor> who's discovered that drug, it was Casey Neistat. </connor>
<connor> When he first got the flight, </connor>
<connor> when he first started blowing up Man. Cause my God, </connor>
<connor> like it's, it's like, </connor>
<connor> it's such an example of someone who just like, </connor>
<connor> how are you finding this many hours in the day, man, </connor>
<connor> you are using a hundred percent of your brain. </connor>
<connor> - Hundred percent of his brain yeah. </connor>
<connor> - You've discovered the limitless drug. </connor>
<garnt> - That's insane. </garnt>
<connor> I just I'm in so much respect to the dude, </connor>
<connor> but like just Jesus Christ. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, he really set the bar high. </connor>
<connor> I get exhausted thinking about what he was doing. </connor>
<connor> Like it's insane. </connor>
<garnt> - We don't even do a 10th of what he does. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. My God, like I've had like these past three months, </garnt>
<joey> have probably possibly been </joey>
<joey> the most busiest three months of my life. </joey>
<garnt> And it's still like, it's nothing compared to what, </garnt>
<garnt> whatever the that he went through at his peak years. </garnt>
<connor> - For years as well. - For years as well. </connor>
<garnt> Okay. He's also taking a shit. </garnt>
<connor> Let alone just like thinking about doing what he's doing, </connor>
<connor> you know what I mean? Like I just, </connor>
<connor> I can't don't have energy for that Jesus. </connor>
<garnt> - Like, okay, so like how long, </garnt>
<garnt> how long did it take you doing work on YouTube before you </garnt>
<connor> realized man, it's a, it's fucking tiring doing videos. </connor>
<connor> I like, cause I feel like, </connor>
<connor> I feel like every YouTuber goes through the phase where like </connor>
<connor> YouTube making videos at some point was just easy. </connor>
<connor> It was just like, I'm getting, I'm getting paid something. </connor>
<garnt> That is my hobby. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's when you first make a video. </garnt>
<garnt> And you're like, I don't, </garnt>
<connor> I don't think I liked this. </connor>
<connor> I don't think I liked this video. </connor>
<connor> And I think hate this. </connor>
<connor> - It's when you start to become like really perfectionist </connor>
<connor> about your videos, </connor>
<connor> I feel like when you starting off you again, </connor>
<joey> you have the honeymoon period of like everything you make is </joey>
<connor> like, oh, that's cool. </connor>
<connor> That's fun. Let's do that. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. I enjoy that. </connor>
<connor> Yeah, let's go. </connor>
<connor> But then as you start to make more content and as you start </connor>
<connor> to grow and you start to realize, oh, </connor>
<connor> I got to like up my quality in the content </connor>
<connor> and all my quality of the cameras or whatever. </connor>
<connor> That's when you start to get a little more self-reflective </connor>
<connor> on your own content. Right. </connor>
<connor> And you start to think, oh, </connor>
<connor> that video I made last week that I was loving. </connor>
<connor> Now that look at it could have done a little better on that. </connor>
<connor> Maybe, maybe this next video do a lot better. </connor>
<connor> And I feel that's the point where you start to be like, oh, </connor>
<connor> okay. Now this is like seriousness. </connor>
<connor> This is like a job now that it's like, </connor>
<connor> kind of not only is my rent and like my living on the line </connor>
<connor> for this, for the success of this video. </connor>
<connor> But also like just my artistic integrity of making content </connor>
<connor> now is kind of on the line. </connor>
<connor> - Artistic integrity. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah. I mean, you know, </connor>
<joey> not every YouTube can say that same thing obviously. </joey>
<joey> - I feel like I don't, I feel like I just make stuff </joey>
<connor> I like, I don't know. </connor>
<joey> - Right but you know, but at the same time you'd be lying. </joey>
<joey> If you said that you didn't care about how your video looked </joey>
<connor> or how it was structured. </connor>
<connor> - Well of course not, I love making a good video. </connor>
<joey> - So I feel in a lot of ways, </joey>
<connor> like as much as you maybe don't want to admit that is in a </connor>
<connor> sense, artistic integrity. </connor>
<connor> Like you want to make the best. </connor>
<connor> You want to make the best shit you can make. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. You want to make sure you are proud of </garnt>
<joey> or that you enjoy. </joey>
<connor> That's just been my philosophy. </connor>
<connor> And that's why I've never like paid too much attention to </connor>
<connor> the algorithm and stuff like that. Maybe, </connor>
<connor> maybe seeing what kind of content is doing well </connor>
<connor> and stuff like that. </connor>
<connor> But at the end of the day, I'd like, </connor>
<connor> it sounds like such generic advice or whatever, </connor>
<connor> but it's kind of true in a sense where just good, </connor>
<connor> good content is king at the end of the day, there's some, </connor>
<connor> there's some videos that will not perform as well </connor>
<connor> on the algorithm. </connor>
<connor> But for the most part, if you make good content, </connor>
<garnt> people are going to watch it. </garnt>
<garnt> And then at every so often you get someone like Dhar Mann, </garnt>
<garnt> which just blows your mind because you're just like, okay, </garnt>
<garnt> I don't understand. - But that's the thing right? </garnt>
<garnt> - I just, okay. </garnt>
<garnt> Maybe, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe, </garnt>
<garnt> maybe my entire understanding of this platform </garnt>
<garnt> has just been warped, but. </garnt>
<joey> - But that's the thing right, at the end of the day, </joey>
<joey> I think everyone is asking the question, </joey>
<connor> what is good content? </connor>
<connor> Like what the fuck does that even mean? </connor>
<connor> Right. Because like, to some people that's Dhar Mann, </connor>
<connor> and to other people, it's a Gigguk video. </connor>
<joey> Like we don't know what is good content. </joey>
<connor> - I think Dhar Mann is. I mean, you can't say it's bad. </connor>
<connor> It's very well produced. It's just, yeah. </connor>
<connor> I think it's just so absurd and just the amount of views is </connor>
<connor> so absurd. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> So that's, what's just kind of crazy. </connor>
<connor> I think it's just insane to me, </connor>
<connor> the amount of views this man brings in. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. I mean, I, I can, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> I think that's the biggest thing. Cause he, </garnt>
<garnt> he makes well-produced content and it's, it's just like, </garnt>
<garnt> it's just not correlational to like kind of like the views </garnt>
<connor> that we're seeing on this platform. </connor>
<garnt> - These videos are amazingly produced, </garnt>
<connor> but the story is just fucking bizarre. </connor>
<connor> It's like a child wrote it it's really strange. </connor>
<connor> Cause everything else was amazing. </connor>
<connor> Th these videos are shot </connor>
<connor> better than like almost any other YouTube video. </connor>
<connor> Like it's insane. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. I dunno. </joey>
<joey> I've always found it fascinating, </joey>
<joey> like the kind of whole question of like, </joey>
<joey> what is like a successful video, </joey>
<connor> what is like a good successful video, right? </connor>
<connor> Because like, you know, if you're talking about like, okay, </connor>
<connor> is a good, is good content, one that has quality. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Right. </connor>
<connor> And then like, </connor>
<connor> how do you explain the fucking Chonk Chart video </connor>
<garnt> that has 10 million views, you know? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah that's like, that's got quality. </garnt>
<garnt> - I don't know what you're talking about, Joey. </garnt>
<joey> - Like on, on a, on a traditional sense. It's not. </joey>
<joey> - Oh, it's like, it's like, you know, </joey>
<joey> like report of the week. Right? </joey>
<garnt> Like, and the production quality is terrible. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah it sucks. </garnt>
<connor> - But it's like, it's amazing because it's, </connor>
<connor> it's what made YouTube great. </connor>
<joey> - And I feel that's like a big question that like a lot of </joey>
<connor> people who are starting off YouTube ask, right. </connor>
<connor> It's like, you know, like they go up to the YouTuber, </connor>
<connor> who's been on the platform for a while and being like, okay. </connor>
<connor> So you're telling me that in order to be successful, </connor>
<connor> I need to make good content. </connor>
<connor> Explain that. What is good content? </connor>
<connor> - To me, the content, good content is anything that, </connor>
<connor> you know, you've taken the time </connor>
<connor> to consider every aspect of the content. </connor>
<joey> You've, you consider audio, </joey>
<joey> you consider visuals like, </joey>
<connor> you watch the report of the week video. Yeah. </connor>
<joey> The audio quality is professional, but you're like, </joey>
<connor> you can hear it. It sounds good enough. </connor>
<connor> It's not, it's an unpleasant. </connor>
<connor> You can watch it. It's good enough. </connor>
<connor> You know, he doesn't try and egregiously click beta. </connor>
<connor> He doesn't chase trends. You know, </connor>
<connor> I feel like bad content to me is someone who is just </connor>
<connor> chasing trends for the sake of it. </connor>
<connor> The clickbait is just disgustingly egregious, </connor>
<connor> they're making X, thousands of dollars, </connor>
<connor> never considered upgrade equipment, you know, </connor>
<connor> stuff like that. You know, if you're, </connor>
<connor> if you're a full-time YouTuber </connor>
<connor> and you're using like a USB mic, </connor>
<connor> I'm just like, what? </connor>
<connor> Bro they're like literally a hundred bucks </connor>
<connor> and the audio quality difference is insane. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> Is no excuse in my mind. Other than I don't want to learn. </connor>
<garnt> It's too complicated. It's not that difficult. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. - It's really not difficult. </connor>
<garnt> - I normally notice that the people who do trace </garnt>
<garnt> chase trends have like, have like a set shelf life. </garnt>
<garnt> They will get massive amounts of views </garnt>
<garnt> for like one or two years. At most. </garnt>
<connor> - Or, or you'll go to their channel. </connor>
<garnt> One video will have a million views. </garnt>
<garnt> One we'll have a hundred K. And it's like, it's like, </garnt>
<connor> that's how you can tell, </connor>
<connor> like that's a channel where you're like. </connor>
<connor> Probably not making the most consistent stuff. </connor>
<joey> - Or, the, your content, your, </joey>
<joey> your you're clearly just, you know, </joey>
<connor> appealing to a wider audience </connor>
<connor> that doesn't so much care about you. </connor>
<connor> - You're only as worth </connor>
<connor> as much as your worst performing video. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. Like if your, </connor>
<connor> if a video of that doesn't get in the algorithm, </connor>
<joey> doesn't do well, but people still show up and watch it. </joey>
<joey> That's how you can kind of tell, I guess </joey>
<connor> - That's your core fanbase. </connor>
<connor> - That's like what, you know, </connor>
<connor> the people who really would turn up then, </connor>
<connor> and that's what if you can pull in, you know, </connor>
<connor> X amount of views that is like a healthy amount on your </connor>
<connor> worst performing video that says a lot. </connor>
<connor> I think if you are pulling in a million views, </connor>
<connor> then you pull in 50K, </connor>
<connor> I think something's gone horribly wrong there. </connor>
<connor> And you're clearly you're doing something that's not healthy </connor>
<connor> or sustainable. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - And sure. You can keep trending tracing Chen chasing Chen, </connor>
<connor> but not, sorry. </connor>
<connor> - Chasing Chen, chasing chen? </connor>
<garnt> - Demon Slayer, Demons Slayer - Chasing trends. </garnt>
<garnt> - Then there's also where you see YouTubers </garnt>
<garnt> who start to do questionable things </garnt>
<connor> because they get so desperate for these views, </connor>
<connor> they start doing these horrible video ideas, you know, </connor>
<joey> - Like actual just like clickbait. </joey>
<connor> - you know, some real egregious stuff, you know, </connor>
<connor> it's like where the prank channels, you know, </connor>
<joey> you can look at this clear examples where they were chasing </joey>
<joey> pranks so much that it became to the point where, okay, </joey>
<joey> - It was no longer a prank. (laughs) </joey>
<joey> - Well, yeah, they, they started, </joey>
<joey> they would do stuff like pranks in the hood where these like </joey>
<garnt> white guys would just go in like, </garnt>
<garnt> slap some black guys. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh, I've seen them. </connor>
<connor> I mean, they would just try it. </connor>
<connor> It was, it was just like a, </connor>
<connor> trying to get shot challenge or something like that. </connor>
<connor> - What the fuck is this? And then they would also, </connor>
<connor> it got to the point where </connor>
<connor> every single prank channel was paying actors. </connor>
<connor> And then there was like kissing pregnant women prank. </connor>
<connor> And it's just like, this is just like, what is this? </connor>
<connor> Like, this is so beyond clickbait now </connor>
<connor> where you have to get views, </connor>
<connor> you have to go into such egregious territory, you know, </connor>
<connor> and with the family channels </connor>
<connor> where they would just put their fucking </connor>
<connor> here's my here's my child's vasectomy for 10 million views. </connor>
<connor> You know, it's like, what is this? </connor>
<connor> This is not, this is not something that should be YouTube. </connor>
<connor> - Child's vasectomy. (laughs) </connor>
<connor> - You know? I mean you joke, right? </connor>
<connor> But this is the, almost the extent </connor>
<connor> of what these family channels would do. </connor>
<connor> They would be like, oh yeah, </connor>
<connor> today my children are gonna fight to see who's the strongest </connor>
<connor> 10 million last one to survive, gets Burger King. </connor>
<connor> I joke but some these channels were doing </connor>
<connor> such egregious stuff to their children that you, </connor>
<connor> you may as well have put that up for fucks sake. </connor>
<connor> You know what I mean? Like, </connor>
<connor> I feel like when you chase trends and you're the kind of </connor>
<joey> person who is willing to put morals aside to get the views </joey>
<joey> is when you really see the worst side of YouTube come out. </joey>
<joey> And I'm not saying if you trace chends, </joey>
<connor> you're going to be doing some horrible stuff on YouTube, </connor>
<connor> but it is, it is like a </connor>
<connor> - There's a tasteful way of doing it. </connor>
<connor> - There is a, there is an uncomfortable similarity </connor>
<connor> to the people who start to chase trends who </connor>
<connor> sort of start to get to the questionable area. </connor>
<connor> And that, there's a kind of, </connor>
<connor> there's a definitely a, </connor>
<joey> a spectrum of distastefulness as I like to call it. </joey>
<garnt> And you can tell when someone's on it. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah, no, cause like, for me, like when I think what, </garnt>
<garnt> when I think about what kind of content I want to make or </garnt>
<garnt> what, what, what good content is? </garnt>
<garnt> I just, I just think back to that, like, like, </garnt>
<garnt> I just think back to that, </garnt>
<garnt> like seed in Bakumon or something where it's just like, </garnt>
<garnt> I remember like the editor of shounen jump </garnt>
<garnt> in that series set. Like, </garnt>
<garnt> it doesn't matter what you make as long as it's interesting </garnt>
<garnt> like that to me, </garnt>
<garnt> like that to me is like what sticks out in my mind whenever, </garnt>
<garnt> when, whenever anyone thinks, you know, </garnt>
<garnt> whatever the algorithm is, whatever video you want to make, </garnt>
<garnt> it just has to be interesting for someone, unfortunately. </garnt>
<garnt> And. </garnt>
<connor> - We've seen the kind of like toxic content in traditional </connor>
<garnt> media, right? </garnt>
<garnt> Like tabloids, right? </garnt>
<garnt> It's like you're ruining someone's life to get content. </garnt>
<connor> - You know it's, - Paparazzi. </connor>
<garnt> It's a thing as old as time, </garnt>
<garnt> if someone wants it as someone and someone's consuming it, </garnt>
<garnt> someone's going to make it whether it's good or bad or not </garnt>
<garnt> is another question entirely, you know, </garnt>
<connor> like nobody respects TMZ, </connor>
<connor> but TMZ exists because it gets views </connor>
<connor> the same as on YouTube, you know? </connor>
<connor> And these channels are gonna exist </connor>
<connor> because people are gonna watch them. </connor>
<connor> Naked Yoga exists on YouTube. </connor>
<connor> Should it? I don't know. </connor>
<garnt> But it's people are watching it. </garnt>
<garnt> - What'd you think of drama channels? </garnt>
<garnt> What's what's cause I feel like. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's, that's a can of worms. </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like there's such a fine line with drama channels </garnt>
<garnt> from being like acceptable to just pure cancer. Right. </garnt>
<garnt> It's it's, it's, it's such a, </garnt>
<garnt> - I wonder who you're talking about. </garnt>
<garnt> It's such a, it's such a like fine line to, to tread. </garnt>
<garnt> Right. I know. </garnt>
<joey> - I think when it comes to drama channels, </joey>
<joey> there's the right way to do it </joey>
<connor> and there's the wrong way to do it. </connor>
<connor> - I like Scarce. Scarce is chilled. </connor>
<connor> I was about to say, </connor>
<connor> I think Scarce is a drama channel done right. </connor>
<connor> Because he merely states the facts. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - That's it like that. </connor>
<connor> And there's, I feel there are too many drama channels </connor>
<connor> that think that they're also commentary channels. </connor>
<connor> When I feel those are two very different things. </connor>
<connor> Like you can be a drama channel that like Scarce, </connor>
<connor> who just states the facts like this is what happened. </connor>
<connor> - I don't want to hear their opinion. </connor>
<connor> - And then there are people who are like, here's the drama. </connor>
<connor> Here's why you should be on that person's side. </connor>
<connor> Like that's cancerous, right? </connor>
<connor> Like just, just be like, just say what happened, </connor>
<garnt> just state the fact and let the audience </garnt>
<garnt> make up their own mind. </garnt>
<garnt> I don't think there's anything wrong with that to be honest. </garnt>
<garnt> - I think that's why I liked The Right Opinion as well. </garnt>
<connor> Cause at least like he, he does, </connor>
<connor> he does put his opinion in it </connor>
<connor> or like whenever he's breaking down, </connor>
<connor> whatever drama or whatever, </connor>
<joey> - But that's not the core of his video. </joey>
<connor> - That's one of the core of his video. Right. </connor>
<connor> He's breaking down what's happening. </connor>
<connor> And he separates that from his opinion is it's, </connor>
<connor> it's like a clear divide and that's kind of what I liked </connor>
<connor> because he, you know, </connor>
<connor> he allows you to make up your own minds, but then he also, </connor>
<connor> you know, he, he also puts in his own opinion, </connor>
<garnt> as well as his own perspective. I feel like that's, </garnt>
<garnt> that's kind of the right way to go about it. And, </garnt>
<garnt> and you know, even, even sometimes there's, might, </garnt>
<garnt> there might be drama channels that do that, </garnt>
<garnt> but they're also just toxic personalities as well. Right. </garnt>
<joey> - And again, like, </joey>
<joey> I feel it really does come down to like the personality of </joey>
<connor> the presenter as well. Like if you, </connor>
<connor> if you sell yourself as this kind of like, </connor>
<connor> starting a mall, but like toxic kind of guy </connor>
<connor> who then also gives your opinion about </connor>
<connor> a certain piece of drama that let's be real, </connor>
<connor> you're not fucking involved with. You just saw it. </connor>
<connor> And you're like, oh, check, </connor>
<connor> check out this fight that's happening right now. </connor>
<connor> Let's let's root for one person, right? </connor>
<connor> That's when it becomes toxic. But if you're just like, </connor>
<garnt> here's, what's happening, you've probably heard of it. </garnt>
<garnt> Here are the details make up your own mind. </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - You know, it's like, I'm not involved. </garnt>
<garnt> I'm just the messenger. </garnt>
<garnt> Do it with, do it with it. </garnt>
<garnt> What you will then I think, I think in a lot of ways, </garnt>
<garnt> that's fine. - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - But again, it really just depends on like </garnt>
<joey> how you present it and how you present yourself. </joey>
<garnt> - This is why I can never be a drama channel. </garnt>
<garnt> Cause I would just like overthink it so much </garnt>
<garnt> that I probably wouldn't even make the video. </garnt>
<connor> - There's so much drama. </connor>
<garnt> How do you keep up with it? </garnt>
<garnt> - Exactly. - Fucking hell. </garnt>
<connor> It's gotta be exhausting. - Yeah. </connor>
<joey> - Like I, like half the, like 99% of the time. </joey>
<joey> I just don't give a shit. </joey>
<garnt> - Honestly, one thing that like, we we've, </garnt>
<garnt> we've talked about toxic anime fandoms, </garnt>
<garnt> but I think in general, </garnt>
<garnt> compared to like the other communities and the other, </garnt>
<garnt> other things going on in other place, </garnt>
<garnt> I think Anitube is like kind of like chill and drama free. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean, we've, we've had like our drama, </garnt>
<garnt> but compared to what we've seen elsewhere, </garnt>
<connor> it's been like pretty tame. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah it's pretty chilled man. </garnt>
<connor> It used to not be that chilled, </connor>
<garnt> but I feel like it's really chilled now. </garnt>
<garnt> - I feel like even when it wasn't all that chill, </garnt>
<joey> it was like still way more chill than other places. </joey>
<joey> - It was way more contained. </joey>
<garnt> I feel like it wasn't like the other communities where like </garnt>
<joey> people from other communities would hear about. </joey>
<connor> - But the thing is with communities, right. </connor>
<connor> And then drama is that it's, you know, </connor>
<connor> as much as people want to, </connor>
<connor> unless someone does something really scandalous, </connor>
<connor> like really fucked and that transcends beyond the community. </connor>
<connor> And it's just so fucked </connor>
<connor> that even like normal people were like, </connor>
<connor> whoa, you know, that's, that's a rare circumstance. </connor>
<connor> But other than that, the drama in the community is caused. </connor>
<connor> And in solely responsible, </connor>
<connor> as far as like the biggest creators in the community, </connor>
<connor> if the biggest creators making drama in a space, </connor>
<connor> then there's drama in that space. You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> Like if we're anime fans that we start doing something </connor>
<connor> that's really fucked. </connor>
<garnt> - We better watch ourselves then. (laughs) </garnt>
<connor> - It's true, you know if there is, if we do something </connor>
<connor> it's kind of in the anime community, right. </connor>
<connor> It's kind of, </connor>
<connor> that would be considered not saying that we're so big to </connor>
<connor> drama, but like what, you know, </connor>
<connor> the community is kind of almost dictated at times by like </connor>
<connor> the biggest people in it. </connor>
<connor> And that behavior is reflected downwards. </connor>
<connor> If you get into shit and you say a bunch of shit, yeah. </connor>
<connor> The community is going to kind of mirror that. </connor>

<garnt> back to the episode. </garnt>
<connor> - Circling way back earlier on about passion projects. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Any passionate projects you've been working on recently? </connor>
<connor> Other than the Fate one? </connor>
<garnt> - I guess I don't, I kinda don't want to talk about it, </garnt>
<joey> (group chattering) </joey>
<joey> because like I talked about the Fate video and people were </joey>
<joey> asking about me about it for an entire year, </joey>
<joey> because like here, here's the thing. </joey>
<joey> When you're working on a passion project, it feels great. </joey>
<joey> You're just, you just want to talk about it. </joey>
<joey> You want to get it out and then you forget </joey>
<joey> that you have to make it as well. </joey>
<garnt> (all laugh) </garnt>
<garnt> - Shit! </garnt>
<connor> - That's literally me with the Oyasimi Punpun video. </connor>
<connor> People have been asking, </connor>
<connor> I've been writing that shit for years now. </connor>
<connor> It's like, "when is it? When is it coming out?" </connor>
<joey> And I'm like, "don't fucking rush the passion. Okay." </joey>
<connor> I probably recorded was one of my favorite, </connor>
<connor> one of my favorite videos the other day. </connor>
<connor> And it was just so fun and it was very fun. </connor>
<connor> Everything about it was great. </connor>
<connor> I filmed it, it should be out by the time this is airing. </connor>
<connor> Hopefully if not, I guess it's a surprise. </connor>
<connor> I filmed a video where I worked at a gay bar. </connor>
<garnt> - Oh yeah? - Yeah, yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> - It was very fun. They were just so welcoming. </garnt>
<garnt> Everyone was just so chilled. It was a great time. </garnt>
<garnt> I almost forgot I had camera's on me. </garnt>
<joey> I'm just having a great time reacting </joey>
<joey> and hanging out with the boys. We would just, </joey>
<joey> - The lads. - Yeah, man. </joey>
<joey> It was just, it was just so fun. </joey>
<joey> And especially in Japan, you know, </joey>
<connor> because people are very closed off here and it was very much </connor>
<connor> just having a guy be like, Hey, what's your Dick size? </connor>
<garnt> And I was like, whoa. - I'm glad you asked. </garnt>
<connor> - Well, that's the way to break the ice. </connor>
<garnt> That's something you don't see in Japan especially. </garnt>
<garnt> - I've had this in Japan. I haven't had this level of uh, </garnt>
<garnt> - Was he a Jojo fan? (all laugh) </garnt>
<connor> - Yes. Yes he was. </connor>
<garnt> - Did he see an unsucked dick? (laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - It was after I sing, I sang (speaks foreign language) </garnt>
<connor> When I first sang that. </connor>
<connor> So naturally they asked me, what was my dick size. </connor>
<garnt> - I bet its huge. </garnt>
<garnt> (Joey laughs) </garnt>
<garnt> - I can imagine it has girth to it. </garnt>
<garnt> It was like an otaku gay bar and it had kareoke. </garnt>
<connor> - Oh nice. In Shinjuku? - Yeah in Shinjuku. </connor>
<joey> - So in the like gay district. </joey>
<garnt> So you can just go in sing, sing anime songs with the, </garnt>
<garnt> with the boys. - Hell yeah. </garnt>
<connor> That sounds amazing. It was such a fun bar, so welcoming. </connor>
<connor> It was just great. And yeah, </connor>
<connor> I just had an amazing time and it's great. </connor>
<connor> And it's one of the videos where I didn't really think much </connor>
<joey> about it before I filmed it, but I was like, </joey>
<joey> this is pretty one of the most fun videos I've ever felt. </joey>
<joey> - That's the best feeling. </joey>
<connor> - Just had drinks with the boys. Yeah, literally. </connor>
<garnt> Yeah. - Yeah. </garnt>
<garnt> It's really weird actually meeting anime fans here in Japan </garnt>
<garnt> because you talk to some of them and it's almost like it's </garnt>
<connor> even less popular than it is outside of Japan. </connor>
<connor> - Well its just so normalized here. </connor>
<connor> Cause it's, it's really weird. </connor>
<connor> Cause sometimes you meet an anime fan </connor>
<connor> and you say you watch anime as well. They get so excited. </connor>
<joey> And then they're just like, </joey>
<joey> - I though I was the only one! </joey>
<joey> - "Oh my god, what's your favorite anime? </joey>
<connor> What'd you like watching?" And, and it's, it's so weird. </connor>
<connor> Cause it's almost being transported back like 10 years ago, </connor>
<connor> except it's, its here in Japan. </connor>
<connor> - I think it's because you know, in Japan, you know, </connor>
<connor> they don't have a massive social climate, you know, </connor>
<joey> it isn't, you know, </joey>
<joey> people aren't exactly like social to one another </joey>
<joey> - Yeah, yeah, yeah, especially otakus'. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah and I think having a solid icebreaker </joey>
<joey> like you like anime, you know, it makes any, </joey>
<joey> anyone comfortable who, who, if you, </joey>
<garnt> if it doesn't matter who you are, if you both like anime, </garnt>
<garnt> you can talk about something. - Yeah yeah exactly. </garnt>
<garnt> I mean like, I feel like in Japan where again, </garnt>
<connor> people aren't very socially outgoing. </connor>
<connor> It's it's such a good icebreaker in a very comfortable one. </connor>
<connor> And I find that, especially when you're a foreigner as well, </connor>
<connor> people feel a lot more comfortable talking to you because </connor>
<connor> they feel like, oh, you like the same things as me, </connor>
<joey> even though you have a different place. </joey>
<connor> And it definitely makes them feel more comfortable. </connor>
<joey> - I feel it's especially as well, </joey>
<joey> because unlike in the West where like the whole like </joey>
<garnt> anime community and like otaku thing is more of like </garnt>
<garnt> community-based thing. Even in real life. </garnt>
<garnt> Here in Japan, it's very much like </garnt>
<garnt> a lone Wolf type of thing. </garnt>
<connor> Like I feel like, </connor>
<connor> - Yeah people don't talk about it. </connor>
<connor> - Like the true, like, like hardcore otakus here. </connor>
<connor> I mean, for one don't really go out and socialize. </connor>
<connor> - You won't meet them. - You actually, </connor>
<connor> you won't, they won't be outside. </connor>
<connor> Like being, like walking around, </connor>
<connor> being like, I like this thing, do you like it too? </connor>
<connor> Like, they're not going to be like that. </connor>
<connor> They're going to stick it to like two Chan. Right. </connor>
<connor> And talk about that passion there. Right. </connor>
<connor> Obviously, but you know, and I feel that's why like, </connor>
<connor> especially in Japan, that's so much more rare to come across </connor>
<connor> because for one it's like, oh, </connor>
<connor> I didn't know about this whole other side of the community </connor>
<connor> because a lot of these otakus in Japan. </connor>
<connor> Don't really interact with other people in that even within </connor>
<garnt> the same community, let alone, </garnt>
<joey> you know, across the fucking ocean. </joey>
<garnt> - You're here in Japan and you, you, </garnt>
<garnt> you talk to a Japanese person and </garnt>
<garnt> even if they're not an anime fan, </garnt>
<connor> they're like aware of like, </connor>
<connor> obviously of a lot of anime. Cause we're here in Japan. </connor>
<connor> But like you meet an actual person to watch as well, </connor>
<connor> who watches anime. And it's like, </connor>
<connor> I'm transported back to like the early periods </connor>
<connor> of when I got into anime. </connor>
<connor> Cause I've never seen someone's face just, </connor>
<connor> I've never seen a Japanese person's face, light up so much. </connor>
<connor> When you say you watch Jojo, </connor>
<connor> or when you say you watch some other, </connor>
<connor> like some other anime that's maybe not Ava or One Piece, </connor>
<connor> you know? Cause those are like those, </connor>
<connor> like the two mainstream anime here </connor>
<connor> that even like non anime fans watch. And I, I guess like, </connor>
<connor> that's just not what I expected when I moved to Japan </connor>
<connor> because I thought, I thought at least like, I didn't know, </connor>
<connor> because I only heard about, you know, </connor>
<connor> the otaku culture from basically from third-hand accounts. </connor>
<garnt> Right. I'd never actually had experienced it myself. </garnt>
<garnt> So I didn't know that anime fans just are still, </garnt>
<garnt> almost like underground here in, in some, in some senses. </garnt>
<garnt> Right. And that, that just kind of like blew my mind. </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah I mean, I feel maybe within like the past, </joey>
<connor> like say 10, 20 years, </connor>
<connor> like much like the West. Right. </connor>
<connor> I feel it's become a little bit more open and accepting and </connor>
<connor> like, you know, you know, like even in the West, </connor>
<connor> right kids 10, 20 years ago </connor>
<connor> would get bullied for watching anime. </connor>
<connor> Now you get bullied for not watching anime. </connor>
<connor> I feel in Japan, it's kind of become the same thing now, </connor>
<connor> except still at the end of the day, like the true like, </connor>
<connor> hardcore or otakus are still very much underground </connor>
<connor> because I think, I think they're scared to come out. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - But I feel like, you know, </connor>
<connor> you said that they're underground, but you know, </connor>
<connor> like every time you watched a documentary, </connor>
<connor> anything about Japan and otakus, </connor>
<connor> you always saw the hardcore. - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - They'd be like, this is, this is Tanaka. </connor>
<connor> He spent $10,000 this year on love life. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - And it's like, </connor>
<joey> all right, great. </joey>
<connor> - Yes. But I think as well as well, </connor>
<connor> because like just the term or otaku in Japan is just so much </connor>
<connor> more than someone who likes anime. </connor>
<connor> Like you have like train otakus </connor>
<connor> you have military otakus, </connor>
<connor> like just the types of fans and like hardcore fans that you </connor>
<joey> wouldn't really see outside of Japan. </joey>
<connor> - I saw a hardcore America otaku, </connor>
<joey> - Oh did you actually? </joey>
<connor> - At my train station and </connor>
<connor> this guy was wearing a full, what does it bald eagles? </connor>
<joey> What's it called? What's the American eagle? </joey>
<connor> - Bald eagle. - Bald eagle right? </connor>
<connor> - Bald eagle shirt, a cowboy hat, </connor>
<connor> like a 10 gallon one. He had the pins of America on it. </connor>
<connor> He was wearing the bluest denim jeans I've ever seen. </connor>
<connor> And he was wearing cowboy boots </connor>
<connor> - Nice! </connor>
<connor> - And he was just Japanese and like was wearing glasses. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, this is just so bizarre. </connor>
<connor> It was just at my train station. </connor>
<connor> - That's some drip right? </connor>
<connor> - And he was doing the, like the fucking hands in belt </connor>
<connor> waiting for the train to come. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, what the fuck man? </connor>
<connor> - That's so cool. </connor>
<garnt> - I wanted to be like Ko Nee Chi Wa to him, I was just like, </garnt>
<connor> this is so bizarre. I was like, </connor>
<connor> I want to know the background. I was like, </connor>
<connor> I want that guy to come on Trash Taste. </connor>
<joey> Like I wanna know this dudes story. </joey>
<connor> - I don't know. It's just like, cause like, especially like, </connor>
<connor> you know, every now and then </connor>
<connor> when you go to like a train station in Japan, </connor>
<connor> especially like, like the shinkansen, </connor>
<connor> the bullet trains, you sometimes see, you know, </connor>
<connor> some train or otakus </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah and they're always taking pictures. </connor>
<connor> - Oh yeah. </connor>
<joey> - They're always taking pictures </joey>
<joey> with these like massive like bird watching lenses. </joey>
<connor> - People do that in the UK though, as well as big, </connor>
<joey> big train spotting or whatever, </joey>
<connor> and the planes and you'll see them at the airport. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah. - But like, </joey>
<joey> I always find like that side of the otaku fan base to be </joey>
<joey> just so much more interesting. </joey>
<joey> I feel that maybe it's because I had known nothing about it, </joey>
<joey> but also at the same time, it's like, </joey>
<joey> it feels so much more like mysterious because you almost </joey>
<joey> never see those kinds of people interacting </joey>
<joey> even within the same community. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah but you also, </connor>
<connor> you also see a lot more shows made about our otakus, </connor>
<connor> the traditional otakus, I guess, for the anime. </connor>
<joey> Cause it's just like, oh, look at this guy. </joey>
<joey> He spends 20 grand a month on some P and G. Yeah. </joey>
<joey> It's a lot easier to get it. - It's a lot weirder. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. That's the thing, right? </joey>
<joey> Is that they want to, </joey>
<joey> these film cruisers want something weird. </joey>
<connor> it's really hard to just make fun of a guy </connor>
<connor> who just likes trains. You know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> - That's true, that's true. </connor>
<connor> It's like, you know, you say what you will, </connor>
<connor> but a lot of the time, </connor>
<connor> these documentaries that would just would go into a dude's </connor>
<connor> house and be like, wow, look at him, look at the state. </connor>
<garnt> And he's got all these anime figures </garnt>
<connor> they're trying to make fun of it. Really. </connor>
<garnt> - I, I, cause I feel like there's such a, </garnt>
<garnt> such a big divide between maybe like say anime. </garnt>
<garnt> And then the otaku Anime, you know what I mean? </garnt>
<garnt> Basically like if, if you see if, </garnt>
<garnt> if you see your series and like Akihabara or something, </garnt>
<garnt> then it's probably going to be looked down upon by a lot of </garnt>
<garnt> people in Japan. Because I remember we, </garnt>
<connor> we hung out with our friends, </connor>
<connor> a girlfriend and she was like a mad, </connor>
<connor> like a mad otaku. </connor>
<connor> I remember talking to her and she was like, yeah, </connor>
<connor> I got bullied in school for liking anime. </connor>
<connor> I'm just like, what? </connor>
<garnt> You're Japanese? What, how, how is this a thing? </garnt>
<garnt> - Yeah. I think it's, </garnt>
<garnt> it's so common that it's almost cool to not like it and do </garnt>
<connor> something else. Right? </connor>
<connor> Yeah. But I dunno like the whole, okay. </connor>
<connor> When, when someone, all right, this is, </connor>
<connor> this is a controversial take. </connor>
<connor> When someone is like severely into something like a show, </connor>
<connor> you know, I was about to describe myself there. </connor>
<connor> Actually. </connor>
<connor> I was like, cause you know, you see these, </connor>
<garnt> you see these things where like they make their whole life </garnt>
<garnt> about something, right. </garnt>
<garnt> This is me with Jojo innit? - Yeah. It really is. </garnt>
<connor> - I saw something, you know, </connor>
<connor> when I remember that I'm watching the show one time and this </connor>
<connor> woman had like, everything in our life was Barbie. </connor>
<joey> - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. The one living in LA right? </joey>
<joey> The Japanese woman </joey>
<connor> - That's right. Yeah. - Yeah, yeah, I've seen that. </connor>
<connor> - Everything she owned was Barbie. And I was like, </connor>
<connor> is this like something that like can happen to anyone </connor>
<connor> or is it something that like... </connor>
<garnt> - He said, he, he ponders, while, </garnt>
<connor> his Jojo posters are in the background </connor>
<connor> with the Jojo statues. </connor>
<joey> - Listen I love- - And the $10000 Jojo merch. </joey>
<connor> - Everything he says is Jojo words. </connor>
<garnt> - And the $10000 Jojo suit.- </garnt>
<garnt> - Listen, I love Jojo </garnt>
<garnt> But I don't feel like </garnt>
<connor> because when I see them talk about their show, I don't, </connor>
<connor> I don't feel like they talk about it </connor>
<connor> the way I feel about Jojo. You know what I mean? </connor>
<joey> - That's what, every one of those like </joey>
<garnt> obsessive collectors think as well. </garnt>
<joey> - Talk to Connor in 10 years. </joey>
<garnt> - Here'a my Jojo toilet. </garnt>
<connor> - This can be just taken out of context </connor>
<connor> and just clipped with me talking about Jojo, I realize that. </connor>
<connor> But like when I see them, there's almost like this, like, </connor>
<connor> like this obsession that feels unhealthy, </connor>
<connor> or you could probably say that you could, </connor>
<connor> probably accused me of being the same. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - But you know, we're not, we're not, I just, </connor>
<connor> I just liked the style </connor>
<joey> and I like decorated my office in a certain way. </joey>
<joey> Outside of that none of my rooms are Jojo, you know? </joey>
<joey> Or there's nothing else. </joey>
<joey> - Are you talking about like, when someone's entire house, </joey>
<joey> is like. </joey>
<connor> - Their entire existence becomes a collection of this thing. </connor>
<connor> And I just wonder I'm like, </connor>
<connor> is that something that just happens to anyone </connor>
<connor> - I think so. - Or is it that, </connor>
<connor> or is it something that maybe something's happened to you </connor>
<connor> where you, you know, </connor>
<connor> you've had an experience or maybe you've been raised in a </connor>
<connor> certain way and that, </connor>
<connor> that makes you more receptive </connor>
<connor> to being obsessed with something? </connor>
<connor> What do you think? </connor>
<connor> - I'm sure both sides can happen, </connor>
<joey> but I think, </joey>
<joey> - Psychiatrists, Psychologists in the chat, </joey>
<connor> can you let me know? </connor>
<joey> - I think at the end of the day, it's just about like, </joey>
<connor> how much do you like this certain thing, right? </connor>
<joey> How much are you willing to sacrifice? </joey>
<joey> - I don't know? </joey>
<joey> A part of me thinks there has to be something where you have </joey>
<connor> to be more susceptible to addictive tendencies. </connor>
<garnt> - I also think there's just some people where for whatever </garnt>
<garnt> reason in their life, </garnt>
<connor> there's this one thing means so much to them personally. </connor>
<connor> Maybe it came along at the right time. </connor>
<connor> Maybe it helped them through something, </connor>
<connor> but like they are so personally attached to this thing. </connor>
<connor> - I'm not trying to bash it by the way. I just want to like, </connor>
<connor> actually discuss it. </connor>
<connor> - I think, I think that's the real reason. </connor>
<connor> Cause I mean, </connor>
<connor> I feel like a lot of idol fans fall into that category </connor>
<connor> where, where, you know, they, </connor>
<connor> they want to support these idols because they gave them </connor>
<connor> something, you know? - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> And I, I, I feel like that's more likely, I mean, </connor>
<garnt> I'm sure there are a lot of people who maybe have addictive </garnt>
<garnt> tendencies as well. </garnt>
<garnt> - Right? Yeah. </garnt>
<connor> I guess because the whole thing that sucks about talking </connor>
<connor> with idol staff specifically is that, you know, </connor>
<joey> here in Japan, I mean, </joey>
<joey> there was just some stuff that's fucked. </joey>
<joey> Like, you know, there was this one, </joey>
<joey> - I mean the idol industry in general. </joey>
<joey> - It's okay. Well, yeah, </joey>
<joey> there's so much predatory shit that goes on in that. </joey>
<joey> I can't remember if I've talked about this on Trash Taste, </joey>
<joey> but was just one video on YouTube done by some that I wish </joey>
<joey> news agency was there. Some not super mainstream one, </joey>
<joey> they did like a documentary with this British guy and he </joey>
<joey> just goes to idol stuff, but not normal idol stuff. </joey>
<joey> 13 year old idols in Japan and man, </joey>
<joey> this is an uncomfortable watch. </joey>
<connor> Cause it is like these dudes go to these concerts with this </connor>
<connor> 13 year old girl. Yeah. </connor>
<connor> And she's dancing and stuff. And the guy goes around, </connor>
<connor> just ask these guys like, "Hey, why do you like it?" </connor>
<connor> And that the answers they give are just really like </connor>
<connor> uncomfortable. If they don't say it, </connor>
<connor> they don't say what you, you know what I'm thinking, </connor>
<connor> but they don't really give a good argument as to not. </connor>
<joey> - There's actually, there's a really good documentary I saw, </joey>
<garnt> I think it's on Netflix called Tokyo Idols. </garnt>
<garnt> - I've seen that one. - I watched that one. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. But that one wasn't that bad. </connor>
<connor> Cause I really liked that one because I felt like it wasn't </connor>
<connor> an insulting look into it. </connor>
<joey> - Actual like in-depth look, but at the same time. </joey>
<connor> - It was tryna give a, I would say an unbiased look. </connor>
<garnt> - Yeah. I think that was just interesting. </garnt>
<connor> I watched it. I'd like you watch it and you don't, </connor>
<connor> you don't really want to, </connor>
<joey> you don't judge any of the people there. It's just like, </joey>
<joey> to me, it was just fascinating. </joey>
<connor> How, how someone ends up in this situation where he, </connor>
<garnt> you know, they spend thousands and thousands of. </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah, if you wanna give, if you're a 40 year old man, </connor>
<connor> and you want to give thousands of dollars to a 20 year old </connor>
<connor> woman, that's fine by me. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. I have no qualms about that. </connor>
<connor> You know, you can do that. </connor>
<connor> That, that's your, that's your money. </connor>
<connor> You do what you want with it. Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> But like the one where it was like 13, I was like, come on, </garnt>
<garnt> come on. I mean, I haven't seen that video. </garnt>
<joey> I've sent you a link later. It's just like, oh my God dude. </joey>
<joey> And it's just like, </joey>
<joey> it's so obvious what's going on </joey>
<joey> - Yeah it's not a good look. </joey>
<joey> This is one of those things where it's like some idol guy </joey>
<joey> was like, man, </joey>
<connor> these guys are making so much one of these idols </connor>
<connor> child idols. And it's like, no, no. </connor>
<connor> - No, no. </connor>
<connor> Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. I mean like, even if you don't mean it in that way, </connor>
<connor> that everyone's thinking like, it's, it doesn't help. </connor>
<joey> It really is not a good look. I feel, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> - Like, especially living in Japan, </garnt>
<garnt> I feel like Japan as a country, </garnt>
<garnt> more than like any other country that I've seen or been to, </garnt>
<garnt> like, I understand the word otaku here, </garnt>
<garnt> because there are so many like really obscure things that </garnt>
<garnt> people just get obsessed with. And like it's, it's, it's, </garnt>
<garnt> there's no like definite pattern in it. </garnt>
<garnt> But like we talked about anime otakus, </garnt>
<garnt> but that's like the most, </garnt>
<garnt> I'd say the most broad otaku there is in Japan. </garnt>
<joey> Cause you meet, you meet people who are obsessed with </joey>
<garnt> like really strange things. </garnt>
<joey> - That's almost the most normal otaku. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah. - Yeah, it is right. </garnt>
<joey> - I think so. Cause like, </joey>
<connor> when you look at my strange addiction, </connor>
<connor> you look at these lines, Sandy eating our otakus, </connor>
<connor> the animals. </connor>
<connor> That's why it comes to, I try, it comes to my mind. </connor>
<connor> Cause I feel like somebody who eats the stuffing in their </connor>
<connor> mattress, which is a real thing, by the way I, </connor>
<connor> I assumed I assumed TLC is a hundred percent rock solid with </connor>
<connor> their journalism and this is an accurate, </connor>
<connor> I'm sure some of the stuff on TLC staged, </connor>
<connor> - Some. </connor>
<connor> - Probably most of it. But you know, </connor>
<joey> people that do the weird thing where they like </joey>
<joey> eat only fries. - Yeah. </joey>
<joey> I feel like that's, </joey>
<connor> that's gotta be some sort of similarity to somebody who was </connor>
<connor> obsessed with a certain thing </connor>
<connor> that dominates their whole life. </connor>
<joey> - There's a big difference between an obsession </joey>
<connor> and an addiction. - Yeah, yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. I feel, I feel like, you know, </connor>
<connor> when you are something is your identity. </connor>
<connor> It is an addiction. In some senses, </connor>
<connor> I feel like obsession, addiction, the lines blurred. </connor>
<connor> - Do you have an addiction to Jojo? </connor>
<connor> - This is some intervention. (co-hosts laugh) </connor>
<joey> - Is it a, let's make it clear. </joey>
<joey> Is it an addiction or an obsession? </joey>
<connor> - I, I am obsessed with the style of Jojo. </connor>
<connor> (co-hosts laugh) </connor>
<connor> I'm not addicted to Jo, I don't. </connor>
<joey> - That sounds like denial. </joey>
<connor> - Day by day. I don't think about Jojo. </connor>
<connor> I don't do anything to do with Jojo. </connor>
<joey> - Really, your actions says otherwise. </joey>
<connor> - I can, I can not watch Jojo. I don't have to- </connor>
<connor> - I can quit anytime I like. (Joey laughs) </connor>
<connor> Listen. I don't suck every day. </connor>
<connor> (co-hosts laugh) </connor>
<connor> - You're not looking for the next unsucked cock. </connor>
<connor> - Where is it? (co-hosts laugh) </connor>
<connor> - I can , I don't think about Jojo most days. Right? </connor>
<connor> I know this sounds like a meme! </connor>
<connor> Right? (Garnt guffaws) </connor>
<connor> - This sounds like a meme. </connor>
<connor> I don't think about it most days. </connor>
<connor> I just, I love the style. </connor>
<connor> I love it in my room and the suits of banging straight up </connor>
<connor> fire, you can't deny. </connor>
<connor> But even if you don't like Jojo, those suits of fire, </connor>
<connor> you know what I mean? </connor>
<connor> - Right - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - If the suit looked like shit, </connor>
<connor> I wouldn't buy it, but it looks fire. </connor>
<garnt> - No it does. I'm not, I'm not denying that. </garnt>
<garnt> - I'm not denying that. </garnt>
<garnt> - Now that being said, </garnt>
<connor> if I suddenly became just everything about my life was Jojo. </connor>
<connor> I only ever wore Jojo things. </connor>
<connor> I wouldn't stop talking about Jojo. </connor>
<connor> And garnt I know what you're going to say. </connor>
<connor> There was a phase in my life where I, </connor>
<connor> I did only talk about Jojo. That was a short period. </connor>
<connor> When I got into it, I'm not proud of it. </connor>
<connor> I've changed for the better intervention </connor>
<connor> Garnt told me to stop. I did. </connor>
<garnt> - I'm a changed man. </garnt>
<garnt> - If only every Jojo fan could be. </garnt>
<connor> - But also at the same time, I think I'm like, okay, </connor>
<connor> I see these people who have these very severe addictions or </connor>
<connor> something. And I think, okay, </connor>
<connor> maybe something has gone wrong. Maybe it hasn't. </connor>
<connor> But at the end of the day, I don't really care. </connor>
<garnt> You, you seem happy. </garnt>
<garnt> You're not hurting anyone. Do what you want. </garnt>
<garnt> That's how I ultimately, that's what it comes down to. </garnt>
<garnt> But I am just fascinated with how one becomes addicted to </garnt>
<garnt> something like that. Severely. </garnt>
<connor> You know what I mean? I'm not trying to bash on it. </connor>
<connor> I want to make that clear. I'm not trying to say, </connor>
<connor> oh, it's fucked up or anything. </connor>
<connor> I just want to know the process </connor>
<connor> - Yeah, because its facinating. </connor>
<connor> - I feel like because it's not a super normal thing </connor>
<connor> to do because it's not something that happens every day </connor>
<connor> to everyone. </connor>
<connor> What happens to make someone super addicted to something? </connor>
<connor> I just want to know. </connor>
<garnt> - My strange addiction. </garnt>
<connor> - Science explain! </connor>
<connor> Yeah, its always about the strange addiction. </connor>
<connor> not how it became my strange addiction. </connor>
<connor> That's what I wanna know. </connor>
<garnt> - I just think like, especially in Japan, </garnt>
<connor> it's part of the reason </connor>
<garnt> why Japan is such a goldmine for content, right? </garnt>
<garnt> It's just because kind of, </garnt>
<garnt> kind of like so many people </garnt>
<garnt> are so many are into so many niche things. </garnt>
<garnt> - Because when you, </garnt>
<connor> when you make people have to become so goddamn normal and so </connor>
<connor> assimilated in society, - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - Anyone is dying to do anything different. Yeah. </connor>
<garnt> That's why we get so many, these niche and crazy. </garnt>
<garnt> - Oh, there's so many like niche bars and places, which, </garnt>
<garnt> you know, some, some you've been through, </garnt>
<garnt> some are still out there probably like we were </garnt>
<connor> - Never to be found. - Never to be found. </connor>
<connor> - Cause their entire childhood, </connor>
<connor> their creativity is snuffed out. </connor>
<connor> We don't get to be creative. </connor>
<connor> So they become an adult and they can make money and they can </connor>
<joey> live that life. You know? Finally. </joey>
<joey> - It's that epiphany moment I'm like. </joey>
<garnt> - Yeah they can take control. </garnt>
<joey> - I can be different. </joey>
<joey> - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. </joey>
<garnt> I think that's part of like the part of the interest </garnt>
<joey> thing about living in Japan is you walk down the street </joey>
<joey> somewhere and you just, </joey>
<joey> you find this random place and you're like, what? </joey>
<joey> Who made this? What like? </joey>
<joey> - Only in Japan. </joey>
<connor> - a lot of things are only in Japan. </connor>
<garnt> - Living here, </garnt>
<connor> you just become to have such an appreciation for people here </connor>
<garnt> really do. Just, </garnt>
<connor> don't give a shit </connor>
<connor> and love what they want here because my God, </connor>
<connor> life is hard here. If you don't conform, </connor>
<joey> if you don't do what everyone else is doing, </joey>
<joey> you're the one sticking out. </joey>
<joey> And so when I saw that, that guy rocking all, </joey>
<connor> he was American attire. I thought, man, the balls on this, </connor>
<connor> man, thank God. </connor>
<connor> Thank God. </connor>
<connor> He had a good pair of denim jeans to contain those, </connor>
<connor> those giant balls, you know, </connor>
<connor> keep rocked up to a Japanese train station wearing that. </connor>
<connor> But that man did not give a single fuck what people thought. </connor>
<connor> And it makes you kind of happy. </connor>
<connor> Cause you were like this man doesn't give a fuck. </connor>
<garnt> What anyone else thinks? </garnt>
<connor> - My, my mind Japan. </connor>
<connor> It's funny. Cause every like, </connor>
<garnt> since moving to Japan and living in Japan, </garnt>
<garnt> my standard for what's become cool and bad-ass has just </garnt>
<connor> become so much so warped compared to like when I was living </connor>
<connor> what I was living elsewhere, because I remember this, </connor>
<connor> I remember this one time, it was like, </connor>
<connor> I was like a busy street in like Shinjuku. Right. </connor>
<connor> And we were, </connor>
<connor> we were all just like standing there waiting for the lights </connor>
<connor> to change. </connor>
<connor> Then one guy I I'm walking right behind this one guy and, </connor>
<garnt> and he's walking towards his massive crowds and like the </garnt>
<garnt> lights are still red. Doesn't even flinch. </garnt>
<garnt> Doesn't even stop just walks and J and J walks. </garnt>
<garnt> And I'm just like what a bad-ass. </garnt>
<garnt> (all laugh) </garnt>
<connor> - Yeah. The emotion, the emotion that I, </connor>
<connor> and this is gonna be a hundred percent accurate. </connor>
<connor> But you know, at the end of Shawshank redemption, </connor>
<connor> when a Dufresne finally breaks free. That's how it feels. </connor>
<connor> Never a Japanese man. Doesn't conform the son of a bitch, </connor>
<connor> This son of a bitch crawled through </connor>
<connor> the mile long pile of shit to do it. </connor>
<connor> Goddamn! </connor>
<garnt> - I'm like he saw the red light that says not walks. </garnt>
<garnt> And he, it didn't, he didn't even phase him. </garnt>
<connor> He said, this. </connor>
<connor> He said, "fuck the system." </connor>
<garnt> I'm just like, fuck me, man. </garnt>
<garnt> That's a bad-ass. And I'm just like, my, </garnt>
<garnt> my for bad-ass is so warped living here because you see that </garnt>
<garnt> I think, and then I'm just like, oh, it's just another guy. </garnt>
<garnt> - That's the key to living in Japan is to live in Japan and </garnt>
<connor> get all the good things and not anyone off. Yeah. </connor>
<joey> We're not saying. </joey>
<joey> - To break the rules of Japan, do that. </joey>
<connor> - Do whatever the you want. </connor>
<connor> Like as long as you're not hurting anyone and you're not </connor>
<connor> breaking any rules, do what you want. </connor>
<connor> Yeah. Japan is such a depressing place. </connor>
<connor> If you follow every single money rule, </connor>
<joey> it doesn't need to be following. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah. But that's the thing. </connor>
<connor> Right. And, and I feel, </connor>
<joey> that's why Japan is one of those few countries that does </joey>
<connor> birth, some of the, </connor>
<joey> the craziest looking and the craziest acting and just like </joey>
<joey> the most like unique type of people, </joey>
<joey> because you need to be like that in order to feel like </joey>
<joey> you're living sometimes. </joey>
<garnt> - Because it seems like it's either one way or the other, </garnt>
<joey> it's such a, it's such an extreme. </joey>
<connor> Right. Which is why like, </connor>
<connor> whenever I like Japan is famous for having like very low </connor>
<connor> crime rates. Right. </connor>
<connor> But for some reason, </connor>
<connor> whenever you hear about a crime being committed here, </connor>
<connor> it's the most, </connor>
<connor> - it's a fucking crime! </connor>
<connor> - It's the most fucked up, demented I've ever heard. </connor>
<garnt> Like what the fuck? </garnt>
<joey> - Yeah. </joey>
<connor> It's like the other day it happened right </connor>
<connor> on the Odakyu line. </connor>
<connor> Those are the guy who like went on </connor>
<connor> and just like stabbed 10 people. </connor>
<joey> Cause he was like, I just wanted to I'm like. </joey>
<connor> - He's like the women are happy. Right. </connor>
<joey> - I want it to stop happy women. I'm like what? </joey>
<garnt> - Like just, just rob a, </garnt>
<connor> like hold up a corner shop or something, man. </connor>
<connor> Like someone like holding up like a corner shop. </connor>
<joey> - Steal grandma's purse, you know like something simple. </joey>
<joey> - I just said, </joey>
<connor> there's just so many people who were like idolize Japan in </connor>
<joey> that way. And I think, you know, </joey>
<joey> you have to be realistic about it. </joey>
<connor> Like I remember I socialized with Chris and there was this, </connor>
<connor> he was on Facebook reading an article or something. </connor>
<connor> It was a post someone made on Facebook. It's like, </connor>
<connor> did you know, </connor>
<connor> Japan has the least amount of exams in the world. </connor>
<connor> And I was like, yeah, but only for a specific age group. </connor>
<connor> And then they fuck them to death with exams. </connor>
<connor> They had already ruined their life. </connor>
<connor> They don't get to do anything other than examine study. </connor>
<connor> Like it's like, oh great, great. </connor>
<connor> They get to have one year where they get to run around the </connor>
<connor> fields and have fun. And then we fuck them today. </connor>
<connor> It's you know, </connor>
<connor> the amount of pressure on people to succeed in exams here. </connor>
<connor> I don't know anyone who went to a cram school in the UK. </connor>
<connor> Are you kidding me? I wouldn't even have cramps. </connor>
<connor> I'm sure there is on I don't know where it is. </connor>
<connor> I don't know anyone else who went into one. </connor>
<connor> At most people had like a private tutor </connor>
<joey> once a week or something like that. </joey>
<connor> - And even then it was like, </connor>
<connor> "wow, you have a private tutor". </connor>
<connor> - Yeah like education not good enough for you? </connor>
<connor> Like five days of school. Not enough for you. </connor>
<connor> Huh? </connor>
<joey> - I say that as I went to Saturday school. </joey>
<joey> - You know, </joey>
<connor> there's a lot of harsh realities about Japan that is </connor>
<connor> overlooked because we want it to be this rosy </connor>
<garnt> and beautiful place that is. </garnt>
<garnt> - Which it is. - Which it is. </garnt>
<connor> - In a lot of aspects it is yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I feel like we're looking where we're lucky enough to not </connor>
<garnt> have to be part of the Japanese system. </garnt>
<connor> - We avoid the probably some of the worst aspects </connor>
<connor> of working in Japan. </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. </connor>
<connor> - I think we work in Japan in the most comfortable way ever. </connor>
<joey> - Yeah, we're working right now. </joey>
<joey> I can just sit on my ivory tower, </joey>
<connor> looking down all these peasants and telling them, oh, </connor>
<connor> you should stop doing that. </connor>
<connor> You should try working from home. </connor>
<connor> Have you heard of that? </connor>
<joey> Its the new hip thing with the young people right now. </joey>
<connor> - Wasn't there a thing where they wanted to get people to </connor>
<connor> come back into work and like a little bit of work. </connor>
<joey> It's like, please, God, no, we want to keep teleworking. </joey>
<joey> - We've discovered the beauty that is teleworking. </joey>
<joey> - I feel like if anyone was going to love teleworking </joey>
<connor> it going to Japan. Oh my God. </connor>
<garnt> - It's like kind of like mind blowing, </garnt>
<garnt> that it's taken this long for them to adopt it honestly. </garnt>
<connor> - Have you been on a Japanese Zoom call? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. Unfortunately. </connor>
<connor> Oh my God. If you've been on one? </connor>
<connor> - Yeah. - Oh my God. </connor>
<connor> I was like, whoa, where's the fun guys. </connor>
<connor> Come on, talk a little bit. </connor>
<connor> Like no one said anything. </connor>
<connor> I got on the call we were there for like five minutes. </connor>
<connor> No one said anything because they were waiting for one more </connor>
<connor> person. We're all just standing there with our cameras on. </connor>
<joey> I was like, ah, so the summer, right? </joey>
<connor> - Am I in the right place? </connor>
<joey> - I'm like, please, please I'm not, </joey>
<joey> I'm just like please someone talk about the weather. Just, </joey>
<garnt> just, just, just talk about the weather please. </garnt>
<garnt> - It's been basic as fuck but. </garnt>
<garnt> - I was just waiting for my turn to go on a </garnt>
<garnt> game show or something like everyone was just nervous. </garnt>
<connor> Like no one said anything. And then even then it was like, </connor>
<connor> everyone would like, some of them would say something. </connor>
<connor> I don't know. </connor>
<connor> I've been on zoom calls with like Americans in so much more </connor>
<connor> chill obviously. Cause I'm picking out whatever. </connor>
<connor> But I remember there was one call I had and there was five </connor>
<connor> of us and one person would say something and they would just </connor>
<connor> wait like 30 seconds, like process it. </connor>
<connor> And they would be like, and </connor>
<connor> - I'd be like, guys, this is, this, isn't a courtroom. </connor>
<joey> This is a fucking zoom call. </joey>
<connor> I saw, you know, they would in America, </connor>
<connor> they would publish some of the, </connor>
<connor> a lot of the Zoom court proceedings. </connor>
<connor> And I said, that was, that was more, </connor>
<connor> more jovial fun going on in those then on these zoom calls </connor>
<connor> that I was having, I would just stand there. </connor>
<connor> - What do you mean like jovial? </connor>
<connor> - Like more fun having more fun. </connor>
<connor> - The judge is like guilty JK. </connor>
<joey> - and just a few, </joey>
<connor> few jokes cracked here and there a few, you know, </connor>
<connor> even the judge would be like, how's the day going? </connor>
<connor> Hi. Good, good, good. </connor>
<connor> Anyway, this is far proceeding number. </connor>
<connor> - Anyway life. </connor>
<connor> I just thought I used the weirdest thing that they was just </connor>
<connor> like this weird understanding that no one was allowed to </connor>
<connor> talk until everybody got on the zoom call, </connor>
<connor> but no early </connor>
<connor> - Because its all about procedure here. </connor>
<connor> If its not according to procedure, </connor>
<joey> then it's just chaos and panic. </joey>
<connor> I was just like, this is the, </connor>
<connor> this is the most like unfun Zoom call of my life. </connor>
<joey> Not Zoom calls are fun. </joey>
<connor> - Not that expect them to be fun, </connor>
<connor> but I didn't expect it to be </connor>
<connor> I'm waiting for my hostage person to tell my family about </connor>
<connor> how much they're going to ask for ransom. </connor>
<joey> - I'm waiting for the godfather to enter the room. </joey>
<connor> - Yeah It felt like something like </connor>
<connor> there was some kind of like </connor>
<connor> spiritual ritual about to take place. </connor>
<connor> It was so strange. </connor>
<connor> - Like a seance. (laughs) </connor>
<joey> - I was like, what is this? </joey>
<connor> - Right. Anyway, I think that's a good place to wrap it up. </connor>
<connor> - What a good episode. - what a good episode. </connor>
<connor> I like how we talked about toxic clickbaits. </connor>
