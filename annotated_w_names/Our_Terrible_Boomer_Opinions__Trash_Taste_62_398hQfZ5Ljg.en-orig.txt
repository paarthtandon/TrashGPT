<joey> yeah </joey>
<joey> you're like the because we all shared on </joey>
<garnt> like outline uh message that we have </garnt>
<connor> like the how what the temperature of </connor>
<connor> everyone's was yours was through the </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] roof you were like yeah you were </connor>
<connor> like 39 degrees i was like is this the </connor>
<garnt> last time i'm going to see this game </garnt>
<connor> yeah oh [ __ ] i didn't realize it went </connor>
<joey> that high it was like actually dangerous </joey>
<connor> levels yeah i didn't i didn't feel like </connor>
<connor> i was sick when i woke up when i woke up </connor>
<connor> i was like wow it's just kind of </connor>
<connor> it's kind of hot isn't </connor>
<garnt> it that's a little bit a little bit </garnt>
<garnt> spicy it's kind of what a fever is you </garnt>
<connor> know well i didn't particularly feel bad </connor>
<connor> i felt i've had fevers before where i </connor>
<connor> felt really sick yeah i didn't feel good </connor>
<joey> but this one i was just like wow i'm </joey>
<joey> just really hot oh really wow and then i </joey>
<joey> got out of bed and i went to check my </joey>
<connor> temperature and i was like oh it's </connor>
<joey> it's high yeah it's oh i'm i'm cooking </joey>
<joey> from the inside </joey>
<connor> and then i was like okay i'm gonna go </connor>
<connor> and get some uh energy drink from the </connor>
<garnt> store not that i'm not energy drink like </garnt>
<garnt> gatorade or whatever you know just yeah </garnt>
<garnt> generic water so red bull is probably </garnt>
<connor> literally just any drink that's water </connor>
<joey> featuring sugar uh yeah one of those </joey>
<connor> drinks </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and i got it </connor>
<connor> and then by the time i got home i was </connor>
<connor> like okay no i actually think i feel </connor>
<connor> sick now </connor>
<connor> i think i feel pretty shitty yeah and so </connor>
<joey> i didn't do anything it was the opposite </joey>
<garnt> for me i immediately woke up and like </garnt>
<garnt> all of my joints were just </garnt>
<garnt> aching like crazy but it was weird </garnt>
<garnt> because i checked my temperature and i </garnt>
<joey> only had like 37 or something so i only </joey>
<joey> had a slight fever but man my bones were </joey>
<garnt> just rattled yeah it was really weird </garnt>
<garnt> for me because i woke up and i felt like </garnt>
<garnt> completely fine i woke up to like we </garnt>
<garnt> have like a group chat where like all </garnt>
<garnt> the staff members of trash taste were </garnt>
<garnt> just like are we recording today and </garnt>
<joey> everyone posted that temperature and </joey>
<joey> we're like no we're definitely not </joey>
<joey> recording today no that's that's not a </joey>
<joey> thing that's happening and then i took </joey>
<joey> my temperature and mine was just like 37 </joey>
<joey> on the door and i was like yeah i feel </joey>
<joey> completely fine and got up started doing </joey>
<connor> work be like ah these these guys just </connor>
<connor> have weak immune systems these </connor>
<connor> yeah things having weak immune systems </connor>
<connor> and a [ __ ] like two o'clock rolls </connor>
<connor> over sitting on my computer i'm like oh </connor>
<connor> i'm getting chills what's what's that </connor>
<connor> what's happening here what's happening </connor>
<connor> right yeah yeah and then i went from </connor>
<garnt> like being completely fine to just like </garnt>
<garnt> having the worst headache and just </garnt>
<garnt> probably just having the flu so i'm just </garnt>
<garnt> like man there's a vaccine he's got </garnt>
<joey> hands man it's [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> fighting this has been delayed </joey>
<joey> yeah it was a bit late so like yeah in </joey>
<joey> the end i just i i woke up completely </joey>
<garnt> fine and then for like most of the day </garnt>
<garnt> after 2 p.m i was just completely </garnt>
<joey> bedridden yeah yeah um how long were you </joey>
<joey> guys in bed for </joey>
<connor> i don't know i was watching the olympics </connor>
<joey> you know just chilling oh yeah just </joey>
<connor> watching people do sports and i was like </connor>
<joey> wow i still could be me right i still </joey>
<garnt> haven't seen anything from the olympics </garnt>
<joey> except the opening ceremony i saw that </joey>
<joey> because yeah we had like a like a little </joey>
<garnt> viewing party at our place yeah because </garnt>
<connor> uh one of our friends really wanted to </connor>
<garnt> see the opening for something to be fair </garnt>
<connor> it's probably like the most interesting </connor>
<connor> part of the olympics honestly </connor>
<connor> i mean if you're not into sport right i </connor>
<connor> feel like you don't even need to be into </connor>
<connor> sport to be into the olympics oh no like </connor>
<joey> story lines you know it's a story i mean </joey>
<joey> sure but like i think for like the </joey>
<joey> majority of people who aren't into sport </joey>
<joey> and don't care about the olympics the </joey>
<joey> opening and ending ceremony probably </joey>
<joey> like the two biggest highlights of like </joey>
<connor> the scene i guess i i don't really care </connor>
<connor> about sports in general i don't i just i </connor>
<connor> don't know why something about the </connor>
<connor> olympics is fun it's a thing where </connor>
<connor> there's just sport that's on all day and </connor>
<connor> it's changing constantly between events </connor>
<connor> so you don't have a chance to get bored </connor>
<connor> like when i've been watching like you </connor>
<connor> know i might be watching the cycling of </connor>
<connor> too long i'm like all right okay but </connor>
<connor> then the next the boxing comes on and i </connor>
<connor> say oh okay </connor>
<connor> and then and then you know it keeps </connor>
<connor> changing and then like okay and i like </connor>
<connor> what the [ __ ] going on like what is </connor>
<garnt> actually right who's winning </garnt>
<garnt> i mean yeah for me the olympics is i've </garnt>
<garnt> never been really too </garnt>
<garnt> interested in the olympics it's probably </garnt>
<garnt> one of my least favorite sporting events </garnt>
<garnt> just because there's a bit too much </garnt>
<garnt> going on for me like at least no because </garnt>
<connor> we talked about least favorite sporting </connor>
<joey> events yeah i mean i mean we talked </joey>
<garnt> about stories we lost the olympics </garnt>
<joey> what's worse than the olympics </joey>
<joey> every other sporting event </joey>
<garnt> i don't know what's better than the </garnt>
<connor> olympia better than olympics well i like </connor>
<connor> most major sporting events when they're </connor>
<connor> when the league doesn't count </connor>
<connor> league doesn't dude league does count on </connor>
<connor> you i [ __ ] love the league fighter </connor>
<connor> video games </connor>
<connor> what am i listening to i love the world </connor>
<connor> cup i love the euros i love the rugby </connor>
<connor> world cup as well it's just like it's </connor>
<connor> for me it's easier to follow along the </connor>
<garnt> storyline if just there's just like one </garnt>
<joey> event or one tournament going on right </joey>
<garnt> with the olympics it's just like what </garnt>
<joey> stage are we at what what sport is this </joey>
<joey> i don't know i've never even heard of </joey>
<joey> this [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> what the [ __ ] is handball how do i get </connor>
<garnt> invested in handball when i don't even </garnt>
<connor> know the [ __ ] rules </connor>
<connor> i totally agree with you and so i i </connor>
<connor> could have watched it on japanese tv </connor>
<connor> probably is that i don't understand </connor>
<connor> fully what's being said all the time </connor>
<connor> yeah and i feel like i realized when </connor>
<connor> when watching on japanese tv i'm like </connor>
<connor> wow actually like knowing who the people </connor>
<connor> are and why i should give a [ __ ] is </connor>
<connor> actually really important oh yeah yeah i </connor>
<connor> thought just being able to leave it on </connor>
<joey> the background that'd be interesting </joey>
<joey> that's the whole point of commentators </joey>
<joey> right so and i realized and i so i got </joey>
<connor> my vpn and i watched it on the british </connor>
<garnt> uh the british uh website did you use </garnt>
<garnt> expressvpn i did use accessories hell </garnt>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<garnt> and </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i i was watching with the british </garnt>
<garnt> commentary and the commentary was really </garnt>
<garnt> good and </garnt>
<garnt> i didn't realize how much it added to it </garnt>
<garnt> because there's some commentary that </garnt>
<connor> he'd be like actually dying like </connor>
<garnt> laughing like uh i think the british </garnt>
<connor> rowing team didn't win like any gold </connor>
<connor> medals and one of the commentators just </connor>
<connor> couldn't hold back he was so pissed off </connor>
<connor> and he was like the absolute state of </connor>
<connor> british rowing we invested 27 million </connor>
<connor> pounds in british rowing and we didn't </connor>
<connor> get a single gold medal and it was just </connor>
<connor> like live on tv like right after they </connor>
<connor> just lost and it's like he's just going </connor>
<connor> in he's like he's like </connor>
<connor> i felt embarrassed i'm like imagine </connor>
<connor> you're the rose that made this guy on </connor>
<connor> bbc go off on one because i don't want a </connor>
<connor> tyrant </connor>
<connor> legendary this is like all the other </connor>
<connor> good sports i don't know anything about </connor>
<connor> like taekwondo i don't know anything </connor>
<garnt> about but the commentators help explain </garnt>
<garnt> everything as you're going and yeah and </garnt>
<garnt> it is annoying when you're watching it </garnt>
<garnt> for too long because then they start </garnt>
<garnt> over again and they start explaining it </garnt>
<garnt> again because they assume that people </garnt>
<garnt> are only watching for short amounts of </garnt>
<garnt> time yeah they because nobody knows what </garnt>
<connor> the hell the rules are yeah yeah it's </connor>
<connor> great i mean i was watching like diving </connor>
<joey> as well diving is really fun to watch oh </joey>
<joey> yeah diving super fun it was really fun </joey>
<connor> i was like </connor>
<connor> i think that's the only like sports that </connor>
<connor> i like in the olympics is like just the </connor>
<connor> obscure ones that you never get to see </connor>
<connor> otherwise so it's like with like tennis </connor>
<connor> and rugby it's like you know that's </connor>
<connor> playing all year rugby your [ __ ] in the </connor>
<joey> olympics have you seen it yeah </joey>
<connor> it's like five minutes aside or </connor>
<connor> something and there's only like 10 </connor>
<garnt> minutes of rugby well most major sports </garnt>
<garnt> that have like bigger competitions yeah </garnt>
<connor> are like pretty [ __ ] in the olympics i </connor>
<connor> feel like like they send like the b team </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah they don't see you like you </connor>
<connor> look at like the football or the rugby </connor>
<connor> or like the tennis yeah </connor>
<connor> as well yeah oh there's baseball there </connor>
<connor> so yeah there's baseball yeah it's </connor>
<connor> basically more like basketball as well </connor>
<garnt> right </garnt>
<connor> yeah like like sports that have like a </connor>
<connor> competition that's just more prestigious </connor>
<connor> than the olympics for that specific </connor>
<garnt> sport i feel like it just takes a bit of </garnt>
<garnt> the wind out the real magic of the </garnt>
<garnt> olympics is watching this small sport </garnt>
<connor> that you've never heard well yeah </connor>
<connor> because a lot of these sports don't have </connor>
<connor> any major leagues to you know push them </connor>
<connor> and give them a lot of money in the </connor>
<joey> obviously i did see a bit of like the uh </joey>
<connor> the skateboarding because i was </connor>
<connor> interested in that i think japan got a </connor>
<connor> gold medal in it yeah </connor>
<joey> like it's all kids as well yeah it's </joey>
<joey> like 10 year old kids yeah i'm like [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> dude god imagine winning a [ __ ] yeah </joey>
<connor> right what was i doing in 10 years i </connor>
<connor> realized the olympics this year has been </connor>
<connor> awful like every single athlete right he </connor>
<connor> looks like 30 the interview he's like 21 </connor>
<connor> and he's just won the gold medal i'm </connor>
<connor> like what the [ __ ] man </connor>
<connor> this man is built like a greek god and </connor>
<connor> he's won a medal and he's got he's got </connor>
<garnt> his [ __ ] together yeah </garnt>
<garnt> like you you've reached that point where </garnt>
<connor> i you reached that point when you were </connor>
<connor> when everyone in the olympics is younger </connor>
<connor> than me yeah no no not even the olympics </connor>
<connor> or when you grow when you when you're </connor>
<connor> young everyone you watch on tv is just </connor>
<connor> older than you yeah and it's just like </connor>
<connor> something you get used to like every </connor>
<connor> every athlete every major like </connor>
<connor> personality is just older than you and </connor>
<joey> then you get to a point where you start </joey>
<joey> seeing people that's younger than you </joey>
<joey> and achieving these amazing achieving </joey>
<connor> these amazing things and like starting </connor>
<joey> football i'm like geez like at 21 i was </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] masturbating and eating cheetos </garnt>
<garnt> like i mean well these kids just want a </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] olympic gold medal yeah i was </connor>
<garnt> getting really pissed off because every </garnt>
<garnt> single time they introduce someone </garnt>
<garnt> they're just younger than me i'm like </garnt>
<garnt> what the [ __ ] is this where's the </garnt>
<connor> where's the 30 year old get it pull it </connor>
<joey> get him in what does he do he's he's the </joey>
<joey> veteran </joey>
<connor> yeah [ __ ] bro the coach is like 27 years </connor>
<connor> old it's like jesus it's pissing me off </connor>
<connor> i'm like this is surely surely there has </connor>
<joey> to be someone age 24 that's why i kind </joey>
<joey> of almost prefer the winter olympics a </joey>
<joey> lot of times because i feel that in the </joey>
<joey> winter olympics there's more of those </joey>
<connor> like more niche sports that you really </connor>
<connor> only get to see in the olympics </connor>
<connor> otherwise you really have to go deep for </connor>
<connor> it like curling for example is like i </connor>
<connor> never thought i would care about curling </connor>
<connor> until i watched the curling like two </connor>
<connor> winter olympics back and i'm like </connor>
<connor> damn i want to try this this looks fun </connor>
<connor> as [ __ ] because i didn't even know the </connor>
<connor> rules to calling at first i was like </connor>
<connor> it's just a bunch of people scrubbing </connor>
<connor> some ice like all right cool so but then </connor>
<connor> when you actually like learn the </connor>
<joey> intricacies of the game it's just like </joey>
<joey> all right that's actually like really </joey>
<connor> cool i don't understand why like every </connor>
<connor> country just doesn't agree to take like </connor>
<joey> a week off during the olympics well to </joey>
<joey> just sit down and watch it sit down </joey>
<connor> chill watch it why not every every </connor>
<connor> country can you know have a week off </connor>
<garnt> seems like the world economy might have </garnt>
<connor> a different a small issue with that </connor>
<joey> i mean it's like once every what four </joey>
<connor> years right yeah take a week off </connor>
<garnt> i mean okay dude do you get patriotic at </garnt>
<joey> all during the olympics </joey>
<connor> i i listen to what the commentators tell </connor>
<connor> me to do </connor>
<connor> the commentators tell me i should care </connor>
<joey> about something i'm like all right i'm </joey>
<joey> caring do you get patriotic at all about </joey>
<joey> like any sporting event </joey>
<connor> oh yeah uh league of legends i want the </connor>
<connor> eu boys to win well i mean obviously i </connor>
<joey> was like </joey>
<garnt> again anything else uh for me the world </garnt>
<connor> cup and the euros yeah i was i actually </connor>
<connor> stayed up i watched the euros and watch </connor>
<connor> england get beaten this time yeah in the </connor>
<connor> finals once again good um </connor>
<connor> and uh </connor>
<connor> it was it was horrible i had to record </connor>
<connor> trash taste like the day as well which </connor>
<connor> is why i was until like four years </connor>
<connor> remember the last time i recorded trash </connor>
<connor> this while i was absolutely dead yeah </connor>
<garnt> because i was like watching [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> england just int </garnt>
<connor> over like whales in rugby i want wales </connor>
<connor> to win right oh yeah and then if whales </connor>
<connor> get knocked out of something and england </connor>
<connor> are still in it it's like okay now i'm </connor>
<joey> rooting for england to lose </joey>
<joey> you'd think it would be like you'd think </joey>
<joey> mostly </joey>
<connor> the problem is with english people is </connor>
<connor> that they're the worst when they win at </connor>
<connor> the sport they like </connor>
<joey> every time they win it's like every </joey>
<connor> single country hates them because </connor>
<joey> they're just they somehow are the worst </joey>
<joey> country at winning yeah they're like bad </joey>
<connor> losers yeah or bad winners well it's </connor>
<connor> just like every single country hates </connor>
<connor> having the fans in their country </connor>
<connor> yeah because they're the worst yeah it's </connor>
<connor> terrible </connor>
<connor> like like people think because you're </connor>
<garnt> welsh part of great britain well sean in </garnt>
<garnt> it you're gonna you've root for england </garnt>
<garnt> right and it's the complete [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> opposite now </garnt>
<garnt> except if it's the other way around like </garnt>
<garnt> i remember when uh andy murray won </garnt>
<connor> wimbledon it was like it was like </connor>
<connor> britain's first win in wimbledon floyd </connor>
<connor> god knows how many years he's like </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] decades right um and it was like </connor>
<connor> the only time where like a british like </connor>
<connor> english people are happy to cheer for </connor>
<joey> like scottish people because annie </joey>
<joey> murray scottish i believe yeah um but </joey>
<joey> they aren't happy to share the other way </joey>
<connor> around everyone hates english people </connor>
<connor> right that's true </connor>
<joey> and normally english people won't cheer </joey>
<joey> for scottish people welsh people but </joey>
<joey> when it once is great britain </joey>
<joey> everything's fine everyone's funny buddy </joey>
<garnt> everyone's buddy buddy again it's team </garnt>
<connor> gb now which is really [ __ ] confusing </connor>
<connor> because depending on the sport is it's </connor>
<connor> totally up to the sport whether or not </connor>
<connor> it's a welsh scottish and english team </connor>
<joey> right or if it's a </joey>
<joey> uh a british team or some i think </joey>
<joey> there's one or two sports where wales </joey>
<connor> and england are combined but scotland </connor>
<joey> isn't yeah so it's really </joey>
<connor> of cool whales scotland is just so </connor>
<connor> confusing to someone outside of that </connor>
<joey> country like i've had it explained to me </joey>
<joey> about three or four times i believe by </joey>
<connor> you two and i still don't understand </connor>
<joey> what it is not that complicated i'm like </joey>
<joey> so what's considered uk what's great </joey>
<joey> britain what's the commonwealth what's </joey>
<joey> all this [ __ ] like it's it's just really </joey>
<connor> confusing to me i mean we do we want to </connor>
<connor> have we do we the siege watch cbc great </connor>
<joey> video yeah there's there's plenty of </joey>
<connor> people just trying to explain it there's </connor>
<joey> plenty of videos on it we're not going </joey>
<connor> to explain it yeah </connor>
<connor> but you should learn that wales exists </connor>
<joey> and see but at least like you know in </joey>
<joey> the case with like wales in england </joey>
<connor> right like at least you got you know i i </connor>
<connor> feel a lot of the same sports you guys </connor>
<connor> are either good at or bad at right so </connor>
<connor> like say for example like in the rugby </connor>
<connor> right whales in england pretty good yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah they're not like top top but </connor>
<connor> they're you know usually stay up near </connor>
<connor> the top right so like at least you have </connor>
<connor> that choice yeah i don't have that </connor>
<connor> choice with my two countries because </connor>
<connor> sports that australia is good at japan </connor>
<garnt> sucks at sports that japan is good at </garnt>
<garnt> australia sucks at </garnt>
<garnt> so like in the soccer right like japan's </garnt>
<joey> pretty good australia's [ __ ] in the </joey>
<joey> cricket japan didn't don't even play </joey>
<joey> cricket </joey>
<joey> the same like the rugby is probably like </joey>
<joey> the only thing because you know i think </joey>
<garnt> last rugby woke up japan came like </garnt>
<garnt> eighth i think yeah top eight or </garnt>
<garnt> something it was hosted in japan yeah </garnt>
<garnt> which is hype as far as right because </garnt>
<garnt> japan is never that good um that was the </garnt>
<joey> only time where i was like all right </joey>
<joey> japan you did good but </joey>
<joey> we're gonna have to go back to syria now </joey>
<connor> after that </connor>
<connor> there's australia they're gonna rugby </connor>
<joey> yeah australia's really good and they're </joey>
<joey> in top four yeah i don't watch sports </joey>
<connor> often mainly because of a it's just you </connor>
<connor> know we're supposed to live in this time </connor>
<joey> zone what the [ __ ] when the [ __ ] is this </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] happening the reason why it's so </joey>
<garnt> easy to keep along with the olympics is </garnt>
<joey> because it's just all day yeah yeah it's </joey>
<garnt> great i wake up it's on i go to bed it's </garnt>
<garnt> on like </garnt>
<garnt> i mean that's kind of what i liked about </garnt>
<connor> big sporting competitions you know any </connor>
<connor> any age i was where you turn on the tv </connor>
<connor> and it's just sports playing and it's </connor>
<connor> just it's just fun and it's fun to watch </connor>
<connor> something where every match matters to </connor>
<garnt> somebody i just wish i knew more about </garnt>
<garnt> who was competing yeah in the olympics </garnt>
<connor> no way you can though yeah there's no </connor>
<connor> way there's so much information and then </connor>
<garnt> you know even like i was getting </garnt>
<connor> confused because even in like some of </connor>
<connor> the sports like taekwondo or some of the </connor>
<connor> martial arts it's like weight divisions </connor>
<connor> and there's so many weight divisions </connor>
<connor> there's so many competitors in the </connor>
<connor> weight divisions and there might be </connor>
<connor> multiple ones from your country in the </connor>
<connor> one weight division so it's really hard </connor>
<connor> to be like all right wait who am i </connor>
<connor> rooting for what the [ __ ] is going on i </connor>
<joey> just see the flag and i'm like oh i </joey>
<garnt> recognize that one go that one </garnt>
<garnt> that's basically what it boils down to </garnt>
<garnt> right it's just like i like my country </garnt>
<joey> let's see that country do well yeah it's </joey>
<joey> like oh i've never heard of </joey>
<connor> liechtenstein before i i think they're </connor>
<connor> good at this sport </connor>
<connor> they compete in the olympics i don't </connor>
<connor> even know there's a lot dude like okay </connor>
<joey> watching the opening ceremony and you </joey>
<joey> know how they have to like go through </joey>
<joey> all the countries </joey>
<joey> there's like over 100 countries that </joey>
<joey> were competing this year but </joey>
<joey> it was funny because </joey>
<joey> they were going not in alphabetical </joey>
<joey> order yeah they were going in like </joey>
<joey> japanese like hiragana order which is oh </joey>
<garnt> completely different i was wondering </garnt>
<joey> what kind of order they were going in </joey>
<joey> yeah they just seemed like the most </joey>
<garnt> weird order yeah that had never been </garnt>
<joey> done that's why there were like you know </joey>
<garnt> some countries starting with c that came </garnt>
<garnt> after countries starting with k because </garnt>
<garnt> in japanese alphabet it's like in the </garnt>
<garnt> same order so like i remember my sister </garnt>
<garnt> in australia was texting me because she </garnt>
<garnt> was watching it as well and she was like </garnt>
<garnt> oh it's really funny because these </garnt>
<garnt> australian commentators have been </garnt>
<garnt> explaining for the past 10 minutes why </garnt>
<connor> these countries are coming out in this </connor>
<connor> order they literally have to explain the </connor>
<connor> japanese writing system to an australian </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] audience to be like oh so okay </connor>
<connor> so hear me out this is how it works and </connor>
<connor> this is why it's the weird order but </connor>
<connor> like i heard dude there were so many </connor>
<joey> countries in there where i was like that </joey>
<joey> that sounds like a made-up word like </joey>
<connor> that's not a real country some of them </connor>
<connor> aren't i i i'm correct aren't even </connor>
<joey> countries like uh i think like some of </joey>
<joey> them are like micro nations yeah some of </joey>
<connor> the more uh territories territories are </connor>
<joey> other countries like there's the cayman </joey>
<connor> islands as well as listed as this yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<garnt> i don't think that is </garnt>
<garnt> i saw some drama happen live while i was </garnt>
<garnt> watching boxing there was like a british </garnt>
<garnt> guy versus a french guy </garnt>
<garnt> and i mean that's drama already yeah </garnt>
<garnt> that's trump already which is that's i </garnt>
<connor> mean let's go back to history </connor>
<connor> napoleon just makes a [ __ ] like </connor>
<connor> exposed video or whatever </connor>
<connor> yeah it was literally like that </connor>
<connor> and they were boxing right and </connor>
<connor> so obviously when you're boxing </connor>
<connor> sometimes you like you did they do the </connor>
<connor> hugging thing yeah and it's like okay </connor>
<connor> cool so when they were doing the hugging </connor>
<connor> thing like i think the french guy was </connor>
<connor> like head-butting the british guy oh </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] he like made him bleed and the ref </connor>
<connor> was like hey don't do that again he did </connor>
<garnt> it again </garnt>
<garnt> and then he just immediately </garnt>
<garnt> disqualified him right right the french </garnt>
<joey> guy yeah yeah and he had a [ __ ] men </joey>
<joey> down like a mental breakdown and started </joey>
<joey> like shouting and stuff going up to all </joey>
<connor> the cameras being like no i won no i won </connor>
<connor> into the wow and they were like </connor>
<connor> announcing it and he was like no stop </connor>
<garnt> announcing it stop it now stop the count </garnt>
<garnt> yeah he was like stop this is [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> there's no way and he was like throwing </joey>
<joey> a massive fit it was so crazy </joey>
<joey> how did i not see that i don't know i i </joey>
<garnt> when i when it was happening i was like </garnt>
<garnt> oh [ __ ] am i watching drama live yo [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i went to i didn't want any good uh </garnt>
<garnt> personality </garnt>
<garnt> it was great the live league thing </garnt>
<connor> started popping up like midway it was </connor>
<connor> great </connor>
<connor> i immediately went to twitter as any </connor>
<connor> good person would when </connor>
<connor> featuring drama i was like oh this is </connor>
<connor> great i went to twitter and i watched it </connor>
<connor> and i was just watching everyone else </connor>
<joey> talk about the drama i was watching oh </joey>
<joey> that's weird because i've seen so many </joey>
<joey> clips of the olympics there's a lot more </joey>
<garnt> drama in the olympics it happens yeah i </garnt>
<garnt> think i've watched more olympics on </garnt>
<garnt> twitter than i have on television the </garnt>
<joey> only clips i saw at the olympics was </joey>
<joey> that they're playing a lot of anime </joey>
<joey> music yeah a lot of people are doing </joey>
<connor> anime stuff yeah so when you come out in </connor>
<joey> boxing you're allowed to play your own </joey>
<joey> music yeah yeah yeah yeah and some of </joey>
<joey> them one of them the demon slayer one of </joey>
<connor> the japanese guys yeah yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<joey> i saw there was a greek person who did </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> yeah i did like year two in one piece </joey>
<joey> and won the [ __ ] one uh gold medal as </joey>
<joey> well what a bad i think he said a record </joey>
<joey> as well so i'm just like yo one piece </joey>
<garnt> stands founder of one piece stands like </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] stand up yeah the i think one of </joey>
<garnt> the volleyball matches with the japanese </garnt>
<connor> team they'll play in the haikyuu theme </connor>
<garnt> like during like the intervals </garnt>
<garnt> and i'm like that's so cool but yeah </garnt>
<garnt> like the opening set the only cool part </garnt>
<joey> about the opening ceremony was the fact </joey>
<joey> that that from what i saw because like </joey>
<joey> admittedly like compared to some of the </joey>
<connor> other opening ceremonies that i've seen </connor>
<connor> it was a very artistic one i'd say yeah </connor>
<joey> [Applause] </joey>
<garnt> you know what that means it was history </garnt>
<joey> it was very bare bones it was bare bones </joey>
<joey> like the references i think that people </joey>
<joey> were looking for were not in the opening </joey>
<joey> so i think a lot of people are hoping </joey>
<connor> that it comes out in the ending ceremony </connor>
<connor> but i think the only cool thing was that </connor>
<connor> during the time when all of the </connor>
<connor> countries were coming out because that's </connor>
<connor> like a like an hour and a half segment </connor>
<connor> of like all the countries coming yeah </connor>
<connor> they were playing like just </connor>
<joey> basically the entire discography of </joey>
<joey> square enix games like literally every </joey>
<joey> square enix game you could think of they </joey>
<joey> were playing the musical so like they </joey>
<joey> literally opened with like the dragon </joey>
<joey> quest theme and like they're playing </joey>
<joey> final fantasy chrono trigger like </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] near they've played a [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> near automatic yeah i heard them but not </garnt>
<joey> just any near automata song literally </joey>
<connor> the most darkest depressing mirror </connor>
<connor> that plays in like a really sad scene in </connor>
<connor> the game oh my god i mean it's like </connor>
<connor> malta and it's just like </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] like </connor>
<connor> this </connor>
<connor> it's really weird but like i'm just </connor>
<garnt> thinking like because you know i think </garnt>
<garnt> the biggest question everyone had who </garnt>
<garnt> watched the opening is like </garnt>
<garnt> where's all the nintendo [ __ ] yeah </garnt>
<garnt> that's what i was pokemon where's mario </garnt>
<joey> where's all that stuff that they </joey>
<joey> promised that like it's kind of odd </joey>
<connor> because normally japan has been quite </connor>
<garnt> patriotic with all of its especially </garnt>
<joey> pokemon </joey>
<garnt> japan is not </garnt>
<garnt> as sweet what's the word uh </garnt>
<connor> japan has not been scared to embrace </connor>
<joey> pokemon right national symbol and like </joey>
<garnt> you know considering the fact that at </garnt>
<connor> the end of the last olympics yeah the </connor>
<garnt> mario thing yeah like a prime minister </garnt>
<connor> came out of a pipe dressed as mario </connor>
<connor> right it could be a thing if nintendo </connor>
<connor> didn't want to do it or it could have </connor>
<joey> been a thing of or i think what a lot of </joey>
<joey> people are waiting for is because they </joey>
<joey> were like square enix we'll let you take </joey>
<joey> the opening </joey>
<joey> but nintendo </joey>
<connor> is the end i don't know </connor>
<connor> that's why by the time this has come out </connor>
<joey> we'll know the answer yeah i guess so </joey>
<joey> but like that's as of right now that's </joey>
<garnt> what i think all the theories are yeah i </garnt>
<garnt> mean like do you think the opening was </garnt>
<connor> purposefully done the way it is or is it </connor>
<connor> just because of the world situation that </connor>
<garnt> they couldn't make it bigger because </garnt>
<joey> that's what i i think i think it's the </joey>
<connor> latter did you go back and watch other </connor>
<joey> opening ceremonies i did yeah </joey>
<connor> the beijing olympics like that one was </connor>
<garnt> insane compared to like japanese i mean </garnt>
<garnt> the japanese one was good don't get me </garnt>
<joey> wrong but i definitely did feel that i </joey>
<joey> think the world situation really did </joey>
<joey> screw it over in a lot of ways yeah </joey>
<joey> because i was like </joey>
<garnt> i like the idea that they were going for </garnt>
<garnt> but i feel it was like a little </garnt>
<garnt> underperformed it's like where's the </garnt>
<joey> budget yeah right </joey>
<connor> it really did feel like that won't have </connor>
<connor> the [ __ ] queens yeah yeah yeah i'm </connor>
<joey> like how much did that cost </joey>
<connor> yeah that daniel craig be james bond </connor>
<joey> there's no way he did that for less than </joey>
<joey> like 50 million exactly he literally </joey>
<connor> hates james bond </connor>
<garnt> as we've established why would he want </garnt>
<garnt> to do that exactly right for queen and </garnt>
<garnt> country obviously </garnt>
<garnt> that like you know they would have at </garnt>
<garnt> least you know some more like notable </garnt>
<garnt> like big big people coming out in the </garnt>
<garnt> opening right because like that's you </garnt>
<connor> know the way to like open for your </connor>
<connor> country and like be braggadocios about </connor>
<connor> your country for years but i feel that </connor>
<joey> like that's the one time you can </joey>
<connor> actually brag yeah right and like people </connor>
<joey> are waiting for you to brag but like i </joey>
<joey> feel like the references that they did </joey>
<joey> throw in were like </joey>
<joey> super [ __ ] subtle and like kind of </joey>
<garnt> offhand or like what was that guy that </garnt>
<garnt> was tap dancing i didn't get that </garnt>
<joey> he was literally okay yeah </joey>
<garnt> he was literally i think it was he's </garnt>
<connor> the greatest tap dancer in japan wait to </connor>
<connor> explain what was going on i watched him </connor>
<joey> i don't remember that so there was this </joey>
<joey> tap so what they did instead was instead </joey>
<joey> of bringing out these like notable names </joey>
<joey> they brought out like </joey>
<joey> japan's best </joey>
<joey> blank so like they had like japan's best </joey>
<joey> tap dancer and he was performing and </joey>
<joey> they're like they had japan's best like </joey>
<connor> jazz pianist yeah i do remember this and </connor>
<connor> i i think i was like why are they </connor>
<connor> bringing in tap dances in japan yeah </connor>
<joey> also during a really like traditional </joey>
<joey> like wood scene yeah that's why i'm like </joey>
<joey> this </joey>
<joey> it's like 400 years of difference </joey>
<joey> between tap dancing and like edo period </joey>
<connor> you know </connor>
<connor> when i think japan i don't think tap </connor>
<joey> that </joey>
<joey> i don't think tap dancing in jazz </joey>
<garnt> piano it was just so surreal seeing like </garnt>
<garnt> a tap dancer dancing on a stage with </garnt>
<garnt> nothing on it to a crowd of zero people </garnt>
<garnt> in a stadium that's meant for like </garnt>
<connor> thirty thousand yeah yeah yeah oh it's </connor>
<connor> so depressing seeing all the studios </connor>
<joey> yeah i actually read that uh they </joey>
<joey> the guy who designed like the the actual </joey>
<connor> stadium </connor>
<connor> he to make you know because obviously </connor>
<connor> they couldn't put people into the </connor>
<connor> stadium so what they did was he </connor>
<connor> purposely designed the seats and </connor>
<connor> arranged the colors to make it look like </connor>
<garnt> there were people sitting from a </garnt>
<garnt> distance what how can </garnt>
<joey> you [ __ ] didn't that was the intent i </joey>
<connor> think yeah but uh yeah obviously you </connor>
<joey> know to varying degrees of success i </joey>
<garnt> mean i think a lot of it was unfortunate </garnt>
<garnt> because i i think another thing about </garnt>
<connor> the tap dancing is that it's because the </connor>
<connor> stadium was so big and i don't think the </connor>
<connor> microphones were sensitive enough i </connor>
<connor> could hardly [ __ ] hear it it was at </connor>
<garnt> that point it was just like [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> stepping with attitude </garnt>
<connor> that's that's kind of what it felt like </connor>
<garnt> the commentators even in the i was </garnt>
<garnt> watching on japanese tv they were </garnt>
<garnt> explaining what was going on more than </garnt>
<joey> they were letting their audio play yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah so </joey>
<joey> how good of an opening ceremony is that </joey>
<connor> if i need i actually need a narrator to </connor>
<connor> tell me what's happening like legit some </connor>
<joey> of the stuff was so avant-garde yeah it </joey>
<connor> was crazy but like sixty percent of the </connor>
<connor> commentators were like doing [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> like audio commentary yeah they were </connor>
<connor> telling the description exactly what was </connor>
<connor> going on </connor>
<joey> this represents blah blah blah and i'm </joey>
<joey> like just let me watch it shut up just </joey>
<connor> let me watch it's not very good if i </connor>
<connor> can't discern what's going on right </connor>
<joey> exactly yeah i was watching it through </joey>
<joey> the british commentary and there wasn't </joey>
<joey> actually much commentary because i think </joey>
<joey> they were just as confused </joey>
<joey> it's not a good opening ceremony if you </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] talk over all of it yeah exactly </joey>
<connor> i don't go and watch of mice and men and </connor>
<joey> have someone narrow in my ear what's why </joey>
<joey> why lenny is doing all this [ __ ] you </joey>
<joey> know what i mean i don't need this [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> let it speak for itself that's it's oh </connor>
<joey> my god i think i think the speech </joey>
<joey> afterwards of like the olympic committee </joey>
<connor> actually went on for longer than the </connor>
<connor> performance yeah </connor>
<connor> zoned out yeah yeah so yeah i don't know </connor>
<connor> like maybe that was because of a budget </connor>
<connor> problem it was because of the world </connor>
<joey> situation but i mean like i think a lot </joey>
<joey> more people i think the only good thing </joey>
<joey> that came out of it was probably square </joey>
<joey> enix's stocks went </joey>
<joey> because of like the amount of music they </joey>
<garnt> used at the beginning i wanted to know </garnt>
<garnt> how square enix was basically just got </garnt>
<joey> over to got to like take over the </joey>
<garnt> opening ceremony yeah i've noticed </garnt>
<connor> there's so many other like </connor>
<joey> japanese yeah honestly but they </joey>
<joey> literally like you know had the actual </joey>
<joey> spotlight at that point like i remember </joey>
<joey> as well like it wasn't just square enix </joey>
<joey> music they literally played a song from </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] sonic adventure 2. </joey>
<joey> are you serious there was yeah one of </joey>
<joey> the songs that played in the scene </joey>
<joey> because the set piece uh like </joey>
<joey> was leaked on twitter before the actual </joey>
<joey> like beginning of that segment and in </joey>
<connor> the list there was a [ __ ] sonic song </connor>
<connor> rolling around </connor>
<garnt> i think there's that one </garnt>
<garnt> the best opening ceremony of all time </garnt>
<joey> but yeah they literally i don't think it </joey>
<joey> was sonic adventure 2 it was one of the </joey>
<connor> sonic games but they legitimately played </connor>
<connor> a sonic song and i'm just like i mean </connor>
<joey> sean's pretty [ __ ] iconic i mean hey </joey>
<garnt> man like they did it i guess how did </garnt>
<garnt> sega get in and then nintendo just </garnt>
<joey> didn't then i and i think that's why </joey>
<joey> like that's where the confusion arose of </joey>
<connor> like okay so like </connor>
<connor> obviously more people know when you </connor>
<connor> think of japan from like a foreigner's </connor>
<connor> perspective you think pokemon and mario </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah like you don't think of final </connor>
<connor> fantasy and sonic would you say song is </connor>
<connor> more famous than final fantasy </connor>
<connor> it is right sonic yeah probably probably </connor>
<connor> not weird because he </connor>
<joey> only had like three good games yeah he's </joey>
<joey> literally just like he's coming on the </joey>
<joey> bridge </joey>
<garnt> yeah he's literally cashing in on the </garnt>
<joey> brand recognition he he is sonic is one </joey>
<connor> of those sonic riders though okay </connor>
<connor> i recognize that it's not the best game </connor>
<joey> sonic riders battle adventure 2 is good </joey>
<joey> and sonic heroes was weirdly good too </joey>
<joey> but but isn't it strange though how </joey>
<connor> sonic hasn't had like the biggest </connor>
<connor> smash hit games yet he's still like the </connor>
<connor> one of the most recognizable that's the </connor>
<joey> thing sonic is not purely surviving off </joey>
<garnt> of character design brand recognition </garnt>
<connor> like he's he's just an icon his </connor>
<connor> character design is poor [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> it's brilliant </connor>
<connor> it's just the cult following all right </connor>
<connor> like you know after sonic uh the uh </connor>
<connor> sonic 3 all right like we haven't had a </connor>
<joey> single like goose </joey>
<connor> well i mean yeah but i mean it's kind of </connor>
<joey> a remake of it yeah yeah that's up for </joey>
<joey> debate i mean it's all like been 2d </joey>
<garnt> sonics there hasn't been a good 3d sonic </garnt>
<joey> all the 2d sonics were fantastic </joey>
<joey> all the 3d sonics except for writers was </joey>
<joey> you know absolutely trash and yet they </joey>
<joey> can somehow pump out all these sonic </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] sonic games and people are still </joey>
<joey> just like </joey>
<joey> i mean the next one might be if you </joey>

<joey> athletes complaining about was how bad </joey>
<connor> the temperature is here oh yeah how bad </connor>
<connor> the heat is it's absolutely brutal poor </connor>
<joey> people doing like triathlons and stuff </joey>
<garnt> and like cross-country cycling and like </garnt>
<garnt> it looks great on tv you can't even tell </garnt>
<garnt> it looks hot like it just looks like oh </garnt>
<garnt> good weather nice yeah it's it's </garnt>
<garnt> disgusting here yeah i mean we talked </garnt>
<garnt> about this last week but the summer here </garnt>
<garnt> is [ __ ] it's insane and just these </garnt>
<connor> poor athletes you have to do like </connor>
<connor> hour-long events in this heat all right </connor>
<joey> right now where we are it is 34 degrees </joey>
<joey> but because of the humidity it feels </joey>
<joey> like 41 degrees it's insane it doesn't </joey>
<garnt> it do be like that like even just </garnt>
<connor> walking from the train station to the </connor>
<garnt> office like it's a nice like brisk 5-10 </garnt>
<connor> minute walk i'm [ __ ] dying time i get </connor>
<connor> it i don't care where you live or what </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] temperature it is no one should </connor>
<joey> be doing sports in 41 [ __ ] celsius no </joey>
<joey> i should be doing a triathlon </joey>
<connor> i don't care if you were raised in the </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] magma crust of this earth i know </connor>
<connor> there's gonna be one comment who's like </connor>
<joey> oh it's 50 right [ __ ] off yeah you're </joey>
<joey> not doing a triathlon 50 degree like oh </joey>
<garnt> my god </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i'm wondering how the [ __ ] are they </garnt>
<garnt> doing this or how how is like anyone </garnt>
<garnt> meant to compete in this weather i </garnt>
<connor> wonder why i'm pretty sure i read </connor>
<connor> something i could be totally totally </connor>
<connor> wrong on this one that apparently they </connor>
<connor> did try and ask uh japan did try and </connor>
<connor> tell them like hey we should do it in </connor>
<connor> like september or something yeah the ioc </connor>
<connor> was like nope no we're doing it in july </connor>
<joey> and of all the sports that are like </joey>
<joey> perfect for this heat aka the swimming </joey>
<garnt> is done indoors yeah so it's like no </garnt>
<garnt> point </garnt>
<garnt> at least do that outside you know feel </garnt>
<connor> good for the athletes </connor>
<connor> yeah jesus i feel i feel bad now i </connor>
<connor> didn't even think about that they must </connor>
<connor> be absolutely dying out there in the </connor>
<connor> heat dude it's brutal </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah but like i mean how how how </connor>
<connor> much is left of the olympics now that we </connor>
<connor> are i don't know not only what days left </connor>
<garnt> where are we because it's been like it's </garnt>
<connor> only like a two-week event isn't that </connor>
<connor> yeah we're on like </connor>
<connor> what yeah yeah [ __ ] or like day 12 or </connor>
<joey> something i thought it was like i </joey>
<joey> thought it was like a couple of months </joey>
<connor> no it has to be done it's like i think </connor>
<joey> one of the rules in the contract with </joey>
<joey> the olympics committed to the local </joey>
<connor> government is that it needs to be done </connor>
<connor> within like two weeks oh wow and no </connor>
<connor> longer no less like it has to </connor>
<joey> why does it feel like every olympics it </joey>
<joey> lasts so much longer than that i think </joey>
<connor> because it's just so stacked because you </connor>
<connor> get so like the hype for it is built up </connor>
<connor> more than any e3 event tenfold yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah any gay any no man's sky wishes </connor>
<connor> that it had this much hype like because </connor>
<connor> everything in in like you know i've </connor>
<connor> we've lived in japan for like two years </connor>
<garnt> now right and since day one since you've </garnt>
<garnt> been here you've been seeing tokyo 2020 </garnt>
<garnt> stuff everywhere like </garnt>
<garnt> it's it's insane like everything is </garnt>
<connor> tokyo 2020 like you can get a chocolate </connor>
<connor> bar tokyo 2020s on it for some reason i </connor>
<joey> don't know why why is this on there we </joey>
<joey> did actually buy uh some tokyo 2020 </joey>
<joey> merchandise just because like oh think </joey>
<connor> about it right like it's one of the few </connor>
<connor> if not the only olympics that has ever </connor>
<connor> had you know been in this like weird </connor>
<connor> world situation where it's been delayed </connor>
<connor> by you yeah right and it's like it's so </connor>
<connor> like telling of itself like i think aki </connor>
<connor> bought a tokyo 2020 face mask like that </connor>
<garnt> 50 years from now is going to be a great </garnt>
<garnt> story to tell </garnt>
<garnt> because it's like you know just to say </garnt>
<garnt> that like yeah we lived through a time </garnt>
<garnt> where there was such like an insane wall </garnt>
<joey> pandemic that we literally had to a </joey>
<joey> cancelled the olympics for a year but b </joey>
<joey> everyone had to [ __ ] wear this for </joey>
<garnt> two years i mean it's it's weird right </garnt>
<garnt> because i feel like this olympics the </garnt>
<garnt> hype just like you talked about the hype </garnt>
<garnt> but i just haven't felt the hype at all </garnt>
<connor> because i think i think last year </connor>
<joey> before covert hit it was the hype was </joey>
<joey> definitely oh yeah oh yeah yeah it was </joey>
<joey> definitely but like i think the moment </joey>
<connor> covered hit and it got pushed back a </connor>
<joey> year is when and then the hype for cove </joey>
<connor> had happened yeah and then i think </connor>
<connor> pretty much the german people just </connor>
<connor> turned against the olympics and they </connor>
<joey> were like we don't want it anymore yeah </joey>
<garnt> even though japan is doing exceedingly </garnt>
<connor> well this olympics as well it's great </connor>
<connor> it's good oh yeah they've won a lot of </connor>
<joey> gold gold medals already yeah they're </joey>
<connor> third right now i think oh [ __ ] okay </connor>
<garnt> yeah they're doing very well see i just </garnt>
<garnt> haven't been following them along as </garnt>
<connor> much as i used to just because </connor>
<connor> i don't know just it like the high like </connor>
<connor> i said the hype just doesn't feel there </connor>
<connor> obviously in japan because </connor>
<connor> no japanese people don't want it to </connor>
<connor> happen for obvious reasons yeah but also </connor>
<garnt> like internationally it just feels like </garnt>
<garnt> there's been a lot less </garnt>
<garnt> talk about it as well you see like the </garnt>
<garnt> odd article you see </garnt>
<garnt> it's been a rough year i think i think </garnt>
<garnt> yeah also like political situations are </garnt>
<connor> getting rough and you're seeing it in </connor>
<joey> the olympics as well yeah it's been it's </joey>
<joey> been in a lot of talks just not for the </joey>
<connor> right reasons yeah it just feels like </connor>
<connor> you know at least like </connor>
<joey> olympics pre i don't know like 2012 2016 </joey>
<joey> maybe not 2016. i don't know didn't feel </joey>
<joey> as like [ __ ] like politically as well </joey>
<joey> yeah i think there's a lot of politics </joey>
<connor> in it now and that always was maybe i </connor>
<joey> was younger and i didn't realize but it </joey>
<connor> just yeah it feels uh very tense </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah i mean the world is you know </joey>
<garnt> in a tense state right now in general so </garnt>
<joey> it definitely just doesn't help </joey>
<garnt> everyone's just on edge now yeah i mean </garnt>
<garnt> like it's it's you know everyone loves </garnt>
<connor> the idea of the olympics just like </connor>
<connor> the every nation gets together and we </connor>
<connor> just play a bunch of sports differences </connor>
<connor> yeah put our differences to size and uh </connor>
<joey> play some </joey>
<joey> games friendly competitions um and you </joey>
<joey> know in any other olympics i feel like </joey>
<joey> that is the case in this olympics it </joey>
<garnt> just feels like nobody really like </garnt>
<garnt> everyone's just forgotten to care </garnt>
<garnt> because everyone's just like can we just </garnt>
<garnt> have the world open back up yeah like </garnt>
<garnt> i see the empty seats there it's it's </garnt>
<joey> reminding me that it's still a </joey>
<connor> depressing situation in the world well </connor>
<joey> most of the world at least so </joey>
<joey> i don't know it's it's it's it's been </joey>
<joey> difficult yeah definitely definitely </joey>
<joey> just wanted to be how has how has </joey>
<joey> who has been winning the olympics i have </joey>
<connor> not been keeping </connor>
<garnt> china's winning right now five well it's </garnt>
<connor> always china and usa at the top right </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah and then japan and then i </connor>
<connor> think australia and britain are like </connor>
<connor> neck and neck yeah like fourth but i i </connor>
<connor> it's hard to tell what's going to happen </connor>
<connor> yeah but i mean china and usa normally </connor>
<connor> always win yeah they're usually the type </connor>
<joey> and then that's like the the cold </joey>
<joey> war-esque thing for them where it </joey>
<connor> matters who wins that yeah that's the </connor>
<joey> friendly competition unless </joey>
<connor> apparently </connor>
<garnt> yeah what's the problem yeah what's the </garnt>
<garnt> ranking so people should probably have </garnt>
<garnt> 30 goals okay uh united states of </garnt>
<garnt> america 25 volts yeah okay japan number </garnt>
<garnt> three with 20 volts nice oh wow </garnt>
<garnt> australia 15 volts let's go </garnt>
<garnt> uh roc republic </garnt>
<joey> that's right oh that's that's russia </joey>
<garnt> that's russia roc is fifth grade region </garnt>
<garnt> six oh okay okay </garnt>
<garnt> yes britain isn't doing too well this </garnt>
<connor> olympics well i like that commentator </connor>
<connor> said man absolute embarrassment for </connor>
<connor> british foreign absolutely absolutely </connor>
<connor> that was one of the events that britain </connor>
<joey> used to win at least somewhat </joey>
<joey> consistently yeah yeah i mean it's i </joey>
<garnt> feel like it's it's it's part of british </garnt>
<joey> culture what are we calling sports </joey>
<connor> that's like one of the things where </connor>
<connor> we're like we actually have like a big </connor>
<garnt> deal about yeah it's like rowing and </garnt>
<garnt> cycling right that we usually cycling we </garnt>
<connor> normally have a really good tournament </connor>
<connor> yeah british people love [ __ ] cycling </connor>
<garnt> for some reason </garnt>
<joey> [Music] </joey>
<connor> meme where it was like britain invented </connor>
<connor> sport gives it to other country they </connor>
<connor> become better and then america's like </connor>
<connor> invent a sport no one plays it become </connor>
<connor> number one </connor>
<connor> that's true that's crazy </connor>

<connor> win the league and it's just very funny </connor>
<connor> oh and it's just insane the lengths they </connor>
<connor> go to get these kids to play football </connor>
<joey> based on a true story i know it's like </joey>
<joey> literally you're following them oh it's </joey>
<joey> like a doggy matrix yeah they just </joey>
<joey> literally pick a school and follow okay </joey>
<joey> okay um yeah that's pretty good on </joey>

<connor> uh super i was about to say superb owl </connor>
<connor> for a second super bowl </connor>
<garnt> super bowl do you feel like it's like </garnt>
<garnt> it's like the most foreign thing on it </garnt>
<connor> like to a british person hearing the </connor>
<connor> word super bowl i'm like what is that </connor>
<garnt> what the hell okay okay so holding up </garnt>
<garnt> you hear about this it's a really big </garnt>
<garnt> ball so so so there's me watching the </garnt>
<connor> super bowl before i watch i shield 21 </connor>
<garnt> and there's watching super bowl after </garnt>
<garnt> i've watched </garnt>
<connor> 21 which is a football manga um and i </connor>
<garnt> still don't know what the [ __ ] is going </garnt>
<garnt> on really really i i kind of get the </garnt>
<garnt> rules well you get the rules now i don't </garnt>
<garnt> understand how the super bowl is formed </garnt>
<connor> how does it become who who gets to play </connor>
<connor> in the super bowl what are the rules </connor>
<garnt> well you just follow you follow the lac </garnt>
<connor> and the lcs right that's exactly the </connor>
<connor> same </connor>
<garnt> yeah they literally based league uh from </garnt>
<connor> like american sports like the super bowl </connor>
<garnt> what about because that's like the final </garnt>
<garnt> right i don't know why it's called the </garnt>
<connor> super bowl </connor>
<connor> it's just one of the playoffs that </connor>
<joey> sounds good i understand the playoffs </joey>
<joey> the playoffs make sense maybe it has to </joey>
<garnt> do maybe it has to do with the playoffs </garnt>
<garnt> lead to the super bowl so the super bowl </garnt>
<connor> is like the </connor>
<connor> the name for the final match yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah british man learns about </connor>
<connor> american football man i don't know this </connor>
<joey> is so fun to me but i only know this </joey>
<joey> because i follow league and league is </joey>
<joey> based on like american football i think </joey>
<joey> it has to do with the name of like the </joey>
<connor> actual like cup you win do you watch </connor>
<connor> american football oh yeah no that's not </connor>
<joey> a baltimore i don't know maybe it is i </joey>
<joey> don't know i mean that's why the ashes </joey>
<joey> are called the ashes right right </joey>
<garnt> dude </garnt>
<garnt> i know more about like the american </garnt>
<garnt> sports system than dude i do i do about </garnt>
<connor> cricket so do you watch american </connor>
<garnt> football </garnt>
<garnt> i mean i i just i watch the super bowl </garnt>
<garnt> and anytime i go to america they're </garnt>
<garnt> always watching football every week and </garnt>
<joey> i pretend to care </joey>
<joey> about it i watch the football in america </joey>
<joey> when it's on tv i don't like willingly </joey>
<joey> go watch it but when it's on i'm like </joey>
<connor> okay that's pretty cool watching like uh </connor>
<connor> normal uh football uh you know you get </connor>
<connor> the ads just in the half time yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> that's when you get the ads yeah no </connor>
<connor> other ads the 40 minutes is straight </connor>
<connor> playing yeah so it's really weird and </connor>
<connor> jarring when i watched american football </connor>
<joey> and every time there's like an attempt i </joey>
<joey> think there's an ad and i was like whoa </joey>
<joey> yeah because there's so many starts and </joey>
<joey> stuff yeah yeah this is stops and of </joey>
<joey> course they put ads there but it's just </joey>
<joey> so jarring i'm like [ __ ] i don't want </joey>
<connor> to hear about [ __ ] cheetos and bud </connor>
<connor> light man i just i can't do this like </connor>
<joey> that's that's literally the two forces </joey>
<garnt> that drive the nfl it was hard to get </garnt>
<connor> invested because every every 10 seconds </connor>
<garnt> there'd be an ad and i was like oh my </garnt>
<garnt> god i mean it's just everything is </garnt>
<connor> monetized yeah and also american sports </connor>
<connor> so watching american tv in american </connor>
<connor> hotels is really weird as well because </connor>
<connor> you know we have our ads before the </connor>
<connor> program starts yeah and in the middle of </connor>
<connor> the program yeah right and when i was </connor>
<connor> watching american tv i don't know if </connor>
<connor> they changed it or what but i was </connor>
<garnt> watching it and </garnt>
<garnt> they let the show play for like two </garnt>
<joey> minutes and then they have an ad and </joey>
<garnt> then they have an app yeah and i'm like </garnt>
<joey> what is this what is this youtube video </joey>
<garnt> what is this </garnt>
<joey> what the [ __ ] is this it's more </joey>
<garnt> consistent than a mid-roll it is they </garnt>
<garnt> they put like two mid-rolls and two end </garnt>
<garnt> rolls because they have they have like </garnt>
<garnt> the intro they have like the clickbait </garnt>
<garnt> intro yeah uh then they have they have </garnt>
<connor> an ad and then the actual intro to the </connor>
<connor> show plays uh half the show plays uh ad </connor>
<connor> second half of the show plays and then </connor>
<connor> they have an ad and then you know that </connor>
<connor> there's like an end credit scene or </connor>
<connor> something like that or i've seen the </connor>
<connor> plays during the credits so they haven't </connor>
<garnt> had and then an end credit scene and </garnt>
<garnt> then it goes on to the next show or </garnt>
<joey> sometimes it's even worse it's sometimes </joey>
<joey> there's the end the end credits start </joey>
<connor> rolling that minimizes into a corner and </connor>
<connor> shows an ad </connor>
<connor> yeah there's like another one that i've </connor>
<joey> seen i'm like am i am i watching an end </joey>
<joey> credit or i'm all watching it i was </joey>
<connor> watching south park and they played </connor>
<connor> legitimately like the first two minutes </connor>
<connor> of the actual episode and then they </connor>
<connor> played an ad </connor>
<connor> right and then they played like 20 </connor>
<garnt> minutes of the episode nearly near the </garnt>
<connor> end right before the end the other ad </connor>
<garnt> yeah right before the end like i'm like </garnt>
<connor> a minute or two before the show finishes </connor>
<garnt> right yeah and for concludes </garnt>
<garnt> and they play an ad and then they play </garnt>
<joey> the the two minutes of the episode and </joey>
<joey> then they don't have a break or anything </joey>
<connor> they immediately start the next episode </connor>
<connor> of south park yeah oh right two minutes </connor>
<connor> of that play and then they play an ad </connor>
<connor> again yeah right right and so it's like </connor>
<joey> it's i was losing my mind i was all in </joey>
<joey> the wrong i was actually getting so </joey>
<joey> angry watching south park because i was </joey>
<joey> like why do they keep putting the ads </joey>
<joey> like this it feels like i'm being </joey>
<connor> bombarded i can't think or straight </connor>
<connor> where is the the clear act of we put an </connor>
<connor> ad in the middle and before the show </connor>
<garnt> yeah when did this go out the window i </garnt>
<garnt> mean it's it's because </garnt>
<joey> viewers are more likely to keep watching </joey>
<joey> the show right </joey>
<garnt> i know why it is i hate it </garnt>
<joey> i hate it from like an entertainment </joey>
<joey> standpoint to be like just let me watch </joey>
<joey> a </joey>
<joey> clear chunk of this one episode have a </joey>
<garnt> clear moment where you know the episode </garnt>
<garnt> ends and the next one begins and that's </garnt>
<joey> where the ad break goes yeah they don't </joey>
<joey> give you a chance to take a pee break in </joey>
<joey> between an episode yeah because they're </joey>
<joey> like oh you might change the channel so </joey>
<joey> we'll just play it immediately first two </joey>
<joey> minutes now you can go where did this </joey>
<garnt> change when was it like this i think </garnt>
<joey> it's always been like this in america </joey>
<joey> has it really yeah i have no idea i mean </joey>
<garnt> ever since every like the first time i </garnt>
<garnt> went to america it was like this and i </garnt>
<garnt> remember that was one of the first thing </garnt>
<garnt> i noticed as well but then you look at </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<connor> how because normally like when you binge </connor>
<connor> watch american tv shows there's like a </connor>
<connor> very clear cut of where they put the ads </connor>
<connor> in and it's just like a weird moment </connor>
<garnt> compared to british tv shows which is </garnt>
<garnt> just beginning halfway through the </garnt>
<garnt> episode than ending yeah we have really </garnt>
<garnt> strict rules on advertising and stuff so </garnt>
<garnt> yeah </garnt>
<connor> there's never any overlays or anything </connor>
<joey> on the t on the program meanwhile </joey>
<joey> japanese tv is like put as many ads in </joey>
<connor> as you possibly can every five years </connor>
<connor> it's so weird the stuff they promote in </connor>
<connor> japan but then then you remember it's </connor>
<connor> for elderly people </connor>
<joey> other people only watch tv so then it </joey>
<connor> all kind of makes sense like they </connor>
<connor> advertise like futons all the time </connor>
<joey> futons yeah the hell kind of shows </joey>
<joey> you're watching just normal like nhk </joey>
<joey> they'll just cut to a futon and there's </joey>
<joey> so </joey>
<joey> so many uh tele telecall shows oh </joey>
<joey> telemarketing shows </joey>
<joey> there's like this entire channel there's </joey>
<joey> like three marketing shows there's like </joey>
<joey> three or four channels basically </joey>
<connor> and it's literally just it's literally </connor>
<connor> whole yeah whole networks and they're </connor>
<connor> not like way back they're like four or </connor>
<connor> five yeah on the the remote and it's </connor>
<connor> just like a whole network dedicated to </connor>
<connor> ads and they show you the product then </connor>
<garnt> you can call up yeah it's literally like </garnt>
<garnt> oh it's like qvc or imagine if qvc was </garnt>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> number five </connor>
<connor> qvc is number 20 in the uk or something </connor>
<joey> right like way way down as it should be </joey>
<connor> it's just ads no one wants to watch that </connor>
<joey> just think of like if the shamwow guy </joey>
<joey> was just constantly promoting different </joey>
<garnt> types of shamwow for 24 hours so it's </garnt>
<joey> just an infomercial channel literally an </joey>
<joey> information there's like three of them </joey>
<joey> and they're like like the top the </joey>
<connor> first 10 shows or something yeah </connor>
<connor> i could be chatting on my ass honestly </connor>
<garnt> there's a lot of them </garnt>
<garnt> i mean i can kind of see why there would </garnt>
<garnt> be so many infomercial kind of channels </garnt>
<garnt> because i don't know like old people </garnt>
<connor> don't use the internet to buy things </connor>
<garnt> yeah they don't know what it is </garnt>
<garnt> so when you when you're a kid right </garnt>
<garnt> and you had a sick day okay so i </garnt>
<garnt> remember i remember i remember as a kid </garnt>
<connor> you know you'd enjoy the fact that you </connor>
<connor> had a sick day because great i don't </connor>
<connor> have to go to school but what do you do </connor>
<connor> so back when i was a kid i did had </connor>
<connor> nothing but just had television right </connor>
<connor> yeah so you had the morning tv shows </connor>
<connor> you had cbbc when i was growing up and </connor>
<connor> then it was like it was like between </connor>
<connor> 8 a.m to i think around 10 a.m which was </connor>
<connor> just like brilliant i'm sick i get to </connor>
<connor> watch tv programs for as long as i stay </connor>
<connor> home and then 10 a.m hits and then there </connor>
<garnt> is just nothing to [ __ ] watch like </garnt>
<garnt> there is nothing on tv at all and i </garnt>
<garnt> remember i'd just be like great i guess </garnt>
<garnt> i'll just [ __ ] put on kvc then </garnt>
<garnt> because there's literally like nothing </garnt>
<connor> else interesting like jeremy kyle back </connor>
<garnt> then you could watch i didn't get jerry </garnt>
<garnt> michael i was like a [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> seven-year-old i loved it i loved the </connor>
<connor> shouting and stuff and all the people </connor>
<joey> jumping around i loved it yeah well i </joey>
<joey> think it's because like during like </joey>
<connor> weekdays at you know in </connor>
<connor> the middle of the day yeah the only </connor>
<connor> people who are watching tv is like </connor>
<joey> anywhere below eight and anywhere above </joey>
<garnt> 80 right because everyone else is at </garnt>
<garnt> work or school yeah cause like if i </garnt>
<garnt> can't watch something entertaining at </garnt>
<garnt> least like watch some like shiny </garnt>
<garnt> products that was that's how like my </garnt>
<connor> brain worked right you're like oh if i </connor>
<garnt> can't watch something i mean it'll be </garnt>
<connor> advertised too yeah yeah i may as well </connor>
<garnt> mom we have to get this diamond necklace </garnt>
<connor> the guy on the tv said we get three if </connor>
<connor> we purchase one </connor>
<joey> god </joey>
<connor> because i like i remember seeing all </connor>
<connor> those like infomercial stuff during </connor>
<connor> childhood and </connor>
<joey> even like 10 year old me was watching </joey>
<joey> and i was like who the [ __ ] buying </joey>
<joey> this like who's </joey>
<connor> who is buying this [ __ ] my permanent </connor>
<garnt> favorite thing of those is that like you </garnt>
<garnt> know so they're advertising the product </garnt>
<garnt> it looks fantastic yeah you're like wow </garnt>
<garnt> this is this looks great yeah it's a mop </garnt>
<connor> that cleans my floor and it cleans </connor>
<connor> itself this is fantastic and you're like </connor>
<connor> great i'm already sold and you get to </connor>
<connor> the end it's like but if you act now you </connor>
<connor> can get not one not two but three extra </connor>
<connor> mob and you're like whoa this is just </connor>
<garnt> too many mobs i only wanted the one that </garnt>
<garnt> now you have a second three and if you </garnt>
<garnt> buy now on this exact moment you get two </garnt>
<garnt> extra days free shipping it's like all </garnt>
<garnt> right this is this is just ridiculous </garnt>
<garnt> they keep throwing things in like and if </garnt>
<connor> you pay by card we'll come to your house </connor>
<connor> and install it for you yeah it's like </connor>
<connor> whoa whoa whoa and then and then and </connor>
<connor> then the program will end and then you </connor>
<connor> can tell they've done this because they </connor>
<connor> did it all the [ __ ] time they would </connor>
<connor> record an extra bit after it it clearly </connor>
<connor> didn't sell well enough whatever yeah </connor>
<connor> and it would cut you another pit and it </connor>
<connor> would be like but but [ __ ] that part if </connor>
<connor> you buy now you'll get five instead of </connor>
<connor> three only for today yeah it's like what </connor>
<connor> is good what's going on i'm always </connor>
<joey> losing my [ __ ] money literally just </joey>
<joey> like keep adding on [ __ ] and it's always </joey>
<garnt> like it needs to be now that you call it </garnt>
<joey> like before the next thing comes in you </joey>
<garnt> need to so like there's people probably </garnt>
<joey> just like sitting there just like </joey>
<connor> waiting to call it like there's another </connor>
<joey> thing </joey>
<joey> half the time can i call it now because </joey>
<joey> i was sold before and now now they're </joey>
<connor> just raising my concerns because this is </connor>
<connor> now too much this is just like too good </connor>
<connor> to be true yeah now it's too much this </connor>
<connor> is way too many products yeah yeah i was </connor>
<connor> sold on the 50 pan and now you tell me </connor>
<garnt> you're going to include three pens no </garnt>
<connor> way this is a cast iron yeah it should </connor>
<connor> not be costing ten dollars per pen </connor>
<garnt> including shipping this is rejected </garnt>
<garnt> what what's what like set me off was </garnt>
<garnt> when they would introduce like when they </garnt>
<connor> would include a product that had like </connor>
<connor> nothing to do with the product that they </connor>
<connor> were advertising yeah but they just like </connor>
<garnt> tacked it on for free yeah like where </garnt>
<connor> did this come from </connor>
<connor> you get the jewelry and now we're </connor>
<garnt> throwing in an extra tenga on top like </garnt>
<connor> well </connor>
<connor> this is totally unrelated </connor>
<garnt> all this is worth three hundred dollars </garnt>
<garnt> but we're selling it for thirty dollars </garnt>
<joey> it's like is it really really </joey>
<joey> there's no way all of these companies </joey>
<joey> are making money yeah exactly </joey>
<joey> i'm pretty sure i saw this thing that </joey>
<joey> you're tacking on yesterday's commercial </joey>
<connor> so it clearly didn't sell well you had </connor>
<connor> like a golden age because like i felt </connor>
<connor> like there was a time when the products </connor>
<connor> were actually semi-decent yeah like that </connor>
<connor> you'd go to the supermarket you'd </connor>
<connor> actually see the section of yeah as seen </connor>
<connor> on tv products and there were some of </connor>
<connor> them actually like pretty good well i </connor>
<joey> mean like look how much the [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> shamwell sold right like that started i </joey>
<garnt> think it was just before the internet </garnt>
<connor> was invented so like now you can just </connor>
<joey> search up whatever product you kind of </joey>
<connor> need and if not then japan has a whole </connor>
<connor> store for them it's called [ __ ] daiso </connor>
<garnt> yeah so like you just walk into daiso </garnt>
<garnt> and then you just you you you find </garnt>
<garnt> products that you never knew you needed </garnt>
<joey> until you walked into this i need a sign </joey>
<joey> now that just says as seen on dice </joey>
<garnt> like japan is just like the king of </garnt>
<garnt> creating these little devices which have </garnt>
<garnt> just like exactly one use one very very </garnt>
<garnt> specific use that you never thought </garnt>
<garnt> about until you see it in the store and </garnt>
<garnt> just like wow i guess i guess i do need </garnt>
<garnt> like gloves that can like clean </garnt>
<garnt> dishes at the same time i like what i </garnt>
<connor> like </connor>
<joey> there's a lot of stuff i guess i do need </joey>
<joey> slippers that have like mops on them so </joey>
<joey> that i can like walk around while </joey>
<garnt> mopping the house </garnt>
<garnt> i guess that's a thing it's only 200 yen </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] it i'll take it yeah why not </garnt>
<joey> meanwhile if i saw that on tv i'll be </joey>
<garnt> like who the [ __ ] is this yeah he's like </garnt>
<garnt> who needs some slippers </garnt>
<connor> they also like it's like a 100 yen store </connor>
<connor> so like less than a dollar even like </connor>
<connor> it's around a dollar but your standard </connor>
<connor> and like my favorite thing is that </connor>
<connor> sometimes in daiso they'll have </connor>
<connor> the same product but different brands </connor>
<connor> and they're all the same price i'm just </connor>
<connor> like what is this like why if you're </connor>
<connor> gonna if you're gonna have your </connor>
<connor> competitor right next to you for the </connor>
<connor> same price and i what i think is the </connor>
<connor> same quality what is the purpose of this </connor>
<joey> well there's clearly not much kind of </joey>
<connor> tradition </connor>
<joey> there's completely there's obviously not </joey>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> like dragon's den would never work for </garnt>
<garnt> japan because you get the ceo of daiso </garnt>
<garnt> there and he'll just say yes to every </garnt>
<garnt> idea </garnt>
<garnt> he's gonna he'll be like i'll put in an </garnt>
<connor> offer i'm putting in an offer just opens </connor>
<connor> his mouth i'm sold i don't even wanna </connor>
<connor> hear it </connor>
<connor> or putting it in my store </connor>
<connor> i could imagine dragon said in the uk </connor>
<connor> they would they they have like 10 </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] minutes introducing each other </connor>
<connor> before they even actually start the </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] pitch </connor>
<connor> business cards </connor>
<connor> [Laughter] </connor>
<connor> the person pitching would have to go and </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] pour in water and everything </connor>
<connor> like it's like they can't even start and </connor>
<connor> oh my god </connor>
<garnt> jesus they'd have to start with like a </garnt>
<connor> board meeting or something before they </connor>
<connor> could even get in the room could you </connor>
<connor> imagine they they </connor>
<connor> people being pitched would be like no we </connor>
<connor> know exactly what's happening i want to </connor>
<connor> see the script of the man pitching </connor>
<connor> before he pitches it you know it's like </connor>
<connor> insane </connor>
<garnt> i would love to see it actually but what </garnt>
<garnt> i never understood about those shows is </garnt>
<garnt> that it's it's just like </garnt>
<garnt> it's sold as you know it's these are </garnt>
<garnt> very real businesses and very real ideas </garnt>
<garnt> that some of them actually going to be </garnt>
<garnt> successful and stuff right but like you </garnt>
<garnt> you look at some of the people going on </garnt>
<garnt> and you're just like okay i've watched </garnt>
<garnt> dragons then before or like shark tank </garnt>
<garnt> which is the american version right it's </garnt>
<garnt> there's there's like a very simple </garnt>
<garnt> formula there's like very specific </garnt>
<garnt> questions that all the dragons ask every </garnt>
<garnt> single [ __ ] time </garnt>
<garnt> and somehow 90 of the contestants never </garnt>
<joey> know their [ __ ] numbers like i think </joey>
<joey> surely that's the first thing you do if </joey>
<garnt> you if you figure out you're going on </garnt>
<joey> dragons denver you're like all right let </joey>
<garnt> me just figure out my [ __ ] profit </garnt>
<connor> margins yeah that's literally the first </connor>
<connor> thing you should do yeah like what's </connor>
<joey> your gross like sorry about it </joey>
<joey> i'm not gross thank you very much </joey>
<connor> they're like they're asking like what is </connor>
<connor> your target audience or whatever maybe i </connor>
<connor> don't know people </connor>
<connor> [Music] </connor>
<connor> people with money i saw this water clear </connor>
<connor> but it may be [ __ ] laughing from the </connor>
<connor> british one </connor>
<connor> it's from the guy who's like the worst </connor>
<garnt> he's like so what is he called is he </garnt>
<garnt> called tuka tuka </garnt>
<garnt> sounds like a breaking bad character </garnt>
<connor> yeah right he's like he's like the guy </connor>
<connor> who like all the other dragons hate on </connor>
<connor> the swamp and uh it's just a great </connor>
<connor> moment he is he's pitching the offer to </connor>
<garnt> them he's like okay so i'm gonna give </garnt>
<garnt> you the fifty thousand pounds you asked </garnt>
<connor> for i've seen this for for ninety </connor>
<garnt> percent of the business what and then </garnt>
<connor> the dragons were like so all of the </connor>
<connor> business so you said you're trying to </connor>
<connor> buy the business off of him </connor>
<joey> like what's the remaining ten percent </joey>
<garnt> you can't do anything </garnt>
<garnt> i remember so so like the first thing he </garnt>
<garnt> was pitching to was like sweat you </garnt>
<garnt> you're so who are you giving the money </garnt>
<garnt> to and he's like i'm giving the money to </garnt>
<garnt> the business and he was like but you own </garnt>
<garnt> 90 percent of the business </garnt>
<garnt> so you're giving the money to yourself </garnt>
<connor> it was so good and all the other dragons </connor>
<connor> are like what the [ __ ] bro </connor>
<connor> what the [ __ ] is this </connor>
<connor> ultimate money laundering </connor>
<connor> but imagine if you got to accept like </connor>
<connor> sharp dragons shut up this genie is </connor>
<connor> going to agree to it </connor>
<joey> oh my god it's like </joey>
<joey> like what is this like these supposed to </joey>
<joey> be professional like </joey>
<joey> half these sometimes you see the dragons </joey>
<joey> right you're like </joey>
<garnt> you're not a [ __ ] good businessman </garnt>
<garnt> you just got really [ __ ] lucky with </garnt>
<garnt> one business and managed to convince </garnt>
<connor> this [ __ ] tv show to let you off yeah </connor>
<garnt> some of them have no [ __ ] idea what </garnt>
<connor> they're doing i swear </connor>
<connor> they'll be like they'll be like yeah </connor>
<connor> he's got a multi-million dollar business </connor>
<connor> then when you think about businesses </connor>
<connor> multi-million dollar business is </connor>
<connor> actually not that difficult no </connor>
<garnt> it's yeah because it's it's it's so </garnt>
<garnt> stark the contrast between like shark </garnt>
<garnt> tank and dragon's den dragon like shark </garnt>
<connor> tank have like mark cuban and like </connor>
<garnt> full-on like [ __ ] billionaires really </garnt>
<connor> really really you really like really </connor>
<connor> really stupid people yeah super super </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] wealthy and then compared to </garnt>
<garnt> like the dragons it's </garnt>
<connor> it's i think half the dragons are like </connor>
<connor> pretty successful but they they've had </connor>
<connor> trouble like keeping the seats filled </connor>
<connor> right and they always bring in people </connor>
<connor> and a lot of the time they've had like </connor>
<connor> businesses they just sold and made like </connor>
<connor> four million which is obviously a [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> ton of money nothing me wrong but we're </connor>
<connor> talking businesses you know it's not </connor>
<connor> really a good in the business well four </connor>
<joey> million yeah </joey>
<connor> i wouldn't say it's a hardcore proven </connor>
<joey> track record that you know how to run a </joey>
<joey> business hundred percent you know what i </joey>
<joey> mean yeah </joey>
<joey> all right you might have got lucky here </joey>
<joey> and there you had a good idea it's like </joey>
<joey> it doesn't prove that you i don't think </joey>
<joey> that's good enough where you can go on </joey>
<joey> and start telling people how to run </joey>
<joey> their businesses you know what i mean </joey>
<joey> like personally yeah i get it i guess i </joey>
<connor> i was just kind of like all right okay </connor>
<connor> all right they'd introduce them maybe </connor>
<connor> like he made two million dollars off of </connor>
<connor> his online card business and i'm like </connor>
<connor> what what is that </connor>
<connor> what that's never even heard of it's </connor>
<connor> hardly a business </connor>
<connor> oh how am i kidding i'm insulting them </connor>
<connor> two million dollars </connor>
<connor> child's play i don't know i just when </connor>
<connor> you when you you know we're talking a </connor>
<connor> lot of businesses here that's that's not </connor>
<connor> it's not that much in business well yeah </connor>
<joey> in the business world it's not that much </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah yeah in layman's terms it is </connor>
<connor> well yeah i think that's how the show </connor>
<joey> works is that so most people watching </joey>
<joey> the the show in the uk obviously a </joey>
<joey> million pounds </joey>
<joey> two million pounds that's [ __ ] insane </joey>
<joey> yeah most people can't comprehend that </joey>
<joey> yeah but you know when you work with </joey>
<connor> some businesses and stuff and you </connor>
<connor> understand the margins they're working </connor>
<connor> with that's not that much </connor>
<connor> but i guess it doesn't matter it's tv at </connor>
<connor> the end of the day they're not actually </connor>
<connor> trying to like it's not actually trying </connor>
<connor> to give good business but it's like a </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] tv </garnt>
<garnt> yeah if they did people would know what </garnt>
<garnt> like a [ __ ] their net profit is and </garnt>
<connor> their margins are yeah i swear some of </connor>
<connor> the british ones are like staged i they </connor>
<connor> must </connor>
<garnt> no way some of the stuff because there's </garnt>
<garnt> one time there there's like a pyramid </garnt>
<garnt> scheme come on </garnt>
<garnt> on the british tv show like a guy came </garnt>
<garnt> in </garnt>
<garnt> who just advertised a ponzi scheme right </garnt>
<garnt> and they were like </garnt>
<connor> yeah and the dragons were like this </connor>
<connor> sounds awfully a lot like a pyramid </connor>
<connor> scheme </connor>

<garnt> about mothers not true but you do give a </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] about pokemon yeah but there's uh i </garnt>
<joey> don't know if you've heard but uh </joey>
<connor> there's about 100 other pokemon games </connor>
<joey> out there </joey>
<connor> that i could also play </connor>
<joey> but uh yeah i don't know like i saw like </joey>
<connor> a piece of news on twitter i don't know </connor>
<connor> how true this is but uh like i think it </connor>
<connor> was like </connor>
<connor> day two or day three that pokemon unite </connor>
<connor> came out and the league players were </connor>
<connor> like oh ho what's this and then they </connor>
<joey> invaded it and now apparently it's just </joey>
<joey> full of uh it's either you're versing </joey>
<joey> children who are eight years old or </joey>
<joey> you're versing league players </joey>
<garnt> like that sounds like a terrible place </garnt>
<joey> it just sounds like league 2.0 yeah so </joey>
<joey> i'm like no i like you pokemon but no </joey>
<connor> thank you yeah the games are either very </connor>
<connor> fun or not fun at all right you either </connor>
<garnt> get like stomped or you don't as a as a </garnt>
<garnt> gamer and a moba player how did you find </garnt>
<joey> it as a toxic gamer how do you feel </joey>
<connor> toxic playing games yeah as you talk to </connor>
<garnt> gamer i i enjoyed it i didn't like the </garnt>
<garnt> fact that i couldn't racially slow </garnt>
<connor> within 10 seconds of getting in the game </connor>
<connor> uh obviously that was very unfortunate </connor>
<connor> of course yeah there's no chat feature </connor>
<connor> there's actually voice chat apparently </connor>
<connor> is there apparently i don't know how you </connor>
<garnt> could you have to get you have to you </garnt>
<connor> have to hook up the mic through </connor>
<connor> nintendo's like [ __ ] way of doing it </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah i saw a voice chat option on </joey>
<joey> the game oh yeah no i have done that </joey>
<joey> through animal crossing actually oh and </joey>
<connor> it does not work so there is a chance </connor>
<connor> that if you're a league player you could </connor>
<connor> say something horrible to that </connor>
<joey> ten-year-old kid right </joey>
<joey> no i'm kidding obviously but i mean uh </joey>
<joey> yeah it's it's it's fine it's weird it </joey>
<joey> it it's it's pokemon but it definitely </joey>
<connor> feels like it's been developed not by </connor>
<connor> nintendo right like you can so has it </connor>
<garnt> been developed by nintendo no it's by </garnt>
<garnt> tencent oh </garnt>
<connor> of course of course of course it has </connor>
<connor> like i guess a monopoly on mobas yeah um </connor>
<garnt> yeah it's like it's weird man it's it's </garnt>
<garnt> like when you haven't seen that family </garnt>
<garnt> member in like 10 years and he comes </garnt>
<joey> back and he's really weird and he's like </joey>
<joey> yeah i'm the same guy right you're like </joey>
<connor> no no what is this you're not the same </connor>
<connor> person you're right right it's like you </connor>
<connor> know you you boot it up there's there's </connor>
<joey> gacha there's loot boxes oh that's you </joey>
<garnt> can buy gems it's like oh my god this </garnt>
<joey> isn't pokemon what is this nintendo </joey>
<garnt> micro transaction </garnt>
<garnt> yeah nintendo's been real comfortable </garnt>
<garnt> with those micro transactions lately </garnt>
<connor> been getting real comfortable with those </connor>
<garnt> loot boxes all right okay yeah i mean </garnt>
<garnt> like i haven't played pokemon unite but </garnt>
<garnt> i've seen like clips looked into it and </garnt>
<garnt> it just it it's so weird where did this </garnt>
<garnt> come from was this announced a while ago </garnt>
<garnt> because like the the whole idea of like </garnt>
<joey> a pokemon moba is just like </joey>
<garnt> how how did this happen when i think </garnt>
<joey> pokemon i don't think league of legends </joey>
<joey> dota well i mean pokemon well people </joey>
<joey> thought of that about pokemon when </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] pokken came out right like </connor>
<connor> people are like wait what </connor>
<connor> pokemon yeah which is a great game now </connor>
<connor> right but i remember when it was first </connor>
<joey> announced people were like this looks </joey>
<connor> horrible this this just i thought it </connor>
<connor> looked epic when it came out no i </connor>
<joey> thought it looked epic but i saw a lot </joey>
<joey> of people who are like that doesn't work </joey>
<connor> i don't know there's just something sad </connor>
<joey> there's something sad about seeing </joey>
<connor> a child's game by nintendo like this </connor>
<connor> that's just shoved full of these </connor>
<connor> egregious microtransactions yeah yeah </connor>
<joey> sure but i mean you know it's whatever </joey>
<connor> you can have a different opinion on it i </connor>
<joey> don't really give a [ __ ] i don't </joey>
<joey> so have you pulled for the gotcha yet uh </joey>
<connor> yeah techtone i played with a friend of </connor>
<connor> ours and he was like he was </connor>
<connor> he was </connor>
<garnt> and he's a he is a </garnt>
<garnt> whale that is pretty much his job yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and with without love </garnt>
<garnt> yeah within five minutes he was like </garnt>
<garnt> spend a hundred bucks just spend a </garnt>
<garnt> hundred bucks just get everything just </garnt>
<connor> unlock everything he's like and i'm like </connor>
<connor> no i'm not gonna do that and he's like </connor>
<connor> i'll give you a hundred bucks just spend </connor>
<connor> it right now and i was like what the </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> this man when it comes to gotcha this </joey>
<joey> man like loses all sense of money yeah </joey>
<connor> he has no </connor>
<connor> he has no way of holding back but i </connor>
<connor> respect it you know oh yeah of course </connor>
<garnt> but i i just didn't want it because i </garnt>
<garnt> could tell that i i i ended up spending </garnt>
<garnt> like 40 bucks on it and i was like i'm </garnt>
<garnt> not going to play this again but i'm </garnt>
<garnt> going to do it so i can play ranked </garnt>
<garnt> right is it free to play yeah okay </garnt>
<connor> there's there's an excuse it can't </connor>
<garnt> there's no </garnt>
<garnt> i was </garnt>
<garnt> you said you spent 40 bucks which is </garnt>
<joey> like free to play is the road to losing </joey>
<joey> items you can buy that'll uh boost your </joey>
<garnt> stats in-game </garnt>
<joey> so you can actually it's not it's kind </joey>
<garnt> of like the way to win </garnt>
<garnt> the way it was explained to me and i the </garnt>
<garnt> way i understand it is that you know how </garnt>
<garnt> like league of legends used to have a </garnt>
<garnt> thing called runes yeah that </garnt>
<garnt> weren't pay to win they would give you </garnt>
<garnt> an edge but you could unlock them </garnt>
<garnt> through the game yeah but </garnt>
<garnt> they give you </garnt>
<garnt> a noticeable advantage i'd say at times </garnt>
<garnt> um but would you like back in the days </garnt>
<garnt> you to buy runes remember yeah would you </garnt>
<garnt> have described ruins as pay to win back </garnt>
<garnt> then it's kind of like that i mean it's </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> with the advantages that roon runes gave </garnt>
<garnt> back in the day you wouldn't be able to </garnt>
<garnt> take advantage of that small stat </garnt>
<garnt> increase unless you unless you're at </garnt>
<garnt> like the [ __ ] higher tier it's kind </garnt>
<connor> of like he's truly optimized the games </connor>
<connor> just came out and no one no one's been </connor>
<connor> had the time to underground to get this </connor>
<connor> stuff so if you do just buy it you do </connor>
<connor> get an advantage it's not massive but </connor>
<connor> you get an advantage um i don't know how </connor>
<connor> big it is i mean from what i understand </connor>
<connor> it's not that much it is i mean </connor>
<connor> obviously any advantages should be a big </connor>
<garnt> no-no in video games i think yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> but especially a children's game as well </garnt>
<connor> it's like you know what's next [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> tetris with the microphone's actions in </joey>
<joey> it like well i mean you know technically </joey>
<joey> speaking that's it's not the first </joey>
<joey> pokemon game with micro transactions </joey>
<joey> right i remember pokemon go back in the </joey>
<connor> day yeah and even then i felt like that </connor>
<connor> was like it's weird man yeah it's </connor>
<connor> strange i feel like nintendo they're </connor>
<connor> like well if another company develops it </connor>
<joey> it's not us </joey>
<joey> that is true that's true pokemon was </joey>
<joey> also not them yeah but they don't but </joey>
<joey> then nintendo also does weird other </joey>
<joey> microtransactions or uh brand </joey>
<joey> partnerships like they're [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> mercedes and mario kart 8. oh yeah yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah mercedes </joey>
<joey> what was going on with that what how did </joey>
<joey> what what i thought it was like a joke </joey>
<joey> that someone at the dev team threw in </joey>
<joey> then i realized oh no it's an actual </joey>
<joey> brand like </joey>
<connor> how did this happen what's going on and </connor>
<joey> she battles me i mean i pick it up every </joey>
<connor> time i play mario kart just because it's </connor>
<connor> hilarious yeah it looks so stupid baby </connor>
<connor> mario in a mercedes yeah just a full </connor>
<connor> mercedes </connor>
<garnt> i've never played mario kart 8 so i this </garnt>
<joey> is the first time i'm hearing it's like </joey>
<joey> a dead ass </joey>
<connor> three mercedes cars and it's just it's </connor>
<joey> just hilarious to see baby </joey>
<connor> i don't know </connor>
<garnt> it's just in the game in the game always </garnt>
<garnt> since release it's not even like an </garnt>
<garnt> unlockable it's just there by default </garnt>
<garnt> you can just pick a mercedes if you want </garnt>
<garnt> what yeah you didn't know this i thought </garnt>
<garnt> you guys were membing </garnt>
<garnt> it's a straight up mercedes </garnt>
<joey> what the [ __ ] is going on </joey>
<joey> like when you select the car as well it </joey>
<garnt> literally says mercedes where does this </garnt>
<garnt> fit in the [ __ ] mario lore how how </garnt>
<joey> did this happen well you know if you </joey>
<joey> know mario was like i'm sick of going </joey>
<connor> through all these levels let me just hop </connor>
<connor> in my mercedes </connor>
<connor> over all the enemies </connor>
<connor> you know at least ea you know you're </connor>
<connor> getting into you know i mean nintendo i </connor>
<connor> can't figure out what the [ __ ] they're </connor>
<connor> trying to do i don't know what they're </connor>
<joey> doing everything they're trying to do </joey>
<connor> everything man this is bizarre yeah i </connor>
<connor> mean i get it whatever i mean good on </connor>
<joey> them i guess man i just think i get that </joey>
<garnt> grinder get that coin man i just think </garnt>
<garnt> unfortunately like uh microtransactions </garnt>
<garnt> is just like kind of creeping its way </garnt>
<connor> into the future of gaming because it's </connor>
<connor> just yeah it was just sad because </connor>
<joey> nintendo obviously was the one company </joey>
<joey> that for a long time was like no i don't </joey>
<joey> know yeah </joey>
<connor> but then now they're like yes yes yes </connor>
<garnt> yes yeah </garnt>
<connor> because like genji's come along and just </connor>
<connor> prove like how much [ __ ] money there </connor>
<connor> is to spend on anime wi-fi apparently </connor>
<joey> yeah it's like it's it's ridiculous </joey>
<joey> because i remember i watched the uh i </joey>
<connor> watched the live stream of the new </connor>
<connor> genshin announcement for like the 2.0 in </connor>
<joey> azuba where they announced the new area </joey>
<joey> and i think it was getting like almost </joey>
<joey> 400 000 people 400 000 people on twitch </joey>
<joey> on twitch not youtube twitch live </joey>
<joey> concurrent which is like how much does </joey>
<joey> like press conferences on on like ea or </joey>
<joey> like press conference like e3 and stuff </joey>
<joey> get it's not that much like 100 100k max </joey>
<joey> yeah it gets like 100k 200k maybe like </joey>
<joey> this again shin update </joey>
<garnt> stream was getting 400k viewers </garnt>
<garnt> concurrent on twitch which might be the </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] is going on which mind you or a lot </joey>
<joey> of the stuff that they announced had </joey>
<connor> already been leaked </connor>
<joey> as well so it's like people are like </joey>
<joey> tuning in to like look at lead ship i </joey>
<connor> mean like it's confirmed i guess yeah i </connor>
<connor> mean i i'm sure if i was a fan i would </connor>
<connor> get behind the high field yeah i'd be </connor>
<joey> very happy for it </joey>
<joey> i mean yeah i mean you know obviously it </joey>
<joey> did very well for them right like yeah </joey>
<connor> but yeah it just blew me away because </connor>
<joey> like i was like oh there's a game </joey>
<joey> shooting stream happening yeah 400 000 </joey>
<joey> people </joey>
<joey> sitting there waiting for a [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> update like are you serious and now </connor>
<connor> more gacha </connor>
<connor> yes </connor>
<connor> more waifus </connor>
<garnt> yeah i mean like i haven't haven't </garnt>
<garnt> gotten back into against you and i've </garnt>
<joey> been thinking about it because of a new </joey>
<garnt> area but you know even like out of the </garnt>
<joey> three of us the person who was most of </joey>
<joey> the integrity was probably me and now </joey>
<garnt> she's like that's this is a lot of </garnt>
<garnt> people watching an anime anime waifu </garnt>
<joey> game right now could you imagine if like </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] like if like fake grand order </joey>
<joey> had an update and there was 400 000 </joey>
<joey> people like watching i don't know </joey>
<garnt> don't do that to me </garnt>
<garnt> don't give me hope </garnt>
<connor> is genji in like is it </connor>
<connor> i'm sorry is it majority played on </connor>
<connor> mobile or pc i'm assuming pc i'm </connor>
<garnt> it would be more majority pc i mean i </garnt>
<joey> think so right yeah because i i i did </joey>
<garnt> not have a fun time playing gen channel </garnt>
<garnt> mobile um at all i think i think some </garnt>
<garnt> people just played on both like when </garnt>
<garnt> they're home they're playing on pc but </garnt>
<joey> sometimes you know they got to get on </joey>
<joey> that grind while on the go well i think </joey>
<garnt> i think that's </garnt>
<garnt> one of like the biggest advantages that </garnt>
<connor> genshin has over like a lot of triple a </connor>
<connor> games which is the fact that it's so </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] easy to play yeah you know you </connor>
<connor> you literally like every account is </connor>
<joey> linked and now you can like even link </joey>
<connor> your ps4 account to like every other </connor>
<connor> account so it's just it just makes it </connor>
<connor> like ridiculous is it on the switch as </connor>
<garnt> well it's not yes </garnt>
<connor> it does it does i mean is it on the </connor>
<connor> switch yeah and apparently there's a </connor>
<connor> full </connor>
<connor> [Laughter] </connor>
<garnt> this is the problem when i'm a fan of a </garnt>
<connor> lot of things i also end up promoting </connor>
<connor> unfortunately i've fully disconnected </connor>
<connor> myself from gaming hype i don't get </connor>
<connor> hyped about games anymore i don't know </connor>
<connor> if that means no happiness for me but </connor>
<connor> i've i've just stopped getting hyped and </connor>
<connor> i've stopped watching announcements i </connor>
<joey> think i've just stopped getting hyped </joey>
<connor> about things in general because i've </connor>
<connor> just </connor>
<connor> because like </connor>
<joey> that's a little </joey>
<joey> because i've ran into so many situations </joey>
<connor> where i just get hyped and i either </connor>
<connor> experience hype fatigue </connor>
<connor> or </connor>
<garnt> fatigue </garnt>
<garnt> fatigue </garnt>
<connor> so i had to experience height fatigue or </connor>
<connor> i just </connor>
<connor> end up getting disappointed with the </connor>
<garnt> final result right and i'm just like oh </garnt>
<garnt> well then what the [ __ ] you know give me </garnt>
<garnt> back my hype all right yeah so now let </garnt>
<garnt> me pack my </garnt>
<garnt> still waiting for my cyberpunk hype </garnt>
<connor> refund like i'm i'm firmly of the </connor>
<connor> mindset you should never pre-order a </connor>
<connor> game ever no no never no no matter how </connor>
<connor> good or 100 it looks like amazing or the </connor>
<connor> bonus deals don't do it it's a bad </connor>
<connor> practice and i think it's bad for gaming </connor>
<connor> it is here we go here we go for gaming </connor>
<garnt> man it's sharks </garnt>
<garnt> i mean it's it because like i'm not into </garnt>
<connor> gaming as much as i used to be and even </connor>
<connor> back then i just i don't think i've ever </connor>
<connor> pre-ordered a game or at least like i </connor>
<connor> think the only game i ever tried </connor>
<garnt> pre-ordering was gta but that was just </garnt>
<connor> like because it was gta oh yeah do you </connor>
<joey> remember like it was like 2 000 picture </joey>
<joey> 2013 everything is a pre-order bonus </joey>
<joey> yeah literally like everything is </joey>
<joey> pre-order like no everyone is </joey>
<connor> pre-ordering everything that's just how </connor>
<connor> it is you pre-order [ __ ] everything </connor>
<connor> but luckily now everyone's chilled out </connor>
<garnt> but it was insane but i also think kind </garnt>
<garnt> of back then it made more sense right </garnt>
<garnt> because back then the game you're buying </garnt>
<garnt> on the day was the game you were getting </garnt>
<garnt> right there was no updates no patches no </garnt>
<connor> nothing and it also made more sense </connor>
<connor> because we it's just i think it really </connor>
<joey> hit its peak right before </joey>
<joey> maybe just during online shopping </joey>
<joey> started popping up yeah right right you </joey>
<garnt> know and this is before when you didn't </garnt>
<garnt> really want to download it because </garnt>
<connor> people's internet speeds probably </connor>
<connor> weren't good enough to really get </connor>
<joey> download a full 20 gigabyte game yeah </joey>
<joey> like that but now you know people's </joey>
<garnt> internet speeds it's not really a </garnt>
<garnt> problem yeah and also back then i feel </garnt>
<connor> like you just had a lot less choice of </connor>
<connor> what games you could play you know as a </connor>
<connor> kid i'm just like yeah i waited like </connor>
<connor> four [ __ ] five months for the new </connor>
<connor> mario game because there was nothing </connor>
<joey> else to look forward to there was </joey>
<joey> literally nothing to fulfill that void i </joey>
<joey> couldn't i couldn't get a free-to-play </joey>
<joey> game like genji </joey>
<joey> playing games </joey>
<joey> like fortnite or league of legends or </joey>
<garnt> anything like that there's nothing to </garnt>
<joey> fill that fill up that void the only </joey>
<joey> games that i've pre-ordered are the ones </joey>
<joey> that like i know 100 i'm going to love </joey>
<connor> i've ordered every single like mario </connor>
<connor> release of late and i haven't played any </connor>
<connor> of them </connor>
<joey> well that sounds like your problem i </joey>
<connor> don't know why </connor>
<joey> because i think the last game i </joey>
<joey> pre-ordered was uh final fantasy 7r but </joey>
<joey> i 100 of that because i knew i was going </joey>
<joey> to like it because i liked the original </joey>
<joey> and like persona 5 royal as well i </joey>
<joey> pre-ordered that because yeah i liked </joey>
<garnt> the personified i mean i i've i have so </garnt>
<joey> many [ __ ] games that i've bought in </joey>
<joey> my library that i just have </joey>
<garnt> i've downloaded them i've installed them </garnt>
<garnt> and i just never know for them </garnt>
<connor> i've never opened the last time you got </connor>
<connor> really hyped for a game </connor>
<connor> final fantasy 7r probably did it live up </connor>
<joey> to your hive yeah 100 percent of it what </joey>
<connor> you gone was that fantastic game and it </connor>
<garnt> got very exciting i haven't pre-ordered </garnt>
<garnt> it like the last time i got hyped for a </garnt>
<garnt> game cyberpunk </garnt>
<garnt> i'm not joking that was the last time </garnt>
<connor> [Music] </connor>
<garnt> because i was just like great it's a </garnt>
<garnt> sci-fi game it's cyberpunk this looks </garnt>
<garnt> like everything i've ever wanted to fill </garnt>
<joey> up that void that mass effect has just </joey>
<joey> left for let me left me for years and </joey>
<garnt> now that hole is even deeper and now the </garnt>
<connor> hole is ashamed </connor>
<connor> of therapy with it as well </connor>
<connor> i mean </connor>
<connor> i'm like every few months i just google </connor>
<garnt> it's cyberpunk 2077 </garnt>
<connor> i saw it i saw a good i saw a good </connor>
<connor> article it was like cyberpunk is nowhere </connor>
<connor> near a no man's sky turn around </connor>
<connor> oh </connor>
<connor> the devs are like we're nowhere near </connor>
<connor> fixing it like no man's sky </connor>
<connor> or something like that according to </connor>
<connor> something like that i was really it was </connor>
<joey> just how they said they had to say a no </joey>
<garnt> man's sky turn around of course i mean </garnt>
<joey> that that is like no man's sky is the </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] anime redemption of the gaming </garnt>
<garnt> industry i think it's like one of the </garnt>
<joey> only redemptions that's when the </joey>
<joey> antagonist turned into the protagonist </joey>
<connor> because most companies you just cut your </connor>
<garnt> losses and you're like [ __ ] it make the </garnt>
<garnt> next [ __ ] fallout yeah yeah [ __ ] 76 </garnt>
<joey> make a new one yeah you know it's it's </joey>
<joey> when was the last time you got hyped </joey>
<garnt> yeah as the gamer </garnt>
<garnt> borderlands three i was very hot for </garnt>
<garnt> borderlands throughout that was a good </garnt>
<garnt> okay uh no all right i was extremely </garnt>
<connor> hyped for borderlands i absolutely </connor>
<connor> borderlands two is one of my favorite </connor>
<connor> games yeah because i was gonna ask i've </connor>
<garnt> never played three but i played two </garnt>
<garnt> great i haven't played board once what </garnt>
<connor> was the sigh they're gone i just i just </connor>
<garnt> realized i just realized what the game </garnt>
<garnt> before okay well cyberpunk 2077 what the </garnt>
<connor> last game i was hyped before that i </connor>
<connor> bought lens too right i loved </connor>
<connor> borderlands uh so i bought borderlands </connor>
<connor> one originally on the xbox 360. right </connor>
<connor> and uh i thought it was [ __ ] i hated it </connor>
<garnt> because i didn't have friends to play </garnt>
<garnt> with so it was terrible game to play </garnt>
<joey> alone but when i finally went back to it </joey>
<connor> months later my friends bought it went </connor>
<connor> on more more sale i just went cheaper </connor>
<connor> sorry uh and yeah i loved it i thought </connor>
<connor> wow this okay this game is actually sick </connor>
<connor> when you play it with friends then </connor>
<connor> borderlands 2 came out and it looked </connor>
<connor> like they just improved everything yeah </connor>
<connor> and they did yeah and it was amazing </connor>
<connor> bought lens 2 is such a good game and </connor>
<connor> playing it with friends is like amazing </connor>
<connor> like this this game is so much replay </connor>
<connor> value with friends um and i absolutely </connor>
<connor> had like some of the best gaming </connor>
<connor> memories playing borderlands 2. so </connor>
<connor> naturally borderlands 3 was coming out </connor>
<connor> and i had a monster gaming pc yeah i was </connor>
<connor> ready every all my friends were getting </connor>
<connor> it there's endless people i could play </connor>
<connor> with it was going to be good yeah </connor>
<connor> so i play it and uh yeah it's just kind </connor>
<joey> of like borderlands 2 but with like a </joey>
<joey> worse story like the stuff they add </joey>
<joey> isn't very good wait since when have you </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] cared about story well </joey>
<joey> borderlands 2 actually was such like </joey>
<joey> handsome jack is such an uh engaging </joey>
<joey> villain oh yeah </joey>
<joey> [Applause] </joey>
<joey> he's there always making you laugh right </joey>
<connor> and that was something that even if i </connor>
<connor> didn't care what was happening i knew </connor>
<connor> that i liked handsome jack and then he </connor>
<connor> was funny as [ __ ] yeah i loved having </connor>
<connor> that and the and the two main villains </connor>
<connor> were like youtubers or twitch streamers </connor>
<joey> in the third one right and it was just </joey>
<joey> cringe because i'm a youtuber and twitch </joey>
<joey> streamer right so it was cringe watching </joey>
<garnt> that i am the bad guy </garnt>
<joey> it was like yeah </joey>
<garnt> it was just like poking fun at me in </garnt>
<connor> like the worst way right and i was like </connor>
<connor> this isn't this isn't the representation </connor>
<connor> i asked for </connor>
<connor> this is slander </connor>
<connor> i'm all down for when people make fun of </connor>
<garnt> youtubers and twitch streamers i'm all </garnt>
<connor> down for it but sometimes they do it in </connor>
<connor> like a like a way </connor>
<connor> in a way that you've clearly never </connor>
<connor> watched something because there are so </connor>
<connor> many other things you could have gone </connor>
<connor> for like you know they do the whole </connor>
<connor> thing of like oh hi guys whatever and </connor>
<joey> they could have gone for like why don't </joey>
<joey> you thank me for like the 10 donation or </joey>
<connor> something like that right that would </connor>
<joey> have been funny as [ __ ] you know like bo </joey>
<connor> burnham did a great parody of it i mean </connor>
<connor> bye-bye used to be a youtuber oh yeah </connor>
<connor> obviously he did a great parody of </connor>
<connor> twitch streamers and stuff and that was </connor>
<connor> great but i felt like it was a terrible </connor>
<connor> parody and it was also they were just so </connor>
<connor> unlikable and there was so many bugs in </connor>
<joey> it as well like there were so many </joey>
<joey> game-breaking bugs that just happened </joey>
<joey> throughout and i was like this shouldn't </joey>
<joey> be happening i waited years for this i </joey>
<joey> got hyped for this i felt invested in </joey>
<joey> give my high back i didn't really like </joey>
<joey> any of the characters that you could </joey>
<joey> play as yeah which kind of sucked </joey>
<connor> borderlands 2 i felt like every single </connor>
<connor> character was like pog yeah </connor>
<garnt> because like the game i think the game </garnt>
<garnt> the game i got hyped for before </garnt>
<garnt> cyberpunk </garnt>
<garnt> was uh this this just shows my track </garnt>
<garnt> record and why i don't get hyped for </garnt>
<garnt> games anymore right it was mass effect </garnt>
<joey> andromeda i thought you might say </joey>
<connor> fallout 76 yeah i thought you might say </connor>
<joey> i thought you were saying this guy </joey>
<connor> fallout 76 mass effect andromeda </connor>
<connor> i love donkey's video i don't know i've </connor>
<connor> never played masturbate i've just </connor>
<garnt> watched these videos on them </garnt>
<garnt> andromeda was so funny i think i've </garnt>
<joey> played like an hour of mass effect </joey>
<joey> andromeda and i'm just like this this </joey>
<joey> this just isn't doing it for me right </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> by that point like i i think i think </joey>
<joey> cyberpunk was just uh yeah this looks </joey>
<garnt> like a game that could be you know could </garnt>
<garnt> appeal to me but i think mass effect was </garnt>
<garnt> really what just killed my soul right </garnt>
<connor> right there's something so </connor>
<connor> heartbreaking about it in a way that </connor>
<joey> i've never experienced when a game just </joey>
<connor> lets you down like that yeah yeah it </connor>
<connor> feels like your dad just never came home </connor>
<joey> you know like it's like damn but it's </joey>
<joey> like it feels like your dad came home </joey>
<joey> but with a different woman </joey>
<connor> this </connor>
<connor> is i don't know it's just it's i feel </connor>
<joey> like that's the first time you get to </joey>
<joey> really experience betrayal as a young </joey>
<joey> adult yeah </joey>
<joey> a true betrayal i trusted you yeah i </joey>
<joey> followed you all the way through and </joey>
<joey> this is how you repay me i stuck with </joey>
<joey> you for years i had memories with you </joey>
<joey> that i can't i can't i've never even had </joey>
<joey> with anyone else and this </joey>
<garnt> yeah it's gone like that yeah </garnt>
<joey> yeah i mean like i i just i just like </joey>
<connor> now i just try to keep as little </connor>
<connor> knowledge of the gaming industry and </connor>
<connor> like what's coming out sports well </connor>
<connor> because </connor>
<joey> and it was [ __ ] amazing oh yeah </joey>
<connor> horizon zero dawn i was like what the </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] what what kind of game franchise is </garnt>
<garnt> this i had no idea what it was about it </garnt>
<joey> was [ __ ] amazing that's why i'm not </joey>
<joey> hyping myself up for breath of the wild </joey>
<joey> too right because i don't want a [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> andromeda to happen you know like god </joey>
<joey> forbid it never happens but like you </joey>
<joey> never know right so i'm just gonna like </joey>
<connor> i'm just gonna wait </connor>
<garnt> and also like i you know i've seen </garnt>
<garnt> someone streaming a lot now um </garnt>
<garnt> you know when e3 happens or nintendo </garnt>
<connor> press conference i was like did you </connor>
<connor> watch it did you watch the e3 conference </connor>
<connor> why would i watch an hour of ads why </connor>
<connor> what so i can get excited and give my </connor>
<connor> money to a company that's going to let </connor>
<connor> me down no no thank you i'll when the </connor>
<connor> game comes out and i hear it's good i'll </connor>
<joey> buy it </joey>
<joey> why would i sit down and watch an hour </joey>
<garnt> conference of getting myself hyped for </garnt>
<garnt> something that i probably won't be hype </garnt>
<garnt> about i know i think it's pretty fun i'm </garnt>
<garnt> not even sometimes sometimes i'm just </garnt>
<garnt> like sometimes when like i still </garnt>
<garnt> remember um when final fantasy 7 remake </garnt>
<garnt> was announced and just the reaction </garnt>
<garnt> around that i'm just like i haven't i </garnt>
<garnt> don't give a [ __ ] about final fantasy </garnt>
<garnt> but i'm [ __ ] hype </garnt>
<connor> meanwhile me who never played final </connor>
<joey> fantasy i'm like what's going on </joey>
<joey> meanwhile i was the one guy like </joey>
<garnt> in the crowd yeah and then they </garnt>
<garnt> announced like shenmue three afterwards </garnt>
<garnt> i was like what kind of press conference </garnt>
<connor> is this like i think i was more hyped </connor>
<garnt> about the press conference than the </garnt>
<garnt> actual games themselves </garnt>
<garnt> that turned out to be a great game huh </garnt>
<garnt> no but i feel like it's a little it's </garnt>
<connor> it's a fun little you know um event you </connor>
<connor> know if you're if you take part of it i </connor>
<garnt> just feel like you just want to get </garnt>
<joey> hyped it's like the nintendo directs </joey>
<joey> right that's like another one where it's </joey>
<joey> just like did you watch it did you watch </joey>
<connor> the nintendo ds there's something about </connor>
<connor> nintendo directx that really pissed me </connor>
<connor> off i can't put my finger on it i get </connor>
<connor> angry watching nintendo directly well i </connor>
<connor> don't know why i think it's the way they </connor>
<connor> present games that clearly no one gives </connor>
<connor> a [ __ ] about they'll be like and now </connor>
<connor> it's just dance 17 and it's like </connor>
<joey> why but they always they always have to </joey>
<connor> sandwich it between two big titles right </connor>
<connor> yeah which is like you know fair enough </connor>
<connor> right there clearly no but it's also </connor>
<joey> just like i don't care about just </joey>
<connor> dancing sometimes they do like ad spots </connor>
<connor> i think for other companies to like </connor>
<connor> where they give i think it's i think </connor>
<connor> it's an ad spot i think they do this and </connor>
<joey> they'll show a game that looks awful for </joey>
<joey> like 30 minutes and they'll just like a </joey>
<joey> play through and i'm like stop this stop </joey>
<joey> this right now </joey>
<joey> show me an ad show me an ad over this </joey>
<connor> please </connor>
<joey> anything else other than this i can't </joey>
<connor> stand this show me a bloodline ad </connor>
<connor> i'll take it i'll take a bottle out give </connor>
<connor> me fallout 76 demo or something god damn </connor>
<connor> it please i'm begging for something else </connor>
<connor> i don't know i </connor>
<connor> i </connor>
<connor> i don't know i i think i'm just getting </connor>
<connor> to that point in my life where i'm </connor>
<connor> becoming extremely bitter about </connor>
<connor> everything that makes other people happy </connor>
<joey> welcome to adult things i think i think </joey>
<joey> i'm getting this it's called being </joey>
<connor> adulting and it's called being british </connor>
<connor> as well it's like the worst combination </connor>
<connor> of angry </connor>
<connor> i think i sit there on my porch just </connor>
<garnt> like rocking my chair thinking oh you </garnt>
<connor> young kids getting excited over games </connor>
<garnt> how naive imagine imagine being happy </garnt>
<connor> imagine being excited if only i could </connor>
<connor> feel these emotions anymore oh you think </connor>
<connor> mario golf is going to be fun really </connor>
<connor> have fun playing mario </connor>
<connor> one time at a party and then never </connor>
<connor> playing it ever again </connor>
<connor> mario tennis you thought that was fun i </connor>
<connor> felt i never felt angrier than when i </connor>
<connor> bought mario tennis the new mario tennis </connor>
<connor> right it's [ __ ] terrible game you </connor>
<connor> played it yeah i like it it's terrible </connor>
<connor> it's terrible why is it terrible wait </connor>
<joey> have you played the original look no oh </joey>
<connor> that's probably why </connor>
<connor> why why i have to have prerequisite </connor>
<joey> knowledge of another game well compared </joey>
<joey> to the original it's much better </joey>
<garnt> i love the original i like the original </garnt>
<joey> two but i think the new one just </joey>
<garnt> improved on i mean i love the original </garnt>
<garnt> because i was a kid and i had yeah zero </garnt>
<garnt> taste in video games everything </garnt>
<connor> i'm sure i'm sure oh sorry i don't have </connor>
<joey> tasted </joey>
<connor> i'm sure i pissed people off saying it's </connor>
<connor> terrible i just i played it and i should </connor>
<joey> i was so bored out of my mind to playing </joey>
<joey> this game i mean clearly it's just not a </joey>
<connor> game made for you right why why is it </connor>
<connor> not i would have loved this what's going </connor>
<connor> on what's going on why do i don't why do </connor>
<garnt> i hate this game you sound like the same </garnt>
<connor> crowd it's not toxic enough you sound </connor>
<garnt> like the same crowd of people who are </garnt>
<connor> pissed off when nintendo released like </connor>
<connor> the nintendo 2ds which was intended for </connor>
<connor> like five year olds </connor>
<connor> i thought it was affordable and uh yeah </connor>
<connor> i like the ergonomics of it it looked </connor>
<joey> cool it looked like a [ __ ] like </joey>
<joey> fisher-price like yeah i like children's </joey>
<joey> toy and adults are like what the [ __ ] </joey>
<garnt> nintendo how dare you not make it </garnt>
<joey> how dare you make a toy </joey>
<connor> company i'm not one of those people who </connor>
<joey> gets angry at nintendo for not making </joey>
<joey> adult-oriented products right that's not </joey>
<joey> that what they do right but you know </joey>
<joey> stuff like pokemon i wish that they </joey>
<joey> would put a difficulty option or </joey>
<garnt> something where you could add something </garnt>
<garnt> like like that i wish they would include </garnt>
<garnt> something the toxic game right </garnt>
<connor> right now </connor>
<connor> you know what is that insane of me to </connor>
<connor> ask pokemon to include like something </connor>
<joey> that makes it more </joey>
<connor> into it that allowed you to make it more </connor>
<connor> difficult or to do certain things i just </connor>
<connor> i don't understand no i don't i don't i </connor>
<joey> don't think i </joey>
<joey> disagree with that because like i think </joey>
<garnt> like purposely leaving it open-ended to </garnt>
<connor> like how difficult you want it is what </connor>
<garnt> makes that game so appealing to people </garnt>
<connor> yeah if you put a difficulty like if you </connor>
<garnt> went into a pokemon game and you were </garnt>
<joey> like choose the difficulty immediately </joey>
<joey> people will be like uh </joey>
<garnt> actually actually </garnt>
<garnt> in regards to difficulty i [ __ ] hate </garnt>
<garnt> choosing difficulty i hate it </garnt>
<connor> so much it depends on the game it </connor>
<connor> depends on the game because unlike so </connor>
<connor> some games it's it's completely stupid </connor>
<connor> necessary right like first person </connor>
<joey> shooters like i hate it because it just </joey>
<connor> makes them more spongy yeah that's all </connor>
<joey> it does but on some games like pokemon </joey>
<joey> where it's like okay this </joey>
<joey> even even a 12 year old probably find </joey>
<joey> this too easy like especially the number </joey>
<joey> one the new one was like the new ones </joey>
<joey> like hold your hand that's why it was </joey>
<connor> like beyond mine like even like you know </connor>
<garnt> you you play players that's that's </garnt>
<garnt> that's the problem with the game itself </garnt>
<connor> right right i feel like i feel like this </connor>
<connor> is a game design yeah i feel like even </connor>
<connor> adding 10 more difficulty to this is </connor>
<joey> like what like it's pokemon platinum i </joey>
<joey> was playing that i did another log but </joey>
<joey> like even the core game itself was </joey>
<joey> actually kind of challenging like it's </joey>
<joey> not it's not you can't just like fall </joey>
<connor> asleep and just spam one pokemon well </connor>
<joey> that's the thing right it's like i feel </joey>
<joey> that's the problem with just like </joey>
<connor> pokemon games in general where like like </connor>
<connor> i played sun and moon right that [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> holds your hand the entire </connor>
<connor> even as an adult and i'm like dude like </connor>
<joey> 10 year old me was crying trying to get </joey>
<joey> past like gym three of silver right but </joey>
<connor> and the game couldn't give a [ __ ] like </connor>
<connor> it was just like just get good it's like </connor>
<connor> figure it out yeah you're ten you should </connor>
<connor> start thinking bro stop thinking [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> ten years </garnt>
<joey> exactly i feel like nowadays people </joey>
<garnt> people have less patience when it comes </garnt>
<connor> to completing games yeah there's no </connor>
<joey> there's no way making a pokemon gym </joey>
<joey> slightly harder is hardly asking for </joey>
<joey> like like it's not we're not even dark </joey>
<joey> souls level of difficulties </joey>
<joey> i'm just you know there is you should in </joey>
<joey> a pokemon game i think even if you're </joey>
<joey> like 10 years old you should fail the </joey>
<joey> first gym probably and be forced to be </joey>
<joey> like maybe i should buy some potions </joey>
<joey> yeah maybe i should consider doing </joey>
<connor> something not just [ __ ] steamrolling </connor>
<joey> this [ __ ] with my mudkip every time just </joey>
<joey> give it like good game design so that </joey>
<joey> you don't have to say anything to get </joey>
<joey> the player to figure it out right yeah </joey>
<connor> it's like you know i i just </connor>
<connor> even like when you're when i was like a </connor>
<connor> much younger kid you know when i was 10 </connor>
<connor> whatever playing these games i hated it </connor>
<connor> when games were like completely like </connor>
<connor> steamrolly like you could just do it </connor>
<connor> without thinking yeah it's like having </connor>
<connor> some form of difficulty there is good </connor>
<connor> and it's also important i think for the </connor>
<connor> kid to learn </connor>
<joey> everything is going to be [ __ ] easy </joey>
<joey> yeah exactly like i remember like when i </joey>
<joey> was [ __ ] like eight years old playing </joey>
<garnt> mega man 2 for the first time yeah and i </garnt>
<garnt> was like this is [ __ ] impossible like </garnt>
<garnt> no one can beat this [ __ ] love that </garnt>
<garnt> game though it's one of my favorite </garnt>
<joey> games of all time because i learned to </joey>
<garnt> like i learned success through failure </garnt>
<garnt> kids have it too easy now these guys </garnt>
<connor> is that as an adult i have absolutely </connor>
<connor> zero patience for games that are </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] hard right kids do not kids </joey>
<joey> will play the [ __ ] oh yeah yeah over </joey>
<joey> and over and over again because it's one </joey>
<garnt> it's probably the only game they're </garnt>
<connor> getting yeah and also there's nothing </connor>
<connor> it's not that's that's that's that's </connor>
<connor> what i'm trying it's not an email that's </connor>
<connor> that's what i mean that's the point i'm </connor>
<connor> trying right yeah no because i feel like </connor>
<connor> there's just games are a lot more </connor>
<garnt> affordable nowadays yeah back then you </garnt>
<connor> had one game every few months maybe </connor>
<connor> but it's still most if they're getting </connor>
<connor> like an xbox or something okay yeah they </connor>
<connor> can play fortnite for free on it but if </connor>
<connor> they want to buy another game and it's </connor>
<connor> difficult they're probably gonna try and </connor>
<connor> complete it because they bought the game </connor>
<garnt> when they wanted it for christmas or </garnt>
<garnt> something right adults try to understand </garnt>
<garnt> kids </garnt>
<garnt> i'm just thinking from my perspective i </garnt>
<garnt> don't know maybe maybe i mean most of </garnt>
<garnt> them are just happy with like fortnite </garnt>
<joey> and stuff right yeah </joey>
<connor> but i mean </connor>
<joey> i think the other thing as well is that </joey>
<joey> at least with like the old games is that </joey>
<joey> you know because they could only be </joey>
<joey> so long that they literally had to be </joey>
<joey> like all right this game if you blast </joey>
<joey> through it yeah you could probably </joey>
<joey> complete in less than an hour exactly </joey>
<joey> but like we want you to play this game </joey>
<joey> for a long time so we're just gonna make </joey>
<joey> it [ __ ] hard to the point where 40 </joey>
<joey> minutes of gameplay is going to take you </joey>
<joey> about 40 days oh there are a lot of </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] moments in a lot of older games </garnt>
<joey> oh yeah and i i remember thinking back </joey>
<connor> and i'm thinking how the [ __ ] did i like </connor>
<connor> play so many like levels of battle toad </connor>
<connor> and controversy </connor>
<garnt> i did play battletoads it's actually a </garnt>
<joey> really fun game oh it's a good game yeah </joey>
<connor> it's a [ __ ] great game </connor>
<joey> like to this day as like i remember </joey>
<connor> playing the [ __ ] motorbike </connor>
<connor> like the </connor>
<garnt> i think i played it like for a full week </garnt>
<connor> yeah in my room trying to complete that </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] level yeah because because i </joey>
<joey> remember beating mega man 2 </joey>
<connor> lots of times as a kid yeah and then i </connor>
<connor> recently played it a couple of years ago </connor>
<connor> i could barely get past [ __ ] wood man </connor>
<connor> yeah i'm like how the [ __ ] did i do this </connor>
<joey> as a tenure oh it's because i literally </joey>
<joey> spent like a month of my life just </joey>
<garnt> grinding also i couldn't play megaman of </garnt>
<garnt> my age i'm going to get a [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> carpool tunnel like i i tried playing </garnt>
<connor> man x i'm just like oh i'm getting a </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] crap here if i'm just like </connor>
<connor> doing like the wall jump jesus christ my </connor>
<joey> god </joey>
<connor> that's great though i love it i i guess </connor>
<joey> i'm i guess i'm angry that i'm getting </joey>
<joey> older and these children games aren't </joey>
<garnt> getting older with me yeah i guess so i </garnt>
<joey> i mean i like with difficulty i like i </joey>
<joey> i've i i now like when a game has just </joey>
<joey> like one set difficulty even if it's </joey>
<joey> like i i i </joey>
<joey> i'm so like i get anxious that with any </joey>
<joey> game or any piece of media where i want </joey>
<joey> to enjoy it the most right i want i </joey>
<connor> wanted to enjoy the most on my first </connor>
<connor> playthrough and sometimes i've had games </connor>
<connor> where i loaded up and i hit i hit the </connor>
<connor> difficulty level selection and i'm just </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> i'm getting anxiety just now i'm already </connor>
<garnt> getting anxiety you know what maybe i'll </garnt>
<garnt> play this game another time this is why </garnt>
<connor> i like games uh even if they have </connor>
<connor> difficulty options they let you just </connor>
<connor> change it on the fly yeah yeah yeah i </connor>
<connor> like the consequences for it and it's </connor>
<connor> like all right well this cut this </connor>
<connor> section's kind of [ __ ] i'm gonna </connor>
<joey> knock it down how do you feel about </joey>
<joey> people who like purposely select like </joey>
<connor> easy mode </connor>
<connor> well like what it depends on the game </connor>
<connor> there's some games where i'm like you're </connor>
<joey> actually just like not playing the game </joey>
<connor> if you pick right because it's far too </connor>
<joey> easy but like there's that whole like </joey>
<joey> stigma i i guess like connotation </joey>
<connor> they're like oh you're not you're not a </connor>
<joey> real gamer if you're playing it on </joey>
<connor> youtube good scrub like levels of things </connor>
<connor> but i mean it's </connor>
<connor> obviously if i was there in the room </connor>
<connor> with them i'd be like almost wrong </connor>
<connor> little baby you're not gonna i'm not </connor>
<connor> gonna click normal but you know </connor>
<connor> on the on the podcast and if if a </connor>
<connor> general audience asked me i'd be like </connor>
<connor> yeah of course well can you pick pick </connor>
<connor> whatever difficulty you want yeah right </connor>
<connor> but obviously if you're my mate i'm </connor>
<garnt> going to i'm going to play play baby </garnt>
<garnt> mode mario oh yeah yeah i'm like you </garnt>
<connor> playing america </connor>
<garnt> no you're not no no </garnt>
<connor> no no no no no no no </connor>
<connor> i mean it's different right actually </connor>
<garnt> you'll poke fun at your friends yeah </garnt>
<connor> [ __ ] around with that but i obviously in </connor>
<garnt> general i think that you can play </garnt>
<garnt> whatever [ __ ] difficulty you want all </garnt>
<garnt> right </garnt>
<garnt> why would it why would i can why does </garnt>
<garnt> take away from me just have fun just </garnt>
<connor> have fun if you want to be a little baby </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] you could be a little baby [ __ ] i </connor>
<joey> don't care you have the right to do that </joey>
<joey> you paid the strength you have the right </joey>
<joey> to be a baby [ __ ] you pay for 60 bucks </joey>
<joey> you get to do it yeah you know </joey>
<joey> also you know i think it's it's good </joey>
<joey> because not everyone you know obviously </joey>
<joey> some people have disabilities as well </joey>
<joey> they can't play the game on the hardest </joey>
<joey> difficulty </joey>
<joey> they can't do it you know i just think </joey>
<joey> accessibility is good in gaming i think </joey>
<joey> that one of the things that pisses me </joey>
<joey> off most and it's always the japanese </joey>
<connor> game companies that do this is that like </connor>
<connor> the accessibility options in their games </connor>
<connor> are terrible like they don't they don't </connor>
<connor> let you change anything no button </connor>
<connor> remapping none of that i love it when </connor>
<connor> games are like bro what do you want to </connor>
<connor> do what do you how big do you want the </connor>
<connor> the character models to be or what now </connor>
<garnt> about so how bold you want the outlines </garnt>
<joey> to do do you ever use button remapping </joey>
<connor> yeah all the time i really i i've never </connor>
<joey> used it in my life i love button </joey>
<joey> remapping and i i it pisses me off that </joey>
<connor> a lot of games don't do it and a lot of </connor>
<connor> the indie devs are normally the ones who </connor>
<connor> include a [ __ ] ton of accessibility </connor>
<joey> options that's a lot of like pc games as </joey>
<connor> well yeah like it's not not a lot of </connor>
<garnt> console games have but yeah happening </garnt>
<joey> right i mean the the beauty of console </joey>
<connor> games is that it's just plug and play </connor>
<connor> it's very simple you just put a disc in </connor>
<garnt> or whatever or do you download the game </garnt>
<connor> and then you just start playing okay so </connor>
<connor> the the argument behind accessibility </connor>
<connor> options and button remapping especially </connor>
<connor> is like um especially with people who </connor>
<joey> are you know maybe someone has a </joey>
<joey> disability where they can't use one of </joey>
<joey> their hands properly and maybe there's a </joey>
<joey> button where they can't press jump yeah </joey>
<joey> but they can press the jump button with </joey>
<connor> this finger right so the idea is that </connor>
<connor> even though yes this is probably the </connor>
<connor> best layout someone might out there </connor>
<connor> might have a waysier time with this </connor>
<connor> button being on this this one right so </connor>
<connor> just give them the option to remap no no </connor>
<joey> no why wouldn't you yeah no i'm </joey>
<joey> definitely not against </joey>
<joey> i've just personally never used it yet </joey>
<connor> yeah nintendo's got a lot better at it </connor>
<connor> as well i think actually i think so uh </connor>
<connor> but they're awkward sometimes with it um </connor>
<connor> and also like colorblind options uh the </connor>
<garnt> last of us had like amazing uh </garnt>
<garnt> accessibility options like you could uh </garnt>
<garnt> you could change it so all the </garnt>
<garnt> everything in the thing was just like </garnt>
<garnt> two colors like it's all gray and the </garnt>
<garnt> models are just like bright red and </garnt>
<garnt> bright blue so even someone who's like </garnt>
<garnt> completely like you know has really bad </garnt>
<connor> uh case of vision can play the game </connor>
<connor> because they can see the models outlined </connor>
<connor> and then you can also just turn stuff on </connor>
<connor> for yourself like you if you if you </connor>
<connor> prefer color like a lot of people play </connor>
<connor> apex legends with like the color blind </connor>
<connor> settings on to change the color of the </connor>
<connor> bars and stuff to make it more visible </connor>
<connor> right you know i just i i i think that </connor>
<connor> especially oh another one okay so i'm </connor>
<connor> going on a round now this is one thing </connor>
<connor> that i think is there's absolutely no </connor>
<connor> excuse why this shouldn't be an option </connor>
<connor> on every single video game subtitles why </connor>
<connor> is there not subtitles in every single </connor>
<joey> video game yeah they have the script i </joey>
<joey> hate it i hate it like i hate games i </joey>
<connor> agree with that i hate games that don't </connor>
<connor> have subtitles like </connor>
<connor> sometimes i don't want to have to like </connor>
<connor> listen to it at full volume yeah and </connor>
<connor> sometimes maybe there's explosions and </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] going on i want to read it they </connor>
<connor> have the script just plop this [ __ ] in </connor>
<garnt> it just it's just like what is it about </garnt>
<garnt> not just gaming but like movie audio </garnt>
<joey> mixing </joey>
<garnt> especially if you like i remember i </garnt>
<joey> watched uh nightcrawlers yesterday with </joey>
<joey> sydney and um you know it's uh it's we </joey>
<connor> watched a few movies and </connor>
<connor> we were we turned up like the tv to </connor>
<connor> almost full volume yeah characters start </connor>
<connor> speaking which is like </connor>
<connor> like what </connor>
<connor> what is that subtitle option and then we </connor>
<connor> turn on the tv to full volume and it's </connor>
<connor> still like </connor>
<joey> i literally had that happen to me when i </joey>
<garnt> watched interstellar like last week </garnt>
<garnt> like oh my god it's a fantastic movie </garnt>
<garnt> don't get me wrong but my god and i love </garnt>
<garnt> matthew mcconaughey but man like like </garnt>
<joey> listening to him is like listening to a </joey>
<joey> subwoofer that barely works </joey>
<joey> this is like </joey>
<connor> because when they're mixing these movies </connor>
<joey> they're mixing them on like these </joey>
<joey> gigantic audio editing suites yeah you </joey>
<joey> can hear everything i'm like no edit </joey>
<connor> this [ __ ] on a [ __ ] uh airpod bro so </connor>
<connor> you can hear what most people are going </connor>
<connor> to listen to like one when they're when </connor>
<joey> they're listening to them like it's this </joey>
<joey> amazing scene you know when like matthew </joey>
<connor> mcconaughey is giving this like really </connor>
<connor> like intense speech yeah and all i'm </connor>
<connor> hearing is just these [ __ ] organs and </connor>
<joey> it's just like </joey>
<joey> that man he's like </joey>
<joey> i don't know what you're saying </joey>
<garnt> speak up </garnt>
<garnt> because like i said some of the time </garnt>
<garnt> like the audio mixing on like video </garnt>
<connor> games as well it's just it's it's like </connor>
<connor> watching a bass boosted meme you know </connor>
<connor> where the dialogue </connor>
<garnt> is like so </garnt>
<garnt> quiet </garnt>
<garnt> your ears get [ __ ] destroyed but i </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] love youtube videos so like </garnt>
<connor> small youtubers he's like audio is way </connor>
<connor> too [ __ ] quiet and the music is like </connor>
<connor> done </connor>
<connor> you can't [ __ ] hear them and i don't </connor>
<joey> know why i love it it's my favorite it's </joey>
<garnt> so charming i know it's so pure i love </garnt>
<garnt> it but yeah subtitles on video games </garnt>
<garnt> this is why this is why we need it even </garnt>
<garnt> like especially even in your own </garnt>
<connor> language right yeah yeah so yeah there </connor>
<connor> should be absolutely no reason why they </connor>
<connor> shouldn't be subtitles these have to </connor>
<connor> write the script to the game just put </connor>
<connor> the [ __ ] script into the software </connor>
<connor> that can do this yeah right just yeah </connor>
<joey> someone has to time it </joey>
<joey> and i hate how it's like a lot of games </joey>
<connor> the default is off yeah yeah yeah just </connor>
<joey> make it on yeah and if you don't like it </joey>
<connor> then you can turn it off also i think a </connor>
<connor> lot of games is why i'll do this and i </connor>
<connor> think every game should do this is that </connor>
<connor> they let you choose how big you want the </connor>
<connor> text the color of the text the outline </connor>
<connor> of the text shadow and stuff so you can </connor>
<connor> get the subtitles just right so you know </connor>
<connor> again if you're if you have if you can't </connor>
<connor> really see very well you know you should </connor>
<connor> i don't understand why games don't just </connor>
<connor> give you all these options i get it it's </connor>
<connor> crunch they don't have time but i mean </connor>
<connor> it's like all right well just [ __ ] the </connor>
<connor> people who can't play the game like </connor>
<connor> everyone else right just [ __ ] them right </connor>
<connor> yeah [ __ ] them </connor>
<connor> which is why like everyone loves to </connor>
<connor> clown on xbox and and i get it you know </connor>
<connor> i'm an xbox boy myself i love xbox yeah </connor>
<connor> i think xbox have done some of the like </connor>
<connor> most amazing things for accessibility </connor>
<connor> have you seen the um the controller </connor>
<connor> they've made </connor>
<connor> it's like the it's like this pad right </connor>
<connor> and you can literally hook anything up </connor>
<connor> to it right literally anything into a </connor>
<connor> controller and it's set up so that like </connor>
<joey> you can just turn anything into a </joey>

<connor> anything you want so like recent oh it's </connor>
<joey> been out for like two three years oh wow </joey>
<joey> threat for a while never heard of it and </joey>
<joey> uh it's done some amazing things like </joey>
<joey> it's it's so cool that like xbox thought </joey>
<connor> to do that because they're probably not </connor>
<connor> gonna make much money off that right </connor>
<connor> yeah that's not something you make money </connor>
<connor> off of so a lot of the companies won't </connor>
<connor> do it but you know i thought [ __ ] fair </connor>
<joey> play to microsoft man like i mean yeah </joey>
<joey> like that's great cred right yeah i i </joey>
<joey> just like why wouldn't you do that </joey>
<joey> they're looking out for all gamers out </joey>
<connor> there yeah and uh also you know just a </connor>
<connor> lot of </connor>
<garnt> the term gamers has just like been </garnt>
<connor> reporting </connor>
<joey> for the record i meant that in all </joey>
<connor> sincerity all right please </connor>
<connor> any any any game company or whatever </connor>
<connor> that spends money and time to develop </connor>
<connor> stuff for you know uh accessibility </connor>
<connor> options that they know is probably not </connor>
<connor> going to be valued by 99 people yeah </connor>
<garnt> that's mad respect yeah of course well i </garnt>
<garnt> i feel like you're praised i feel like </garnt>
<garnt> in terms of customization and </garnt>
<garnt> accessibility well not maybe not </garnt>
<garnt> accessibility but definitely </garnt>
<garnt> customization it's always been the pc </garnt>
<garnt> gaming crowd that's been like leading </garnt>
<connor> leading the charge and you know </connor>
<connor> obviously xbox microsoft you know it's </connor>
<connor> it kind of kind of feels like it fits </connor>
<connor> within their ip whereas nintendo is kind </connor>
<joey> of like the apple of the gaming world </joey>
<joey> where she's like this is how we're doing </joey>
<joey> things and </joey>
<garnt> you can buy a peripherals you you can't </garnt>
<garnt> buy your improv rules it's also gonna be </garnt>
<connor> operational it sucks right because like </connor>
<connor> imagine it like miyamoto's there this </connor>
<connor> kid who can't use his hands and mimo's </connor>
<connor> like yeah you don't get to play my games </connor>
<connor> why because you don't make enough money </connor>
<connor> to make money do you millions of dollars </connor>
<connor> no bye-bye you know like it's just like </connor>
<connor> why would you deny someone the option to </connor>
<connor> play your games you know like i'd like </connor>
<connor> to think that if something happened to </connor>
<connor> me or you know uh if i had a kid who </connor>
<connor> loved gaming and and he wasn't able to </connor>
<connor> use the standard controller </connor>
<connor> i'd want to think that there's a chance </connor>
<connor> that he can play his favorite games </connor>
<connor> i said he like i know it's a boy of </connor>
<connor> course it's gonna be a boy </connor>
<connor> i won't allow it </connor>
<connor> girls </connor>
<joey> disgusting you know i i just gave you a </joey>
<joey> girlfriend </joey>
<garnt> they don't exist </garnt>
<connor> [Music] </connor>
<connor> it's not hard to make something that's </connor>
<connor> like that that you can just allow </connor>
<connor> someone to customize you know obviously </connor>
<connor> you still need help from someone else to </connor>
<connor> help set it up for you but yeah you know </connor>
<connor> what i mean i don't know why why not </connor>
<joey> pisses me off yeah why not like they all </joey>
<connor> these companies have all this money </connor>
<joey> right like at least spend it on </joey>
<connor> something that you know like nintendo at </connor>
<connor> one point yeah i think a year ago it was </connor>
<joey> the most cash cash rich company in japan </joey>
<joey> i mean did that pandemic did they have </joey>
<connor> been watching </connor>
<connor> cash lying around make a [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> accessible controller nintendo [ __ ] me </joey>
<joey> stop making joy-cons that don't [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> work </connor>
<connor> god damn it i'm making joycons that </connor>
<joey> break after six months jesus </joey>
<connor> it literally is like an apple periphery </connor>
<connor> it is like oh breaks off the system </connor>
<joey> let's just just buy a new pair it's </joey>
<connor> about a friend who is like </connor>
<joey> he didn't know anything about joycon </joey>
<joey> drift </joey>
<connor> and they were like yeah i don't know how </connor>
<garnt> much joycon drift you don't know </garnt>
<garnt> anything about joey i obviously don't </garnt>
<joey> play my uh it's when that's enough it's </joey>
<joey> when the d-pad just does so </joey>
<joey> unfortunately there's a massive lawsuit </joey>
<connor> going on i don't know if it's been </connor>
<connor> resolved with nintendo and a bunch it's </connor>
<connor> a class action um essentially the </connor>
<garnt> controllers after like a random period </garnt>
<connor> of time they just start drifting the </connor>
<connor> joy-con like the the joysticks </connor>
<joey> right it's not just the joy-cons either </joey>
<connor> the pro controllers do the same thing </connor>
<connor> yeah and it's been a massive problem and </connor>
<connor> people have to buy so many joy-cons and </connor>
<joey> drinks aren't cheap they're like 60 </joey>
<joey> bucks yeah 67 it's ridiculous and um </joey>
<joey> yeah and they just they drift and i had </joey>
<joey> a friend who was playing it </joey>
<connor> and bless them they not really a gamer </connor>
<connor> and they were like yeah so when i'm </connor>
<connor> playing it sometimes i just go to the </connor>
<connor> side why is that i'm like first time </connor>
<connor> yes so nintendo made a shitty product </connor>
<connor> that doesn't [ __ ] work so you have to </connor>
<connor> deal with it buy a new one if you don't </connor>
<connor> like it spend more money yeah nintendo </connor>
<connor> says they'll fix it as well then they </connor>
<connor> have like warranty </connor>
<garnt> i think the last thing that something </garnt>
<garnt> like that happened to me was uh the </garnt>
<garnt> infamous xbox red rings of death oh yeah </garnt>
<garnt> bro that was such a debacle </garnt>
<connor> what a [ __ ] clown fiesta that was man </connor>
<garnt> did you have to send your xbox away to </garnt>
<garnt> microsoft no no so like i i did this </garnt>
<garnt> like [ __ ] gorilla tactic that i found </garnt>
<garnt> on the internet of like now now that i </garnt>
<joey> know what i'm doing i was just basically </joey>
<joey> overheating the xbox so what you do is </joey>
<joey> you [ __ ] wrap a towel around it and </joey>
<joey> then no i'm actually serious </joey>
<joey> you wrap a towel around it and then you </joey>
<joey> turn on the xbox and leave it for like a </joey>
<joey> few hours so you're just basically over </joey>
<joey> here </joey>
<joey> yeah you're overheating and cooking your </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] cpu or something you think it's </connor>
<connor> like a 4chan thread to set your house on </connor>
<connor> fire </connor>
<garnt> like what the [ __ ] yeah very very much </garnt>
<joey> like a uh fire hazard but first </joey>
<joey> arsonist for some reason for some </joey>
<garnt> inexplicable reason it worked and i have </garnt>
<joey> no idea why wait wait so do you want to </joey>
<joey> explain what the red ring of death is </joey>
<garnt> for people who don't know </garnt>
<garnt> um so back when xbox released their xbox </garnt>
<connor> 360. they rushed it out and it was </connor>
<connor> poorly manufactured yeah had many </connor>
<connor> problems right so if you bought one of </connor>
<connor> the first consoles first generation </connor>
<connor> consoles that were released um you </connor>
<connor> basically had a time limit right it was </connor>
<connor> basically like a year or two and every </connor>
<connor> xbox had this where you play and then </connor>
<connor> one day for one reason that nobody could </connor>
<connor> tell it just wouldn't work right and so </connor>
<connor> you would get the three rings right so </connor>
<connor> when the xbox turned when the xbox turns </connor>
<connor> on right you would um you'd see like a </connor>
<garnt> green ring around the power button yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah and basically there were it </garnt>
<garnt> was split into four segments and </garnt>
<garnt> uh the red rings of death meant three </garnt>
<garnt> segments were red which was mean </garnt>
<garnt> something was wrong with the startup </garnt>
<garnt> right and </garnt>
<garnt> nobody like we called it the red rings </garnt>
<garnt> of death because everyone had this issue </garnt>
<garnt> i know and it never got resolved and how </garnt>
<garnt> you would resolve it is to basically </garnt>
<garnt> send it back to the manufacturer they </garnt>
<connor> cost microsoft billions yes because of </connor>
<garnt> all this [ __ ] because it happened so </garnt>
<connor> often right and my friend i had two </connor>
<connor> friends about it so we had a group of </connor>
<connor> four of us who all played xbox yeah and </connor>
<connor> i never got it thank god i would have </connor>
<connor> actually cried because what my friend </connor>
<connor> had to go through sounded like my worst </connor>
<connor> nightmare as a 16 year old me yeah he he </connor>
<connor> got the red ring of death and he had to </connor>
<connor> send it back and then they sent back a </connor>
<joey> box that an xbox that was refurbished it </joey>
<connor> was someone else's and it didn't work </connor>
<joey> yeah what so and again like this so </joey>
<joey> they're just recycling xboxes apparently </joey>
<connor> they had they were doing stuff like this </connor>
<connor> like it was pretty widespread so you </connor>
<connor> sent it and they called them up again </connor>
<connor> this is like over months like this took </connor>
<connor> i think it took like half a year to get </connor>
<connor> it fixed overall he had sent about like </connor>
<connor> three times before they finally fixed it </connor>
<connor> and then and then it broke six months </connor>
<connor> later and he just gave up he was like </connor>
<connor> i'm not doing it again yeah i'm not </connor>
<connor> sending it out </connor>
<connor> i mean this is that that literally like </connor>
<connor> scared me to death i was like the </connor>
<connor> thought of my xbox dying i was like this </connor>
<connor> is my only this is my lifeline like if </connor>
<connor> this goes what am i gonna do i don't </connor>
<connor> know what i'm gonna do if i can't play </connor>
<connor> halo reach i'm gonna lose it </connor>
<connor> it's gonna be everyone's problem </connor>
<garnt> dreamer memory cards yeah stuff have you </garnt>
<connor> ever had like a save file that's just </connor>
<garnt> been corrupt </garnt>
<connor> actually trauma on my childhood of like </connor>
<garnt> my [ __ ] gamecube ones just like dying </garnt>
<connor> for no reason </connor>
<joey> back in the day mad cats was like </joey>
<joey> everything like if you wanted a </joey>
<connor> controller or another memory card or any </connor>
<joey> peripheral yeah that was half the price </joey>
<joey> mad cats so like we have the we have </joey>
<joey> like the xbox now and now uh not the </joey>
<joey> xbox sorry the gamecube in our room </joey>
<joey> right now and i was like okay i got to </joey>
<garnt> buy some memory cards for it i just and </garnt>
<garnt> like the trauma kicked back the moment i </garnt>
<garnt> said that to myself i was like we got to </garnt>
<garnt> buy memory cards we got to buy memory </garnt>
<garnt> cards i just ended up buying like 10 </garnt>
<connor> memory cards because i was like i'm just </connor>
<connor> expecting the worst yeah one of these </connor>
<connor> memory cards gonna die in like two days </connor>
<connor> guaranteed luckily it hasn't happened </connor>
<connor> yet so i just have this like pile of </connor>
<connor> memory cards in my room that are just </connor>
<joey> unused just in case but yeah yeah i </joey>
<joey> remember it was it sucked as well </joey>
<garnt> because it was like there was no pattern </garnt>
<garnt> to it no there wasn't there was never it </garnt>
<joey> was just like one day the memory card </joey>
<joey> was like </joey>
<garnt> stay up yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i think playing with memory cards </garnt>
<joey> uh on the gamecube has given me a </joey>
<joey> permanent fear of playing jrpgs like </joey>
<joey> like it was like you know </joey>
<garnt> mario kart you know [ __ ] any zelda </garnt>
<joey> game okay zelda's bad enough okay yeah </joey>
<joey> oh dude like i've had some wind waker </joey>
<joey> accounts just completely dying on me for </joey>
<garnt> no reason but there is nothing worse </garnt>
<garnt> than a [ __ ] jrpg corrupting and i've </garnt>
<garnt> had it i've had on gamecube i've had it </garnt>
<garnt> on ps2 i still have never finished star </garnt>
<garnt> ocean three because i've gotten [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> 60 hours into the game i was invested </garnt>
<garnt> and then the memory card got corrupted </garnt>
<garnt> and i just lost 60 hours of my life i i </garnt>
<garnt> and i've never gotten it back and i </garnt>
<joey> don't know what the ending of that game </joey>
<joey> is i i i had it even worse once i think </joey>
<joey> it was like the the second time i played </joey>
<joey> uh a final fantasy game i was playing </joey>
<joey> final fantasy 6 for the first time on </joey>
<joey> super nintendo and i was like 40 hours </joey>
<connor> in i think i was like maybe like two </connor>
<connor> bosses away </connor>
<connor> and uh and just one of my cousins walked </connor>
<connor> past kicked the snes it completely reset </connor>
<connor> completely reset my file what the hell </connor>
<connor> it's like a light tap like that </connor>
<joey> it just went </joey>
<connor> just died and i was like </connor>
<joey> what happened flicked it back on </joey>
<connor> corrupt all gone yeah and i was like i i </connor>
<joey> had i've never been that close to </joey>
<joey> committing murder in my life </joey>
<joey> but i was that close like eight-year-old </joey>
<joey> mia was like </joey>
<joey> is this how like serial murders start </joey>
<joey> joey was a good boy until the day </joey>
<joey> until he wasn't until that day when </joey>
<joey> someone kicked his ass </joey>
<joey> and then i realized and then that's when </joey>
<connor> i realized just the </connor>
<connor> absolute fragility of these like old </connor>
<connor> consoles that literally just a tiny it </connor>
<joey> wasn't even like a boot it was like </joey>
<connor> literally just like a little like it was </connor>
<connor> it was either you you had like an </connor>
<connor> absolute tank or you got very unlucky </connor>
<joey> and one tap did it like i i swear to god </joey>
<joey> i dropped my nintendo ds like a million </joey>
<joey> times a child oh dude those things are </joey>
<joey> brick [ __ ] houses yeah but i heard yeah </joey>
<joey> but somehow you know my my ps2 would </joey>
<connor> just [ __ ] itself all the time </connor>
<connor> but i swear everyone else's ps2 was a </connor>
<garnt> tank so i i don't really like like for </garnt>
<garnt> some reason like they're always like the </garnt>
<garnt> sony ones well just like the most </garnt>
<garnt> fragile things compared like being a </garnt>
<connor> nintendo switch 360s i've seen like how </connor>
<connor> how those things survive i don't even </connor>
<connor> know man even though the red ring of </connor>
<garnt> death like yeah yeah yeah like </garnt>
<garnt> i know like do you remember did you ever </garnt>
<garnt> have that experience on a ps2 where you </garnt>
<garnt> you know you go up to the loading screen </garnt>
<connor> and then you put it the disc in and you </connor>
<connor> just like you're praying for like a few </connor>
<connor> seconds of silence you're praying to god </connor>
<connor> that you're gonna get the </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> and yeah it's and when you don't you </connor>
<connor> have this like it's like this [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> hellish dimension right where where the </connor>
<garnt> ps2 just turns into like the gates of </garnt>
<garnt> like the [ __ ] gates of hell opened up </garnt>
<garnt> it's all red you're just like oh i've </garnt>
<garnt> got a corrupt disk oh no </garnt>
<connor> how do you even do that how do you get a </connor>
<connor> corrupt disk how does that even happen </connor>
<garnt> how do you not do that i'm sure have you </garnt>
<garnt> never have you never opened like had a </garnt>
<joey> had a full og like xboxes like if that </joey>
<joey> was like one </joey>
<connor> like micro meter oh actually oh they're </connor>
<joey> being scratched yeah no not even a </joey>
<joey> scratch if there's like just a tiny bit </joey>
<connor> of dust on it it just wouldn't run i </connor>
<connor> remember there was like disc cleaning </connor>
<connor> services at like game stores </connor>
<joey> and uh really yeah yeah in the uk and </joey>
<joey> they just didn't [ __ ] work like at </joey>
<joey> all like you paid like 30 pounds yeah </joey>
<connor> which is like the cost of a game at that </connor>
<connor> time right and you'd get like two </connor>
<connor> disspec and then she didn't didn't do </connor>
<connor> anything it didn't work they'd be like </connor>
<connor> yeah it's good to go i'm like no it's </connor>
<connor> not i put it in did you even try it no </connor>
<joey> yeah it worked i'm like coffee didn't </joey>
<joey> that's why i like the you know like the </joey>
<connor> super nintendo cartridges right because </connor>
<connor> it's like if it didn't work cartridges </connor>
<connor> are pretty nice wall on that [ __ ] like </connor>
<joey> smack it against the wall if you want </joey>
<joey> you pop it in and it magically works oh </joey>
<garnt> so </garnt>
<garnt> speaking of the cartridges things you </garnt>
<garnt> should never do yeah um i remember how </garnt>
<connor> like i had a [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] like it was like you know you </connor>
<connor> know some kids are just [ __ ] yeah </connor>
<connor> absolutely no reason yeah so we had like </connor>
<connor> this uh we had like this distant </connor>
<connor> relative friend who like yeah she's no </connor>
<connor> longer a friend no no no you you'll hear </connor>
<connor> this </connor>
<connor> you'll hear the story and you're like </connor>
<garnt> you know you know family or unions </garnt>
<connor> especially asian family unions they're </connor>
<garnt> like some kids there some people that </garnt>
<connor> you don't know how you're related to all </connor>
<connor> your families related to but it's like a </connor>
<connor> family friend cousin and they're always </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] worse so i remember we were like </connor>
<connor> playing goldeneye on the n64 he only </connor>
<connor> chose our job didn't he huh but he chose </connor>
<connor> no no no no he didn't no no no he he he </connor>
<connor> didn't do that uh he he got he got </connor>
<connor> smacked he got smashed he got batted and </connor>
<connor> he was a pretty good scorer yeah we we </connor>
<connor> scored him it was four before it was uh </connor>
<connor> it was a four player game yeah he died </connor>
<connor> immediately yeah and he he got </connor>
<connor> humiliated and what did he do </connor>
<connor> he just went over to the n64 and just </connor>
<connor> took the cartridge out </connor>
<connor> no </connor>
<connor> no turning off the console no nothing </connor>
<connor> just took the cartridge that's a big </connor>
<connor> no-no you can't do that </connor>
<connor> i'm just like i'm just like you know you </connor>
<joey> know the you know the debate of like </joey>
<connor> whether people can be born evil </connor>
<joey> like i'm just like clearly kids are born </joey>
<garnt> evil like i'm clearly just witnessing </garnt>
<connor> johann lieber right here there are some </connor>
<garnt> kids that you're like you you </garnt>
<joey> you must have been born for something </joey>
<joey> wrong you came out the womb of boston i </joey>
<connor> bet there was [ __ ] music playing when </connor>
<joey> you came out the [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> like final fantasy boss music yeah </joey>
<connor> it's like for some like as a kid as i'm </connor>
<connor> sure you can understand as well like </connor>
<connor> yeah as a gaming kid right there was </connor>
<connor> like you could punch me you could you </connor>
<connor> could spit on me you could stamp me but </connor>
<connor> you don't touch the game console no </connor>
<connor> that's a big no no you don't doesn't </connor>
<connor> matter how heated [ __ ] gets you stay </connor>
<connor> away from the people that's sacrilegious </connor>
<connor> that's like that's like the stuff that </connor>
<connor> you i was i was a calm kid at times but </connor>
<connor> the one thing that would set me off like </connor>
<connor> you touched the game console while it's </connor>
<garnt> on that's yeah i'm a loser i don't care </garnt>
<connor> who you are yeah one of my biggest pet </connor>
<connor> peeves as a kid whenever i play with </connor>
<connor> like a mate or something or whenever i </connor>
<connor> have mates over is for some reason </connor>
<garnt> everyone had [ __ ] greasy hands and </garnt>
<garnt> their controllers would grease up their </garnt>
<connor> hands would grease up </connor>
<garnt> ps2 controller yeah like like my biggest </garnt>
<garnt> pet peeve was when you know when we were </garnt>
<garnt> having food or something and we had </garnt>
<connor> pizza and they would they would be </connor>
<connor> eating the pizza while playing the game </connor>
<connor> and i could say </connor>
<connor> get a wet wipe please </connor>
<connor> and i could see their greasy hands going </connor>
<joey> on the controller and i'm just like you </joey>
<garnt> know what maybe friendship's overrated </garnt>
<joey> this this is why i played the forms </joey>
<garnt> of grease in like in between like the </garnt>
<joey> button and the yeah </joey>
<connor> like physically see it that's why you </connor>
<connor> know when people grab pizza and there is </connor>
<connor> kitchen all available i'm like you </connor>
<connor> absolute animal why didn't you that was </connor>
<connor> a perfectly good kitchen roll on the </connor>
<connor> table why do you not take a slice yeah </connor>
<connor> you know for the crumbs or just to wipe </connor>
<connor> your hands on you know this is pizza </connor>
<garnt> it's greasy come on </garnt>
<garnt> yeah please please learn some manners </garnt>
<connor> especially as adults because i feel like </connor>
<connor> even even as adults there's some people </connor>
<connor> who don't do that as well and i don't </connor>
<connor> know greasy controllers are just like </connor>
<garnt> one of my biggest pet peeves yeah that's </garnt>
<connor> pretty disgusting because it's kind of </connor>
<connor> hard to clean it yeah it is </connor>
<connor> i was gonna say something i totally </connor>
<connor> forgot </connor>
<connor> you know what was my my most hated genre </connor>
<connor> of video online it is like yeah genre of </connor>
<connor> video it is the people who turn people's </connor>
<connor> game consoles off of like 10 year old </connor>
<joey> kids while they're playing and they're </joey>
<joey> like look he's getting angry yeah no </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] he's getting angry you just turn </joey>
<joey> that [ __ ] off i've never heard of that </joey>
<joey> genre of videos you know you must have </joey>
<joey> seen them there's tons of videos out </joey>
<joey> there where people just go up to like </joey>
<joey> their little brother turn the game </joey>
<joey> console off or pc off while they're </joey>
<connor> playing minecraft or something what a </connor>
<connor> cut and then and then they're like haha </connor>
<connor> look he's getting angry yeah no [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> he's getting angry he's probably </connor>
<joey> building his [ __ ] world yeah that's </joey>
<joey> like the adulting version of that is </joey>
<connor> like if your friend was driving and then </connor>
<joey> you just pulled the [ __ ] keys i was </joey>
<connor> like oh look he's angry yeah no [ __ ] he </connor>
<connor> it might as well be [ __ ] life </connor>
<connor> it's one of those things where it's like </connor>
<connor> okay </connor>
<connor> doing something to like </connor>
<connor> if that kid actually turned off his own </connor>
<connor> pc that's funny you know if he gets </connor>
<connor> angry yeah this is his fault he did yeah </connor>
<connor> but when you do to someone you know it's </connor>
<connor> like okay just because you don't </connor>
<connor> understand the hobby and you don't </connor>
<connor> understand how invested someone is [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> you thinking that it's just funny </connor>
<connor> because you oh you're here you turned </connor>
<connor> off you've got a reaction do something </connor>
<connor> else what's wrong with you this is what </connor>
<joey> it's like especially when it's like </joey>
<joey> unwarranted right yeah how sad is your </joey>
<joey> life that you have to do this to someone </joey>
<joey> that you have to just turn their game </joey>
<garnt> console off to get some views on </garnt>
<garnt> instagram or something like [ __ ] off </garnt>
<joey> ridiculed yeah where have you started </joey>
<joey> seeing me yeah these things have been </joey>
<joey> around for decades online i think i've </joey>
<joey> just like avoided watching them some of </joey>
<connor> the like most popular clips back in the </connor>
<connor> day were like brothers turning off each </connor>
<connor> other's game consoles while they were </connor>
<connor> playing and like watching their kid rage </connor>
<connor> i mean the only ones that's a big thing </connor>
<joey> i mean the only one i know is like the </joey>
<garnt> kid who got like his uh wow account </garnt>
<garnt> deleted by his mom right yeah he's like </garnt>
<garnt> freaking out oh that's staged there yeah </garnt>
<joey> yeah that's stage but i feel like i've </joey>
<connor> seen some videos where that's been true </connor>
<connor> or just you've seen it yeah i've seen </connor>
<garnt> i've seen some of those videos where </garnt>
<connor> just accounts get deleted but like </connor>
<connor> because obviously now because two talk </connor>
<connor> is </connor>
<connor> rising right so i feel like two talk has </connor>
<connor> been going through a lot of the old </connor>
<connor> trends that happened back in the day </connor>
<connor> yeah and i've been seeing it a lot on </connor>
<joey> tick tock and i'm like this isn't funny </joey>
<joey> this is just a [ __ ] like how are you </joey>
<joey> getting likes for this what was it funny </joey>
<connor> back in the day though when you're </connor>
<connor> watching it </connor>
<connor> but yeah but that's because like the </connor>
<connor> kids would like stage it and they would </connor>
<connor> like make these like insane reactions </connor>
<garnt> funny back in the day when i was younger </garnt>
<garnt> yeah when i was i'm older now now </garnt>

<connor> kids shouting and screaming yeah and now </connor>
<connor> now i'm an adult and i'm like but then </connor>

<connor> wrong with you if my if you know if i'm </connor>
<connor> 10 and my childhood brother did it to me </connor>
<connor> that's probably funny to another 12 year </connor>

<joey> how i feel about like almost youtube all </joey>
<connor> like just internet that should be like </connor>
<connor> uh you know when you go to the doctor to </connor>
<connor> get your child birth they should play a </connor>
<joey> series of videos and they'll ask you is </joey>
<joey> this funny if you laugh at any of them </joey>
<joey> they just deny it yeah yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<connor> we're taking the kid </connor>
<joey> you clearly don't have the right child </joey>
<joey> services is just standing there like </joey>
<joey> waiting for you to laugh </joey>
<connor> it's like do it i like you all right </connor>
<connor> next up we have the uh screaming in </connor>
<connor> public challenge yeah here you go i </connor>
<connor> don't know if they laugh a little </connor>
<connor> show the tide pod challenge do you think </connor>
<connor> did you think that was a good idea </connor>
<connor> yeah how does it make you feel </connor>
<connor> i don't know </connor>
<joey> it's so tragic [ __ ] man we're a [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> person rorschach test that's terrible </joey>
<garnt> did you ever find [ __ ] like jackass or </garnt>
<garnt> something funny back in the day though </garnt>
<connor> yeah but that's because i think it was </connor>
<connor> it was new and it was unheard of and you </connor>
<connor> know as well when it was on tv there was </connor>
<garnt> a lot of disconnect yeah i feel like </garnt>
<connor> that disconnect from tv is just gone </connor>
<connor> because there was always like i don't </connor>
<connor> know as it might not have been true but </connor>
<connor> as a kid i was just if it was on tv then </connor>
<garnt> there was always that disconnect of like </garnt>
<garnt> oh this is maybe staged or they sorted </garnt>
<garnt> something out it's or people in that </garnt>
<garnt> video got compensation of some form well </garnt>
<connor> because you know when when jackass did </connor>
<connor> those stunts in public you know even </connor>
<connor> back then the rules were the same you </connor>
<connor> can't just upload any footage of any </connor>
<garnt> person's face you have to get a release </garnt>
<connor> form yeah so they were that means that </connor>
<connor> the person they pranked clearly signed </connor>
<connor> off on it yeah because you have to get </connor>
<connor> the release from or they've blurred yeah </connor>
<joey> and in that case it's like all right </joey>
<joey> well i like jackass back in the day but </joey>
<joey> like that tho the ones where they would </joey>
<garnt> do [ __ ] in public with like just you </garnt>
<garnt> know random people in the streets i did </garnt>
<connor> not like watching those just because </connor>
<connor> like i felt bad for the people who got </connor>
<connor> involved right what was it but i like </connor>
<connor> the ones where they would just like do </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] with each other and just laugh at </connor>
<connor> each other like those are [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> hilarious but yeah but you know also </connor>
<connor> that even with jackass right a network </connor>
<garnt> is standing off on this they all </garnt>
<garnt> following rules right the problem is </garnt>
<garnt> with like when people are doing this in </garnt>
<garnt> public and they're doing it on their own </garnt>
<garnt> there's no rules there's no release </garnt>
<garnt> forms there's no procedure around this </garnt>
<garnt> and even if you aren't going to prank </garnt>
<garnt> someone you can't just show their face </garnt>
<connor> like you have to get a release yeah like </connor>
<connor> it's it's it's a mess and uh i think the </connor>
<connor> problem is that because they've we've </connor>
<connor> seen this on tv the younger generation </connor>
<connor> think that oh okay well i can just do </connor>
<connor> that it's like no no no no no no </connor>
<joey> there's lots of adulting things there's </joey>
<joey> a reason why all the big prank channels </joey>
<joey> fake fake the stunt uh the pranks </joey>
<joey> because it gets the point otherwise they </joey>
<joey> can't get away with it yeah you can't </joey>
<joey> like getting release forms is a </joey>
<joey> nightmare and also you know getting the </joey>
<connor> even getting the reactions you want is a </connor>
<connor> pain in the ass and then you get you </connor>
<connor> have to get them to sign a release yeah </connor>
<garnt> so it's it's </garnt>
<garnt> a lot of prank channels just are </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] </garnt>
<connor> and they died yeah well nearly all of </connor>
<connor> them like a lot of them ran into trouble </connor>
<joey> like i mean </joey>
<joey> vitalia whatever was in prison </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah went to prison in egypt what </joey>
<joey> did he do he climbed the [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> pyramids oh yeah that's right </connor>
<connor> yeah and then and then when he got let </connor>
<connor> out he was like it's the worst thing </connor>
<connor> ever and then he got out and then went </connor>
<connor> and beat up some old woman </connor>
<joey> he jumped old woman in like santa monica </joey>
<connor> he actually went insane like he like </connor>
<connor> beat the he nearly killed this woman </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] i think i don't do pranks yeah </garnt>
<connor> because i think the the the one story i </connor>
<connor> remember was like two kids uh oh that </connor>
<connor> was the two the two brothers who uh </connor>
<connor> who faked a like a burglary or something </connor>
<joey> like that or fake like </joey>
<connor> yeah and they got the uber yeah </connor>
<joey> then they got the uber and the uber </joey>
<joey> refused to drive them and they were like </joey>
<joey> what an [ __ ] uber driver who wouldn't </joey>
<garnt> drive us and i was just like what what </garnt>
<garnt> is going on in this world right now and </garnt>
<joey> they thought it was hilarious and the </joey>
<joey> people yeah and like millions of people </joey>
<connor> found that hilarious it's tragic yeah </connor>
<connor> and like you know that that prank where </connor>
<connor> that oh what a prank or that challenge </connor>
<garnt> where that guy tried to uh see how many </garnt>
<garnt> if a book could stop a desert eagle or </garnt>
<connor> something </connor>
<garnt> which you know right you have to you </garnt>
<connor> can't help but left and the ghost </connor>
<joey> girlfriend literally shot the boyfriend </joey>
<joey> she killed him and it's like it's like </joey>
<joey> this is tragic because like you know </joey>
<joey> people obviously getting these ideas </joey>
<joey> from watching this [ __ ] online it's </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] terrible i i think pranks are </connor>
<connor> generally just dodged </connor>
<connor> and any prank that isn't like a very </connor>
<connor> just like chill prank on like someone </connor>
<joey> you know </joey>
<joey> yeah you know those pranks are hilarious </joey>
<connor> right the ones the ones that always end </connor>
<connor> with the person getting pranked laughing </connor>
<joey> yeah is like you know the ones that are </joey>
<connor> like fine spray your housemate with </connor>
<joey> water you put a pie whatever that's all </joey>
<joey> good you know but like i just think when </joey>
<joey> you're doing it to strangers and they </joey>
<joey> have no say it's like and and it's </joey>
<connor> something that could hurt them or </connor>
<connor> something like genuinely scare them like </connor>
<garnt> you could be traumatized if yeah some of </garnt>
<garnt> these absolutely </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] that no just like just like don't </joey>
<connor> be an [ __ ] basically it's it's it's </connor>
<joey> such a fine line because you know the </joey>
<connor> the line between a lot of psychopaths </connor>
<connor> they don't know what that </connor>
<connor> and uh you know unfortunately we live in </connor>
<connor> a climate where a lot of times being an </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] gives you good you're rewarded </connor>
<connor> you get rewarded for it yeah and it's </connor>
<garnt> unfortunate man we're just like growing </garnt>
<garnt> into like old bitter old men aren't we i </garnt>
<connor> just jesus man i don't know if it's </connor>
<connor> because i've just been on youtube so </connor>
<connor> long man that's just some genres i don't </connor>
<connor> like to be like elitist and look down on </connor>
<connor> genres of youtube yeah but pranks is one </connor>
<connor> of the challenges but then i do </connor>
<joey> but then i certainly will for the pranks </joey>
<connor> yeah absolutely that should have died </connor>
<connor> long ago i mean and luckily they have i </connor>
<connor> feel in a lot of ways but i i mean </connor>
<connor> they've died on youtube but now they've </connor>
<joey> just i think they've just migrated to </joey>
<joey> tickets </joey>
<garnt> they they started on youtube and then </garnt>
<garnt> vine was also there was so many prank </garnt>
<garnt> vines as well and then now i think </garnt>
<garnt> they've just both migrated to tick-tock </garnt>
<connor> as well and it's just i've been watching </connor>
<connor> a lot of youtube shorts and i just lose </connor>
<joey> my mind watching this stuff why are you </joey>
<joey> watching </joey>
<joey> it pops up and i watch them some of them </joey>
<joey> are funny something pretty good but </joey>
<joey> obviously just all reposts yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah but like there's some there's </joey>
<joey> like some genre videos that i just think </joey>
<connor> i absolutely despise to death and uh one </connor>
<connor> of them is like this is genre i don't </connor>
<connor> understand it at all </connor>
<connor> oh this is video and there's this guy </connor>
<connor> right and there's like imagine that your </connor>
<connor> phone is vertical whatever it's cut into </connor>
<garnt> two </garnt>
<garnt> there'll be one video of the guy </garnt>
<garnt> explaining the video that is about to </garnt>
<garnt> play before you </garnt>
<garnt> okay that is very self-explanatory right </garnt>
<garnt> right so there's one where there was </garnt>
<garnt> this video and he was like this guy's </garnt>
<connor> like here are the different types of </connor>
<connor> pokemon compared to each other in size </connor>
<connor> and it goes like pikachu one meter </connor>
<connor> snorlax one minute </connor>

<connor> you to tell me what this is and i don't </connor>

<joey> explained </joey>
<joey> screaming he's still on screen the whole </joey>
<joey> time he's just sitting there he's like </joey>
<connor> and then he'll go like whoa that's big </connor>
<connor> well i didn't expect that pokemon to be </connor>
<joey> big and it's like what is this what is </joey>
<connor> this you saw someone else's video you </connor>

<joey> just wait for them to eventually get </joey>
<connor> onto twitter yeah yeah </connor>
<garnt> you know if they like like make their </garnt>
<garnt> way on like youtube compilations or </garnt>
<garnt> twitter which is how i consume most of </garnt>
<garnt> my tic toc because i did i i did </garnt>
<garnt> actually try downloading tick tock uh </garnt>
<garnt> the other day and i gave it a go and i </garnt>
<garnt> was just like </garnt>
<garnt> oh it's just </garnt>
<garnt> i i'm i'm i'm i don't have enough </garnt>
<garnt> patience for the algorithm to find what </garnt>
<garnt> i've really liked because there's so </garnt>
<garnt> much [ __ ] you go through and there's </garnt>
<garnt> like it's so weird seeing some of the </garnt>
<garnt> tick tocks that are there because i </garnt>
<garnt> remember </garnt>
<garnt> i remember i remember going through </garnt>
<garnt> animatic talk right and seeing okay i'm </garnt>
<garnt> i am i am an anime youtuber i trade i </garnt>
<garnt> wonder what anime tick tock is uh is up </garnt>
<connor> to that was your first </connor>
<garnt> mistake asking that question so so there </garnt>
<joey> was this like really really weird trend </joey>
<joey> that was going on which is like the </joey>
<joey> silhouette trend or something like that </joey>
<joey> right i remember that [ __ ] okay okay so </joey>
<connor> you know you know what i'm talking about </connor>
<connor> well like we're like these girls or guys </connor>
<connor> would like basically </connor>
<garnt> pretend that they were making out with a </garnt>
<connor> silhouette of a character or something </connor>
<garnt> right yeah and one of those funny </garnt>
<connor> i'm wondering not really but it's just </connor>
<garnt> like it's 100 serious it's ironic oh </garnt>
<connor> it's ironically funny oh i thought i </connor>
<connor> thought </connor>
<connor> just pretend like you're making out with </connor>
<garnt> someone right and it's like there's no </garnt>
<connor> irony to it it is just </connor>
<connor> it is just that yeah and i remember i </connor>
<garnt> was browsing anime tick tock and i saw a </garnt>
<garnt> clip which had like millions and </garnt>
<garnt> millions of views on this clip and it's </garnt>
<garnt> this and then there's this girl who's </garnt>
<garnt> pretending to make up with a silhouette </garnt>
<garnt> of barkago and they literally look they </garnt>
<garnt> literally put in sound clips of the dub </garnt>
<joey> to make it seem like he's like uh he's </joey>
<joey> in a he's in a dominating fashion </joey>
<joey> for this tick tock and i'm just like </joey>
<joey> i must be getting old because i remember </joey>
<joey> i remember if you did this like when i </joey>
<joey> was an anime fan growing up you'd get </joey>
<joey> bullied for this you would get chris you </joey>
<garnt> would like this like this is the type of </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] pretty good people got internet </garnt>
<connor> bullied for man i like the jojo post </connor>
<garnt> wrong it's like jojo jojo was cool that </garnt>
<joey> one was cool that was cool because it </joey>
<joey> was like yeah because like there was </joey>
<connor> either people who were just really good </connor>
<connor> at jojo posting but then there were </connor>
<connor> other people who like took that and put </connor>
<connor> like a spin on it right with like all </connor>
<connor> sorts of different anime and stuff </connor>
<connor> that's fine but like that [ __ ] is the </connor>
<connor> same as like you know like laughing at </connor>
<connor> those is the same as people you know </connor>
<connor> laughing like back in the day of like </connor>
<connor> you know watching people proposing at </connor>
<connor> anime cons and stuff like that right </connor>

<joey> just like kind of coming back but now </joey>
<garnt> it's just on tick tock now yeah yeah and </garnt>
<garnt> it's it's just so weird seeing these </garnt>
<garnt> things trending and being popular </garnt>
<garnt> because i just remember thinking </garnt>
<garnt> wow like this is </garnt>
<garnt> so much different to being an anime fan </garnt>
<garnt> when i was [ __ ] yeah when i was like </garnt>
<connor> they just like post anime scenes and </connor>
<connor> like play different music yeah and i'm </connor>
<connor> like what is this what i don't wanna </connor>

<joey> it i tried just because i saw it was </joey>
<joey> getting so big so i was like all right </joey>
<connor> well then you know if it because it is </connor>
<joey> getting so big there might be a chance </joey>
<joey> one of these days i might have to start </joey>
<connor> using it right yeah i i scrolled through </connor>
<joey> it and i just feel like i'm losing my </joey>
<joey> mind yeah i feel like my mind is going </joey>
<joey> numb watching this stuff because it's so </joey>
<connor> fast-paced you don't get a chance to do </connor>
<connor> anything you don't just like think you </connor>
<joey> just all right next next it's just it's </joey>
<joey> like literally just constantly just </joey>
<connor> watching instagram stories yeah yeah i'm </connor>

<joey> much information i was in like a black </joey>
<joey> mirror thing until i was watching </joey>
<joey> youtube shorts yeah and tick tock </joey>
<joey> because like </joey>

<connor> watch yeah but on tick tock and shorts </connor>
<connor> they just feed it to you yeah and you </connor>
<connor> don't think it's weird right like i feel </connor>
<garnt> like we're getting to the point where </garnt>
<garnt> content is being forced down your throat </garnt>
<connor> it's like not what you're choosing to </connor>
<garnt> watch right right i mean there's </garnt>
<connor> there's some content on tick tock which </connor>
<connor> was just so </connor>
<connor> weird because it's like it was almost </connor>
<joey> like hypnotic because there was some </joey>
<joey> there's some content that it's just like </joey>
<joey> had obviously like millions and millions </joey>
<joey> of views and it's just like some very </joey>
<connor> oddly satisfying thing or something or </connor>
<connor> something i don't know it's it's so hard </connor>
<connor> to describe why </connor>
<connor> i was like </connor>
<joey> not invested but just like </joey>
<connor> intrigued by it yeah but i wouldn't call </connor>
<joey> it like interesting content it was just </joey>
<connor> like oh that's uh entrenched couldn't </connor>
<connor> take your ideas that's a bit that's </connor>
<joey> that's a bit interesting all right and </joey>
<connor> next oh oh okay that's that's pretty </connor>
<connor> good right </connor>
<connor> it wasn't like i was never like </connor>
<garnt> emotionally invested in any of this </garnt>
<garnt> content which is why i kind of felt like </garnt>
<joey> almost hypnotic in a way because it </joey>
<joey> doesn't give you the time to get </joey>
<joey> emotionally invested right because it's </joey>

<joey> wrong well how how do i how do you tic </joey>

<garnt> to know i want to know where to find a </garnt>
<garnt> good content because you can't search </garnt>
<joey> like you can't search for anything like </joey>
<connor> you can but you have to sift through </connor>
<connor> just like if you look up like a hashtag </connor>
<connor> right that if you happen to find one or </connor>
<connor> like an audio file or something that you </connor>
<connor> thought was kind of funny that's been </connor>
<connor> used right like you can search for that </connor>
<joey> but in order to find like the actual </joey>
<joey> gucci you just have to sift through so </joey>
<connor> much unrelated [ __ ] i had like a few </connor>
<connor> audios of mine like get pretty big yeah </connor>
<connor> like from my youtube videos i was just </connor>
<connor> like what the [ __ ] is this because it </connor>
<connor> was like really bizarre things like </connor>
<connor> there was one where it was about me like </connor>
<connor> saying sucking dick or something yeah </connor>
<connor> and cosplay and it like those so many </connor>
<garnt> people who used it to make tick tocks i </garnt>
<garnt> was so confused because it was like he's </garnt>
<garnt> like 13 year old kids being like there's </garnt>
<garnt> no time to talk i need to wear cosplay </garnt>
<garnt> and suck dick or something and i'm like </garnt>
<garnt> is this okay </garnt>
<garnt> what is going on i'm so confused and i </garnt>
<joey> was like okay uh hopefully people don't </joey>
<connor> watch my videos uh because some of these </connor>
<connor> kids look really young yeah it's yeah </connor>
<connor> i've had a couple of things yeah i've </connor>
<connor> had a couple of tick tocks where they've </connor>
<connor> used my audio i like it though i think </connor>
<connor> it's interesting it's it's really cool </connor>
<connor> because it's like oh that's you know </connor>
<connor> that's kind of flattering that they </connor>
<connor> thought it was funny though i just feel </connor>
<connor> like i think look at it i'm like yeah </connor>
<connor> what's going on but yeah but at the same </connor>
<joey> time i'm like that's cool but at the </joey>
<joey> same time i look at i'm like why are you </joey>
<joey> doing this </joey>
<connor> well i just thought i was thinking i was </connor>
<connor> like surely i've said other things in in </connor>
<connor> an order that are more entertaining and </connor>
<joey> more useful than that like of all the </joey>
<joey> things i've said you thought this one </joey>
<connor> was yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> i mean that's how the internet is right </connor>
<connor> it just takes things off i don't know i </connor>
<joey> don't know it's weird we don't we don't </joey>
<joey> know how to tick talk yeah </joey>
<joey> have you ever like legitimately thought </joey>
<joey> being like i need to start a tick tock </joey>
<garnt> no </garnt>
<garnt> i mean i i'd like because there's lots </garnt>
<joey> of youtubers right now who are like i </joey>
<connor> don't know </connor>
<connor> i'm not convinced the tick tock audience </connor>
<garnt> is </garnt>
<garnt> well the demographic i want right i </garnt>
<garnt> don't know i like the demographic i have </garnt>
<garnt> right now yeah i like just chill and do </garnt>
<connor> mine things streaming games i mean it's </connor>
<garnt> it's like i think we've grown up we've </garnt>
<connor> brought we've like made an audience that </connor>
<connor> like us for us luckily enough and like </connor>
<connor> the content we make i don't feel like i </connor>
<joey> need to move myself on a different </joey>
<garnt> platform just because that platform is </garnt>
<joey> getting popular right it's kind of like </joey>
<joey> yeah we've definitely grown with that </joey>
<garnt> well our audience has grown with us yeah </garnt>
<garnt> it's kind of like why i i get so many </garnt>
<garnt> messages about this about god why don't </garnt>
<connor> you use instagram why don't why don't </connor>
<connor> you post more on instagram </connor>
<connor> it's the simple answer of i just i'm </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] at taking photos okay i just forget </connor>
<joey> to document my life i'm sorry i feel </joey>
<connor> that okay and it's just you know i'm </connor>
<joey> that's why i get my girlfriend to take </joey>
<joey> photos of me because i'm so [ __ ] at </joey>
<joey> taking photos of myself </joey>
<garnt> and it's just like you know you you get </garnt>
<garnt> brands coming to be like oh instagram's </garnt>
<connor> the you know instagram for the most </connor>
<connor> viewers and the most like audience and </connor>
<connor> the biggest numbers and i'm just like </connor>
<joey> well is that really valuable just going </joey>
<joey> on a platform just because it's got big </joey>
<joey> numbers and a big audience or is it like </joey>
<joey> as a content creator i find it's way </joey>
<garnt> more valuable even if you're promoting </garnt>
<garnt> to a smaller audience that it's an </garnt>
<garnt> audience that is more suitable for the </garnt>
<garnt> stuff that you're making right right so </garnt>
<garnt> i'm not going to make a tick tock just </garnt>
<garnt> because it's popular unless i think i </garnt>
<garnt> actually like tick tock well i think i </garnt>
<connor> can make good tick tocks you know </connor>
<connor> because otherwise i'm going to get a </connor>
<connor> bunch of audience that i don't </connor>
<connor> understand or yeah </connor>
<connor> and then </connor>
<connor> and then and then i will literally be </connor>
<connor> the boomer that yeah you know just like </connor>
<garnt> oh let's let's connect with the kids </garnt>
