<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know why those
are the first two words, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I came up with. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Why is this episode demonetized, Joey? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Why, why? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> (soft music) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, please, it was just

<SPEAKER_02> - Exactly.

<SPEAKER_00> But, I'm a host for the day, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> the Australian boy- - He
just spilled water. (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - He just spilled water all over himself, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> during my fucking intro. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Sorry, I'm just
pissing myself right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm here with the boy
who pissed his pants, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and the boy who shits his pants. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's me, that's me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> People are gonna be
like, is there a story? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Yeah, no, there's a story. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Do you wanna start that off? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Guess we're starting strong then. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Hey I shit myself. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Am kidding, I didn't, but I did. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - You had a full week
of shitting yourself. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Since last week apparently.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I'm still shitting myself. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- So, after the podcast, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we went to Izakaya, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which we'll talk more about later. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And we had liver and- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, you and our producer did. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Only me and Meilyne had liver. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> And, Meilyne, didn't tell me, I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Is anyone else sick?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And, Meilyne, was like, "No, no, nobody." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then five days later- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Meanwhile she's like (indictinct). </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Then five days later, she was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh, yeah, I was sick by the way, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just didn't wanna think that you... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I gave you COVID or something." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, "What the fuck?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "What the fuck, telling me you're sick." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Way to go, Meilyne, thanks a lot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Thank you so much. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Thank you for endangering your hosts. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - So, I'm pretty sure it was like that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that got me food poisoning. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Got the food poisoning-
- Because, Garnt, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and I didn't have the liver. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I remember you messaging us, being like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Hey, is anyone feeling tired?" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> And, Joey, said, he's feeling fine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, "Yeah, I'm might
be feeling pretty fatigued. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Maybe we've just done a lot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I didn't realize, Connor, was
just dying in the next room. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - So, the day after, I
remember I had a call, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> at 10 am, and I was fine, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then I got a bunch
of Jojo Merch shipped. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah.
- Cool, great, I opened it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Day in the life of Connor. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah, right.
- So, like Jojo merch came in, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> very normal day for me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> and then after I opened it, put it down, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I was like, fucking, holy shit, I'm tired. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like I'm weak.
- ]Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I was like, "Oh, my God." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then later on in the day I was like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, I'll order a curry." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's a good idea. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I have no idea why I thought a curry, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> was the best idea, and I ordered a lot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- And I also ate a lot of it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- I had a whole naan, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like shit tons of rice. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Real fucking spicy curry. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Sides, as well, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for some reason I went all out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I was like, what
my body needs is energy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right.
- That's what it needs. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And the best way to get energy, curry. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Dirtiest, dirty curry. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Dirty curry. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So, and then I was like,
okay, I feel a little better, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> like from the first five minutes, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and immediately after I was
like, "Oh no, I'm in pain." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> My stomach started really hurting. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- I was like fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then this whole time, I'm thinking, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> do I have COVID, do I have COVID? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Fuck, fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean, that's the first thing that goes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> over anyone's mind. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right now, yeah- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Who gets ill right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like sometimes I have like a slight fever. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like shit, shit, shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I cough in public, bro I've got it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm dead, dude. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Everyone's gonna think I have COVID. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, I was especially worried with you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause you texted me being like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> bro, I almost fucking fainted. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, so that night, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I texted you that the next day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And the night of, I was
like curled up in a ball </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in my bed, boiling, but like shivering. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Sweating nonstop, my
bed was damp as fuck, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when I woke up, disgusting,
I know, I'm sorry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then I had a horrible, horrible fever, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> couldn't get out of bed, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I had such bad stomach pain at night, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I was like, all right,
I gotta vomit (indictinct). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- [Alex] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then I vomited and I
was like, great, I feel good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then I sleep for one hour, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then I gotta vomit again. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then I'm shitting myself all day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm dying, I can't get off the floor, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I like nearly fainted, and
then like an hour later, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I fainted, and I was like,
oh my God, all right, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I gotta go to hospital, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause what if this is like COVID, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - So, there's like a hospital
right next to our house, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> which was lucky. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like a five minute walk. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, and I had a friend call them up, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and see if they could let me in. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And they were like,
yeah, sure, come on down. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And so they were like,
yeah, come through the back. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Come on down!
- Come on down! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - They were like, yeah, man, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just bring that insurance. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Bring that big old insurance
card, and just come on down. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then I went there, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they were like
someone like, (indictinct) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or something was gonna greet me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And someone comes out in
a fucking hazmat suit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And he was like, Connor san? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was like, yeah, yeah, hi. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And they bring me in, they
lock me in this room alone, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause obviously they
think I might have COVID, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I had COVID symptoms. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then they're like
(speaks in foreign language) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> and I was like, (speaks
in foreign language). </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then they were like, "Oh, okay, okay." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So, then they bring a
nurse in who can speak, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> pretty broken English, but good enough. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And they would, luckily, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> there's one doctor in this building, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that could speak semi decent English. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- So, he came in, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he was like, "You have COVID symptoms. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So we give you test." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> And I was like, "Oh,
cool, cool, yeah, sure." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> And then he's like, "I will
put this in your nose." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, "Okay." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then he just fucking grabs
my head like this, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like from a distance.
- Come here! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - From a fucking distance, grabs my head, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and shoves this thing
in, and I'm like, ah! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause it's quite long. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- It's like this big, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's fucking horrible. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then he puts it in, and
then he puts it in a little bit, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I'm like, "Okay, this is fine." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Then he's like (indictinct). </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You know how like when they
put the sword in the stomach, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and put it in a little bit, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and then fucking turn it in? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm pretty sure that's how
they used to give lobotomies. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yes, that's what I was thinking. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They push it in, and then they
start drilling away, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And he was like doing that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and then he fucking shoved it in. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, ah! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, (speaks in foreign language). </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then the nurse was laughing at me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, all right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like you knew this champ. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Bear in mind, in this whole time, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I have no idea what's really happening. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And they sent me to do a bunch
of other tests and stuff, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I feel like a lab rat. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm just like in this room,
I don't know what's happening, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then they're like, sure, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then immediately after that I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (speaks in foreign language). </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> And then they're like laughing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause obviously I have
like very selective words, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I can choose from.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know the actual words, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> so I'm tryna pick the closest word, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> to describe what's happening. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like how many times... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> How many ways, can I use the word </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (speaks in foreign language)? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (foreign language) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then she's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then she immediately, after, right, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when I'm like this, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> She grabs my arm, starts putting
the blood thing around me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and starts tightening it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> I literally was like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (speaks in foreign language). </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'Cause I'm still, I'm faint. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm already feeling
feverish, I'm fainting. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm gonna faint, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> please, you just shoved
this thing in my mouth. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm dying, I literally said, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (speaks in foreign language). </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Again, she's giggling and
I'm like, "What the fuck?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Just like sticks it
in, and I'm like, okay, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> I got no say in this, and then
she's doing it, and I'm like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (speaks in foreign language), </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause I don't know how
to say I'm gonna faint. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But then she takes it out, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and she's like props me on the
bed, and I'm like, all right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> She's just like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (speaks in foreign language). </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm like, okay, cool, cool. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - For the COVID results. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then she comes in the room, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and she looks at it, turns around, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and she's looking really happy, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> she's like, "Oh, (speaks
in foreign language), </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it's (foreign language)." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> No joke, she says, "Bad," and I'm... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And she's like, it's bad. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - You got it, son. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's bad.
- You did it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I'm like it's bad? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like negative, positives? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> She's like, "Oh, oh, negative" I'm like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Are you fucking kidding me? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Are you kidding me? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Don't scare me like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - That is the most beautiful
Google translated conversation </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I've ever seen. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm just sitting there, the
whole 30 minutes thinking, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all right, if I have COVID, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I got to tell like, Joey,
and got to tell Garnt, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> got to tell everyone I've
been in contact with, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I've got to tell them
everywhere I've been, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've got to stay at home for two weeks, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, fuck, fuck, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like everything.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then when she said that to me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like fuck, oh no! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's bad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it's bad and then
luckily it was nothing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and then they did more tests to me, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> it was really fast though,
it was like two hours. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't have to wait or anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - As someone from the
UK, it's really weird, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> going to any other healthcare system, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and just being able to get your results, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and going and seeing
the doctor the same day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Having an x-ray on the day of, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and getting the results on the day, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> that doesn't happen in the UK. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, really? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I remember, I thought I broke my leg, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and they made me make an appointment </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> for like a week and a
half to get the x-ray. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - What? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I thought, what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Bro my leg is like fucked now, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what do you mean- (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I need the x-ray now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What'd you expect me to do with this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> for a whole week and a half, yeah? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I guess, 'cause it's free, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Everyone gets it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah.
- So, I mean, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I guess you can argue,
which is better, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, you have to
pay for it here, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - You pay 1/3 right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's very cheap. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, I paid 1/3, and I
paid $77 for a COVID test, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> a blood test and a CT, a CAT scan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, Americans are probably
like losing their shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - They're like what the fuck? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like a CT scan, for $77?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - What the fuck? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, I got the breakdown, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the COVID test was 600 yen so like $5. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like five bucks, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> It was like nothing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - 'Cause I remember I had to
take Aki to the hospital once, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> this was like a year ago. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think she squirted
shampoo directly into her eye. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, yeah, I remember that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And she was like, I can't see, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think I've gone blind. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> So I had to call up the hospital, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> obviously get an ambulance
over and everything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And the entire ride,
such an American mindset, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the entire ride to the
hospital she's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh my God, this is gonna
be so expensive, isn't it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like this thing is gonna be so..." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm just like, don't worry about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We'll just fix your eye up, whatever. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- We get to the hospital, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like 2:00 am.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We get to the hospital, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> doctor does a quick little
check and she's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> okay, you're all good,
you're not blind or anything, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just really red,
it's really burnt out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we wash it out for you,
here, take some meds, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you'll be all good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then in Japanese
hospitals, there's like a kiosk, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you have to go to like pay for it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right, so we go to the kiosk
with like this little receipt </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> and we're just like, oh my God, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> this is gonna be like couple
100 bucks at least, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause she's thinking in
the American mentality. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] American mentality.
- [Connor] Yeah? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I had never really gone
to a Japanese hospital before. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> So I had no idea either, I was
like, oh shit it's the same? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as like, if she says it's
like a couple 100 bucks, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> then I guess I'm prepared
to spend a couple 100 bucks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Dude, it was like $12. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And we looked at it and she's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> "Wait, ambulances are free?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Because in America you
have to pay like two, $300, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> to get a fucking ambulance. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- I think it's more, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I think it's like 1,000 plus. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's something like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Like I've heard stories of like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> a couple of my American friends, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> who broke their arm for example, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> and they're like call an Uber. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was because we're not
paying for a fucking ambulance. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - So we're just gonna call an Uber, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with like your arm hanging off a thread. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And it's tragic 'cause,
I think I remember, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Aki wanted to get an allergy test, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> in, not in Australia, sorry, in America, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and it was like $800. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, Jesus.
- For an allergy test. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- Here you'd pay like $10 </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> for an allergy test. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- And I guess in the UK, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> do you guys have free health care? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, we have free health care. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think doctors won't give
you stuff like that there, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> unless they think you need it though. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, so it's kind of hard
to get stuff like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, all right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause in Australia, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you can go get an allergy
test whenever for free. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, maybe, I don't know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've never done one I can't comment. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Some very specific
medicines you get for free, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> others you kind of have to pay for, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like with UK, it's very specific </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on what illness you have, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because sometimes you have like
this really common illness, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they just tell you to just go home, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and sleep it off basically. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, UK doctors a lot of the time, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> are very reluctant to like do anything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, at least the doctors I've had. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, if you just go to a
general practitioner, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like to get a checkup,
it's usually free, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Whereas the only other, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I guess, experience I've
had with health care, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> outside of the UK is Thailand </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and normally it's pretty, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's about the same price as it is here, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in terms of medicine </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and going to see the
doctors and everything, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and what I found is that doctors here, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> in Asia at least, are way
more willing to give off, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> some kind of medicine for
whatever illness you have. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, definitely.
- I guess there's an argument </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> to make that also could
be dangerous though, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just giving off medicine constantly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean that's why there's
an opioid epidemic </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right now in America. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Over prescribing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> But, I mean, healthcare is a loaded topic. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's a loaded topic, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I certainly do not know enough about, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to contribute to the conversation. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Either way, I had a good
time, my doctors were very nice, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> except they scared the
shit out of me that was- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Literally scared the shit out of you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm still shitting.
- Several times. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Actually, and I think
that what's good is, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> there was a pharmacy
right around the corner </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they obviously knew I
couldn't speak Japanese, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I told them, I was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (speaks in foreign language). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then they were, they made
me fill out a form in English, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I was like fuck, how do I tell them, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> I have this blood condition? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And so, I Googled the kanji for it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I like wrote this kanji,
which is fucking hard kanji, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> there was like swishes, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when there's not lines,
straight lines, I'm like fuck! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - There's a curve in this, damn it! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then I had to write this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it must have looked like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a two-year-old wrote this kanji- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I really wanna see
that now, just to see. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know, whatever
the Kanji for hemophilia </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is on the screen right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it was, and so I gave it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I was like I made sure, I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (speaks in foreign language), </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they're like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (speaks in foreign language). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then they gave me the medicine, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then they gave me a
printed A4 paper in English </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> explaining what all the medicine was, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and why I should take it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> And I'm like, "Oh, wow, that's cool." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause normally in
Japan, it's just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> oh, you don't speak Japanese? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Good luck.
- Yeah, good luck. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well shit, I think
this medicine will work. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You might have a reaction to it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Riperoni, kid! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like better find out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause like most American
medicine I can't take, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I always find that out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause when I was a kid,
I didn't give a fuck. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, yeah, I'll take it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (indictinct) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is this a pill off a offer? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> What does it do? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'll give it a go. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, when I was 12, I
was like, oh it's medicine? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah I'll take it, like
it's good, it must be good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And then when I got
older and I started like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when someone told me,
you can't take ibuprofen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and my dad had been giving
me ibuprofen for five years. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, my God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And it was like oh shit,
I could have like died. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, so I can't take ibuprofen, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and there's so many drugs in America, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that contains stuff
that I just can't have. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> So, I can't have those generic ones. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - As a kid, did you love
the taste of Calpol? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I think that was American Calpol. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I fucking love calpol.
- Oh, my God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like an orange kind of thing? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like there was an orange Calpol, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and a black currant one as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - The black currant- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Was that like cough
medicine or something? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - No it's kind of general cold medicine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, just like general cold medicine, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but as a kid, it tasted
way to good for it-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I used to love getting sick. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Every time I would have a sick day, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like mom, bring out the Calpol. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Cracking bottles. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Get the top shelf, and get the Calpol. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause you're only supposed
to take it like one spoonful, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> but sometimes I just act like extra ill, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> so I can be like, I think
I need another one mom. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause that shit tastes
too good to be a medicine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - We had something like that in Australia, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> but it was cough syrup. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And normally, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like strawberry
flavored cough syrup right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it still tastes like cough syrup. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It has the aftertaste of cough syrup. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But the initial thing is like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a goop of like strawberry
flavored, like jelly, basically. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> So kids would just like fucking
downing shots of that shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Very safe. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - We were just like, please father. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I am sick. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey coughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (indictinct) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Turning kids into drug addicts. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, legit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Did you ever in school
wanna break an arm? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> To be like everyone to care? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - No. (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I wasn't that desperate for attention. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Everyone would like write
on the kid's broken cast, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, I want that, I want
everyone to write on my arm. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Mom can I break my arm, please? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think whatever, if there is a God, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> He knew I wanted to break something, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause I've never broken
a bone in my fucking life, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I've like done disgusting shit
that should've broke bones. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - There was a time where, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I would see the cast
thing and I'd be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> that one's so cool. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, that's not what I'm saying. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, I don't wanna break a bone, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> but I'm saying that I wanna have like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I wanna have a cast, and I remember, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it was climbing a tree, and I fell off, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I landed on my arm. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - So get a cast. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, in the back of
my head I was like, yes! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> See, finally! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I just worded it wrongly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But I wasn't like
willingly like all right, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> let me find the closest tree. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I was just like trying
to yee myself on a tree, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I was just like it would be
cool though if I did break it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - When I found out it was
just like a really bad bruise </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like that's not cool- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - You get a cast though?
- It's just a bruise. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't get anything from this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, what the hell?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> (Alex laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I've also never broken
a bone in my body. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> And I don't know the
thought scares me now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I don't know what it feels like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - The older you get. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because I see so many people... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause, I went to a high school </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> that was very predominantly sports based. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Conner] Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So, boys would be breaking their wrists </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or their ankles, their
arms, their legs, whatnot, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> like constantly. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And every time I would ask, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because I don't know why
I've never broken a bone </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in my body. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I would always ask, does it hurt? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And they're always just
like, "Oh no, not really." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm just like, "Bullshit." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've had splinters and they fucking hurt. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Of course that fucking hurts. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> What are you talking about? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because people who
realized that don't realize, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> like that fingers are broken or something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at some point it's like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's a guy at my school, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> didn't realize his finger was broken </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> until like it sat like wonky. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Alex laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Because he didn't go to the hospital. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And it just sat- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - How do you not realize that shit? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't fucking know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like, oh my finger kind of hurts. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> It looks kind of weird too- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like at 90 degrees, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> that's kind of strange. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - What's up with that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And meanwhile there's
me I get paper cut. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like get the fucking bandages. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Can you see a bone? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Can you see a bone? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Get the alcohol, quick. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, my God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm too British, I feel
like if my hand was impaled, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I'd be like, no, well, I mean... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's just a flesh wound. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Put a bit of sanitizer on it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and I think it should be fine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Honestly, I think the
smallest injuries hurt the most. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel sometimes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, paper cut or splinter
hurts like a motherfucker. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - What's the worst injury you've ever had? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like that hurt the most? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - The worst injury I've ever had- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah I'm sure do you have one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I remember once when I was a kid </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> we were playing tag or it's. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> As we would call it. - A brutal game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's a sports for barbarians. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was playing with my cousins </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and this one time I ran like head... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I full on sprinted, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> And my cousin was standing next to a pole </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and then I full on sprinted
to try and get him, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and then I tripped and I
face planted into this pole. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I don't think I got any brain damage </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or anything like that,
didn't get a concussion. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But what I did get was
this Tom and Jerry type, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> massive bump on my head- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It was massive, okay? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> To this day, I've never seen
another injury like this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where my forehead was just like this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> and the entire evening my
parents were just spinning the... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was on my mom's lap
and she would have to... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> She had to literally
press it back in slowly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> over the course of this entire night. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - You should just been
like, it's my giga brain. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just try to come out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> It's trying to escape from my head. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know that point
where you've got an injury </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you don't know how bad it is, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then you see it, and you're like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh, shit!" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> This is way worse than I
thought it was initially. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Alex] Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause initially I'm
like, yeah, yeah I'm good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm good, I can handle this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Walk it off. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then I saw myself in the mirror, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> when I saw that massive lump, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that's when the wave of
pain just came towards it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> So, I don't know if it
was a psychological thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it was- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Probably the worst one I had was... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I was out like camping with friends, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I always used to
go camping every year </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with my family and family friends. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And we were maybe 10
years old or something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and my friend, and I
were just grabbing rocks, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> there was this big cliff face, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and we were just kind of just
throwing rocks at the cliff </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because what do you do-
- This is not gonna go well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What do you do when
you go camping, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> While the dads are setting up the tent, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we're like, all right, fuck it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> let's just throw rocks or whatever. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And one of the rocks had bounced... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like my friends threw the
rock against the cliff </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It bounced back and my hand was pressed up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> against another stone, 'cause
I think I was sitting down </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and the stone came back and
just slammed into my fingers, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I was like, ouch, initially, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> but then I looked down
and both of my fingernails </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> had just completely chipped off. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What the fuck? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it was really weird,
it was kind of your thing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> where it hurts until you
look at it and it's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh, now it really fucking hurts." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Ah, that's so gross. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, so both of these
fingernails were gone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> for a month maybe until they regrew back </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and, yeah, that's probably the worst. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's so gross. - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think the most pain I've been in, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I was snowboarding and
I went, but you know... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just like, "Oh, God, it's
like four years ago, as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> You know having some snow ski resorts, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they have some area that's
designated for tricks </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and do hot pile. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So, I know, I like going
there and I try to... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I normally can do like a 360 in the air. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, like it's not clean. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Stop bragging. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But now I'm too scared to do it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because one of them, I didn't go off right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I just kind of span halfway
on my back was facing... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (indictinct) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> And so, I was up in the air
maybe like, I don't know... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I landed in the bottom of the ramp. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] Oh, shit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - For the next jump. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah-
- Just hard ice. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And I must've been up in the air I dunno, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like three or four meters off the ground. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Just slammed on my back, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> thought I broke my back, I was so winded, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I couldn't breathe, 'cause my lungs </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> had just been like fucking
pancakes, I was like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (inhales deeply) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And they were like should
we get the skiing ambulance? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll walk it off. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll walk it off. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Ant then I'd like broken the fall </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> by putting my hand there, as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> So, I sprained my wrist as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was fucking horrible. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I've had a lot
of snowballs and skiing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They hurt the most. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I had something similar like that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I obviously wasn't
in the air for as long. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And also I always make sure
whenever I do the jumps, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I can do like 180 and 360 as well, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I always make sure </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that the bottom of it is like powder snow, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just so if I fuck up the landing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> then it's just like a
pillow, be like (indictinct). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, this feels nice. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Sometimes you like, I really
wanna do this sick jump, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but there's no snow at the
bottom, but I'ma fucking do it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - (indictinct) moments before a disaster. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause up until that
jump, I was doing 180, 180, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, I'ma do the big one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'ma do the 360. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then I went for it and
it just completely failed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then I had to be like
dragged out of the way. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause people were waiting to go as well, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause it's like a line system. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Some mates had to drag
me with their skis on, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, "Oh my God," it's horrible. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think my most painful memory </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> is actually also my earliest memory. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> So, this is my earliest memory of my life </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I can remember.
- What? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I was... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think I was about three years old </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's obviously very vivid, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it's given me a phobia of bees, okay? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - To give you an idea about
where I'm going with this story. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So, here's my very earliest memory. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember I was in my parents' restaurant </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I see this thing just buzzing around. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It was like this black
dot just buzzing around </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and all I remember thinking was, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I wanna bat the shit out of this thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - As a three year old? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - As a three-year-old kid,
I'm just like, (indictinct). </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause it's moving fast and
I'd never seen a bee before. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> So, I'm just like, I'm gonna
bat the shit out of this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's like some cat brain, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> This thing is moving, I must hit it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Literally cat brain. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then all I remember
was I tried batting it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I remember it moving
in a circular motion, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just closing in on my eye, okay? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, my God. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was like this, I remember it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then the next thing I feel is just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> this sharp pain on my fucking eyes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And it is... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It scarred me for life. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This pain I still remember to this day </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and this is why I have a phobia of bees, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because that shit was so painful, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and so I run to my mom
and she looks at my eyes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I would never forget my mom's face, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was just pure shock,
just like, "Oh shit!" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause the stinger was
still in my eyeball, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So the-
- Oh my God! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The bee had stung me on my eyeball. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like it-
- Bulls eye bro. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And we had to go to the doctor. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We had to go to the doctor, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> because they had to tweeze
out the stinger from my eyes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - How did you not go blind from that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just
- It mustn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> have gone deep enough, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. It must not have gone deep enough </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I think it was on
the whites of my eyes, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was my pupil. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, I probably just
narrowly escaped blindness </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from that fucking bee. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Fuck. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And yeah, ever since then,
I learned an important lesson. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Don't fuck with bees. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Don't fuck with bee's. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Don't fuck with any wildlife, honestly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's the advice I always give </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to people who wanna go to Australia. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like how do all these
Australians avoid all </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> of these poisonous snakes and spiders? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Don't fuck with them </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they won't fuck with you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If you go over to a poisonous
snake and start poking it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> you're gonna get fucking bitten. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Don't do that and they won't bite you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah, it's really easy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think most animals
don't want to attack you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - No. It's a defense mechanism. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Don't fuck with them </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and they won't fuck
with you, really simple. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Speaking about animals, boys, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not that there is
anything to do with anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I wanna talk about animation, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we've even done that, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay, sure.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Remember when we started
off as an anime type podcast </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and then we just didn't
talk about anime at all? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean, we always wanted it to be a... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Whatever the fuck you wanna talk about, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but anime is gonna be a big one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, yeah, of course.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - What have you guys been watching recent? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Fuck all, man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're not watching
anything with Aki, right now? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, Aki, watched,
Uzaki Chan the other day? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Ah, how was that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - She watched the first
episode and then she was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you're gonna want to watch this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, I watched the first
episode actually this morning, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right before we came to the office </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and I can't fucking stand it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm sorry.
- Yes. Same here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm Sorry.
- Same here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Aki, fucking hates
it, I fucking hate it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> It is so fucking boring. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I saw clip of it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I haven't watched it by the way, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> but I saw a clip where
she got stuck in a bush? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And to me it just looked
like the porn hub thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where they get stuck
in the washing machine. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You want me to get stuck
in a washing machine? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You only get stuck in a washing machine. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I thought it was a hint time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I was like, "Oh,
is this an evolution?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think I would enjoy it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if it was a hint time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because that is like hint time material. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, it's literally
like the stuck in the war tag </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that you have without the actual fucking. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I thought, because the laundry thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> had been blowing up recently. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The hint time porn, I thought it was like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I know, man, it's always
been a thing in hint time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But I, I mean it's propped
up a lot of porn recently. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, I thought, "Oh,
it's a hint time thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Which is, I guess- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> That's just like what every
one assumes what anime anyway. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's a hint time thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Animated hint time, yes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - What is it about? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's literally, just a slice of life </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> where you follow this loud lolly- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Big tities. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Who has big tities. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, I get the appeal
of it, because it's- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Why is it blowing up? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because, she's a loud lolly </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> with big tities, that's why. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's literally it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It looks shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That is her... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Her body is her personality. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know, it's... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> She's become the new meme
girl of the month, I guess. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Because she... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> The manga has been pretty popular </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> or at least popular
within certain circles, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because I see her face everywhere. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it's everywhere. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't understand why? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, I reckon what it is, is that... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It was Uzaki Chan for this new year </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or I guess maybe this, I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't want to say this generation, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but it's essentially
the same as Umaru Chan. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Umaru Chan is the exact same type of show </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where, if you can stand Umaru Chan </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> and you can relate, and like, Umaru Chan, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> then you probably love Uzaki, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I couldn't stand Umaru Chan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I couldn't stand Umaru Chan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, this little turd, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is fucking taking advantage of a brother </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so, fucking hard, I would've
slap the shit out of her. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I wanna club stomp Umaru Chan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - (indictinct) Unless you hit- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And so, I feel that Uzaki Chan </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is kind of a similar show </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where if you don't like
Uzaki Chan, as a character </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> then you won't be able to stand the show, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because she is the entire show. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. - Okay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like Watamote, as well, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If you don't like Coroki, which I didn't, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I couldn't stand it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause like the whole show </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is just basically her
annoying the fuck out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> of the main character. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And the main character just- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> (exhale deeply) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Oh, I hate you bro. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's her personality (indictinct). </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Is that she's fucking annoying. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Which is really funny,
because people are like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh, she's not that annoying." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> When a lot of people don't
realize, the name Uzaki, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> is a play on words in Japanese
for (foreign language), </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> which means annoying. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That's why she's called Uzaki. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Because she's annoying. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> Because I know so many people,
like friends of Al's, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like Dakota's a massive fan of that show. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And I'm just like, why? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, Dakota, why? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Why? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Why Dakota? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What does it say about you as a person? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is it because she
has a fucking skin fang </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and has two big tits, is that it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, why? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What's with the fang? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (indictinct) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'll tell you why, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's 'cause the Dojo's she's in are good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is one of those shows </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where it's own specific
genre now, I swear to God. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Where I swear, there were just some shows </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or some manga that I swear people make, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just 'cause they like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, this gonna be
good Dajinshi material. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. That's what it- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is gonna be the
top 10 Dajinshi material. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's the genre of these shows. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The genre is Dojinshi material. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's what it is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause they always have the meme girl, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's always focused on this one meme girl </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that a lot of people may find annoying, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but for some reason she
just works in really good... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like in any situations in Dojinshi, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they just like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They're just golden. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, yeah, because as much as I don't dig </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the uzaki Chan anime,
men, the Uzaki Chan Dojo's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are fucking lit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Oh, my God. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - (indictinct) Degenerates, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Every single one that
I have seen so far, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm just like, deim son. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I wish I could read porn. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I just can't, a monkey brain, man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, you don't have to. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, you don't read anyway- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Let alone read porn. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> So, how am I gonna read... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> That's even worse than the
gaming thing with reading. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I wanna read my porn, I want shitty acting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I wanna skip to five minutes in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then decide what I'm gonna do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's because, Uzaki Chan's personality </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is so fit for Dojinshi. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Because she's like that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> always teasing kind of character, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm just like, well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you put that in a sexual aspect, man, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that makes for some spicy Dogen's. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And they are. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They're really good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Her big tits don't help. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Honestly, her body proportions
do not help, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't think I would enjoy
the Uzaki Chan's Dogen's, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if her body was just normal. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But because it's so disproportionate </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and built for Dogen's I'm just- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They were clearly planning
for this in Dogens. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's just the show
that's made for Hint time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Even more so than some fan
surveys (indictinct) shows. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There are just... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There were like some edgy shows </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then there are edgy
shows that are made, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel, just for like the
fan material under the Danjis </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and everything like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like being, "Oh, yes,
this new era gay came out, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I'm gonna get the
old ages version instead. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why would you do that to yourself? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Why, what's the point in that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So, out of 10, the first episode? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like a three. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - At least. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That sounds generous. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It looks good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> That's all I'm gonna... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, Uzaki Chan... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Okay, I'll admit, Uzaki
Chan's character design, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> fucking amazing, I love it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's great. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I reckon that's why a lot
of people got Jordan's web, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because her character design is great. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I love her character design. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> And she has such a good memorable face. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You know that one girl that every season </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that just has the best facial expression. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like this season is definitely... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's definitely Uzaki Chan, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> like her smug face, the smuggling NG, man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - The smug face, yeah, that's what it is. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - She's got like the perfect smug face. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Anamei funs are just
like, "It's a great show. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> She's got a smug face,
I'm sold. I'll pay." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is art, this is art- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Congratulations, smug face. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Aname fans are the real monkey brains. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can I just say that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I just genuinely want to know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> for people who are watching this right now </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and saying that they love Uzaki Chan, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what is it about the show that you like? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Because I tried, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I always do my best. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Even if it's a show I don't like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, "Okay, why is it that people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are getting to the show?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What aspects is it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I looked at, Uzaki Chan, and I'm like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> the only thing I can think of is her tits. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's the only redeeming
factor about this show. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And I feel bad, because I feel like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> that's the easy to go to joke- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Of like, "Oh, this show
has no substance or anything, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> but I legitimately, I'm just curious. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I wanna know why people, like it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's not like I'm
trying to diss on people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> who like the show, by all means, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But I just wanna know, what is it? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Is it the tits? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Because if that's the case- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is this like a call for help- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because if that's the case, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> then you can literally, just be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Okay, I fucking hate this Anime, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> but if I add tits, seven out of 10. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - This feels like my intervention. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, just admit you have a problem. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Just tell us. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just admit that you like the tits. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> And that's the only reason
why I enjoy the show. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What, have you been
watching anything else </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> this season, Jerry or not really? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Not really. No. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Could I'll tell you
why I've been watching, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Rent A Girlfriend. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, me too- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And that is... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Is that a guilty pleasure? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - No. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know if that's
a guilty pleasure. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I genuinely think it's like
the best show this season. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think it's a really good show. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Really? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'll say it's the best show
this season they're gone. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, Real Zero is... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Real Zero, head and
shoulders above the rest. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, yeah. - At the moment. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, Real Zero, the last episode, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have you watch the last episode? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I was crying like a fucking baby- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Holly shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Real zero, shit... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We'll get into Real Zero in a minute. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But Rent A Girlfriend. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That is just, why does it work? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because it's such a
generic heron plot, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - I hate the protagonist or something. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause I read the synopsis of that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, this seems really in silly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It seems like it's made for Incell. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like the protagonist
is a living bro moment. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Every time he does something, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like for fuck's sake,
why are you doing this bro? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Seriously, bro. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, bro. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The problem is now this anime comes out, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people are gonna be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "Wait, we should actually
make this a thing." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They're gonna be like, 'We should do this, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this is normal." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - We should normalize this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Normalize paying girls. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That we all ready did that with online- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - The gaming, the (indictinct)
realgirls.gg or something, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> whatever it is. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, gameofgold.gg or whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, whatever the fuck (indictinct). </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, I'm surprised
you're enjoying it though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause it was really fun. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean I hate the main character </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and I saw it when you tweeted out, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> saying, "Oh he's irredeemable." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There were people like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "No, he's not irredeemable." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, bro he's
annoying as fuck right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's the incell's
protecting their boy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I know, it's probably
like the, monguritus, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> who's like, well he gets kind of- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm sure he will. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Which, I'm looking forward </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to seeing him become a better person. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> But right now, I can't
remember what I called him, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think it was like a- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Cum stain (indictinct). </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like a cum stain. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, cum stain protagonist. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Which is so accurate, it's so accurate. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> He's a cum stain. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - The way I view him is like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I fucking hate Backer girl
from My Hero Academia. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - But everyone fucking loves him. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm like, he's a piece of shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - He's so selfish. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't get it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why are you people... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Why are you booing me, I'm right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause I think that's the
thing that really pisted me off, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which is just how selfish he was. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - He is so selfish. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - He's ridiculously selfish. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Unlike if you're one of those
people, who relate to him- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's the people who related
to Subaru in the start, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like, what's wrong with you? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Like if you are my mate and
you were acting like him, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I would have... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I would need to talking to you... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I would have to talk to you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You would catch these hands. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The person who I liked
the most wasn't him, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> but he was his best mate. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like he was a true bro who like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Who was looking out
for him and everything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And so far the main protagonist </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> hasn't done anything
that's made me feel like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> man, he deserves a best girl. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Man, he deserves his bros. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, he definitely does, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - So, I'm looking forward </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> to seeing his character development, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which I assume is what happens- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Still, but- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - In the Manga. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Or it's the Manga real. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Just being the Manga is be- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - If this was shit that
happen in real life, you... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And this was in your friend group, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you'd never be forgiven for it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - For doing the shit that he's pulled- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, no. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> No, you would absolutely
be clowned on by bro's. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - So, he like rents a
girlfriend, she's great. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean, this just spoilers
the first three episodes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> And then, this girl that dumped him, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> he immediately gets back with her. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Even though she's talking shit about him. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - In front of his friend. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's like, what are... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What, I can't believe this shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> This is where you would be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> "Wow, this guy's my friend." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - This is where you would be like, no... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm friends with an
absolute cunt, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You selfish asshole. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And it's one of the
first Hera manama where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> there's clearly a best girl. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause she's girl real,
fucking girl of the seasons. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> She's such- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - MVP. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - MVP. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - She's coming through. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - She's not only helping him out, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> she's like, with the grand
situation, oh, my God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (indictinct) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like I'm there in my corner, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm fucking cheering. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But at the same time, I kinda
don't wanna cheer, as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause, cheering means that she has </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> to end up with this person at the moment. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's so hard to be like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (cheering) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Go protagonist. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I hope she gets like a giga charge, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> just to make incells mad. (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I wanna incells mad, bro. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Man, I've... (chuckles) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> Seen the incell takes on Twitter, man, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they get me fucking fuming. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Oh, my God, you guys have
never left your room. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is this your first Heroin Manama </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that you've been following then? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Weekly? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because Heroma don't really seem, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like a thing you would watch. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, that's why I was like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> That's why I was surprised </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when I heard you were watching it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, I normally watch them, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I think, because they make life </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> so difficult for themselves, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's so frustrating to watch. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, you didn't have
to make this difficult. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You like, you made your life shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You could've spoke to her, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but you fucking sat there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay, one thing that you would
never do in real life, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If your girlfriend, whatever, walks off, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> even if it's your rental girlfriend. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - You go after her. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's a universal thing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Even idiots and people who
are the most nervous people </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> on earth and shy, they go after the- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And if they don't, your friends
will immediately be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> "Yo, dude, go, right now." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Like the thing that pisted me off is, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> in a lot of these situations, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> his friends are acting like
his friends should act. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> They're like, "Bro, get
your girl, get your girl." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And he's getting angry </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that they don't know the full situation, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> even though he's put
himself in this situation. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Bro, you go after the
girl if she storms out angry </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that's like rule number one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Even if it's a fake girlfriend, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I would still go after my girl. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - The other thing, the reason why I might, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't think I like Harams is 'cause, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe in my head I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm trying to speed run it in my mind. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, oh God, what would I do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for optimal straps to get the girl? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, no, no, you did the wrong route here </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you just lost 20 seconds. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But I think that's the problem, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like, you're trying to like watch </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> these kinds of shows- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - To relate, to like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're basically, if we were relating </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like speed runs, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You're trying to be like, all right, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> how am I gonna speed run this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> while watching 100% run. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's what it is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like why are they
taking the optimal route? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Not knowing that they're
trying to do 100%. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, I think you've put harems into </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> the wrong genre then. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I just... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Most of the stories I
find really underwhelming </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I don't, like some of
them I've really enjoyed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But some of them- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - A lot of them are
very like, come on bro, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just get to the fucking point. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Most of them, like you watch three </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and you feel like you've
watched all of Hararm, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, for me, the closest
thing I would relate harem to, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> actually, is sports. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Okay, here's the thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Here's the- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What's the formula? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Here's the enjoyable
part of Harem, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> It's picking a team, picking your girl </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then fucking cheering for her. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This isn't about speed running the shit, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is about getting caught teased, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> about who's the protagonist's
gonna end up with. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, yeah, I guess that's Harams, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm sorry that, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I was about to say, if
there's only one main, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's just the romance at that point. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Romance I don't like, romance... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Haram is, but 90% of
Harems, you already know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Wait, but why don't
you like romances then? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because that's the speed run, if anything. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because sometimes they
just do dumb shit in it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm like, no one would ever do this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, they have to make
a cohesive story, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They're not just gonna be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all right, I met this girl, episode one, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> episode three, em' together. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> End of the story, baby. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Sometimes they do shit in romance </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I'm like, this shit... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay, I knew it shouldn't be realistic, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but then also there's just some stuff </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that it's like hard for me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to ever believe whatever happened. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm trying to think of a case. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can't off the top- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What romance anime have
even seen then? - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Named a bunch of
iconic ones and I'll see. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Golden Time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, Golden- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Totadora. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Totadora, I really liked. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, I think I like most of them, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just never seek them out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's something that if a friend recommends </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and I have nothing better to do, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I put it on, I'll probably enjoy it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> but it's not a thing that
I seek out for myself. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm sure a lot of people
can relate to this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Especially those people
who watch Only Shownin. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like, get that shit outta here. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - There's no fight scene. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like Harem, especially, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I feel that most shows that I've watched, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like, oh, that's the one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> If any of these girls are gonna get it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which is, even a mystery. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause 90% of the time,
nothing fucking happens. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, "Oh, the
protagonist, supervene, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's the show and it ends, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What was that one from a few years ago </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where it was like, they
will all like wizards. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And the one guy could like counter magic </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it was awful. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - You just described like fucking 90% </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> of most like magic high school Hermn show. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, and it'll be like eight girls. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And they all have one personality trait. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And that's it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like the most boring shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Are you talking about Index? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's what I thought. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's the only thing
like counter magic- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like Index is the guy
who he's like the magic- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - He has like the right
hand that can counter magic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's also the Irregular
Of Magic High School. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I love that series. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was around that, the same season. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - (indictinct) Straddles? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Some guy, I don't fucking know this guy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - They all sound the same. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'll try and find it today. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's like trying to pinpoint an Easter </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> by saying, "What was that one show </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where they go against
transported to the other world?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And gets overpowered and stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - If I find what it is, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's on the screen right now, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> if not, I'm just holding my
hands up, like an asshole. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Night in Magic, maybe that one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'll fucking find... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I'll find it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - They're all crap. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - They're just garbage. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The thing about Heroin anime is that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I can never watch two at once, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause when I'm watching two at once, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's like me watching
the same show twice, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but every time a new one comes on, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then this time it's Rent A Girlfriends. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And boy, what I will say
about Rent A Girlfriend, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is that it's just very addicting to watch. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I also thought it is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I think because the main character </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is the way he is, as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause you're sitting there fuming, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but you click on that next episode. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause you wanna see... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You're like cheering for
him to become a better guy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And just act the way
that you want him to act. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is it funny how it's like
the opposite of real life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> You're like, the moment
you see it, your like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> get out of my life- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> For an animate, please get better. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Come on. I know you can. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - You can do it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You can do it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like imagine the scenario
of Rent A Girlfriend </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> in real life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> One of your mates- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Especially in this climate, as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Find out one of your mates </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is paying for a girl just
to rent her as a girlfriend </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and parade her around. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And you're like, bro,
that's a real bro moment. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That aint cool bro. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I can think of like several
people who would do that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But like in anime, for some reason, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know why, because
sometimes there's scenarios </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I feel wouldn't work in real life </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or even in like live action series. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, that's true. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But because it's anime
and because it's animated, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> my suspension of disbelief
is just a bit more so like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> You get to hear their thought process. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean actually, hear that
they have compassion and stuff, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so you can kind of- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, because a live
action rent a girlfriend </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> would be probably one
of the cringes things </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> you'll ever watch. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - So have you ever completed
a Hera man-made to the end- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Where the best girl wins? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know if a best girl won. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Wait, what... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Name a few famous Hera manama. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Nisekoi. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Nisekoi I didn't watch. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Toloveru. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I haven't watched Toloveru. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Orimo. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Orimo. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't think I've watched many. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Aeromonas. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - The World God Only Knows. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The World God Only Knows I watched. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - All to the end? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, all like three
seasons or whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, deim. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - And that was good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But I don't know what happens. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That doesn't seem like
a show you would watch. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm just like, "Oh, you
watched that one, okay." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - I watched all of it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And then I was like, wait, I
have to read the Monga now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What do you mean, we have three seasons, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> don't stop now, keep going. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> I thought normally when
it gets to season three </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that's normally like, all right, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we're only here for the
long run, we keep going. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And then it just ended. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, what do you mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What do you mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's a really good show, I loved that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - So you've never gone to the end </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> where like there's a winning girl. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Where there's an actual- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Winner. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I probably have, I probably
just can't remember it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Well, yeah, 'cause they're
all probably generic. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's like, again, like we
all know I have monkey brain. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Most like the anime </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's, if it's not an eight
out of 10 or higher for me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> it probably is like in the forgotten. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's in the (indictinct) category, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's in the, okay, it's good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> But not a good enough for me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to retain memories of it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because that's the
reason I watch harem anime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because once you watch one,
you basically watched them all. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> So to me- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I love watching the
same thing over again. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean I do watch- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Its the Isakaya man, after all. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But I don't know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just fun being in the race, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And part of the fun is
being in the community </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and seeing all the salt
and tears from the losers. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, it's like real sport. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Part of the fun is shitting
on the losing side. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Very, very long sports game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - An all week long sports game. Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And that's why you can get... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's why you get so invested in it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because you're reading this... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You're reading this Monga. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause normally it's a Monga. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause the anime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can hardly, I can, it's really rare </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for an anime Harem to actually
go through to the end. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So, you normally follow
the Monga for like weeks </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and weeks, and sometimes it's years. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And that final chapter
where your girl wins, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's like a euphoric feeling. (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Wouldn't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've experienced that recently with, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what the fuck is it (foreign language). </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - We Never Learn. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - We Never Learn. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because they recently ended that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and best girl won and I was
just like, yes, finally. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Thank you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - If you had to give me a recommendation </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for a hera monga to read,
what would you tell me? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I would recommend, We Never Learn. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Really. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. That's really cute. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I've read so much harem stuff </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and this is one of the few
series where I'm just like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> wow, I like all of these girls. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Like there isn't a single girl... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like all of these girls can easily win </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and all of these girls
are fucking awesome. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I wasn't too mad or... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I mean, I was happy because
my favorite one, won. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But I think when I saw her
around in the community </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> when people were routing for all the girls </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that were like, my girl didn't win, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but I ain't complaining,
I'll take the second place. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's all right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> It's all good, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Its all fun. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just seeing how people
justify their losing position. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's beautiful. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> It's beautiful when you're
in that winning girl. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> When you're backing that winning horse </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's just like all the
tears taste so good, man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> But I mean, you're watching one now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with Rent A Girlfriend. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. It's good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Would you follow up on the Monga </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> if the anime ends and that
you just, it just ends. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - If I'm really into,
yeah, I probably would. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It have to be pretty damn good though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It'd have to end like on
an amazing cliffhanger. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Do you read a lot of Mongo? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's hard, 'cause I feel that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the time when I would read Mongo, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm normally doing something else. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've seen you reading
quite a few (indictinct). </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, you read all of Terraformers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - If I read a Monga. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like nonstop. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like I cannot put it down. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> So it's very like hard
for me to get into it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So I don't think you'd enjoy then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> if it's like a currently (indictinct). </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I don't read currently serializing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> except for One Punch Man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause that's always a
treat whenever it pops up. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, a new chapter. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like fuck yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Action happens in every chapter- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God, One Punch Man
monger is fucking beautiful man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> That shit is amazing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, I love that shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then I try to read the web comic, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> but I was like. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You know that meme, where
the guy took off the headset, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> he's like... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, it's good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's funny. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> But it's like, the best- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You can't go back to the web Mungo, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> once you've experienced- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Exactly, the art is so good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it blows my mind </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that the first season actually managed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to capture how hype his art was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and maybe even exceeded it at some points. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> But like his art is fucking insane. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, I've loved
Eyeshield since issue 21. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> When I found out he was
doing One Punch Man, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like, yes, the best. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Issue 21 is still one of
my favorite sports mangroves. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's something I've downloaded </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to actually read at some point. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But it's like every time I'm
gonna start a sports Mongo, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like Slam Dunk or EyeShield. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I just I'm like fuck, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> which one should I choose? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Just do both, man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Honestly, those are my top two- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - And those are like the two sports manga </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that you should definitely
read the sports monga </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and not watch- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Don't watch anamie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. Don't watch- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Cause they have not aged well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Mostly because their matches
take so fucking long. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This is back in the day of Dragon Ball Z. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I remember the first
time I watched Slam Dunk </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I remember thinking, why
is a match like 10 episodes? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> How can they possibly stretch
a match over to 10 episodes? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I watched the entirety
of the Slam Dunk anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and then I read the manga,
and then it just felt, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like when Rock Lee had taken
off his training weights, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like it was moving so fast. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> And I was like, I didn't know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't know the story,
could move this fast. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - This is how ,its supposed to feel. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, exactly, exactly. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - But, yeah like definitely, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> I think not enough
people read sports Mongo </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or sports anime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Every single sports anime
that I've consumed, I've loved. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like Yo Mushy Pedalwi surprised me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I really fucking loved that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I finally now have an excuse
to start reading Haikyu, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> now that it's finished. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I do wanna read that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause I found the anime a little boring. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, really? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, I know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've heard- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - How come? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I got half of it the second season </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm like, why does it feel
like I'm watching season one? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> I just felt like I was
watching season one again. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Is that bad? Is that a fair take? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, I mean... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like he gets better
and better every season. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I remember it's a high Q. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Every one says that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like I'm in the
(indictinct) minority. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Every one say that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel like I was
properly sold in haiku, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like properly, properly into it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The last match of season two </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and then season three came along, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and season three is just one match. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I remember thinking to
myself before the season started </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how can they make an entire
season from just one match? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We're going back into slam dunk territory. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That would be insane. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is way too dragged out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then I watched it and I'm like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh my God, this is the best season. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So far, this has taken
it to another level. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - But when I know that its
going to be a full season </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what I'm thinking in my head is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "Whoa, that was amazing." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But I'm like, fuck I'm not
gonna find the conclusion </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for like 20 episodes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I think I know roughly
what's going to happen- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - This boy is trying to
speed, run a sports book. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause what's going to happen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And they don't know the pacing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, great. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> This is awesome. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm shocked. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know what to expect. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If I would go into it now and thinking, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay, I'm gonna get, what is it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 12 episodes? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, it was only like nine episodes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was less. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay. That's good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay, nine episodes, is manageable, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> what if it's 25. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it was like, all the
season was 25 episodes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'd be like, I can't do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, that's why the Slam
Dunk and Eye show 21 mongers </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> is so good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because the pacing in
that for every single match </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> is legitimately, like this
could end in two chapters </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or it could end in a hundred chapters. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm gonna try reading one of them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> actually I wanna read Monga on stream. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I've been trying to get permission </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> from our company to be able to do that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You should do that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I think that would be high. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Dude do a stream where you
read Eye Shield or Slam Dunk, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll tune into that,
'cause I wanna know. Right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I wanna know how you think they are. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I probably be like the most
boring reactor of all time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I'm that guy, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who just doesn't get
hype when I'm watching </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> or reading something. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Dude I tried to do an
anime watching stream </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a couple of times. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I walked back on the vault. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, I need to delete these. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It is the most... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm literally just, I fucking
jinxed it the entire time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was just like, all right, yep. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - With Monga, I thought, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> well, if I can voice out most of it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean, that would be very draining. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, but that's more entertaining. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That more entertaining, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's not like the natural reaction. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Where you're just reacting to it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause for me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when I'm watching something, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm literally like dead eye. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The hyper shit could be happening </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm just still like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, that's pretty much me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> unless it's sad. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Then I'm just sobbing my eyes out. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like fucking crying. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> When I'm in that mood, I
will fucking cry at anything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like I fucking cried at The
God Of High School episode. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, why? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This shit was fucking awful. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - God Of High School, why? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> God Of High School... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I know, 'cause I
just wanted to cry that day. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I need some thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And so that was the episode- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - So, wait at what scene, at what scene? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Must've been like, we
turn to episode five now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You've watched episode five? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've watched... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, I've watched episode five. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's some one with his
backstory, with his friend. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, this isn't
even that fucking sad. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And they completely ruined the show for me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the episode before with the wedding. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - All right I'm out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Fucking (indictinct). </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. - So dumb. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> That wedding episode
was the dumbest episode. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And then you cried at the next episode. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, because I was
in one of those moods </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where a fucking Cheeto commercial, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where they will be like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (crying) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - No I don't know what you mean. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I get there's moods where sometimes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm not going to cry, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> but I know that crying
will me feel better. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Even though I'm not sad, I'm not sad. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'll just cry. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Just cause it'll help. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm sure there's people
who can relate to this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah I'm sure, but I don't
think you're gonna find them </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in this podcast. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm with like two giga
brain, like floating, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> meditating geniuses, they
don't experience this kind of- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause the biggest... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like the fucking opposite,
opposite of you, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I could have... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You could show me the
saddest fucking story. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And sometimes I'm like stonewall,
dead face, feel nothing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> You play like the Anahata ending, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> at the Anahata ending song
or a certain piece of music. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm bawling my eyes out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Music for me is such an
important factor to make me- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It all goes back to that music episode. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was listening to music
the other day and I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> oh yeah, my favorite songs is
just the ones with no talking. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I like the noise </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I did appreciate Kevin Penkins tweets. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> Just be like, how he was so giga tilted </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> when he watched that episode. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause he tweeted out being like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> okay, people are linking me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to this particular trash taste episode. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I gotta go check it out. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then like two hours later, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> he just tweets out being
like, Corner, we have to talk. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Kevin doesn't make, except for like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> in Made In The Bass. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> But normally his songs don't
have people singing in them, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so that's nice, I can appreciate the beeps </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the boots that Kevin makes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I love your boots and beeps Kevin. </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_05> Mr. Pipi on the Titi,
whatever my name was, out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> (indictinct) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (air whooshing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - (indictinct), what do you
think of God Of High School? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's just kind of pretty
and that's kind of about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> That's kind of, I hate to say it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I really do want the web tune anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to like kill it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But I don't know if it's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know who wrote it, the story. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know if the
inexperienced that first time, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but the story kind of does feel like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it's a little all over
the place right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, because God Of High School for me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is the one show I really,
really wanna like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I wanna like God Of High School. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, it's a fucking
just a tournament talk </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of an anime, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> It should be my wet dream, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but for some reason I
just can't get into it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think he blew his loads too quickly, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> because it just started
with tournament Arg. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I'm not invested
in any of the characters. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It just feels weird. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I can see why it would
work in like a Monga formula. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've read the manual or
the original web to manual. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - What's the manual like? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The manual it's like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I dunno, the parts I like about the manual </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is kind of the same parts
I like about the anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But it doesn't mean that it's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as you said, it's not... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think it did kind of
kick off a little too hard </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at the beginning where it was just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> you gotta give me time to
like kind of ease into it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Because then the fights, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> when you get the
flashbacks halfway through </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it just kind of feels like weird. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like a cliche. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I'm just like- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Of course they have a backstory. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Everyone has a fucking backstory. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Who doesn't have a backstory. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Did it need to be in
the middle of the fight </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's the question, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Most, shown in fat bad flashbacks </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> are in the middle of the fight. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Then it's on characters </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that we already have
some understanding of, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> most of the time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And then it builds upon it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But when it's the only
introduction you have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to that character. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Like the guy, when he's
sick friend, it's like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just go to Stonewall before. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And now you want me to give a
shit cause his a sick friend? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Now its like, Oh, shit we
have to shoe horn a personality, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right now, quickly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Bro it's 2020, everyone
has a fucking sick friend. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> (indictinct) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> And the main villain, it
just kind of seems like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> why would anyone make
a deal with that guy? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I Don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That guy looks like a loan shark. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> When the guy comes up, she's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, I'll save your friend
if you fight for me." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> That sounds like the sketchiest deal ever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like what. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like a green to do
like a homeless fight. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And for some meth it's of
course the homeless man </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> isn't gonna give you meth. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> You're fighting a homeless man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's not illegal, is this legal. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It was a mess. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The whole thing was, just you watch it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and you're like, none of this is good, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I'll keep watching 'cause it's pretty- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I really want to like it because it's, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it looks so good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Mapper, blew it out of the
park with the flight animation. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's every episode has a really, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really good looking fight. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I've really, really want
to be invested in this flights. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But for me, it's just
like watching fireworks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like really pretty. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then I get nothing out of it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I'm going to watch it next week, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because I really want to get invested. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I hope it turns around and gets better, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because at the moment it's
just not doing it for me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And even though something
like Tower Of God, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> is that feel worse animated. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That drew me into his
world and characters, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and then like everything so
much quicker and so much faster. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Now I agree with that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, I mean, control
is more originals coming, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so I'm hoping one of them is- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Isn't Noblesse getting an anime from- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What I've heard. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm probably most looking forward to that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I think out of the three, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like, God Of High School,
(indictinct), Noblesse. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've probablu enjoy the
Noblesse probably the most. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, and then they
make an original shows. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And now they're making a bunch
of original shows, as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> So yeah, it's gonna be interesting. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - When are they gonna start
animating the adult manual. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, dude, I was just about to say. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (indictinct) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No I just wanna talk about adult manuel- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Dude if they make an
anime for like six a size. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Or like, what's the other
one, the one with the- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Sweet Guys. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Sweet Guy, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Sweet Guy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's my fucking favorite dudes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's a Hara Monga. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Sweet Guy, oh, my God,
you need to read Sweet Guy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Sweet Guy its basically a
Hera Monga, but for adults. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - That sounds really familiar. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Sweet Guys is the one where the guy, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> gets like zapped by
like an AB like machine. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> And then he develops the power </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> to make any girl horny
just by touching her. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So he has the power of
the cum touch, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> And his this guy who's basically like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> the Rent A Girlfriend protagonist. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like Joni Sins. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> He's like Korean Johnny Sins. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's this incell who
gets this superpower. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Its always an incell. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Its always the incell. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Where he gets the super power of like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> basically anytime he touches a girl, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> he can make them horny and wanna fuck him. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then he does a lot of fucking. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> A lot of fucking. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That sounds great. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But the one main girl
that he's aiming for, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> the power of the cum
touch doesn't work on her. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It only kills her headaches. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> (indictinct) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Extremely useful. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - She's like, deim I have
these searing headaches. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> And the guy's like, let me help you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> (inhales deeply) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Oh, its gone, thank you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - My headaches gone. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> And he was like, deim it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I wanted you to get horny. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Why are you not wet? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think, what the one
series I've been getting into </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or was, had gotten into was Miss Mystic. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What I recommended for you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I discovered Miss Mystic, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> after I binged Domestic Girlfriend. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, I want
something spicy in my life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I need to keep the spice train going. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And Miss Mystic I feel is
that it's that perfect mixture </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> of just a nice spicy story
and like unlike sex, as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, pretty much, it's
like a really compelling, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I actually give a shit, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> about the mystery behind the whole thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> While also being like, "Oh, yay, boobies." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (indictinct) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Gonna explain to Cornner
what the main plot- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> So there's of course incell
protagonists (indictinct). </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's always the incell protagonist. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (indictinct) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know, I made
this joke in my video, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> but I'm like, why is it
that all of these fucking, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> incell protagonists have
to go through a clumsiness, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> litmus test and pass
it with flying colors. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's so true. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's always the clumsy
motherfucker, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because, he's on a train. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He sees this really pretty girl </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and he's like, deim she's hot. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And then of course his
clumsiness kicks in, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> spills coffee all over her. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He guides her to the toilet
to help her get changed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or whatnot, he's waiting outside. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then suddenly he gets this message </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from the girl and she's
masturbating in the toilet. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> She's just full on
masturbating in the toilet. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - She basically just
sends a premium Snapchat </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to (indictinct) essentially. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But he can't save it and
there's no traces of it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - And so he's like, what the fuck </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is this actually the
girl that I just helped </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and where the fuck did the
video come from and everything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And so now there's this entire mystery, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> behind this main girl that
he's trying to get with. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Where it's like, who the fuck is she? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And why is she fuck with my life- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - That sounds oddly amazing, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> but also, this is like coming
on the mystery expression </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, it totally is, 'cause the more... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Basically the more he gets
involved with this girl </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and the more his life gets fucked up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - So, he's already has a girlfriend- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Don't stick your dick in (indictinct). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - He doesn't know if it's
this girl that's causing it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's just coincidentally, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> when he met this girl his life started... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> His life just- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Fucking good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's really good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Its really good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Viral downwards. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And like a lot of things
keep happening to him, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like messages being sent </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or like videos being
leaked and everything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And there's no way to trace it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And he doesn't know who
is fucking with him. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> He doesn't know who's fucking with him. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Why they're fucking with him. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> But someone is. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because the girl that
he's trying to get with </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> is, looks and acts really
innocent in front of him. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But then there's this entire mystery </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> of like, is she the one that's actually- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Fucking good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's really good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I wanna read that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's the thing, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> It's the mystery is so well-prepared </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that you actually give a shit about it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and you're not just reading it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> for the tits and ass, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because he's... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Actually, he's not an incell, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause he has a girlfriend,
doesn't he, in this one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, of like 10 years. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I forgot. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> He's actually gonna get
married to this girl. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> And so like, whatever happens, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> starts fucking up with their relationship- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - His mentality goes
more and more in-sober. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, it does. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - He bowls into an incell. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And what's really good
about it is the story is... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> The story compliments the sex scenes, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> as much as, it's not just
sex for the sake of sex. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> They actually, compliment each other. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> There's actually a reason why he's in all </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> of these different situations. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And the art and character
design is so good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I wanna talk about that with web comics. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> How does everyone- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Why are they also good? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why is the art also good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and why they all colored? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> All right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's exactly what I say it might be, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, why is it... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Is it just like a
coincidence that every Manuel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that I looked up for this video, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just happened to have the
most godly fucking art </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and character design, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> because I don't get
that frequency in Mongo. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Mongo for me is like a very
hit and miss sometimes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, sometimes it's like, okay, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the story's really fucking good, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> but the art is kind of (indictinct). </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Talking about (indictinct). </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then sometimes it's the
other way around, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, man, this Mongo
would be so fucking good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if only the story was good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause the art looks amazing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But for some reason, every
Manuel that I've read </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's always like scored. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Both ends of the spectrum. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I dunno if it's just my
expectations of Manuel, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> it's just so low that
anything will impress me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> or if it's genuinely good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - If there's one thing I can compliment, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> about every Manuel I've met </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is that the art is always fantastic. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's colored. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, you get it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Imagine getting a full color chapter. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's like a gift from Jesus </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or something every time it come out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Reading Joe Joe colored was amazing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And I was like, Fan Don I think, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> all the fans colored. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And it's like amazing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like (indictinct). </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - And in the world of web comics </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> this shit is just normalized. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I know it's crazy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, 'cause I remember
reading Solo Leveling, as well. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Which is, on paper, the most generic, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> power fantasy show ever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Sounds like it's up your alley there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Of course I fucking loved it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why did you love power
fantasy one so much. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know, because, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (indictinct) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - He wants to feel strong. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I know I figured this out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is because power fancy shows to me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are like the turn my brain off. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> These shows are the ones that
activate my monkey brain. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I was, for the
longest time, I couldn't- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We all have a monkey brain. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Of course. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - For like the longest time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I couldn't figure out the
appeal of slice of life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like a lot of people like slice of life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've just never been able to get into- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I like slice of life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - And then I realized,
I think my mentality </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when watching these trashy
Sekai power, fancy shit </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> it's the same kind of mindset </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when people have when
they watch slice of life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Which is just switch
my brain off and just- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just enjoy what you're watching. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just enjoy what I'm watching. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Power fantacy has given me the
minimal amount of engagement. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just the minimal, just enough
to activate the monkey brain, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but not enough to make me think anything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is it like, 'cause you liked the idea </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that it could be you in
the powerful position. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Is that why? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like the biggest
compliment, yet biggest diss. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean, that's why I
call them trash, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Cause I know they're fucking trash. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I don't watch them to
engage myself in any way, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> shape or form. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - So, it's not a matter of
like immersing yourself. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause I know how it feels to be like 15 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and watching Sao and you're
like, God, I wish that was me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (indictinct) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I wanna be Kaito so bad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I wanna be so fucking OP in real life. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then you realize shit, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that's kind of incell. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Hella incell. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like all my problems will be solved </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if I'm just better than everyone else. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> If this is a world that relies on strength </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm just disgustingly over power- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> My life will just be easy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No one can call me an asshole or- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Alpha male way of thinking. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think that's what it is though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, especially when you're younger, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> and you think like, all my life- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I wanna grow up to be like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause you're like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> okay, well maybe I'm not
fitting in at school. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I wanna be (indictinct) and fuck shit up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I bet he gets ass if he wants it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There was definitely a
point in my teenage hood. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I think in a lot of other people, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when they were teenagers where, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we watched power fantasies, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause we want to be the
fucking main character. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think the appeal like
there's always still </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that kind of appeal, that I
don't think I've ever lost that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Really. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I think it grew out of that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I still have that with Hara Monga. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 'Cause when I was like, grow up, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I thought like when I was like 15 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I thought Talavera was
like a gift from God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Cause I'm just like, bro </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I wanna be Rito is so fucking hard </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and get all these girls. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And now I have read over it again, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm just like, your the same. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That feeling is still there dude. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like reading Sweet Guy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - God, I wish that was me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You get to see this
guy, fuck a load of girls. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> And you're like, it's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> oh I'm feeling the power of
fancy I felt when I was 15. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's really weird, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause you in like very
long-term relationships, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> yes, I just want to fuck
everybody (indictinct). </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't give a fuck. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - You got to play that
question real safe boys. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Why you put me in an edge like that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Sidney's like listening. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> You wanna fucks other
people Garnt? (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like Sidney's watching
with eagle eyes right now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Just like, oh, what's he gonna say? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just say it (indictinct). </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Say it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Say I'm not good enough for you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, but I feel like a
lot of guys never grow out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of that phase when they're a teenager. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> There's always a little bit of teenager. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Everyone has that horny monkey brain. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like one show I've been
really enjoying recently </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> has been a Demon School Academy, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which is power fantasy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> But it takes it to another fucking level. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This guy is like more
OP than any other wise- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is that the white head
like huge buff character is- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Or is that something else? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wasn't that the really
shitty animated one, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> The Tale Of Gary or something. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah that one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, it's like tale of
like Greg or something. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> It's a really white name. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Its the one who fucks the ogres. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I can't remember, as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like the tail, right, of fucking- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I know exactly what I'm talking about. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like fucking clip art animation. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - All I remember is that he
has the whitest name in imagine </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like Glen or like Greg or something. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The legend of Gary (indictinct). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But I know this guy
from Demon School Academy, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he opens up the episode with him, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> beating up a guy to
death with his heartbeat. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And you're like, this is so over the top. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This is like the most satirical, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> non-statistical show I've ever seen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He's so OP that you're like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> they can't be taken this seriously, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> but it is played off in the
series totally seriously. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But the situations themselves
just feel satirical, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> because he dies about... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> He's died about three times
in the shows in the show now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But he's so OP that he's like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you think that killing would make me... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Would be enough to make me die? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yes I have seen that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Yeah, I saw that meme. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I'm just like, man, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm enjoying the shows for
like totally different reasons. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just monkey, my monkey
brain is like clapping now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This is fucking fantastic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It sounds like a (indictinct) I know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If I wanted to just like fucking around </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and just be like, I'm gonna
make the most generic, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> satirical just parody of
power, fantasy, I know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that would be the plot. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like the Kanye West,
the power fantasy light levels. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> Because it's just become
a parody of itself. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Okay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> You know what power
anime I really enjoyed, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it was the one with that fucking, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was gonna say the schools, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but that doesn't help at all. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The one with the, it's a magical school </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and he has no powers. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> It's a different one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (indictinct) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> It's different. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> It's the one with the guns. He makes guns. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> He's a famous gun maker. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - He makes guns. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He makes guns in the show. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like a certain magical,
not a certain magical Index. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, a fucking, a
certain magical high school </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> with some fucking shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (indictinct) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm fucking losing my mind here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - It sounds like he describing... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> You just went from Index to
like fucking rail gun now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like fucking similar
vibes to that show. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is it an Easter guy? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - No. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's just a power fantasy- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - The guy who everyone
thinks he's gonna his sister </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> in the school. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Again, your not
narrowing it down at all. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, I know the one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Is it the one with the white and green- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - You know the one I'm on about. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - I know the one your on about. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Mahoka, I think... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Don't know the full name. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, yeah, the irregular high school one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's what I said before. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> You were like no, that's not it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, I was talking about a
different one at that time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That was a hera Manama. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> This one's a different
one about a power fantasy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Wait so were you talking about before? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - No not that, I was talking
about a different one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I cleaned it up being like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Oh, you're the one you
were talking about before </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was the irregular magic (indictinct). </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - When we take our next two minute break, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm gonna look it up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause I'm frustrated now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And I'm like, okay, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we're done with the regular high school. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> And you're like, what's the one- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I wasn't talking about a
regular magic high school before, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I am now, Joey. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's a good show. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> End of comment. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which is like the fact that these shows </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are so generic, they're trying
to distinguish between them, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and it becomes impossible to us. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> So, what did you like
about that show, Connor? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - The exact same shows as
every other (indictinct). </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know, it was a good show. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I did not enjoy that show, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because, again, as you said
it was exactly the same </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> as every other fucking power fantasy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - For some reason that shows... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Its so popular here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I see it fucking everywhere. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know why. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I kinda get it, 'cause
I fucking loved it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know why I loved
it, but I loved it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's so boring. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, this is exactly the same </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> as every other light novel I've ever read. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've tried to justify why I
like certain power fantasies, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or certain generic,
light novel adaptations </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> more than others, and I've just given up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just like they're all trash, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I like this one, I have no idea why, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I guess I'm just trash as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Fair enough. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay I described it the same way, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> that I described the
appeal of light novels, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or how I perceive the appeal
of like a slice of life, sorry. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Slice of life, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - So like, why do you like Slice Of Life? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What's the appeal to you? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause to me, how people view, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> like these Powell fancy
Easter Carla, whatever shows, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is how I view Slice Of Life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> To me, they're all the fucking same. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, they are. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I don't deny that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because I've gotten a lot of criticism, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in the past being like,
you like Slice Of Life? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You could be doing anything else </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and yet you're watching
the fictional lives, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> of these fictional characters. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm just like, I think that's
the part about it though, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because it's like, again,
when I watch an anime, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm thinking way too hard about it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> like I always have to,
I'm always looking at it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like some kind of
analytical, kind of like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> okay, why do I like this show,
why do I not like this show? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And slice of life just provides nothing, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> that nothing becomes a something,
do you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, because- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is getting
philosophical now. (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've always tried describing like this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> because there's nothing there </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that nothing becomes something. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And that thing, because
they're not doing anything, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> everything they do becomes entertaining. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because there's just
nothing there to begin with. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can't do it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't, I can't. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Maybe you should have
been the monk Joey. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I know, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah man, shave that
hair Joey, let's go. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know, I mean maybe
there's a part of me as well, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the reason why for example, I
really like "Non Non Biyori". </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Right, it was like, because it's sat </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in the middle of the nowhere, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in like the butt fuck
middle of nowhere of Japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in the mountains, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And where I grew up, like
at my grandma's place </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it looked very similar. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, I think a lot of
that kind of atmosphere, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> is brings me back to my childhood, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> of like, just being in like
the middle of a rice field </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and just trying to find anything to do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for entertainment sake, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And just watching these
characters go through that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> it's just like, okay,
yeah, I can relate to that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's kind of cute and wholesome, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause I think the only Slice Of Life, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've enjoyed ever, like
pure Slice Of Life, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I think, I can't
even remember the name, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was the one with the two girls, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> going around to the post-apocalyptic- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Girl's Last Tour... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is it "Girls Last Tour"?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I can't even, yeah, "Girls Last Tour". </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because that's one of
my favorite Slice Of Live. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, that's the only Slice
Of Life I've ever enjoyed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And I still couldn't finish it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Really? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, because I need to
be in a very specific... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I needed to be in like
such a specific mood </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> to watch that show and be
able to like not fall asleep. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's one of the most quieter
shows I've ever watched. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Because a lot of the times, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's only these two girl characters, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and there's almost no
fucking music or background, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's very avant garde, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like watching a fucking art school, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like project it's black and
white and spoken in French, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The opposite of what I want. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it looks and
feels very pretentious, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> if you don't understand the
deeper meanings behind it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah 'cause I feel like
I need the bare minimum, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> of engagement for me to enjoy a show, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Even if it's just the
same kind of engagement </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> I've seen a million times before, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I will take that over Slice Of Life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - When I like used to watch shows, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> without looking what they were. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was just watching a show, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> On the contrary, I just click it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then I'm watching a Slice Of Life </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and I get two episodes and I'm like, wait, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> nothing's gonna happened. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They're not gonna do anything are they? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Why is it like you'll
like monkey brains, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> just like it lags for a minute, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it takes you to whole episodes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Hold on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - In this case, I actually
agree with Connor. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - You get like two
episodes then you're like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> wait, they're not gonna do
a single thing are they? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They're not gonna go anywhere. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because, I remember
when I first watched Kaon, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and the "Kaon" that... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> The entirety of the Kaon
fandom hates me now, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> because of that one
review that I did on Kaon. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Because I didn't understand
the appeal of Slice Of Life, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> back then. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And I watched "Kaon" with
the same kind of expectations. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Anything would happen. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Any other show. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> And people have told me
the appeal for "Kaon", </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> and I understand it now, but
I can never relate to it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because I still can never
get that same kind of, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> connection to a Slice Of Life show. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's why I don't blame anybody, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> who says that they don't
like Slice Of Life, at all. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like in any Slice Of Life, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they'll just be like, no, it's all boring, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> nothing fucking happens, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I'd rather be watching like
a show anime or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like a generic show. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- I totally get that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because again, I don't wanna
say it's an acquired taste </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or anything, but I feel it is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It is an acquired taste. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, I'm gonna say the
same thing about Isekai Joey. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - And that's okay man, it's good man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm gonna say that about music. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Music isn't acquired taste. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay if I'm gonna watch Slice Of Life, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'd rather just watch, I don't
know, real life, I guess. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'd rather watch like a documentary, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about something that's real I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - But even like a documentary, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> there's, I don't know- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it's like a story line. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's still engaging. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Stuff happened. (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I feel like the closest
thing to RL Slice Of Life, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> is, what's that Japanese
TV show, Terrace House. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Have you ever seen it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, fuck it, I can't
watch Terrace House. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's like Slice Of Life, IRL. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - If you wanna watch that, and
I'm like, what's the appeal, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like oh, you can just watch
them do their daily things, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and have your thoughts about that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, I can have my
thoughts about my real life. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't need to fucking
think about something like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, it's the exact same reason, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> why people wanted to watch
"Big Brother", right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - They wanted to watch it
like a shit show though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like "Terrace House"
is very like just polite. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They were always just like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I never watched it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I could never get into
Big Brother either though. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Now I could relate to that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I liked watching "Big Brother", </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just because the people
that they had on there, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> were just the most fucking
degenerative fucking way- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - That was like finely selected. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Craziest people they could find. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can't believe these
are not real people. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then later I found out
that the entire show scripted, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm like, oh that
makes a lot of sense. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, they obviously put a lot of work </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> behind the scenes to make it entertaining, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> whereas I feel with Terrace House, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just here are just
people living their lives, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and there's a camera watching them. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I just don't get why that's
fun, I just don't get it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Maybe I'm too monkey brain. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - There was a show-
- I'm with you dude, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm with you, on this one I'm like... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I got my own life to worry about, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> how the fuck I worry
about what other people, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just having an awkward conversation, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I can experience that myself. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - There was a show that
preceded "Terrace House", </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> and I don't know if
it's still going on now, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it's called Inori. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And there was a show that's kind of, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> similar to "Terrace House", </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> but there was like a
romance element to it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> It's essentially think
of a Harem anime, IRL. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's the only way I can describe it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, they would like gather- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is it like "Love Island", </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> or some shit like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's similar to that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But, they would get a
bunch of guys and girls, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> single guys and girls, and
they put them on this bus, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they would take the bus, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they would basically just
do an entire tour of Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like wherever the fuck they wanted. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But at every stop, one
of the guys or the girls, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> had to like confess basically,
to be like, I like you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And if they responded back positively, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then the bus would leave the two there, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then basically just left
them, do their own thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - In the middle of nowhere? (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Sometimes it was, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it was harsher when
the other person denied it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because then the person who confessed, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> would be left there,
basically, on their own, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and just watching like a guy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or a girl get denied on that show </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was the most heart wrenching, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yet somehow the most
fucking entertaining thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you've ever seen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because it's just like, is he gonna? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause it was, it was like a Harem anime, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where like, one of the best goals </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is getting prepared to
confess to the main character- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Come on, come on, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've seen you like go
camping with this dude man, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like you gave us some good vibes, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you got this girl, you've got this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then when the guy's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "No sorry there's another
girl there I like." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And the sad music just starts playing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm just like, no, it's
like watching your... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Going back to the whole
sports thing, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like watching the grand finals, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and the one team's just like flubbing it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> at the last second. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Just like, no, I lost the game. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, but I prefer that over "Terrace." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I gave Terrace House a go. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know, it would seem like on paper, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I like Slice Of Life, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It would seem like this is
a show made for me, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, here's what confuses me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Do you have a favorite Slice Of life </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and how do you justify that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey exhales heavily) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I mean 'cause so many shows can be, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> defined as Slice Of Life shows
and yet they're not, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean, like, I dunno, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I guess "Lucky Star" will
probably be my favorite, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> just because... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It because Meimeis? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, because of the Meimeis, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause it appeals to the
Otaku culture, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And like that was a huge part... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> That was like when I was deeply
rooted in the Otaku culture. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> So that anime spoke to me,
dude, it hit different. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - That was a slice of life that- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Gonna go a whole episode- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No dude. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> No, but I'd said that's
probably my favorite, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for those reasons, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Gentlemen, I found out
what the show was called, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> it's called "Trinity Seven". </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I have watched that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I have not even watched that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can tell you it is exactly the same. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Garbage. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's literally the
same, just a bit older. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think he can like block magic, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or can counter it or something? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's garbage, essentially. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just garbage. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's was hot garbage. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's really bad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Okay, wait, here's a
question for you guys then. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> What is the worst show that you think... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> What is your guilty pleasure, I guess. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Do believe in guilty pleasures, 'cause... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, yeah, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Absolutely, I mean, I
mentioned how I got my friend, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to watch "Kiss Sis" with me, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I own all 23 volumes of
"The Manga," as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - (indictinct) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Why would you fund that shit man? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because it's so bad yet so good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like it is... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I have a lot of guilty pleasure
shows, I'd like to admit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Mm-hmm. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But I think the biggest for
me where I can openly be like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah I know this thing sucks,
but man, I can't put it down, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's definitely "Kiss Sis". </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - There's so many shows I like that suck, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> but I wouldn't call it a guilty pleasure. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm fine with being
like, yeah I like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So you don't believe
in a guilty pleasure or? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know, maybe I've
just gotten to the point </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> where I don't give a fuck. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's my point now, I just like shows. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just don't give a fuck anymore. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But I guess I put some
shows in different categories, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause it's a different kind of enjoyment, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I would never recommend, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I would never actively
recommend some of these, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> fucking shows I watch, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> but I definitely have some
shows that I put in an ad, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like an actual good kind of enjoyment, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> if there is anything as like
kind of a good enjoyment. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean I say "Kiss Sis"
is my guilty pleasure right, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> but I'm not guilty for liking that show. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> It's just my pleasure. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm not guilty, it's just my pleasure. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> But, again, I just call
it a guilty pleasure, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because I don't openly be like,
have you watched Kiss Sis, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like I don't openly recommend it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> unless you're my friend
from high school, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Unless you're my friend from high school. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's a Yahudi scene about to happen. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> But, I have lots of shows like that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like "Yosuga No Sora" is another one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I still need to watch that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I watched that entire thing, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I remember when Dee was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause Dee Revel House, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he has this series called
"The Surviving Series", </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where he goes and like
basically to get people, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to watch these like
absolutely hot garbage shows, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I remember he did an entire episode, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on "Yosuga No Sora" and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bro I'm glad you didn't
call me onto this show, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> because I would have been
praising the fuck out of the show </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the entire time, I'm
like, I know this sucks, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I know that there is some
mad wind set shit going on </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> in this show, but man,
it's so good. (laughs). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, he never called me, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to go on the "Domestic
Girlfriend" episode. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - For good reason, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'cause I still love domestic girlfriend, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's hot garbage, the ending sucks. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Would that be your guilty pleasure? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't know, because I would say, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the manga for "Domestic
Girlfriend" for like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 80% of the manga for
"Domestic Girlfriend", </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I still think it's a
fucking well-written show. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> The way I describe it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's kind of like a soap opera, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but the characters are actually
well-written in my opinion, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but the things that, the
events that happened, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> in the soap opera are still
very soap opera stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But the way they handled
it is still very good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The anime I feel that's garbage. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Because that skips, over a lot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of the actual character development. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Basically the anime speed run's shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The anime just took the
trashest moments from the manga, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and put it all in one package. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, well then Connor will like that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I won't lie, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's a speed run anime, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But like the "Domestic
Girlfriend" manga ending, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everyone pretty much
agrees it's all garbage, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and I've had time to sit in it now, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I think I actually like the ending </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of "Domestic Girlfriend" just because... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - You're going through
the phase that I had, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> with School Days, basically- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Where it's just like the
first time you watch it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and your just like, man,
this is hot garbage. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But then the more you think about it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> your like, you know what,
this actually might be genius. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because, I think that
the series started off </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as a flaming dumpster fire. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And it ended in like a nuclear fallout </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> kind of dumpster. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it was on theme. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was on point. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like who got on this train, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> knowing he was about to crash </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and thought he was gonna parallel park. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We all started watching
Domestic Girlfriend, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause we knew it was a fucking car crash. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What were we expecting? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - They let you know from episode one, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like literally the opening scene, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> you were just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this is gonna suck. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> This is gonna be messy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I think the best thing
it did was trick us into... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Because it tricked us into thinking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it could have ended well, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because there was a lot of
well-written moments in it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They tricked us. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - They tricked us and they made us forget </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that it was a dumpster fire- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because of the way it ended </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it will forever stick in my mind. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm gonna reread that shit someday. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - His telling his grandkids about this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I will tell my fucking
grandkids about the ending </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of Domestic Girlfriend. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Do you have one like that Connor. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, not really. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I never really like... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Or do you just not even
bother with like shows that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, I feel like with... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, with shows normally I tend not to. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm trying to think of what
have been some big animated, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> end controversially. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The bit that people didn't
know the ending of already. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Right, because of the Mongo. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> So its kinda hard animeted feel. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I know right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, you're talking about
anime original endings now </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or like original anime. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Or if it's like from like a
game like school days, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - What about something like
Darling And The Franks, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> which is the closest- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's was a fun (indictinct). </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I feel if darling... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If I watched Darling And The Franks, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> without having been in
the anime community, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I would hate it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But I loved the experience
that it gave me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> just like being a part
of the dumpster, fire. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like threatening the voice actors. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, my God. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That shit was ridiculous. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Why is it the first thing that happens, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> whenever someone's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause the same thing happened
with Domestic Girlfriend. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Where the author just got death threats </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and like people would just
shit talking them online. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like why do you do this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's because, I guess
they're just like the face </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> of the show, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Or the face of the problem
that resides in the show. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So it's just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they don't blame the
directors or the producers, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause no one can see those people, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's always the front facing people. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is it the Japanese
audiences is doing that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause I swear, I didn't
see any of that online. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It wasn't on my Twitter. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think it was kind of universal. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Like in the case with Domestic Girlfriend, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> a lot of it was like the, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it was definitely the Asian population. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know if was
specifically the Japanese. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I know I saw a lot of
like Chinese, Korean. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think, because the author had </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to actually come out and
say it was like foreigners. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So it wasn't people from Japan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't where it was from. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Might've been from the West, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> might have been from
other Asian countries- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I know that at least in
the West all Meme culture, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> pretty fucking cryptic if you're not from- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's shrouded in a very
large vail of circusim, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Look extremely aggressive to someone </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> who doesn't understand this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Probably like a competition- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wasn't there Japanese illustrator, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who's like apologizing for
all the sarcastic tweets </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that will being made- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Someone like commented,
I think I saw this, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was like, someone
had replied to that post </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> with the emoji with the gun, like huffing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like keep posting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause it's so good, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> We understood it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> But obviously the Japanese couldn't- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And they were fighting back being like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm sorry (indictinct). </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Please don't point that at me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they took that at face value, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - The took down that post, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause they were like, they thought </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> they were offending- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - But all fucking memes are fucked up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember the, when
Villain Saga was airing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people were sending like tweets </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> to the author of Vilan Saga,
calling him like a goat, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the goat. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The goat. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And the author was like, why
are people calling me a goat? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Am I doing bad. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Have I done something bad? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Memes do not translate. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, they do not translate well. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't like Japanese memes, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I've always been curious how
the Japanese meme culture is? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, a lot of the
Japanese means that make it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> well, I mean a lot of the
best memes in my opinion, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> stay on 2Chan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If you know anything about
2Chan, they're pretty bad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I know they're like
even most than 4Chan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> If you thought 4Chan was bad, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> never gone to 2Chan. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I remember one of my friends, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> he used to be on 4Chan a lot. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> And then when I told him about 2chan, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he's like man for the
first time in my life, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm glad I never took Japanese. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because if I could understand </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what these threads were saying, holy shit, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I would just be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh my God, I didn't know humans, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> could say such horrible
things to one another." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's really fucking brutal over there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But the memes are very funny. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The memes are great. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And luckily I think a lot of the best, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> probably the safest
memes that start on 2Chan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> do eventually make it on Twitter. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And man those fucking blow
up on Japanese, Twitter. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like so crazily. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like if you thought memes
on like Western Twitter, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> were like, whoa, 50,000
retweets, holy shit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Dude, I've seen Japanese memes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that have like a million retweets. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Deim. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm just like fuck, I
mean, yeah, it's a good meme, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> but God deim guys. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, Western Twitter is just Tik Tok, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> re-uploaded right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, basically. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, some of them are some of them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are pretty good to be fair. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Your sure how long that's gonna last. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Conversation that
we're having right now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Some of them were good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause I feel from what I can see </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with Japanese social media in general, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we've talked about internet hates a lot </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> on this podcast before and
it feels like with Japan, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's either you're really nice and polite </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or it's like the fucking worsted. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Dude there's a reason why I never wanted </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to start a Japanese YouTube channel. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I thought about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> When I first moved here, I was like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> should I start a separate channel </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> where I've, it's aimed towards
a Japanese audience, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It doesn't necessarily
have to be anime related. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was just gonna do just a
regular vog style channel, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but all in Japanese. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> And then I watched a bunch
of Japanese YouTubers, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause before I'd never really
watched Japanese YouTubers </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I saw their comments sections, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Nah, I don't want that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't want any of that shit," </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because, man, some of
the fucking like hate, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like some of the fucking hate movements </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that happen towards Japanese
YouTubers are crazy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember there was
one Japanese YouTuber, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who, and on Japanese
YouTubers, you fuck up once, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> your career is done. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause they will hold on to that shit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for the rest of your
career, until you're gone. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Because there was one Japanese, YouTube- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (indictinct) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, but to a completely
different degree. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know about that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, people have very short memories. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> How many times is the Pole Bro fuck up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and they still get decent views, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But there was this one, Japanese YouTuber, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who didn't even do anything bad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> He had a pet goldfish
and the goldfish died. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And so, he threw the goldfish... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He drained it down the toilet. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay. All right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Basically, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Really standard, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Of course that's what you'd normally do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It got so much hate that even at this day </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and this happened like
four or five years ago, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know about the accuracy of this, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't quote me on this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But it happened like
four or five years ago </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and since then, every
single one of his videos </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> have gotten a 50% dislike ratio. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Deim. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Just from that one thing that he did </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and people are still
holding onto it for it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> For years now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just think they keep onto hate </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> for like another level. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I think that's why
the idol culture here, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> must be so scary. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause you fuck up once here </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you're an idol or
voice actors or something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and your career just done. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - They just expect perfection from you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It definitely feels like they... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> The image that you
build, they immediately, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm in control of it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And that if you... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like you said, if you fuck up once, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like, they're almost
like entitled to you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Perfect. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, pretty much. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - And if you ruin it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> well, you've ruined this
thing I liked, you did that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> You ruin this thing I enjoyed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, what do you mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> It's just me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> And sometimes they forget
that some of these people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> are just humans, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's kind of this mentality where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> they're not allowed to be
human in a lot of ways. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And that's what it feels like. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'Cause I remember the
first story I've ever heard </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> about this kind of situation happening </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in the anime community
was probably with Hirano. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Of like how his voice actress. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Like there was a scandal
like back in the day- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Scandal quote, unquote. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Scandal, back in the day </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when she was voicing in Harohe, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> she was voicing in Lucy Star, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> she was like the triple
alias celebrity here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - She was like one of the
hottest names in this industry. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I think what happens is that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> she had a music career, as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> She had a band and I think she slept </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with everyone in the band, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> except for the bass guitar player. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Every bassis, (indictinct). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like a moment of silence
for the bass guitar player. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Every five or four subscribers- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Why is it always the basis, men. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> But, yeah, that story got outed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and her career just like
went from like A plus, AAA </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to she had a trouble getting (indictinct). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, she completely
disappeared after that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And since then she's disappeared. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And its crazy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Since then she's only had
like a few bigger roles. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think the only last
role I remember her doing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> was doing Mickey from,
what's that, Para Side. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Para Side, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - But I don't think I've
heard her in anything else </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that I can remember? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like that would kind of
happen in the West though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> A little bit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (indictinct) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like an entire career getting destroyed. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Not an entire career being destroyed, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> at least fucking Twitter
would be clowning on you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> But this happened way before </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the Twitter thing came out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - True. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - This happened in like the mid 2000. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The dudes online are like fucking like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what do you mean you've slept with- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, this seems to be scary. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Scary men. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Would someone's career be over, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> just because, can you
think of a single person </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> whose career would literally be over </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if they had slept with someone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or if they came out to have
a boyfriend or something, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I can't. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - You get clowned on
you'd lose subscribers. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You'd lose viewers, maybe- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Actually you wouldn't,
actually lose your thing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but, yeah, you would be clowned on pretty- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean the only person I can think of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is Pokemon, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I didn't know whether
to bring that up or not, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I mean, if we're talking about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the most recent thing, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> But, even then like what she's getting </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is nowhere near as bad as
what some of these like idols, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and musicians are getting. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like if Pokemon came out
today and she was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Hey, I have a boyfriend. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> She probably get less
attention than she does now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But her career wouldn't be over. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - She'd still easily have a career. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I thought it was confirmed, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> It was. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I think it... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I dunno- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think the whole point was it's like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> well yeah of course she's human, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> she's gonna have a relationship </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and not everyone needs to know that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> It's fine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's her choice if she wants to hide it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> There're those (indictinct),
man, they just like... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> (breathing deeply) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Dude, when YouTubers make videos, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like whether they were in
like a one week relationship, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> like we're together,
it's like, (indictinct). </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I get like real fuck it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think like it says so
much about you and to me- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - At least wait a couple of months, man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Like try and figure out if
it's like a real thing, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - To me it feels like, I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Not to be like, to say it,
but it's kind of like a, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, I'm going to have
sex for the first time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I should announce it to the world." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, its is I slash, I had sex, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - It kinda is like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like it says a lot
about your maturity level </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to do that, I think. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's normally I wouldn't
associate with a YouTube </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who does that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like it's also just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a lot of people can do it
for click Bay, as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - They do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But either way, normally, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's no good connotation </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that comes along with doing that, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - True. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - There normally nothing
good that's coming... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Sure, they're probably very
happy, I'm glad for them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But, let's be honest, at our age, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> which most of the YouTubers are, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> most of their relationships fail </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when they are that early on. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Most of them do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, again, it's fine
if you wanna come out, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> but like, as you said,
if I watch like a... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If I watch like a coming out kind of video </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's just like, we're together now, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I met her last week. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm just like... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (exhales deeply) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> All right, I'm counting down the days </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> of the we broke up video, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Be together for like a few weeks, months </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or I get comfortable (indictinct). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> In your head, why would you not be like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Feel like you're secure,
before you make this video. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like, do you introduce
this girl to your parents </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a week after you just started dating? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Probably not. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - But this YouTubers,
probably introducing it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to their audience before their parents. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Bro, bro, backwards, backwards. Come on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Cause I know Aki and I
waited about, three months, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> before- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You probably felt pretty comfortable. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause we wanted to
enjoy our time together, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just like privately. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And we did. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then we were like, okay, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> now if we want to actually
do more stuff now, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> instead of like hiding about it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then I think now is the right time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, we're comfortable now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Especially- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Get it out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - In your position it's kind of forced </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to tell people. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're gonna be together. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can't hide that shit, right, forever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Both of you posting constantly- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - We know, both of you are together </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in a lot of pictures. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - People are gonna connect the dots. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is she just going to
go hang out with him? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Is that how it is, really? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> No. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But yeah, both of you are
in YouTuber relationships </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was there normally the landmine
waiting to just go off? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> What are you saying? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, normally at least
you guys are in the clear now, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like you've got to
the stage where it's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all right, it's mega serious. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - (indictinct) Gonna be fucking married, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> get out of my sight. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You fucking simps. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm fucking tired of these
fucking happy people around me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> When your like, dude... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Especially, my size now I'd be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'd be way too scared to
date another YouTuber, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - No. I mean, I get that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, for me with Sydney, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's kind of a bit different. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because, she... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, she has been on
YouTube for a very long time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but I wouldn't really
call her like a YouTuber, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where she does this as a job. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> She's kind of grown pretty recently. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - She does (indictinct) YouTuber? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That makes sense. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I mean, we started
dating when I wasn't... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> This was before I came back to do YouTube </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for full-time anyway. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So, we've been dating for
like a very long time, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like a good five, six years. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I remember seeing your video, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> like, was it nerve wracking
for you guys coming out </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to be like, "Hey, we're
a YouTuber couple." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Definitely, because- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What was the reaction, like? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean the reaction was
mostly really, really positive. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Thank God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> But I remember, Aki losing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a very significant portion
of her male audience. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> And I lost a very significant
portion of my female audience. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - What kind of percentage? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> What kind of numbers are we talking about? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I probably, I dunno. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Before we came out, I think I had... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I think I had like a 60,
40 female to male ratio, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which I was like, "Wow, okay." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I thought more males
would be (indictinct). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But then the moment I came out, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think that dropped by
like 10, 15%, at least. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was a really significant number. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And the same thing with Aki, as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> As about at least a 10, 15% drop. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But we kind of expected that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because, we'd had been
to conventions enough times </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and we saw- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, a lot of people were speculating- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - We saw a lot of people
were speculating, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think I remember watching your AX vlog </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and then people had saw
that you had like a hickey. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And I was like, oh is Joey- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Joey, getting it on here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - We're not proud of that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I knew Aki falling (indictinct), </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> was like God deim it Joey, you left that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, we're not proud of that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's all right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> That's all right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> We were young. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> We were young, that's whatever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's cute, men. It's cute. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's cute when we look
back on it, it's fine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Must have been stressful back then </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where people were just speculating every- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - (indictinct) Enhance. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Enhance. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - CSI people. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Is that a hickey or a burse? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Get the blue light out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - We need to know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Check for fingerprints. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Someone's in that dark room. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> But like, I think it was
nerveracking for the both of us, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> because it was the first time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that we'd ever had to
make a video like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And we knew we had to make
a video like that, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Eventually, we weren't gonna hide it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for the rest of our career, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> So, I think it was stressful at the time. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And you can see it in
our coming out videos, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that were very nervous and like... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, we're going together
now, kind of thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But at the same time,
after that video went out, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was just like, "Oh, thank God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Now I don't have to fucking hide about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the fact that I have a girlfriend now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Really pleasant as well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> must have (indictinct) a lot of support. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There was a lot of support. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I had a lot of fucking like
YouTubers approached me, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> who had never spoken to me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I remember Garnt fucking tweeted out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - This was, I think our interaction, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> since that time we thought
we hated each other. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> It was the first interaction. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was the first interaction on Twitter </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> where like Gard was like congrats </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to (indictinct) Aki and Joey
are doing this together. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was just like, "Oh my gosh." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I remember this too? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm just like, "Oh my God. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> He doesn't hate me." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I think he like me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No, a lot of (indictinct)
Tubers tweet at us, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> being like, yeah, the two
biggest anmie Tubers are together </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and blah, blah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was like a really big deal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, it's not that big a deal guys. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We're just getting
together, it's all good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But no, we were really happy about it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because, again we were
a little bit worried </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about like maybe there
might be some kind of, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> hidden thing that put us in
some kind of a negative light, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but no, it all came out really fine. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause I remember watching that video </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I remember thinking, man, they... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think they definitely
approached this the right way, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> 'cause everyone knew if you were dating </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this was something that
you would have to address, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sooner or later. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Because your both big
personalities on the platform. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think you definitely went
about it the right way. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I remember just wanting
to quick congratulate you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause I know the trouble's go through </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with long distance relationship, as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - With Sydney, man, that shit's tough. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, tell me about it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> We were in a long distance
for two and a half years, man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah. I dunno. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, my monkey brain can't handle it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was long distance with
Sydney for like a good year </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> or something and that was
one of the hardest years </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> of my life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - When you were like still single online </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> did you messages people like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> would you ever do long distance? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - So, how long though? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Are you available or a long distance? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - What kind of time zone
differences is okay? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm like just fucking say it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like what are you expecting me to say? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like, if it's less than
eight hours, then it's doable. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> But any more than that, bro (indictinct). </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - When I used to live stream, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> doing like, Austine and Sebastian stuff, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the most common thing
that I would often get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is like, this is a long distance? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What's your thoughts on that Connor? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What are your thoughts on that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You dating anyone by the way? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - They don't just say it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they just like, are you perhaps
considering the possibility? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Or they'll say, what's
your ideal partner like? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I got that a lot when
I was doing panels- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm trying to say </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> that I'm like a giga chat </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and everyone just can't help themselves. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But, you just get people who like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, I think you
can say that as the 93% </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, you should
expect that at that point. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> When there's thousands of subscribers </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> there's gonna be like one or two of them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that are interested in you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That are gonna try and see
what ways they can pursue that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - From a formerly written
email, which is many times. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Or they'll do a, not so subtle donation. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What is their logistics
of us pulling up together </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in this long distance relationship. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - What I gotta do is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I gotta some episode I end
up doing a presentation </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> of all the different ways
people have tried to hit me. </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_01> I'm not trying to do any... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just trying to say it's
really fucking interesting. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> The way that people try
to like get in there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Top 10 confessions in anime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Its so interesting when
you realize it the way... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> 'Cause there's like routes in their mind, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm going to go this way. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm going to direct
route the curve ball route. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like a fucking visual novel. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's levels of difficulty, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's like YouTube comment, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> impossible for him to ever date me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> To like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Level 99. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - To like donate $10,000
so you can not ignore me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And there's so many

<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean, if you guys
are interested in that- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Download if you wanna hear the power... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll actually be- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm interested. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I will legit prepare a
PowerPoint presentation. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Were going to screen
for something, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'll do it, I'll do it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Oh, my God. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm trying to think of like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what a weird thing that a
lot of people do on YouTube? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Just weird stuff they might say often </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> that I'm trying to think. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - What, like the whole thing of like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> there's always that one
comment in every video, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is like, Joey is not gonna see this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He's not gonna reply,
just because I'm first </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in the comments section. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Woman] What kind of thing? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I dunno. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. I dunno. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I'm tempted to call
and to prove them wrong </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and I'm like, no, that's what you want. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, I'm going to fall into the bait, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you almost got me there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, you are right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm not gonna see this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Fuck you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Fuck you for thinking
you're entitled to my time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Actually what I like
to do to those comments </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> is like, I just, I don't even heart it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just like it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So, that the only one that knows </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> is that person. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And the easier reply might be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh my God, Joey liked my comment." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And everyone's like, no, he didn't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because there's no way to prove it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There's no way to prove it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Then they get the notification being like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there men, I liked your comment. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Oh, my God. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm so mean. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think it's because I've been getting, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> like growing a bunch, but
I've just noticed more, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> a bunch of nonsensical
comments on my videos. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like comments that don't relate to it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Well, just people being
like, yeah, I'm tired. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> why are you throwing this
shit under my void, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - There's always ones as well that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> are relating to other commenter's. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They're like, oh, I see that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the guy with the mustache is
not in the comment section. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Did you ever get commenters that just have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> a full on fucking
conversation with each other </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in your comments section. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It turns into a forum </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, this video has 10,000 comments </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and you look down to like
5,000 of them are just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so how you been? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm all right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like an MSN messenger
chat or fucking Skype chat. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm like, you do realize
this is why we have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> a discord for, so that
you can do that there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I saw one is this dude having like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> a fucking mental breakdown
arguing with this person </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to be like, you're fucking wrong. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You don't understand the nuances. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> And some one replied are you okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And the guy replied like
honestly, no, not really. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm glad that someone finally asked me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> And I was like, what am I reading? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like a therapy session- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've seen those exact
same comments, as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like bro are you okay? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, honestly, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm glad somebody finally asked. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm not okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What the fuck am I reading? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - How did this happen? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> How did we get here? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I guarantee as well, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> the person who originally
commented the, you okay, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> is just sitting there like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> oh, fuck, now I have to- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Now I have to like
coach them through this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Or like when they're like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> wow, that's a reference
to X Timmy Minecrafts. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's like (indictinct). </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like people will comment and be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> oh, this is a reference to game grumps. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, they've have so many episodes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they probably set the whole fucking- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - They even like give the reference, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like where it is, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, I didn't know what, I
don't know who this person is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> that you're telling me I'm referencing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like, bro, this
video is just a copy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> of Minecraft players, 69. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I was just like, who? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then I look up the channel </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> and they have like 12 subscribers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just like, how the
fuck am I supposed to know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Two view the video,
like you copied them. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's like... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (indictinct) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> What do you mean I copied them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No one could have copied
them if they wanted to. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause nobody saw the video. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Its so true, because I think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is the first time I'm hearing that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I thought I was the only
person who got those comments. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> I think referencing this random video </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or this random YouTuber </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that I have never seen before. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And apparently, you're
just copying their joke. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You made exactly the same joke maybe. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't fucking know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - The internet is massive. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> People are gonna make
the same joke eventually, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's gonna happen, just get over it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know what type of comment I finally, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just want to see gone. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - What? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's the fucking nobody. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Literally nobody. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Joey. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, I'm just letting
you know guys right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> None of them are funny. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just saying that,
none of them are funny, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> none of them are unique. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sometimes I chuckle. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Sometimes, it's like one
out of like a thousand, maybe. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There are some videos where the comments </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are just fucking gold. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But most of the times comments </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> are just like this big circle joke </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where it's the same type of comment </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> that gets up-voted every time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like the funniest comments in my videos </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> are always the ones that have zero likes. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I'm just like, why does
this not have any likes? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's always the ones I heart, as well. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'Cause I'm just like, here you go guys, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> this is a funny comment. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Look, learn from this comment. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> None of you guys are like this comment, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> all like it, because
this is some funny shit, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> that you guys should be tweeting more. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Not the fucking literally. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Literally nobody. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Joey, (indictinct). </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, the have just
like a copy pasta ready </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for these comments. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - To just be like immediately
be like yep throw it in. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - A semi awkward moment or a funny moment, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> all right, that's it, that's it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, that's the one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> That's the thing that
literally nobody does. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, that's it. That's the one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you guys remember the
era of YouTube comments, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> before they ranked them? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And it was just like,
it was just going by- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like free for all. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It was just a free for all. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I heard that was when YouTube
was a fucking SAS pool, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> At least now it's like somewhat organized </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's just basically
become rated in a way. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> But it's better than... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> It's better than it used to be. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think, like the
funniest comments sections, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I always see are like the, at
least with this year, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It was all the comments
on the fucking Rose </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and big Ed episodes. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like that comments, I've
never laughed that hard </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> for like reading a comments section. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - From the 90 Day fiance- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - 90 day fiance episodes like the clips, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> because it's some of the meanest comments </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that I've ever seen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> But at the same time, it is so funny. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I realize watching reality TV shows, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like 90 Day Fiance are so less fun </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> when you can't read a comment section. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause like I tried
watching the show normally, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like a different season
and it was just not fun, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause every time something
really obnoxious happened </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or one of them said something
really like just stupid. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I wanted to immediately go
down to the comments and see- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh, that's it, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause you know, when you're
watching a YouTube video </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> and something happens, you're like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm going to the comments section. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I wanna see people talking about this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I missed it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't get that when I watch
90 Day Fiance, normally. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - What I wanna experience
is what it would be like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you had like whole anime episodes, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> uploaded on a YouTube- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Comments section. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, what would the comment
section be like, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - We have (indictinct), but
context is like garbage. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean that doesn't work, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because like who the leaves a comment </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on the Crunchyroll web? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know what I mean. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Who does that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Who are you? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Why are you leaving
comments on a (indictinct)? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Cause people are given
they're like 48 hour passes- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's just like, work is add control. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> We gotta fill this common section, guys. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - 'Cause most of the comments
are just like the gift passes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> And then there's people
that actually comment </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on the episodes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then I'm just thinking, man... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - But it's so like non-stops
is like very good episode. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Smiley face. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I Rent A Girlfriend to episode one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the comment was, God, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> this is the trashiest show this season. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'll see you all next week. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I thought that was a good comment. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That sounds like a YouTube
comment though, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, that's what I want. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I want YouTube comments... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's something though
about YouTube comments </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> that just, I don't want to say it, but... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - He's gonna say it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He's gonna say it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (indictinct) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I was going through my
light source in my hand </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and just be like, what's
another word for (indictinct). </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> What's another word for different. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It impacts differently. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It impacts, yeah, differently. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like you just read it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like I can't stand right at discussions. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like they're the most, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm smarter than you discussions always. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> At least you're on YouTube,
everyone knows they're an ape. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Like no one tries to like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Reddit comments are the
epitome of I'm actually. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - I love Reddit, but I
hate looking past the meme. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Some time you'll see some
funny stuff on Reddit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - If there's ever a comment thread </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> that's a discussion it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the biggest minefield I've ever seen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just a bunch of people
who wanna validate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> their intelligence. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's just so sad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't read it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just pathetic half the time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Sometimes there's really good threads </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with really solid advice. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But most of the time's actually when </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like the argument
threads changed my opinion or- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Or am I the ass hole? Fuck me. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Was like, I don't care. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't read. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Every one posted their sub-reddits
like, am I the ass hole? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Everyone who posts that sub-reddit, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> knows they're not the ass hole. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Except for like that one, dude... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That one dad who deleted
his kid's Minecraft. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Of course you're the ass hole. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So as a punishment,
this one dad on Reddit, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> apparently thought it was a good idea, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because his kid wasn't doing work. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He deleted his kids, Minecraft </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and all the stuff that he built in it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I went to read it being
like, am I the ass hole, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I deleted my
kid's Minecraft account </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and all the stuff he built. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And everyone's like,
yes, of course you are. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> At least that kid worked
hard on that stuff. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Of course you're the ass hole. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And it was on like Twitter and everything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That shit blew up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was so- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's like, your kid like building </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> like an actual house or
like from the ground up. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> And then it's like, no, I don't like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> the way you made that room. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> And just blows up the house. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Start again. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It is like 90% of Rettit
is very self-serving </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's like 10%, it's
like a dumpster fire </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you're like, I wanna watch. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, I enjoy Reddit for the memes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Memes are great, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The memes are great. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And when, whenever there's a
good meme threads or something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's where I enjoy Reddit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, that's why I like Alsop Reddit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just all memes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> So reddit.com/r/Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You see that segue boys. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - My Reddit name is
literally, I came for meme. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That literally my reddit name- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - People don't believe
you, that that's you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I saw a thread on Reddit being like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> who is this mullet? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like where's Connor. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Who is this, I came from memes guy </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> and everyone's like, that's Conner. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And everyone's like, all
the new people are like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> no, that's not him. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm looking for see dog VA, where is it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause I literally
only made the account, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> so I can up vote the memes I liked. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Fair enough. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, that luckily I also rented </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> this for memes, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's the best part of Reddit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I feel like when Reddit
takes itself too seriously </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just really grating. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know if you guys feel the same- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Not everywhere over the internet, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> because it's the same thing
with Twitter, as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And the only difference
with some Reddit threads </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and Twitter threads I see </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is Twitter has an avatar behind it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And that's basically the
same kind of toxicity. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think it's the discussion
they have on Reddit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are ones that I only
feel can be constructive </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> in posting with someone. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like having like a- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like every argument over the internet. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Which is why you haven't
argued with some one, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> let's just call, I don't
wanna fucking text you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause you know that
shit don't go anywhere. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - My thumbs were tired. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You wrote a paragraph. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not reading that fucking shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Come on, get on call. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, here's a question for you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Have you guys ever had like the comments </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or like a comment on your YouTube, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> or like someone saying
something on Twitter </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that you know you can destroy- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Slam Dunk. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Slam Dunk them in an argument, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> but it's equally as annoying, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because you want to and you know you can, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but there's too many of
these types of comments, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> like address them all. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And if you dress one, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> then you start just opening
Pandora's box or whatever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've done that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I've been on both sides of that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Just being like, okay, I
see this dumb ass comment, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just like, okay, I can't say anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's a lot of restraint. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Control yourself, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like Zen mind right now with this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Don't get tilted. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just keep it in yourself. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like at least like go to your IRL friends </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and bitch about it to them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like they'll understand. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then sometimes I just look at it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm like, no, this kid's
small brain as fuck. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I gotta put him in his position. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I quote, retweet being
like look at this clown. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I feel like the amount
of restraint it takes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> is like, just stop and go piss mid stream. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> (indictinct) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's like the bottle's getting full, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> don't let it over flow. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Okay, I don't need this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't need the same idea. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm okay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I'm don't need to engage with this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like you're right a fucking idiot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like the first
day of going vegetarian </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> you go to like a steak house, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> (breathing heavily) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> No, I can do this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can do this, please. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I just like, sometimes if
they comment something dumb, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll give them a holla. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, I want everyone to see </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how stupid you are. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not gonna engage it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I'm gonna push this to the top, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> just so everyone could see
how stupid this comment was. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like that one out of a million time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when you do acknowledge it
or reply, it's always there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> They're always like this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Get ready, get ready. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, they're always like the
surprise peak at you face. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They're like, oh, I can't
believe he saw my comment. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> What, I was talking shit
and he replied to me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like what's? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - That only applies on Twitter though. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like, how many situations can you go </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> in IRL where you absolutely
slam dunk someone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then they reply
with a punk face, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's just like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Did you see that, he
just completely dunk me, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm so happy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I understand the mentality where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> if you say something on
Twitter or on social media </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to like a big creator or platform, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you don't expect them to ever see it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But I think you'd be surprised
about how many comments </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that we do actually end up seeing, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> most of them, we just,
we just keep scrolling, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> but some of the comments do
actually stick out to us. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Especially the ones where are like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really criticizing or really grating, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> or one of those ones. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I had the thing that happened, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe like a few months ago, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it was the first time
it's ever happened to me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And this one annoyed
me more than anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> Like they weren't shitting on me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Or they really were shitting on me, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but it was someone else tweeting </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> about how they really
enjoyed all my videos. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And then someone was shitting on them </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> for enjoying my videos. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> For some reason that really pissed me off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, bro, you can
shit on me, for like... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> Why are you gotta shit on someone else </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> for enjoying, like,
what's wrong with you man? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And yeah, that was just a mess. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - So did you reply to that? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I replied being like, yo dude, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean, it's cool if you don't like me, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but why are you gonna
shit on someone else? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Just leave them alone. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then they just kept
light antagonizing us </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was just like fuck it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not dealing with this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think the one comment </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's like still angers me to this day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I realized we've talked
about a lot of hate comments. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - We're very tilted man, as you can see. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because it's the comments
that stick out to us, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> But I think the one that
sticks out to me the most </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I probably won't ever forget. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Is when I got engaged,
when I proposed to Sydney, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> like I don't really talk
about my personal life </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> too much on my Twitter, because I like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to keep that separate from
like me talking about anime- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But it was like the one... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> One of the few times </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> that I actually let out my
personal life to the public, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just because I wanted to show
the entire fucking world- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Very important time of your life. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - How happy I was. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And how this was one of
the most happiest moments </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of my life and I wanted to share that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Of course. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I remember I made it like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Me and Sidney are very close. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm glad that I can
make jokes with Sydney. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And like some of like the most
crucial points in my life. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And like, when I proposed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, man, you're my wife, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I still can have
my wife who Sydney car </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is still my number one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> That was just a funny joke. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That's just the kind
of relationship I have. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm glad I'm with someone
who I can joke around </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> with like that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And so Sydney posted that joke </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> and somebody's like, quote... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They didn't even like
quote, retweets that one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They just, they screen shotted it, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Right, that the worst. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like at least give me, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like some fucking credit, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> They think you can't fucking
see it if they screenshot it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause there's nothing
that leads it back to them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> But they screenshot it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and they posted on their personal Twitter </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> and was like, woman you
should have better standards </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for your men. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Don't let your man get away
with this kind of shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like, you know
nothing about my relationship </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with Sydney, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - That is the biggest, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I know more about your life than you do, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> like common right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like they were judging me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I was making this joke, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> which some some girls won't be happy with </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and if you're not happy
with that kind of joke </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's completely kinda fair- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Don't be with that kind of person. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah exactly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Really simple. Right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was with someone I could
trust to make that joke. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But then Sydney actually
like commented on it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Like she quote tweeted
it and commented on it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And the reaction they
made was just, such a... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, why you like this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause, when she replied she was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can't believe they've actually outed me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like they've just sent
all their followers to me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like getting cyber bullied right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> And your like, what do you expect </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> if you talk shit online
and you can't take it back? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, how would you think we feel? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I love people who do that,
because it's always.... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> It's usually like young guys or girls, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> like in their teens obviously, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And they just expect, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like how do they not
understand the concept of, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> if you're prepared to give shit, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> you better be prepared to take shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like you're talking
shit about someone. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Do you expect them to just not fight back. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, like, why are you
acting like the victim here? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You are here judging my personal life- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - They have more followers than me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like, I don't give a shit dude. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like you shit talk me, I'm a
fucking smack you right back. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You better be prepared for that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And if you're not, then don't
save it in the first place. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Keep it to yourself. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - If you're gonna smack talk </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then you're going to
cry about being called out- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's the equivalent
of like you going up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> to someone, smacking them in the face </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> and then they smack you
back and you start crying. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, what, you smack me first. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I should be the one crying, not you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> What are you crying about? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, basically... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> How to act on the internet, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just like, don't act the way... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Don't act any differently than you would </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in real life, honestly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just be real life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Not that you guys needed to know that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause you'll trash tasteless, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the best taste. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Rule number one just,
don't be a dick head. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> All right it's just really simple. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Don't act like Subaru
from Real Zero in real life, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and you should be fine. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Wait, what you mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Wait what do you mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Dude in season one he
was an ass hole, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, was he though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Dude, when he like confessed in front </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of the whole grand court. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - She told him not to. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, what are you doing, man? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> She told you not to do that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> This isn't your time to shine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I wouldn't call him an ass hole, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> as much as I would just call him a clown. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, I think he was an ass hole. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You do? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I thought he
was in the first season. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, either way, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's not very good, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (cross talk) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You're either a clown or an ass hole. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Either way he wasn't
doing himself any favors. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - But season two, he looks like
he's turned himself around. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Don't be like season one Subaru </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> is what we're saying, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Now season two have
been very much enjoying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> his character development. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I'm glad that he's
finally learning to be an incell. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Every (indictinct)
kind protagonist, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Being an incell is bad... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's a revelation. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - She should think of
women as not an item. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah men. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think that's probably
a good place to end it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah it is. </SPEAKER_05>
