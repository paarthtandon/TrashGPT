<connor> what's going on well now now that you've </connor>
<garnt> explained it now of course it's gonna be </garnt>
<garnt> easy now they've explained they had to </garnt>
<garnt> tell me what was going on i was like i'm </garnt>
<connor> guessing </connor>
<connor> based on you know what's going on i </connor>
<joey> can't really i can't recall the moment </joey>
<joey> in my life where i was like i need to </joey>
<joey> know how this game works </joey>
<garnt> all right good job i can't even remember </garnt>
<garnt> the last time i watched a game show </garnt>
<joey> it's just yeah yeah did you watch any </joey>
<connor> game shows growing up yeah i actually </connor>
<garnt> watched quite a lot </garnt>
<connor> we have quite good ones in the uk yeah </connor>
<joey> like how to be a millionaire that was </joey>
<joey> classic classic games you guys have like </joey>
<connor> uh deal or no deal </connor>
<joey> that was a what country originally made </joey>
<joey> that america america but we had like an </joey>
<joey> australian version </joey>
<connor> yeah the british one went for a long </connor>
<garnt> time yeah we had like who's the host </garnt>
<garnt> no edmunds yeah have you seen the </garnt>
<garnt> american deal or no deal no </garnt>
<garnt> it's like it's like deal or no deal but </garnt>
<garnt> like it's </garnt>
<garnt> way more hollywoodized is it literally </garnt>
<connor> just like the kitchen nightmares deal </connor>
<connor> where like kitchen nightmares usa is </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> boom you won't believe what happened and </connor>
<connor> then the uk one is like gordon's like </connor>
<connor> all right come on you gotta you're </connor>
<garnt> acting </garnt>
<garnt> like it's it's just it's way bigger they </garnt>
<garnt> got like it you know </garnt>
<garnt> instead of just [ __ ] noel edmunds </garnt>
<joey> like opening the briefcase or some or </joey>
<joey> something </joey>
<joey> they've got like the proper you know um </joey>
<joey> boxing ring chicks that like you know </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah yeah like the models that </joey>
<garnt> open up the briefcase you compared to </garnt>
<garnt> like the british version and it's just </garnt>
<joey> it's just night and day wait does the </joey>
<garnt> british version not have because i i </garnt>
<garnt> really see the boxes we have the boxes </garnt>
<connor> oh because in australia </connor>
<joey> that we took the american thing we lined </joey>
<connor> up like 30 chicks can we explain what </connor>
<connor> deal and no deal is you're someone who </connor>
<joey> might not </joey>
<joey> okay basically like a contestant comes </joey>
<joey> on </joey>
<connor> um oh wait opens a bunch of briefcases </connor>
<connor> they have to get down to how do you even </connor>
<garnt> wait so they get down to two </garnt>
<garnt> boxes don't they yeah okay so uh if i </garnt>
<garnt> remember correctly you have </garnt>
<joey> i can't remember like 15 boxes or 15 </joey>
<joey> briefcases </joey>
<joey> it's like 25. is that like a lot yeah </joey>
<joey> and i believe </joey>
<joey> you have to like you have to choose </joey>
<joey> random briefcases </joey>
<garnt> and they get knocked out and then like </garnt>
<garnt> every briefcase has </garnt>
<garnt> a different amount of money in it and </garnt>
<garnt> when you choose that briefcase that </garnt>
<garnt> amount of money is knocked out of the </garnt>
<garnt> prize pool </garnt>
<garnt> and no but isn't it they they pick a </garnt>
<garnt> briefcase first and then </garnt>
<garnt> and they hang on to it but they don't </garnt>
<connor> know what it is oh yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> and then there's basically what they do </connor>
<joey> is the reason why </joey>
<joey> they don't just immediately skip to the </joey>
<joey> final one which you pick is because </joey>
<joey> along the way based on what you've </joey>
<joey> knocked out or got in so say you've </joey>
<joey> knocked out all the lower prize pools </joey>
<joey> like the 1000 pounds the 2000 they'll </joey>
<connor> offer you </connor>
<joey> deals yeah so the whole point of the </joey>
<connor> show is that you kind of want to knock </connor>
<connor> out all the small ones at first so that </connor>
<connor> they </connor>
<connor> might offer you a really generous deal </connor>
<connor> which yeah because your box might be </connor>
<connor> like the one that's left </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah it's it was always a really </connor>
<connor> fun game show and i really liked it but </connor>
<connor> in the uk i don't know if this is the </connor>
<connor> same in australia but like </connor>
<connor> all ages watch like the quiz shows like </connor>
<connor> the daily show yes yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> i just couldn't see like my my grandma </connor>
<joey> watching </joey>
<joey> like bikini models [ __ ] open up dude </joey>
<joey> my grandma was [ __ ] obsessed with </joey>
<joey> deal or no deal oh </joey>
<joey> my my great grandma too as well yeah she </joey>
<joey> was i don't know what it is watched it </joey>
<connor> every day </connor>
<connor> yeah wait but did you guys not have like </connor>
<joey> the </joey>
<joey> the the supermodels like without cases </joey>
<connor> no all game shows are like </connor>
<connor> unapologetically like just like chill </connor>
<connor> people </connor>
<connor> just doing like like for normally for </connor>
<connor> small amounts of money but yeah </connor>
<joey> but then on the opposite of the side of </joey>
<joey> the spectrum you guys have shows like </joey>
<garnt> naked attraction yeah i mean i i don't </garnt>
<garnt> know i mean that's still a small scale i </garnt>
<garnt> would say because even like pointless </garnt>
<garnt> which has been like </garnt>
<connor> uh if you don't know what pointless is </connor>
<connor> it's kind of hard to just [ __ ] google </connor>
<connor> it </connor>
<connor> i don't know i want to explain every </connor>
<connor> single game that we talk about um </connor>
<joey> pointless the prize pools only have like </joey>
<joey> 1 000 pounds right </joey>
<joey> yeah which is really yeah which is like </joey>
<joey> to go on i think to go on you know </joey>
<joey> national tv it's like </joey>
<connor> for like what like 1 500 no 1 300 </connor>
<joey> not really a lot if that's if you win </joey>
<connor> yeah yeah nothing if you don't </connor>
<connor> at least no deal had like i think the </connor>
<garnt> prize pool the top price was like a </garnt>
<garnt> million dollars or something it's 250 </garnt>
<garnt> 250 000. </garnt>
<joey> i don't know it pounds forward oh really </joey>
<connor> okay and australia was like a million </connor>
<joey> i think that's not too far off but i </joey>
<joey> mean you never saw anyone winning the </joey>
<joey> milk the price pools in general on the </joey>
<joey> uk </joey>
<joey> quiz shows are pretty small except for </joey>
<garnt> like the big ones which are marketers </garnt>
<garnt> like the big ones </garnt>
<garnt> i think the biggest one we had was who </garnt>
<garnt> wants to be millionaire yeah that was </garnt>
<joey> the yeah </joey>
<joey> that was the whole i mean i think that </joey>
<joey> was the biggest one anywhere right i'm </joey>
<connor> pretty sure </connor>
<connor> like they're probably like the uk </connor>
<joey> version was probably like the most </joey>
<connor> expensive just like [ __ ] why </connor>
<connor> why is our currency so god damn strong </connor>
<connor> you know </connor>
<joey> a million pounds a lot of times imagine </joey>
<joey> a japanese who wants to be a millionaire </joey>
<joey> we have that it's like did you just win </joey>
<garnt> a million yen uh </garnt>
<joey> like 10 grand i think uh wait what is it </joey>
<joey> again </joey>
<joey> ashley do you remember like how much </joey>
<connor> money is it for the japanese </connor>
<joey> who wants to be a millionaire i didn't </joey>
<joey> even know japan oh yeah never mind i'm </joey>
<joey> pretty sure it's a </joey>
<garnt> million no it's 10 million yeah that </garnt>
<connor> would make sense because we spoke about </connor>
<garnt> it before i remember like to keshi's </garnt>
<garnt> castle </garnt>
<garnt> yeah like uh the japanese version i </garnt>
<connor> think it was three million yen was the </connor>
<joey> prize yeah i thought for a game show </joey>
<connor> that [ __ ] hard </connor>
<connor> thirty thousand dollars doesn't seem </connor>
<connor> like a fair reward for a show that only </connor>
<connor> like five people ever won but in most </connor>
<joey> japanese </joey>
<connor> quiz shows yeah well it is about the </connor>
<joey> money but </joey>
<joey> when it is about the money the max you </joey>
<joey> get is like 10k </joey>
<joey> and usually and usually that's split </joey>
<garnt> because like usually it's like a team </garnt>
<garnt> based </garnt>
<garnt> oh no i think so it's like you guys win </garnt>
<joey> 10k split between the five of you so </joey>
<joey> it's small and then after taxes so you </joey>
<joey> probably get </joey>
<connor> about a grand like what's your like </connor>
<connor> favorite australian or like american </connor>
<joey> i already liked family fortunes i don't </joey>
<joey> know i don't know what the american one </joey>
<joey> is but </joey>
<joey> family feuds i've seen like the american </joey>
<joey> like clips of the american one and that </joey>
<garnt> seems </garnt>
<garnt> as fun if not even better than the </garnt>
<connor> british version because like on the </connor>
<connor> american one i feel like they have like </connor>
<connor> more celebrities to choose from </connor>
<connor> exactly right exactly we only have like </connor>
<connor> a few very </connor>
<garnt> giants yeah we had like les dennis which </garnt>
<garnt> i don't even remember what he was famous </garnt>
<connor> for in the first place </connor>
<connor> because because like in america you have </connor>
<connor> like celebrities which normally are </connor>
<connor> known like the world over </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah that's just how it is but in </connor>
<connor> the uk you have like two tiers of </connor>
<connor> celebrities which are like </connor>
<connor> legit like massive celebrities known all </connor>
<connor> around the world like you know like </connor>
<connor> normally musical artists or like really </connor>
<connor> big actors and then the locals then you </connor>
<connor> have like the locally known ones which </connor>
<connor> are normally like just like </connor>
<connor> um the comedians are pretty good like </connor>
<connor> outside of that you have like someone </connor>
<connor> who's like </connor>
<connor> he said the a racist word on tv and made </connor>
<connor> a career out of it one time well </connor>
<connor> yes i mean okay i mean it's the same in </connor>
<joey> australia yeah i mean </joey>
<joey> in australia it's like you're either an </joey>
<joey> internationally known like star who's </joey>
<joey> hosting the show </joey>
<joey> or you're an australian comedian that </joey>
<connor> failed to like market themselves outside </connor>
<connor> of australia yeah yeah so he's just like </connor>
<joey> we'll give you a spot </joey>
<connor> you speak in australia we had okay we </connor>
<connor> had this one game show i think it was i </connor>
<connor> don't know if it was british first it's </connor>
<garnt> called golden balls did you ever watch </garnt>
<garnt> this </garnt>
<garnt> oh yeah i didn't watch that yeah yeah i </garnt>
<connor> know i know yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> teehee golden balls and i can't so what </connor>
<connor> would happen is that </connor>
<joey> they would get like five balls each and </joey>
<joey> they all had different amounts of money </joey>
<joey> in them right </joey>
<joey> and then they basically have to like </joey>
<connor> negotiate i think ah </connor>
<garnt> no no so you could kick off sorry so no </garnt>
<connor> no no um </connor>
<joey> like a football game no i i've seen i </joey>
<connor> haven't actually seen it but </connor>
<connor> i think we're thinking with the right </connor>
<connor> one where the last round the last round </connor>
<connor> is </connor>
<connor> it's the most it's the most interesting </connor>
<connor> one so you have a prize pool </connor>
<connor> and it's it's i think it's based on like </connor>
<connor> the prisoner's dilemma or something i'm </connor>
<connor> probably wrong on that but </connor>
<connor> so you have two people and you basically </connor>
<connor> have to </connor>
<connor> agree if you're going to share the prize </connor>
<joey> pool </joey>
<joey> um and or like okay so you have a </joey>
<joey> steal or share yeah all right you can </joey>
<joey> steal the entire prize pool or you can </joey>
<joey> share the prize pool </joey>
<joey> and if you share if if both people pick </joey>
<joey> share then you share the prize money </joey>
<joey> but if one person picks steel they get </joey>
<joey> the entire </joey>
<joey> amount of the prize oh okay but if both </joey>
<joey> people pick steal then no one gets </joey>
<connor> nobody gets surprised you saw like the </connor>
<connor> biggest pieces of [ __ ] on this show like </connor>
<connor> yeah you'd win the money but like that </connor>
<joey> really seems like a show to like expose </joey>
<connor> the world </connor>
<connor> it was brutal right because this tv show </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] loved it because they were like </connor>
<connor> bro </connor>
<connor> whatever you got to do to get this money </connor>
<connor> you ham it up so these people would do </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> massive sob stories to the person next </connor>
<connor> to you yeah right and they would believe </connor>
<connor> them </connor>
<connor> they'd be like man my kids you know they </connor>
<joey> need this thing real bad man they're </joey>
<joey> like you know they need this expensive </joey>
<joey> thing etcetera </joey>
<joey> and then and then they you know they </joey>
<joey> would do it and then they reveal like </joey>
<joey> they stole all the money yeah and </joey>
<garnt> everyone's like okay sure you won 10 </garnt>
<garnt> grand but yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and what cost what costs at what cost </garnt>
<joey> you they go through their like entire </joey>
<joey> life story to be like </joey>
<joey> i uh i'm a devout christian i've given </joey>
<garnt> to charity </garnt>
<garnt> i am the most honest person you could </garnt>
<garnt> ever meet in your life </garnt>
<joey> they literally did a dion was just like </joey>
<connor> i'm going to reject humanity </connor>
<connor> to get this money i don't remember this </connor>
<connor> one guy i think i've seen the same clip </connor>
<connor> right was it which one which one was </connor>
<connor> there </connor>
<connor> the guy who just [ __ ] hacked like </connor>
<connor> social hacks of the game where he was </connor>
<joey> just like </joey>
<connor> look mate i'm gonna pick steel yeah and </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah he's such </joey>
<connor> a such a like a five head move he </connor>
<connor> literally goes to the guy look i'm not </connor>
<connor> even gonna pretend </connor>
<connor> i'm going to pick steel okay and what </connor>
<connor> i'm going to do </connor>
<connor> is i'm going to share half the prize </connor>
<connor> money with you </connor>
<connor> once the game's over and the other guy's </connor>
<connor> was like no you you can't you can't do </connor>
<garnt> that you got </garnt>
<garnt> you got you like no we're going to pick </garnt>
<garnt> share we're going to at least agree to </garnt>
<garnt> pick shad he's like no i'm picking steel </garnt>
<garnt> and you're gonna have to trust me </garnt>
<garnt> that i'm going to share the prize money </garnt>
<garnt> after the after after the show ends and </garnt>
<garnt> like the other guy asked the host is </garnt>
<garnt> this allowed is this actually allowed </garnt>
<garnt> and the host goes </garnt>
<garnt> whatever happens after the show we can't </garnt>
<garnt> guarantee you know </garnt>
<joey> so he's like he gets shanked that's your </joey>
<garnt> issue yeah yeah so so he's like well i'm </garnt>
<garnt> gonna pick steel as well then and he's </garnt>
<garnt> like fine if you pick steel </garnt>
<garnt> we're both gonna lose the money but the </garnt>
<garnt> only chance you're gonna have to gain </garnt>
<connor> money </connor>
<connor> is by picking share right such a [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> five head moves like this </connor>
<connor> but at the end he didn't pick steel he </connor>
<connor> picked cher </connor>
<joey> so both of them got the prize money in </joey>
<joey> the end oh [ __ ] wow and i was just like </joey>
<connor> dude this this this guy this guy is the </connor>
<connor> main protagonist of the [ __ ] universe </connor>
<connor> i'll be the bad guy so that everyone can </connor>
<garnt> win like i just </garnt>
<connor> i just watched like irl code kiosk right </connor>
<joey> in front of me </joey>
<connor> this is what i saw right here i i saw </connor>
<connor> like i swear i don't know if this was </connor>
<connor> like a popular clip i remember one time </connor>
<connor> the guy like literally came into the </connor>
<joey> show </joey>
<joey> because there's four contestants at the </joey>
<joey> start i believe he was literally just </joey>
<joey> right from the start being like i'm a </joey>
<joey> steal </joey>
<joey> i'm going to steal no matter what life </joey>
<joey> and then he stole and then he didn't get </joey>
<connor> anything see the person also stole wow </connor>
<joey> so it was like the same thing </joey>
<connor> but like small brain version where he </connor>
<connor> was he was like </connor>
<connor> i'm gonna steal to everyone i was like </connor>
<connor> yeah we know i'm not giving you anything </connor>
<connor> so am i god imagine you you wait for </connor>
<connor> months right you go through all the </connor>
<connor> interviews and [ __ ] you get on the show </connor>
<connor> finally you have a chance of winning </connor>
<connor> money and some [ __ ] [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> immediately just said to everyone i'm </connor>
<connor> going to ruin the show for all of you </connor>
<connor> i don't give a [ __ ] you'd be like well </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] what am i supposed to do </connor>
<joey> that's like the that's like the what's </joey>
<connor> the [ __ ] the thing uh the the </connor>
<connor> millionaire hot seat </connor>
<connor> thing as well did you have those no we </connor>
<connor> don't have that i don't think okay </connor>
<connor> because like </connor>
<connor> i don't know if it wasn't we definitely </connor>
<connor> had it in australia though so there's </connor>
<connor> like you know there's like who wants to </connor>
<connor> be a millionaire which is just like a </connor>
<connor> one-on-one thing </connor>
<joey> there's this other version of it called </joey>
<joey> millionaire hot seat which </joey>
<joey> is basically it's one game of </joey>
<joey> millionaire but then there's like </joey>
<joey> four other people in basically like </joey>
<joey> sitting on the benches </joey>
<joey> waiting for the person to [ __ ] up and if </joey>
<joey> one person gets the answer wrong </joey>
<connor> then it goes to the next person from </connor>
<connor> where they started that's pretty cool </connor>
<connor> and so </connor>
<connor> i remember i saw this clip which is like </connor>
<connor> you start off with five people </connor>
<connor> right and uh they got to i don't know i </connor>
<connor> was like the 2000 you know not even </connor>
<connor> halfway up kind of thing </connor>
<connor> and i guess it was like a really hard </connor>
<connor> question so </connor>
<joey> the first guy gets a wrong and he's like </joey>
<joey> oh [ __ ] all right whatever see you later </joey>
<joey> next person comes along fully confident </joey>
<joey> being like well he basically just got </joey>
<joey> rid of one of the answers for me </joey>
<joey> i got this and not only does he get it </joey>
<joey> wrong but then </joey>
<joey> the next person during 50 50 he also </joey>
<joey> gets it wrong </joey>
<joey> so the fourth person comes up is like </joey>
<joey> so there's only one answer remaining um </joey>
<joey> i think it's this one </joey>
<joey> it's like you're correct but like </joey>
<garnt> imagine waiting </garnt>
<garnt> sitting on the benches all that time to </garnt>
<garnt> just come up and be like </garnt>
<garnt> thank you for giving me this money thank </garnt>
<joey> you for the free money thank you for the </joey>
<joey> free money </joey>
<joey> jkc yeah i'm trying to remember what </joey>
<garnt> else was that the weakest link </garnt>
<garnt> german the weakest link yeah like what's </garnt>
<garnt> his name uh was it phil or dan which one </garnt>
<connor> of them was on the weakest link </connor>
<garnt> oh were they yeah one of them yeah one </garnt>
<connor> of them was on the weakest link </connor>
<connor> what's the weakest link oh it's just </connor>
<joey> it's just not going anywhere is it i </joey>
<joey> don't think so it was this really </joey>
<joey> popular daytime british tv show where we </joey>
<joey> had this like really like she was famous </joey>
<garnt> for being like [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> basically okay because that was her </garnt>
<garnt> whole character was that she was there i </garnt>
<garnt> remember her name </garnt>
<garnt> um and she was just a quiz show and </garnt>
<garnt> basically like it would just keep going </garnt>
<garnt> and </garnt>
<garnt> asking questions and you basically like </garnt>
<garnt> at the end of the question the round </garnt>
<joey> they'd ask eight people you have to vote </joey>
<joey> someone off and it was normally the </joey>
<joey> person who was letting the team down </joey>
<joey> because </joey>
<joey> if you got a question wrong you like </joey>
<joey> ruined the streak and it's like a video </joey>
<joey> game where more bonus </joey>
<joey> more streaks so if someone gets a </joey>
<connor> question wrong </connor>
<connor> they ruin it and you get less money yeah </connor>
<connor> and you if you </connor>
<connor> so like as it's going around so if i get </connor>
<connor> one right i get 100 points then you get </connor>
<joey> 200 then 400. </joey>
<joey> and someone has to like say bank so that </joey>
<joey> the points get saved </joey>
<joey> so the stream can keep going until </joey>
<joey> someone saves it so if you're the one </joey>
<garnt> who's like i'm gonna get the </garnt>
<garnt> the big boy question and then you [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> it up and lose the money that everyone </garnt>
<connor> just earned </connor>
<garnt> yeah you're probably gonna get voted off </garnt>
<garnt> right right but then like there was a </garnt>
<garnt> meta game behind it as well because if </garnt>
<garnt> you are too good </garnt>
<connor> then people then then people would just </connor>
<connor> like gang up in you and vote you off </connor>
<connor> because </connor>
<connor> they would have won the best chance of </connor>
<connor> winning right right you were on the game </connor>
<garnt> show right </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and then there was a that's </garnt>
<garnt> probably and i think i can't wish one it </garnt>
<joey> was dan or phil one of them was on it </joey>
<joey> before they became a youtuber oh wow </joey>
<joey> yeah it's really good you should watch </joey>
<joey> it </joey>
<joey> they're like uh the hosts are just like </joey>
<joey> roasting them that sounds fun it's just </joey>
<joey> pretty it's really endearing watching </joey>
<connor> someone before they were a youtuber like </connor>
<connor> do it like </connor>
<joey> i don't know it's really fun i've always </joey>
<joey> wanted to be on like trivia shows like </joey>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah i mean i think i'd like to go on a </connor>
<connor> show that has like literally that is </connor>
<joey> just like hey </joey>
<joey> this is just a game show just go up and </joey>
<joey> do it like yeah yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<connor> no no no no no no no no hey play this </connor>
<connor> character no just let me just [ __ ] go </connor>
<garnt> on </garnt>
<garnt> myself like is there like uh what's </garnt>
<garnt> really how a game show is still going on </garnt>
<connor> yeah they are i think like it's like i'd </connor>
<garnt> like to think that most game shows are </garnt>
<garnt> the complete opposite of like the talent </garnt>
<garnt> shows </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah because the talent shows are </garnt>
<connor> just heavily scripted </connor>
<connor> narratives yeah yeah yeah yeah all this </connor>
<joey> stuff i think we just don't know because </joey>
<garnt> we don't watch tv </garnt>
<garnt> yeah we i just stopped watching tv so i </garnt>
<joey> actually have no [ __ ] idea </joey>
<connor> anymore yeah yeah me too there was this </connor>
<joey> youtuber now who's uploading </joey>
<joey> um he entered uh an american talent show </joey>
<joey> that i'd never heard of </joey>
<joey> um i think he's called reckless ben on </joey>
<joey> youtube and he's like </joey>
<connor> he he basically signed up for this thing </connor>
<connor> and then wore secret glasses </connor>
<connor> while he's on it so now he's uploading </connor>
<connor> videos of him </connor>
<joey> behind the scenes and his narration is </joey>
<joey> really [ __ ] funny </joey>
<joey> and uh yeah now they're just like </joey>
<connor> threatening him to </connor>
<connor> take the video yeah of course yeah and </connor>
<garnt> he's uploading videos be like i'm not </garnt>
<garnt> gonna take it down </garnt>
<garnt> this is the next video i'm taking it </garnt>
<garnt> down </garnt>
<joey> it's right it's really interesting it's </joey>
<joey> just really living up to his name yeah </joey>
<joey> cause he's just like </joey>
<connor> he's in it and he's just narrating </connor>
<connor> really stupid and he's just like a </connor>
<connor> complete clown in like </connor>
<connor> the best way possible yeah yeah it's </connor>
<connor> really interesting you should watch </connor>
<connor> these youtube videos i didn't sell it </connor>
<joey> very well i feel like </joey>
<joey> i still want to explain too much you </joey>
<joey> should go watch them it's pretty really </joey>
<joey> really </joey>
<joey> underrated yeah no one's watching these </joey>
<connor> videos they have like 80k 100k </connor>
<garnt> which is that's that's still decent </garnt>
<connor> amounts well like as crazy as this </connor>
<garnt> a lot bigger but i know it's is it like </garnt>
<garnt> even a big kind of </garnt>
<garnt> exposure that hey this is kind of faked </garnt>
<connor> and no but it's just </connor>
<connor> all scripted it's really fun just seeing </connor>
<connor> like a producer go up to him and be like </connor>
<connor> no not now oh hey this is your </connor>
<connor> like oh like you know like when the </connor>
<connor> crowd's cheering yeah yeah like he shows </connor>
<connor> like the video footage of like what's </connor>
<connor> the show see that he cuts to what </connor>
<connor> what's happening to him and it's just </connor>
<connor> him in the middle of a giant stage and </connor>
<connor> there's nothing </connor>
<connor> like no noise or anything </connor>
<joey> i think there's a big difference between </joey>
<joey> just like hearing and knowing that it's </joey>
<joey> rigged versus actually </joey>
<connor> seeing that you know like all those </connor>
<connor> talent shows as well have like on </connor>
<connor> on-site therapists because of like how </connor>
<connor> like brutal the schedule it's like some </connor>
<connor> of them uh in like </connor>
<connor> america's got talent had to like sit </connor>
<connor> around for like 19 hours </connor>
<garnt> to like wait to practice [ __ ] jesus </garnt>
<garnt> so they had on-site therapists </garnt>
<garnt> and they would like there was like cases </garnt>
<connor> where they're injecting them with like </connor>
<connor> vitamins and stuff to keep them awake </connor>
<connor> during these shows what the [ __ ] yeah </connor>
<connor> and then obviously you know these </connor>
<joey> contracts you sign which have come out </joey>
<joey> before for like x factor in the uk </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah it's kind of horrible yeah and </joey>
<connor> my god like some of them i swear it was </connor>
<connor> x factor uk where </connor>
<joey> you literally sign away your rights to </joey>
<joey> anything you've ever done online </joey>
<joey> yeah and any right anything you do in </joey>
<joey> future yeah like if you became a </joey>
<garnt> youtuber they own it </garnt>
<garnt> like you can't do without their </garnt>
<joey> permission yeah it's [ __ ] </joey>
<garnt> it's not i get why they do because they </garnt>
<garnt> want to cover their ass but they go </garnt>
<connor> like so beyond where it's like this is </connor>
<connor> kind of like this is going to have just </connor>
<garnt> agreed exploitative but like people want </garnt>
<garnt> their five minutes of fame right that's </garnt>
<connor> right and it's like what are you gonna </connor>
<connor> do get five minutes of fame yourself no </connor>
<joey> i don't think you don't think so </joey>
<joey> what do you do build a career good one </joey>
<joey> good one </joey>
<joey> not without my help not without simon </joey>
<connor> cowell [ __ ] breathing down your </connor>
<connor> throat i don't think so </connor>
<garnt> jesus christ i'll tell you what uh </garnt>
<joey> sydney's been watching recently she's </joey>
<joey> been like she's gone off the true crime </joey>
<joey> for a bit and she's just </joey>
<joey> yeah she's now turned over to uh trash </joey>
<garnt> tv uh reality trash tv </garnt>
<connor> she's been watching 90 day fiance bro i </connor>
<connor> could just feel the script </connor>
<joey> when i'm watching that show like you can </joey>
<connor> tell like the producers have made them </connor>
<connor> do like two </connor>
<joey> three takes [ __ ] it's awful i can't </joey>
<joey> stand it i watched like one whole season </joey>
<connor> of it and it was just like </connor>
<joey> they just repeat you watching one whole </joey>
<connor> season i watched the whole i'm impressed </connor>
<joey> yeah i don't know i really don't know i </joey>
<connor> didn't enjoy half of it either i was </connor>
<connor> watching it and it's just like </connor>
<connor> they go in [ __ ] circles they'll be </connor>
<connor> like that so they'll meet up and they'll </connor>
<joey> be like </joey>
<joey> yeah it's kind of weird but we just love </joey>
<joey> each other and then there'll just be </joey>
<garnt> like red flags right from the start </garnt>
<joey> yeah like yeah he asked me to paypal i'm </joey>
<garnt> like 10 grand you know he doesn't want </garnt>
<connor> to have kids i want to have kids </connor>
<connor> but you know i think love has a way and </connor>
<joey> it's like atheists like love </joey>
<garnt> drama right yeah [ __ ] genius because </garnt>
<joey> i i feel like watching 90 day fiance </joey>
<connor> right </connor>
<connor> i lose brain cells watching this at </connor>
<connor> least </connor>
<connor> like i imagine what if it aired like on </connor>
<garnt> twitch or something </garnt>
<garnt> i think it would be a [ __ ] excellent </garnt>
<garnt> experience if something like that aired </garnt>
<joey> on twitch </joey>
<connor> huh like unscripted no i mean just like </connor>
<joey> watching with like the twitch chat </joey>
<garnt> you see all the reactions that's like </garnt>
<connor> part of the fun fun thing the worst part </connor>
<connor> about watching it </connor>
<joey> like in seasons was like yeah without </joey>
<joey> the youtube comments </joey>
<connor> 90 day fiance is like 14 less enjoyable </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> the best comments was like making sure </connor>
<connor> that everyone agrees with you </connor>
<garnt> who's the bigger [ __ ] yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> exactly it's it's like </garnt>
<joey> literally like the a real life version </joey>
<joey> of ah am i the [ __ ] you know it's </joey>
<joey> you know you you go that see the spicy </joey>
<garnt> drama but watching it by yourself </garnt>
<garnt> i feel is just you lose half of the </garnt>
<joey> enjoyment out of it how did you sit </joey>
<joey> through like a normal episode of that </joey>
<joey> oh it was hard because like i watched </joey>
<connor> because obviously like like every </connor>
<connor> anybody i got </connor>
<connor> into through the [ __ ] ed and rose </connor>
<connor> clips right that went around </connor>
<connor> me too so i was just like oh you know if </connor>
<connor> the clips are this good then i'm pretty </connor>
<joey> sure the entire episode is good </joey>
<connor> it's hot well just like it's such a drag </connor>
<connor> it is it is one of those tv shows where </connor>
<connor> like the clip is the best way to watch </connor>
<connor> it yeah yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> watching this was like brutal like none </connor>
<connor> of these couples are like good people </connor>
<connor> they're all just like the worst people </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<connor> doing the shittiest things to each other </connor>
<connor> and then being surprised when none of it </connor>
<connor> works </connor>
<garnt> and it's like it is it is horrible i </garnt>
<garnt> mean i mean like it's it's trash tv but </garnt>
<garnt> i mean you know why you're watching it </garnt>
<garnt> right </garnt>
<garnt> no one's watching it to be like maybe </garnt>
<garnt> this situation will work out </garnt>
<garnt> and this girl's like you know this this </garnt>
<garnt> guy who's on his 10th marriage you know </garnt>
<connor> and i've only known for three months i </connor>
<connor> don't know if he really loves me </connor>
<connor> it is literally it is like </connor>
<joey> someone has made like a playbook of like </joey>
<joey> the worst setups to relationships </joey>
<joey> like there's always like someone who </joey>
<joey> can't speak the other person's language </joey>
<connor> so they just can't communicate most of </connor>
<joey> the times and it's like it's like </joey>
<connor> what the [ __ ] are you doing </connor>
<garnt> he's just loading up an episode right </garnt>
<garnt> now apparently so what are they talking </garnt>
<connor> about there's like </connor>
<connor> there was like one where it was like the </connor>
<connor> girl's like 18 and the guy's 46 and has </connor>
<connor> two kids and i'm like that just sounds </connor>
<connor> like a bad idea </connor>
<joey> yeah it was like yeah it was like that </joey>
<joey> on someone else yeah it was like um </joey>
<joey> was the other one there was like these </joey>
<joey> this was one of them i think it was like </joey>
<joey> oh he was like a south african guy </joey>
<joey> and the other one was like an american </joey>
<joey> like uh she was like super activist </joey>
<joey> and stuff and like he was just kind of </joey>
<connor> like the most laid-back man on earth was </connor>
<connor> like yeah yeah wherever wherever </connor>
<connor> and she was just like i need you to know </connor>
<connor> that i care about these things and she </connor>
<connor> was psychotic </connor>
<connor> and like watching her like behave around </connor>
<connor> this guy was like awful </connor>
<connor> and i was just like this is terrible </connor>
<connor> this is awful why is he doing this how </connor>
<connor> much is he getting paid </connor>
<connor> yeah that's what i'm wondering it's like </connor>
<connor> plc like i need to know no no no no no </connor>
<connor> no no no no no no no no no no no no no </connor>
<connor> no no no no no no no no no it's tlc so </connor>
<connor> they're definitely paying attention </connor>
<connor> are you sure they're getting paid </connor>
<connor> they're getting paid pennies like </connor>
<connor> because </connor>
<connor> i feel like i hope they're getting paid </connor>
<joey> because if they're not getting paid i </joey>
<connor> don't know why they're putting up with </connor>
<joey> half of this [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> yeah it is i'm pretty sure tlc pays all </joey>
<connor> of the people that they have </connor>
<connor> sure but yeah but like i use the word </connor>
<joey> paid very loosely like they're probably </joey>
<joey> getting paid scraps for that [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> yeah it's just like it's like i'm </connor>
<connor> watching this and i'm like how much </connor>
<connor> would you have to pay me </connor>
<joey> because you know that uh you know the </joey>
<connor> rose the the filipino </connor>
<connor> girl she's like a youtuber now yeah i </connor>
<connor> saw sure </connor>
<connor> so it's just like you probably got paid </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] all but </connor>
<joey> hey you got a youtube career now i guess </joey>
<connor> i don't know you haven't followed </connor>
<connor> the rap situation where if the other </connor>
<joey> side is just so </joey>
<garnt> goddamn awful it makes you look amazing </garnt>
<garnt> yeah yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and i did her solid it's it's it's </garnt>
<garnt> always weird for me watching american </garnt>
<garnt> reality tv show versus </garnt>
<garnt> british reality tv show because i feel </garnt>
<garnt> like british reality tv show is like </garnt>
<garnt> so much more toned down than americans </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> i think i think when i think of british </garnt>
<garnt> reality tv shows </garnt>
<garnt> the peak that comes to me is something </garnt>
<garnt> like come dine with me that's </garnt>
<connor> pretty good or like uh what's the other </connor>
<connor> one that that [ __ ] guy does where you </connor>
<connor> just come up to him at a table and he's </connor>
<connor> buy [ __ ] off you for like a hundred quid </connor>
<garnt> was the antique hunters or something oh </garnt>
<garnt> antiques roadshow </garnt>
<connor> anti-road show is that is that it oh i </connor>
<garnt> like that i like that </garnt>
<joey> i've been on the air for like i don't </joey>
<joey> know how long and it's just fun to watch </joey>
<joey> people to bring in some things i'll give </joey>
<joey> you [ __ ] 20 quid for it yeah it's </joey>
<joey> like the [ __ ] you know like porn </joey>
<connor> stars right but like legitimately </connor>
<connor> more legit than that yeah yeah come down </connor>
<connor> with me it's probably </connor>
<connor> probably the best british reality show i </connor>
<garnt> think i enjoy it </garnt>
<garnt> one of my favorite trash reality tv </garnt>
<garnt> shows i can't remember the name </garnt>
<garnt> but the concept is they take this couple </garnt>
<joey> who you know doesn't have a lot of money </joey>
<joey> but </joey>
<joey> are wanting but want to get married oh </joey>
<joey> my god i want to get married it's </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> lovely yeah not cheap as weddings that's </joey>
<joey> the australian is that </joey>
<joey> is that the australian australian voters </joey>
<joey> and they get like they give them 10k </joey>
<joey> to sort out this wedding right now oh </joey>
<joey> it's uh uh and like </joey>
<garnt> the bride has no control she she doesn't </garnt>
<garnt> know anything and it's all up to the guy </garnt>
<connor> lucky's obsessed with that show it was a </connor>
<connor> bbc three show yeah yeah yeah and uh who </connor>
<joey> called the bride or something like </joey>
<joey> something like something like that who </joey>
<joey> wants the bride who wants to write </joey>
<garnt> something like that </garnt>
<garnt> but it's such a it was such a good </garnt>
<garnt> concept in my opinion because like 10k i </garnt>
<connor> feel like is </connor>
<connor> just the right amount of money to be </connor>
<connor> able to make a wedding happen but </connor>
<connor> not enough to make everything you want </connor>
<connor> out of a wedding happened </connor>
<connor> that's pretty genius yeah it's it's </connor>
<garnt> ingenious and like making the guy do it </garnt>
<connor> as well </connor>
<connor> yeah i mean you don't need producers </connor>
<connor> right you just sit there and follow the </connor>
<connor> guy </connor>
<connor> if he does nothing that's fantastic </connor>
<joey> content yeah he's like and </joey>
<joey> they must be fully aware of it too </joey>
<joey> because they always shoot they always </joey>
<connor> choose to use the 10k in the </connor>
<connor> worst [ __ ] we should have done that </connor>
<connor> with god's wedding yes </connor>
<joey> because the guys in the show right the </joey>
<joey> first thing they do it's like call up </joey>
<joey> the crew </joey>
<joey> yeah and they call it like their boy </joey>
<joey> they call up their boys and they're like </joey>
<joey> and then like the main guy will be </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] clueless </joey>
<joey> that one friend is like i really don't </joey>
<joey> think you should you know hire </joey>
<connor> inflatable dinosaurs for your wedding </connor>
<connor> that seems like a bad idea </connor>
<connor> like no no i got this that's why you're </connor>
<connor> waiting there's always like there's </connor>
<connor> always that there's either the guy who </connor>
<connor> like there was never a guy who got it </connor>
<connor> like 100 right because yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> there was a guy who was like pretty </connor>
<connor> close and then like did a modest attempt </connor>
<connor> and there was just the other type of guy </connor>
<connor> that was like </connor>
<connor> i'm gonna do [ __ ] star wars themed </connor>
<joey> wedding </joey>
<joey> my favorite one is the one where like </joey>
<connor> the the the groom like </connor>
<connor> decides to get married in like a pig </connor>
<connor> barn oh yes yeah i've seen this one like </connor>
<connor> they go to like a </connor>
<garnt> the dead is gonna like a farm with like </garnt>
<connor> a [ __ ] muddiest </connor>
<garnt> i i think it's like but you love pigs </garnt>
<garnt> i think i saw one where the guy like </garnt>
<connor> hosted the wedding in a cave </connor>
<connor> like a proper an actress okay yes you're </connor>
<connor> not caving </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah i mean that's that's badass </joey>
<joey> but then like not in the nutty buddy </joey>
<connor> like he knew that the bride's mum was </connor>
<connor> claustrophobic </connor>
<joey> so the bride's not match he couldn't </joey>
<joey> attend like the wedding ceremony because </joey>
<joey> he was like standing outside the cave </joey>
<joey> that's [ __ ] big brain that's so big </joey>
<connor> brain </connor>
<connor> yeah so uh my in-laws hate boats so i </connor>
<garnt> decided let's get on the cruise </garnt>
<garnt> i mean as someone who's like planning a </garnt>
<garnt> wedding now it's it's it's great for me </garnt>
<garnt> because i'm just like </garnt>
<connor> i i see the stress that people that </connor>
<connor> people can make a survey to like </connor>
<joey> sydney's family so what are your fears </joey>
<connor> what are you afraid of like zooms like </connor>
<connor> what </connor>
<connor> it's like my favorite moment is always </connor>
<connor> when they try to pick the dress </connor>
<connor> it's like it's not even like a little </connor>
<garnt> bit wrong it's always the complete </garnt>
<garnt> opposite of what the bride picks </garnt>
<connor> it's literally like m123 and have a </connor>
<garnt> breakdown have a mental breakdown right </garnt>
<garnt> now start crying start telling </garnt>
<connor> the wedding's over that's literally how </connor>
<garnt> it looks this episode is sponsored by </garnt>
<garnt> expressvpn guys we talk about [ __ ] a </garnt>
<joey> lot on this podcast right </joey>
<connor> we do this we do we yes now don't you </connor>
<joey> want to [ __ ] with the privacy of the </joey>
<joey> bathroom door locked of course i do well </joey>
<joey> using the internet without expressvpn </joey>
<garnt> it's like going to the bathroom and not </garnt>
<garnt> closing the door so why would we want to </garnt>
<joey> do that that just sounds </joey>
<joey> barbaric and i will not stand for it i'm </joey>
<connor> being told that internet service </connor>
<connor> providers like comcast or verizon know </connor>
<connor> every single website you visit that's </connor>
<joey> really interesting information because </joey>
<joey> i've also heard that isps can sell this </joey>
<joey> information to ad companies and tech </joey>
<joey> giants who then use your data to target </joey>
<garnt> you expressvpn creates a secure </garnt>
<garnt> encrypted tunnel between your device </garnt>
<garnt> and the internet so your online activity </garnt>

<connor> i would you know even if i got </connor>
<joey> like paid on top of doing the wedding </joey>
<joey> because i'm assuming the </joey>
<joey> the like kind of the reason why people </joey>
<joey> apply for that show is you get a free </joey>
<joey> wedding right yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> but like man organizing a wedding seems </joey>
<connor> like one of the </connor>
<joey> the easiest things to get wrong </joey>
<connor> like just i thought about this yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> i thought about this and i was like god </connor>
<connor> damn just the like </connor>
<connor> because you know like all right you have </connor>
<connor> friends right but like not every friend </connor>
<connor> you want to come to your wedding right </connor>
<connor> so that must be so [ __ ] awkward </connor>
<connor> deciding like </connor>
<connor> you're you're a good enough friend but </connor>
<connor> like i don't know if </connor>
<connor> you're like good enough for the wedding </connor>
<joey> i can barely organize a boys night out </joey>
<joey> let alone </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] also like you have like how many </joey>
<connor> friends do you have right and like where </connor>
<connor> do you draw the line who's close enough </connor>
<connor> how do you decide </connor>
<connor> is it like a mutual thing you're like no </connor>
<garnt> i don't like ted like what winning </garnt>
<garnt> politics is like definitely i think </garnt>
<connor> it's so difficult my my cousin went </connor>
<connor> through it as well and it's just </connor>
<joey> it's ah there's there's a lot that goes </joey>
<joey> into a wedding that </joey>
<joey> i like i i have no interest i didn't </joey>
<joey> obviously it's </joey>
<joey> it's like trying to plan a wedding </joey>
<connor> yourself is hard enough trying to plan a </connor>
<connor> wedding </connor>
<joey> internet like when you're not in the </joey>
<joey> country yeah and also during like covert </joey>
<connor> here </connor>
<connor> [Music] </connor>
<connor> this this is this is like not even like </connor>
<connor> hard mode this is like dark souls no </connor>
<garnt> no like there's so many things that </garnt>
<garnt> can like that can [ __ ] up as well i love </garnt>
<joey> how i love that nowadays whenever </joey>
<garnt> anything is like extremely hard the </garnt>
<garnt> first thing you think of </garnt>
<joey> dark souls no hit nothing's harder than </joey>
<garnt> that </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i mean it's stressful but it's it's </garnt>
<garnt> rewarding </garnt>
<garnt> yeah it must be i think i mean is it </garnt>
<joey> going on i mean it's rewarding </joey>
<connor> yes yes it's rewarding until like </connor>
<joey> it will be rewarding once it actually </joey>
<garnt> finishes right yeah and everything goes </garnt>
<garnt> smooth i mean i mean like the planning </garnt>
<garnt> parts some of it's better than the </garnt>
<garnt> others like i remember like my favorite </garnt>
<joey> moment so far has been </joey>
<joey> actually going to the venue and just </joey>
<joey> being like yeah this is the place this </joey>
<joey> is the place that's an amazing feeling </joey>
<joey> everything up to that like searching </joey>
<joey> through about 50 catalogues of possible </joey>
<joey> places and driving to about 10 different </joey>
<garnt> places </garnt>
<garnt> places and being like uh do i want to </garnt>
<garnt> settle on this </garnt>
<garnt> i don't know can i see myself getting </garnt>
<garnt> married in a barn or a cave </garnt>
<connor> or whatever in japan it's like crazy how </connor>
<garnt> like [ __ ] seriously they take this </garnt>
<garnt> oh yeah oh it's it's eve it's like in </garnt>
<garnt> asia </garnt>
<garnt> they're like we think there's like </garnt>
<joey> wedding politics in western weddings no </joey>
<joey> in asia it's a [ __ ] statement </joey>
<garnt> yeah right and i hate that i i </garnt>
<joey> absolutely hate that because there's </joey>
<joey> so many unspoken rules that are changing </joey>
<connor> the amount that they must spend on </connor>
<joey> weddings here </joey>
<joey> oh it's nice yeah it's insane if you go </joey>
<joey> to like any like fancy hotel </joey>
<joey> in japan like you just cause you know if </joey>
<connor> you go there for like a lunch or </connor>
<connor> something you'll see that like the </connor>
<connor> wedding planning rooms are like </connor>
<connor> full with people yeah and like those </connor>
<connor> prices don't seem cheap </connor>
<connor> they seem real expensive like 50k on a </connor>
<connor> wedding i'm like what </connor>
<connor> yeah i went i went to one of my friend's </connor>
<joey> weddings from university and </joey>
<joey> he did it in japan in tokyo and the </joey>
<connor> inside of this venue looked like a </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] mini disneyland </connor>
<connor> like it was there was like a castle and </connor>
<connor> like a [ __ ] fountain and this like </connor>
<connor> massive </connor>
<joey> completely white church i'm like how </joey>
<connor> much money did you just yeah </connor>
<connor> like what amount of money is too much to </connor>
<joey> spend on a wedding i get that it's a </joey>
<joey> special day but there has to be a limit </joey>
<connor> well like a special day is like </connor>
<joey> ridiculous </joey>
<joey> there was like 300 people at this </joey>
<garnt> wedding yeah because like nobody knows </garnt>
<connor> 300 people </connor>
<connor> sorry i don't even know if i have to </connor>
<garnt> even have that many friends on facebook </garnt>
<connor> let alone i don't know </connor>
<connor> do you like families asking like hey can </connor>
<connor> my like family friend of a friend </connor>
<connor> come did you get like that because i </connor>
<connor> feel like i'd be like no i don't [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> know them no </joey>
<joey> in japan it's like the wedding politics </joey>
<joey> extends to like </joey>
<garnt> you have to work to invite people yeah </garnt>
<joey> yeah because because it's all about the </joey>
<garnt> face right so </garnt>
<garnt> like in in thailand you have to invite </garnt>
<garnt> your family your family friends your </garnt>
<garnt> work colleagues like basically everyone </garnt>
<connor> i mean close colleagues yeah </connor>
<connor> you know yeah they've got actual message </connor>
<connor> inviting my boss </connor>
<connor> yeah and another thing about thai </connor>
<connor> weddings </connor>
<connor> shut up bailey which is why like me and </connor>
<joey> cindy decided to have our wedding in the </joey>
<joey> uk so we didn't have to worry about you </joey>
<joey> know that that side </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] yeah but like it it's a </joey>
<joey> customary entire wedding </joey>
<joey> as well that the groom has to give money </joey>
<connor> you have to have to give like a certain </connor>
<connor> amount of money </connor>
<garnt> to the bride's like family </garnt>
<garnt> like bother to accept or something um </garnt>
<garnt> what era are we in you buying her is </garnt>
<garnt> that like an extra stab i don't know i </garnt>
<garnt> mean </garnt>
<garnt> how much is your daughter yeah i give </garnt>
<garnt> you two goats oh it's like an ocean </garnt>
<joey> like what is this i mean that's like </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] russian like mother right he's </joey>
<joey> like i give you two goats </joey>
<connor> this feels like this feels like an extra </connor>
<connor> step to like auction you know </connor>
<garnt> yeah i mean it's something that i don't </garnt>
<garnt> agree with and i've seen like some of my </garnt>
<garnt> family members doing i'm just like </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i don't know i don't care i kind of </garnt>
<garnt> don't agree with this is that where it </garnt>
<garnt> comes from like where does that come </garnt>
<connor> from that </connor>
<garnt> honestly i have no idea does it come </garnt>
<connor> from something more sinister like what </connor>
<garnt> you've been doing </garnt>
<connor> i mean i'm not i'm not sure how the </connor>
<connor> custom started because </connor>
<connor> you know like it's it's something that </connor>
<connor> i've attended thai weddings and i've </connor>
<garnt> seen happen </garnt>
<garnt> um i've i've never kind of asked where </garnt>
<garnt> where where this where this came from i </garnt>
<garnt> just kind of was just like </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i don't think i want to do that so </garnt>
<connor> you guys just kind of died did you buy </connor>
<connor> mom </connor>
<garnt> i mean like she pressed i did it </garnt>
<joey> i mean it's my bargain </joey>
<connor> the same customary where it's like the </connor>
<connor> bride's dad is expected to play for the </connor>
<connor> wedding </connor>
<joey> and i'm just like no that shouldn't be </joey>
<joey> the case either yeah right </joey>
<connor> like it's it's it's to me a wedding </connor>
<garnt> there's </garnt>
<garnt> there's so many customaries to weddings </garnt>
<garnt> that revolve around money that i just </garnt>
<connor> don't understand i guess because like </connor>
<connor> maybe </connor>
<connor> i mean that was common that's pretty </connor>
<joey> common in the west still right that the </joey>
<joey> uh the other person the </joey>
<joey> bridegroom the bride's parents will pay </joey>
<joey> but i mean it's understandable when </joey>
<joey> marriage used to be way younger like 21. </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah </joey>
<connor> i get it then because you don't have any </connor>
<connor> money but now people getting married at </connor>
<connor> what like </connor>
<joey> 27 30 30 so it's like you know i mean </joey>
<connor> you probably should have your own money </connor>
<connor> by then you know like yeah should be </connor>
<joey> planning a wedding </joey>
<joey> you're unemployed at 30. maybe </joey>
<connor> you're just dissing yourself yeah i mean </connor>
<garnt> just saying </garnt>
<joey> i'm just sorry for that guy who just </joey>
<connor> like you know had like five children and </connor>
<garnt> all of them ended up being daughters and </garnt>
<garnt> he's like come on come on son son </garnt>
<connor> son oh my god it's like the uh like </connor>
<connor> aging population like pyramid thing </connor>
<connor> right </connor>
<connor> it won't bite you now it'll bite you </connor>
<connor> later </connor>
<joey> yeah because isn't it like i remember i </joey>
<joey> saw like this i don't remember it was a </joey>
<joey> vice documentary or some kind of </joey>
<joey> documentary on youtube where like </joey>
<joey> i forgot which country it was somewhere </joey>
<joey> in the middle east where like they still </joey>
<joey> have the tradition of like </joey>
<joey> wife napping where it's like they they </joey>
<joey> did </joey>
<joey> i forgot which country it was but i </joey>
<joey> remember i saw this documentary </joey>
<garnt> and there's this tradition quote-unquote </garnt>
<joey> tradition </joey>
<garnt> where guys if they find a girl </garnt>
<joey> that they find attractive and they see </joey>
<joey> as wife material </joey>
<joey> some of them will actually like dead-ass </joey>
<joey> kidnap them </joey>
<joey> like in broad daylight take them back to </joey>
<joey> their parents place </joey>
<joey> and the girl is then forced to get </joey>
<joey> married to this guy </joey>
<garnt> what is this like [ __ ] real life </garnt>
<connor> pokemon sounds like runescape this </connor>
<joey> sounds like runescape </joey>
<joey> and like and like traditionally the girl </joey>
<joey> can't decline it </joey>
<joey> really yeah so like that she has to get </joey>
<joey> married in and and there's always </joey>
<joey> and this documentary i saw is like it's </joey>
<joey> so [ __ ] disturbing because there's </joey>
<joey> these girls who are literally just </joey>
<joey> breaking down while they get the veil </joey>
<joey> put on top of them and [ __ ] and it's </joey>
<joey> just </joey>
<joey> it's [ __ ] oh i i i wish i could </joey>
<joey> remember the </joey>
<connor> the name of the documentary as i was </connor>
<connor> like there was this thing i don't </connor>
<joey> remember though </joey>
<joey> just look it up if you look up like wife </joey>
<joey> napping i think it's called trash chase </joey>
<connor> podcast early onset outside </connor>
<connor> which is [ __ ] forgetting we forget </connor>
<connor> everything here we can't remember </connor>
<connor> anything we're [ __ ] useless </connor>
<connor> this thing i saw on the internet i </connor>
<joey> vaguely remember that but there's one </joey>
<connor> detail i remember that i want to talk </connor>
<garnt> about now and just share to the world </garnt>
<joey> one episode we were talking about like </joey>
<joey> uh how </joey>
<joey> how very rarely like anime uses english </joey>
<joey> like songs in their openings and endings </joey>
<joey> and we're bringing up all these titles </joey>
<joey> and we're like i'm sure there's other </joey>
<joey> ones we don't know all the titles are </joey>
<joey> like </joey>

<joey> i mean that makes sense that makes sense </joey>
<connor> but it </connor>
<garnt> feels wrong like if that happened in </garnt>
<joey> another country </joey>
<garnt> or i would be like yeah that's [ __ ] up </garnt>
<joey> that's not right yeah yeah but i mean </joey>
<joey> you know like at least they're nice </joey>
<joey> about it though right yeah i just don't </joey>
<joey> like that they asked like my id </joey>
<joey> like i don't know someone about that </joey>
<joey> feels weird i guess they check my </joey>
<joey> colleagues </joey>
<garnt> there's never a way where a policeman </garnt>
<connor> asks for your id and you don't at least </connor>
<connor> sweat a little </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah right like i'm like the </connor>
<garnt> audible like swallow like this is </garnt>
<connor> literally like </connor>
<connor> white guy gets like discriminated first </connor>
<connor> time in his life </connor>
<connor> pov like this is like the story right </connor>
<joey> so this is what it feels like to be a </joey>
<connor> minority [ __ ] oh god fish is [ __ ] up </connor>
<connor> i'm kidding i know it's [ __ ] bad yeah </connor>
<connor> but like yeah i mean it's happened a few </connor>
<connor> times but it's because it's happened at </connor>
<connor> like 10 p.m i was like </connor>
<connor> you know for some reason when it happens </connor>
<connor> at night it feels like way more like </connor>
<connor> whoa </connor>
<connor> and i'm like why are you stopping anyone </connor>
<connor> else i'm the only i'm the only </connor>
<joey> non-japanese you shouldn't have told </joey>
<connor> this story on trash days you could have </connor>
<connor> easily made up </connor>
<joey> i got my first racist experience in </joey>
<connor> japan </connor>
<connor> my video i'll do it i'll do it on a live </connor>
<joey> stream so the clip can come out before </joey>
<joey> this part </joey>
<joey> yeah good idea gonna get the actual </joey>
<joey> brain yeah yeah i just like i just </joey>
<joey> i started cracking up so much when he </joey>
<connor> asked me when i played apex i was like </connor>
<connor> oh my god oh my god i was like you can't </connor>
<connor> make this [ __ ] up like </connor>
<connor> i knew when i was going to tell the </connor>
<connor> story you're going to be like that's </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] no it actually i wish i [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> this is like this </garnt>
<connor> i was like this is too unreal that he </connor>
<connor> just literally just asked me if i play </connor>
<connor> apex </connor>
<connor> but i literally like don't shout about </connor>
<connor> it it's like everyone but it's really </connor>
<connor> it's really popular in japan sorry </connor>
<garnt> it's massive in japan what are like the </garnt>
<garnt> biggest games in japan </garnt>
<connor> what genre of games like what in first </connor>
<connor> person shooters i think it's like apex </connor>
<garnt> right now </garnt>
<garnt> like because it's possible online games </garnt>
<connor> big in japan even yeah yeah there's a </connor>
<connor> huge scene for it like </connor>
<joey> apex right now is massive because also </joey>
<connor> shockingly because the v youtubers that </connor>
<connor> are playing it was popular before that </connor>
<connor> yeah but the beach </connor>
<connor> ninja signs propelled the [ __ ] out of it </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah yeah because like when we </connor>
<connor> moved to japan i think is when </connor>
<connor> pub g was big right pubg was big but i </connor>
<connor> think apex either just released or </connor>
<joey> released like a while back and they were </joey>
<joey> doing a huge push for it </joey>
<joey> because i the month where we moved here </joey>
<joey> every single ad i got was apex legends </joey>
<joey> really in japan yeah everything was and </joey>
<joey> um </joey>
<joey> i thought wow that's kind of weird </joey>
<joey> because it's kind of like a dead game in </joey>
<joey> like the west </joey>
<connor> at least it was i feel like it </connor>
<connor> flip-flops and whether it's popular or </connor>
<garnt> not yeah </garnt>
<garnt> what even counts as a dead game anymore </garnt>
<connor> right overwatch i'd say </connor>
<connor> that's because overwatch 2's coming out </connor>
<joey> so they're just like abandoned </joey>
<connor> um but like you know i mean i not a dead </connor>
<connor> game but like not </connor>
<connor> in like the public discourse is what i </connor>
<connor> would consider like </connor>
<connor> yeah when people when people say dead </connor>
<connor> game i think that's what they mean like </connor>
<connor> it's not </connor>
<joey> like no one plays it like the main </joey>
<joey> population is talking about it or not </joey>
<connor> right yeah yeah like it's not like </connor>
<connor> you you know you're not expected to have </connor>
<connor> some general knowledge about it because </connor>
<joey> you're not expected to have a police </joey>
<joey> officer come up to you </joey>
<joey> do you play overwatch do you play </joey>
<joey> overwatch </joey>
<connor> who do you mean who's your overwatch </connor>
<connor> player right like you tankers like they </connor>
<garnt> don't really </garnt>
<garnt> i'm gonna sound like such a [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> boomer right now like what even are the </garnt>
<joey> popular games right now </joey>
<joey> right because because like when i think </joey>
<joey> coffee all that </joey>
<joey> when i when i think popular game i think </joey>
<garnt> you know whatever the fad is right now </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<connor> among us and four guys well i think </connor>
<connor> after the among us kind of like settled </connor>
<connor> it definitely became a bit more variety </connor>
<connor> like tends to be quite a lot like uh </connor>
<connor> valheim's picking up steam which is kind </connor>
<connor> of like a reimagining of runescape </connor>
<joey> almost </joey>
<joey> all i've heard valheim is is just like </joey>
<joey> minecraft but better graphics </joey>
<connor> oh i heard runescape with like mixed </connor>
<connor> with minecraft oh really </connor>
<connor> um apex has obviously had a really big </connor>
<connor> resurgence yeah </connor>
<connor> really good numbers like a lot of big </connor>
<connor> streamers are getting back into it yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah i think valerian's still doing </connor>
<garnt> pretty well </garnt>
<garnt> leagues obviously league league's just </garnt>
<garnt> always up there i think csgo is still </garnt>
<garnt> the same thing where it's always been </garnt>
<connor> like kind of like you know the scrappy </connor>
<garnt> little underdog because i </garnt>
<garnt> i think the thing is like i look at the </garnt>
<joey> top watch games on twitch and they're </joey>
<joey> normally like the games that i just </joey>
<joey> never end up playing </joey>
<joey> yeah so i don't actually i i never </joey>
<joey> actually know what and what everyone </joey>
<garnt> ends up playing or what's kind of </garnt>
<connor> popular right now um </connor>
<connor> i don't know we haven't had any massive </connor>
<joey> games recently after a manga we haven't </joey>
<joey> really had anything that's </joey>
<joey> stolen the spotlight i don't yeah i </joey>
<joey> could be wrong </joey>
<joey> i think the last time i spoke about </joey>
<connor> games i got things very wrong people </connor>
<connor> gave me [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> that's fair enough go ahead i feel like </joey>
<joey> the whole idea of like </joey>
<joey> you know like the most popular game </joey>
<joey> nowadays is a little bit blurred </joey>
<connor> just because like anyone can i feel like </connor>
<joey> it's like they're gonna be the top </joey>
<connor> games yeah yeah like chess has had </connor>
<connor> already big resurgence obviously yeah </connor>
<connor> balloons tower defense six man i'm </connor>
<garnt> telling you man it's coming </garnt>
<garnt> everyone's playing it man before it gets </garnt>
<garnt> better </garnt>
<connor> fortnite obviously is just fortnite i </connor>
<connor> don't know like i feel like a lot of </connor>
<connor> games are just kind of like settled </connor>
<connor> yeah we haven't really had anything to </connor>
<garnt> shake i mean i remember for the longest </garnt>
<garnt> time we're in the league community where </garnt>
<connor> everyone's just like </connor>
<connor> yo league's dying league's dying it's </connor>
<connor> it's it's </connor>
<connor> yeah it's never gonna well it's never </connor>
<connor> gonna die um it got it plateaued but i </connor>
<garnt> feel like there's a difference between </garnt>
<garnt> something plateauing and something kind </garnt>
<connor> of like and also the league of </connor>
<connor> viewership has been like pretty </connor>
<joey> consistent just because of the plateaus </joey>
<joey> doesn't mean it's </joey>
<connor> you know yeah no no i mean i mean league </connor>
<connor> is still like you know you can still </connor>
<joey> easily </joey>
<joey> support a billion dollar company people </joey>
<joey> are playing it so you know </joey>
<connor> but it's like it's like is it in public </connor>
<joey> discourse right or not i usually i </joey>
<joey> usually chalk up to </joey>
<connor> whether a game is popular if like </connor>
<connor> minecraft is like like small </connor>
<connor> like the younger generation of playing </connor>
<joey> it true like you know </joey>
<connor> like if you go to like a primary school </connor>
<joey> and they're talking about apex and </joey>
<joey> fortnite and minecraft then it's like </joey>
<joey> okay this is like the big games right </joey>
<connor> now yeah it's funny man i mean my mom </connor>
<connor> was telling me she works in primary </connor>
<connor> school she told me like one kid got like </connor>
<connor> really bullied because um </connor>
<joey> he was like bad is it for tonight no </joey>
<connor> wasn't there uh there was a story </connor>
<connor> skin as well yeah there was a story in </connor>
<joey> japan where a kid got bullied because he </joey>
<connor> had the default skin fortnite </connor>
<garnt> serves him right wow i mean i think </garnt>
<garnt> we've talked about this before but i've </garnt>
<connor> heard the same story as well </connor>
<joey> um but like i think minecraft is </joey>
<joey> definitely probably the biggest i'd say </joey>
<joey> minecraft's still the biggest </joey>
<connor> minecraft's just a juggernaut at this </connor>
<garnt> point it's not going anywhere since </garnt>
<joey> since our last stream i've been like </joey>
<garnt> should i play minecraft sure should i </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] should i play minecraft </joey>
<joey> it's dead it's so relaxing if we all </joey>
<connor> play minecraft you guys got to try apex </connor>
<joey> we should do that we should do like a </joey>
<joey> like a game cultural cross </joey>
<joey> cross-pollination </joey>
<joey> we should do that come on it's what the </joey>
<garnt> people want god </garnt>
<garnt> you're just never going to give up on </garnt>
<connor> this song because i know if you guys try </connor>
<connor> it you'll have a good time </connor>
<joey> yeah i think you will i think every </joey>
<joey> person who ever offered me an fps game </joey>
<connor> said </connor>
<joey> the same thing it's because this is with </joey>
<joey> the boys i heard it about fortnight i </joey>
<joey> heard it about overwatch </joey>
<connor> i've already talked about this we'll </connor>
<garnt> give it a shot we'll give it a shot </garnt>
<garnt> we'll try it guys don't worry </garnt>
<garnt> i'll convince them so i guess switching </garnt>
<garnt> gears did you guys hear about this </garnt>
<garnt> like deep fake story that happens i </garnt>
<garnt> think today </garnt>
<connor> or yesterday so yesterday for us but it </connor>
<garnt> would be like three weeks for the </garnt>
<garnt> audience yeah three weeks three weeks </garnt>
<connor> for the audience facts may come out i </connor>
<connor> mean yeah i i have not </connor>
<connor> like with deep fake becoming like such a </connor>
<joey> big thought like a bigger thing now </joey>
<joey> so i uh i can't we're gonna go back to </joey>
<joey> this </joey>
<joey> i can't remember every detail of the </joey>
<joey> story but i think the main gist of it </joey>
<garnt> was </garnt>
<garnt> there was his mom and she had a daughter </garnt>
<garnt> who was on the cheerleading squad </garnt>
<garnt> we get maylene to check the story while </garnt>
<connor> we're talking about it yeah just google </connor>
<connor> deep fake news that'll be like a top </connor>
<garnt> story </garnt>
<garnt> so i believe there was mom who had a </garnt>
<garnt> daughter who was on the cheerleading </garnt>
<garnt> squad </garnt>
<garnt> um and there were other girls on that </garnt>
<garnt> cheerleading squad </garnt>
<garnt> and for some reason she wanted the </garnt>
<connor> she wanted to kick these other girls off </connor>
<connor> of the squad </connor>
<connor> right so what she did is she made some </connor>
<connor> deep fakes </connor>
<connor> for like of the other girls like smoking </connor>
<connor> yeah like smoking drinking </connor>
<joey> doing doing like bad illegal activities </joey>
<connor> or whatever right right </connor>
<connor> and i think threatening them with it </connor>
<connor> right or like i can't remember if she </connor>
<garnt> threatened them or she sent them </garnt>
<garnt> straight to them </garnt>
<connor> sure how she did it but i think they </connor>
<connor> they saw it and the reason why </connor>
<connor> it got even found out was because they </connor>
<garnt> took it to the police yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah and how she got found out was she </garnt>
<garnt> used the fake number </garnt>
<garnt> she used like this internet service that </garnt>
<garnt> gave them a gave her a fake number </garnt>
<joey> but that didn't hide her ip address </joey>
<joey> and that's the only reason she found out </joey>
<garnt> sponsored by you know </garnt>
<connor> i don't think she would have got caught </connor>
<connor> if she was sponsored by it </connor>
<connor> i don't think our sponsor would be very </connor>
<joey> happy now that's why we're not going to </joey>
<garnt> mention any names </garnt>
<garnt> yeah but i mean i i saw it and i'm just </garnt>
<garnt> like well i can't believe they actually </garnt>
<garnt> took </garnt>
<connor> this long or something like this to </connor>
<connor> happen you know the most unbelievable </connor>
<connor> part of the story is there's a mum out </connor>
<connor> there that's tech savvy enough </connor>
<connor> because that's what i thought mike you i </connor>
<connor> don't even think my mum knows what a </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] deep fake is </connor>
<connor> let alone had it she doesn't even know </connor>
<connor> how to search for files on windows </connor>
<connor> i'm actually impressed her mum knew how </connor>
<connor> to make a difference because i'm </connor>
<garnt> impressed </garnt>
<garnt> what i'm impressed that mom knew how to </garnt>
<garnt> do a deep fake but i'm even </garnt>
<garnt> more like because okay um i'm </garnt>
<garnt> not sure if any of this is confirmed so </garnt>
<garnt> i'm going to put out </garnt>
<connor> a disclaimer that we could be totally </connor>
<connor> wrong this could be please check this </connor>
<garnt> out do your own research yeah but </garnt>
<joey> by the time this comes out all right all </joey>
<joey> right </joey>
<joey> i'll cut the story awhile by the time </joey>
<joey> this come out comes out everything might </joey>
<joey> be confirmed </joey>
<joey> this might all have been like false </joey>
<joey> information or it would it might have </joey>
<joey> just been like </joey>
<joey> claims but at the time of recording we </joey>
<joey> don't know if it's real or not </joey>
<joey> but these are what the allegations are </joey>
<joey> right uh and the allegation was that she </joey>
<joey> did this because </joey>
<joey> the daughters on the cheerleading squad </joey>
<garnt> she stopped hanging out with her </garnt>
<garnt> daughter </garnt>
<garnt> and so she she wanted to get them kicked </garnt>
<garnt> off because of that and i'm just </garnt>
<garnt> thinking </garnt>
<joey> if someone's this petty to be this crazy </joey>
<garnt> how dare you are not friends how did she </garnt>
<garnt> manage to figure out how to do deep </garnt>
<connor> fakes </connor>
<connor> they all she also sent them anonymous </connor>
<connor> messages tying them to </connor>
<connor> that they should you know end their own </connor>
<joey> lives as well to the these kids </joey>
<joey> the mom did that the mom did that what </joey>
<joey> the [ __ ] this [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> how this is something some people are </connor>
<connor> not supposed to be scared this is so </connor>
<connor> like cartoon villain like it's so absurd </connor>
<connor> that someone could be this </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] oh my god yeah but </connor>
<garnt> i mean i saw that and i'm just thinking </garnt>
<garnt> my first thought was i'm </garnt>
<garnt> one i'm surprised that it took this long </garnt>
<garnt> for something like this to happen right </garnt>
<joey> this mug shot looks like she's tore </joey>
<connor> someone's face off </connor>
<joey> oh my god she looks like a disney </joey>
<connor> villain doesn't it yeah </connor>
<joey> like maleficent just ripped someone's </joey>
<joey> face off and stitched it that's like </joey>
<joey> should i say that it's probably too </joey>
<connor> going too far isn't it that's like </connor>
<joey> that's like i shouldn't [ __ ] you </joey>
<joey> telling kids to watch that actually it </joey>
<joey> looks like she's wearing someone else's </joey>
<connor> face oh my god </connor>
<connor> you know there's more concerning about </connor>
<connor> that that was someone's parent </connor>
<connor> yeah holy [ __ ] imagine being raised by </connor>
<joey> someone like that </joey>
<joey> holy [ __ ] that kid's gonna be [ __ ] </joey>
<garnt> but apparently the kid knew nothing like </garnt>
<garnt> the mom did this without telling the kid </garnt>
<garnt> she did this by herself </garnt>
<connor> so how would you even tell the kid like </connor>
<connor> the kid's like are you cool with this </connor>
<connor> kid </connor>
<connor> no i'm not mom what's wrong with your </connor>
<garnt> a nasty tweet and then there's creating </garnt>
<garnt> deep faces please please don't tell </garnt>
<garnt> my schoolmates to go kill themselves and </garnt>
<connor> make these fakes when i would tell my </connor>
<joey> mum that i was being bullied she wasn't </joey>
<joey> thrilled about it </joey>
<joey> yeah she was like you know i'm not happy </joey>
<joey> about this i'm putting a word to the </joey>
<joey> teacher but </joey>
<connor> you're on your own yeah yeah yeah this </connor>
<connor> is your problem exactly </connor>
<joey> i can't deal with this [ __ ] i don't even </joey>
<connor> know what's going on </connor>
<connor> like i mean [ __ ] hell that's scary i </connor>
<connor> mean </connor>
<connor> it's just so many these the parts of </connor>
<connor> this story is actually insane </connor>
<connor> yeah that this could happen it is </connor>
<garnt> literally like a horror movie plot </garnt>
<garnt> what this is this is kind of like it's </garnt>
<garnt> just it's almost too cartoony to be a </garnt>
<garnt> black mirror episode </garnt>
<connor> that's what that's what it is it is it's </connor>
<connor> so like if this was a blackberry episode </connor>
<joey> you'd be like yeah twist's really </joey>
<joey> predictable </joey>
<joey> like really really over the top yeah i </joey>
<joey> mean like it's like a </joey>
<garnt> great horror film like the mom's kind of </garnt>
<garnt> an unbelievable villain here she could </garnt>
<garnt> have used more character development </garnt>
<garnt> more motivation no </garnt>
<garnt> this is reality but what scares me is </garnt>
<joey> that </joey>
<joey> like what what does this mean for the </joey>
<joey> future of deep fakes now because like </joey>
<joey> uh this week especially this new apps </joey>
<joey> come up where </joey>
<joey> it's gotten really easy to deflate yeah </joey>
<joey> you know deflate you know </joey>
<connor> use use it for memes use it for harmless </connor>
<garnt> memes to make people sing </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] bakami thai i mean you know </garnt>
<connor> we're used to </connor>
<connor> you know people doing [ __ ] terrible </connor>
<connor> photoshops or doing stuff like that so </connor>
<connor> if someone sent me a video of me doing </connor>
<connor> something i clearly didn't do or never </connor>
<connor> ever did i'd be like </connor>
<connor> i don't give a [ __ ] it's fake right and </connor>
<connor> i'll say it's fake and yeah that'll </connor>
<connor> probably be the end of it </connor>
<connor> but to someone who's never really had </connor>
<connor> anything online or any kind of like </connor>
<connor> you know posted anything about </connor>
<connor> themselves inside like their personal </connor>
<joey> facebook </joey>
<joey> i can see why receiving a video that </joey>
<joey> looks like you </joey>
<joey> doing something that you didn't do could </joey>
<joey> be [ __ ] terrible yeah </joey>
<joey> right absolutely you would think that </joey>
<connor> wow people are really going to believe </connor>
<garnt> this even though </garnt>
<connor> you know realistically they're probably </connor>
<connor> not going to you explain that it's fake </connor>
<garnt> right </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i mean it's it's gotten to a point </garnt>
<garnt> where like for people like us </garnt>
<garnt> especially where we show our faces on </garnt>
<garnt> camera pretty often </garnt>
<garnt> it wouldn't be hard to make a convincing </garnt>
<garnt> deep fake with you know us </garnt>
<connor> coming on camera literally every week i </connor>
<connor> think we all uh we all agree on this </connor>
<joey> that you do not have permission to make </joey>
<joey> any deep fakes of us and we don't </joey>
<garnt> condone any of them by the way just </garnt>
<joey> saying that </joey>
<garnt> you're legally not allowed to do that </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i mean is there anything legal </garnt>
<connor> that's </connor>
<connor> you know that yeah you can't you're not </connor>
<connor> like i think legally speaking you can't </connor>
<joey> like </joey>
<connor> just do that yeah um depending on what </connor>
<connor> jurisdiction you're in </connor>
<connor> yeah tom scott did a video about it </connor>
<connor> right i think i think the laws around it </connor>
<garnt> but iffy and obviously </garnt>
<connor> stuff like this always takes because </connor>
<garnt> it's such a new thing yeah yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> it's a really new thing because like you </garnt>
<garnt> know i've seen like the buccaneer tie </garnt>
<connor> deep fake someone just like you know </connor>
<connor> this is </connor>
<connor> funny meme whatever but then i don't </connor>
<connor> know how it i would feel if i saw the </connor>
<connor> uh you know the ksi ainsley harrier deep </connor>
<connor> fake because that's that's so good </connor>
<connor> that's so good it's funny as [ __ ] but </connor>
<joey> then </joey>
<connor> also something at the back of my mind </connor>
<joey> which makes me </joey>
<joey> like that's [ __ ] worrying that's how </joey>
<joey> good like how good it is </joey>
<joey> and i'm glad it's been used as a funny </joey>
<joey> meme but </joey>
<joey> my god if if i saw if i saw my face on </joey>
<garnt> somebody else like that </garnt>
<connor> i would just think damn i'm glad this is </connor>
<connor> being used </connor>
<garnt> for a funny meme but this could be used </garnt>
<garnt> for something that's really luckily </garnt>
<garnt> right now </garnt>
<joey> as many deep fake things are being made </joey>
<joey> there's just as many things that are </joey>
<joey> detecting if deep fakes have been made </joey>
<joey> like programs that are being written to </joey>
<joey> detect them </joey>
<joey> so right now it's like it's a lot of </joey>
<joey> software's will detect when the when </joey>
<connor> it's a deep fake </connor>
<joey> yeah but whether it'll get to the point </joey>
<connor> in future that it that it is </connor>
<garnt> do you think like it's only a matter of </garnt>
<garnt> time before we get our first deep fake </garnt>
<garnt> cancellation </garnt>
<joey> no i think we're quite far away from </joey>
<connor> that right i think i think they're still </connor>
<connor> too rough and the technology isn't there </connor>
<connor> yet but i think it's possible within </connor>
<joey> like i've seen some defects that are </joey>
<joey> really [ __ ] convincing though but </joey>
<connor> like the </connor>
<connor> the videos are like always in like 480p </connor>
<garnt> max right like and well that's like kind </garnt>
<garnt> of the video you'd expect for i don't </garnt>
<joey> know like the </joey>
<joey> kind of phone quality exposed videos </joey>
<joey> they're never like </joey>
<joey> 720p 4k it's always like [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> playstation eye camera </joey>
<connor> but i think the the more the easier it </connor>
<connor> gets to cancel someone from a deep fake </connor>
<joey> the less cancelling will happen because </joey>
<joey> everyone will be like it's a deep fake </joey>
<joey> is it a deep fake or everyone's going to </joey>
<joey> defense is going to be it's a deep fake </joey>
<joey> yeah all right but like how did that </joey>
<connor> video of me punching a baby </connor>
<joey> that's the thing how long until the deep </joey>
<connor> fake argument is going to be legitimate </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah well i mean the moment that </connor>
<connor> you can counsel someone for a deep fake </connor>
<connor> is when that argument will become valid </connor>
<connor> right because they'll be like oh i mean </connor>
<connor> you sure you saw that do you think it </connor>
<joey> was yeah it was deeply it's a really </joey>
<joey> good deep faith </joey>
<joey> looks so real oh my god i can't believe </joey>
<joey> it myself </joey>
<garnt> our world's going to become a lot more </garnt>
<garnt> messy when he gets there unfortunately </garnt>
<garnt> but you know </garnt>
<garnt> it's uh yeah i mean there's nothing </garnt>
<joey> what's scary is that there's nothing to </joey>
<joey> stop the technology being out there but </joey>
<joey> i mean i i guess you can argue this for </joey>
<joey> a lot of things because i remember </joey>
<connor> when you know 3d printers became a thing </connor>
<connor> and then </connor>
<connor> you can still 3d print guns yeah exactly </connor>
<joey> you can still 3d print guns you </joey>
<joey> shouldn't but i mean </joey>
<joey> you shouldn't and i believe it's illegal </joey>
<joey> right uh </joey>
<connor> well it's it's most around it real weird </connor>
<connor> i think i think i think what it is is </connor>
<connor> that there's </connor>
<joey> most uh 3d printing machines can detect </joey>
<joey> if it's like the blueprint of a gun or </joey>
<connor> firearm or something and just </connor>
<connor> not well it's like a photoshop if you </connor>
<garnt> put a picture of the the dollar bill </garnt>
<joey> in uh they won't let you do anything to </joey>
<garnt> it yeah it'll like stop you </garnt>
<garnt> oh really yeah i had no idea yeah it's </garnt>
<connor> so they don't want to photoshop it to </connor>
<connor> like try and like you know </connor>
<connor> because the software's so powerful </connor>
<connor> photoshop print out free money yeah </connor>
<connor> photoshop is really powerful tool yeah </connor>
<connor> and the stuff that they're constantly </connor>
<connor> adding to it is just </connor>
<connor> you know adding to the repertoire of how </connor>
<connor> strong it is and it's like very </connor>
<connor> concerning but then again you know </connor>
<connor> it's like when photoshop first started </connor>
<connor> as well like we were all like oh my god </connor>
<connor> people are going to be like it's it's </connor>
<connor> crazy you know like </connor>
<connor> everyone's going to start getting </connor>
<connor> cancelled they're going to be people </connor>
<garnt> going to put nicholas cage in orgies </garnt>
<garnt> although that's </garnt>
<connor> i can't remember there being a case </connor>
<connor> where someone got in trouble for a </connor>
<connor> photoshop picture </connor>
<joey> like a big story like because normally </joey>
<joey> you know a picture at least you know </joey>
<joey> there needs to be a lot more context </joey>
<connor> behind why the picture </connor>
<joey> exists yeah yeah exactly and without </joey>
<connor> reasonable context of why </connor>
<connor> the picture would exist people aren't </connor>
<connor> really gonna believe it yeah i feel like </connor>
<connor> it's probably gonna be the same for a </connor>
<connor> video </connor>
<connor> like if there's a video of like i don't </connor>
<joey> know like robert downey jr just like i </joey>
<joey> said like punching a kid </joey>
<joey> in like a park or something it's gonna </joey>
<joey> be like well one why is robert down a </joey>
<connor> junior in a park </connor>
<connor> why is he playing basketball with the </connor>
<connor> kid then punching it right this is gonna </connor>
<joey> be like </joey>
<joey> the context is gonna be needed like </joey>
<joey> there's gonna be so many questions </joey>
<joey> they're gonna need to be answered before </joey>
<connor> you take a video seriously </connor>
<joey> i think that's good yeah but but like </joey>
<joey> how long until you do run into like that </joey>
<joey> you know </joey>
<joey> perfect situation where it's like oh the </joey>
<joey> story is there the narrative is there </joey>
<garnt> everything lines up the only difference </garnt>
<garnt> is that robert downey jr didn't actually </garnt>
<connor> punch the kid yeah i mean like but i can </connor>
<connor> make him punch the kids </connor>
<garnt> yeah he was close i mean i mean [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> fake news articles are bad enough </joey>
<joey> already yeah </joey>
<joey> with with how you know there are [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> anti-vaxxers and </joey>
<joey> flat earthers and just things that have </joey>
<connor> been enabled because it's so easy to </connor>
<connor> stay in your bubble and </connor>
<connor> it's really like strengthen your own </connor>
<connor> argument and you're right it's a </connor>
<garnt> worrying time </garnt>
<joey> it is it is definitely a worrying time </joey>
<connor> but i don't let it get to me i'm trying </connor>
<connor> to enjoy life you know </connor>
<connor> i'm just trying to live my best life the </connor>
<connor> world may be ending but i'm gonna have a </connor>
<connor> good time </connor>
<connor> i still laugh at these memes i care </connor>
<connor> about what i need to care about </connor>
<connor> no more that's kind of how i like to do </connor>
<connor> it like i just think that </connor>
<connor> after a certain point if you just start </connor>
<connor> worrying about everything you're just </connor>
<connor> gonna be [ __ ] miserable </connor>
<connor> and like i think obviously you know when </connor>
<connor> it comes to like you know you're voting </connor>
<connor> on </connor>
<connor> your politician your area yeah i think </connor>
<connor> you should care about that and that </connor>
<connor> should matter but like </connor>
<connor> beyond that do i care if a news </connor>
<connor> presenter </connor>
<connor> in the u.s says like something [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> abhorrent i'm like no honestly it's not </joey>
<joey> really my problem and i don't really </joey>
<joey> give a [ __ ] like </joey>
<joey> maybe that that's i don't know is that </joey>
<joey> is that like elitist to think that like </joey>
<joey> i think it's just </joey>
<joey> outside of my like like you know i don't </joey>
<joey> know to me like stuff that goes on the </joey>
<joey> u.s sometimes i'm like that's honestly </joey>
<joey> not my problem </joey>
<joey> like is that bad like so some people say </joey>
<joey> that's like a </joey>
<joey> like a prejudiced or ignorant mindset </joey>
<connor> work it's like </connor>
<connor> i have the luxury right it depends it </connor>
<connor> depends on the context right because the </connor>
<connor> problem is </connor>
<connor> that the problem with that argument i </connor>
<joey> feel is that </joey>
<joey> there's no way a human can care about </joey>
<joey> absolutely everything </joey>
<joey> true so at some point you're going to </joey>
<joey> have to pick and choose </joey>
<joey> what you care about otherwise one you're </joey>
<joey> probably going to be a miserable [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> and two you're gonna wake up and you're </joey>
<joey> gonna you're just gonna be </joey>
<joey> exhausted i'm not gonna have to do </joey>
<garnt> anything on the day because you just </garnt>
<garnt> feel flooded and i feel flooded enough </garnt>
<garnt> with my own social media right now and </garnt>
<garnt> like and this is me </garnt>
<garnt> like where social media is so </garnt>
<garnt> intertwined with our jobs so i see this </garnt>
<garnt> stuff and i'm just like i can't care </garnt>
<joey> about it i'm pretty sure that's how </joey>
<joey> people become nihilists right they just </joey>
<joey> like they look at the world it's like oh </joey>
<joey> the world is [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> i guess nothing matters i mean like it </connor>
<connor> feels like it's just been so much </connor>
<connor> like heavier as well i've since the </connor>
<connor> pandemic as well because yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> you're just trying to like get by </connor>
<joey> you know life's already difficult enough </joey>
<connor> and then shit's going on you're like </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] man like </connor>
<connor> i'm i'm literally just trying to be </connor>
<connor> happy for like 10 seconds here can i </connor>
<garnt> have this yeah i </garnt>
<garnt> i kind of feel a bit jealous of our </garnt>
<garnt> parents when they only had to care care </garnt>
<garnt> about the [ __ ] that was happening around </garnt>
<garnt> them </garnt>
<garnt> now i have to care about [ __ ] that's </garnt>
<connor> happening halfway across the world yeah </connor>
<connor> like when i see like you know my my </connor>
<connor> parents get [ __ ] furious that they </connor>
<connor> change the bin size of like the council </connor>
<connor> by like ten percent lower they're like </connor>
<connor> oh my god this is unreasonable you know </connor>
<connor> like i just missed the days where i </connor>
<connor> could give a [ __ ] about stupid [ __ ] like </connor>
<connor> that yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> now i've got to worry about like </connor>
<joey> literally like </joey>
<joey> cultural engagement nothing to do with </joey>
<connor> you right yeah it's just like i don't </connor>
<connor> know man i i </connor>
<connor> i want to care about everything and i </connor>
<connor> want to give like people who are </connor>
<connor> fighting for like legitimate like good </connor>
<connor> fights i want to help them out but at </connor>
<joey> the same time it's like there's so much </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] like [ __ ] going on and obviously </joey>
<joey> the internet has obviously made </joey>
<joey> all the information even more accessible </joey>
<joey> so there's so many more things to care </joey>
<joey> i'm talking about global warming right </joey>
<joey> don't waste too much food right what's </joey>
<joey> going on over here </joey>
<joey> there's a civil war going on in this </joey>
<joey> country and like atrocities happen how </joey>
<joey> do i </joey>
<connor> how do i like legitimately like give my </connor>
<joey> energy literally </joey>
<joey> how to live yeah like that's that's just </joey>
<joey> life isn't it yeah </joey>
<connor> like i don't want to be like um global </connor>
<connor> warming is more important than people </connor>
<connor> dying in this country yeah i mean it's </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> how where do you where do you draw the </connor>
<connor> line on where to start well i mean i </connor>
<joey> think you can like </joey>
<joey> you know pick and choose what you care </joey>
<joey> about but it's the difference between </joey>
<joey> being publicly open about this stuff </joey>
<connor> right it's like yo i mean i wouldn't say </connor>
<connor> i don't care about something as much or </connor>
<connor> as like yeah it's oh my god this is so </connor>
<connor> tough to talk yeah i mean </connor>
<connor> it is it literally makes you sound like </connor>
<connor> an [ __ ] yeah you don't give a [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> about </connor>
<joey> like what do you think </joey>
<connor> you're our manager we are we going to </connor>
<connor> get cancelled for this mailing but no no </connor>
<connor> but no i i totally understand because </connor>
<joey> i feel like that's just part of being </joey>
<joey> human right you know there's </joey>
<joey> going to be people that's you know make </joey>
<joey> the argument well you're privileged </joey>
<joey> enough that you don't </joey>
<joey> have to care about it right but i i </joey>
<joey> would argue that </joey>
<joey> surely surely you can't you also </joey>
<joey> can't care about every single issue </joey>
<garnt> happening in the world because you you </garnt>
<garnt> feel strongly about this one issue </garnt>
<garnt> because it definitely affects you and i </garnt>
<garnt> understand that but surely that means </garnt>
<garnt> that you can't put the energy into </garnt>
<garnt> caring about another issue i don't think </garnt>
<joey> there's i don't think there's </joey>
<joey> any person out there living any type of </joey>
<joey> life pre like you know </joey>
<joey> uh prejudice or not prejudiced </joey>
<joey> privileged or not </joey>
<joey> who can dead ass be in a position where </joey>
<joey> it's like right now </joey>
<joey> everything in the world i need to worry </joey>
<joey> about because it's important to me like </joey>
<joey> yeah it doesn't matter who you are like </joey>
<joey> there's going to be one piece of news </joey>
<joey> where you're just like that has nothing </joey>
<joey> to do with anything that resonates with </joey>
<joey> you </joey>
<joey> yeah that like that you really believe </joey>
<joey> in yeah and that you fight towards like </joey>
<connor> helping that like i'm i'm down with that </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah at least you're fighting towards </joey>
<joey> something it's better than someone just </joey>
<joey> getting up in the morning being like i </joey>
<connor> don't care about any of this [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> yeah i mean like it's it's it doesn't </connor>
<connor> really bother me much when people get </connor>
<connor> like angry about </connor>
<joey> you know like oh my god you don't care </joey>
<joey> about this but i hate people who are </joey>
<joey> like you don't care enough </joey>
<joey> about this specific thing yeah like you </joey>
<joey> should be so angry about this thing and </joey>
<joey> i'm like </joey>
<connor> man i'm literally just trying to get by </connor>
<joey> yeah like what dictates like the </joey>
<joey> quantitative worth of how much you care </joey>
<connor> about some people who get willing to get </connor>
<joey> like outraged and like really </joey>
<joey> like a lot of fire up their ass for </joey>
<joey> something you know and like i don't you </joey>
<joey> know obviously </joey>
<connor> we need we need people like that yeah of </connor>
<connor> course yeah although [ __ ] doesn't get </connor>
<joey> done i can't expect any everyone to be </joey>
<connor> like yeah but then </connor>
<connor> i hate it when i see people like </connor>
<connor> blackmailing other people being like you </connor>
<connor> should count more you should care </connor>
<garnt> so much more about it because because </garnt>
<garnt> the problem with the argument is that </garnt>
<garnt> there's no way to frame it without the </garnt>
<garnt> person </garnt>
<garnt> without the person who you know cares </garnt>
<garnt> less about the topic </garnt>
<garnt> there's no way to frame the argument </garnt>
<garnt> without making them making them </garnt>
<garnt> like look good you know because it's </garnt>
<garnt> just okay you don't care about it </garnt>
<garnt> therefore you are the [ __ ] because </garnt>
<garnt> you don't care about this important </garnt>
<joey> issue </joey>
<joey> and i feel like can we just accept that </joey>
<joey> we are all human </joey>
<joey> you know we why we are all just trying </joey>
<joey> to get by everyone has different issues </joey>
<joey> some matter more than others but it's </joey>
<joey> it's </joey>
<joey> it's a lack of empathy you know we </joey>
<joey> in order to empathize with your problem </joey>
<joey> you at least have to </joey>
<joey> give us some empathy as well you know </joey>
<joey> and i feel like there's there's </joey>
<garnt> just there's just like a lack of empathy </garnt>
<connor> in that sense and that kind of argument </connor>
<connor> i'd like to think about being ignorant </connor>
<connor> on any of this that you know it won't </connor>
<connor> result in [ __ ] let's cancel the boys </connor>
<joey> but </joey>
<joey> i mean just let me know down below i'll </joey>
<joey> i will read the comments so if i am </joey>
<joey> missing any like big point here </joey>
<joey> or i'm being ignorant please do let me </joey>
<connor> know because i would like to judge my </connor>
<joey> mindset i don't think it's </joey>
<joey> i don't think it's ignorance personally </joey>
<connor> i think it's just like being honest </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah i mean i'm exactly the same i </garnt>
<joey> try to keep it as open-minded as </joey>
<joey> possible </joey>
<joey> about everything um and i've you know </joey>
<garnt> i've definitely changed my viewpoints on </garnt>
<garnt> certain topics thanks to what people </garnt>
<garnt> have said about what they've been </garnt>
<connor> discussing of course there's words i </connor>
<connor> like there was one person who um </connor>
<connor> because i think uh uh someone tweeted me </connor>
<connor> was like connor </connor>
<connor> shouldn't say the word crackhead is like </connor>
<connor> a descriptive word </connor>
<connor> it's a bad word uh because it apparently </connor>
<connor> has to do with a lot of </connor>
<connor> um you know like racial stereotyping </connor>
<connor> back in the war on drugs in america and </connor>
<connor> stuff and is used as a derogatory term </connor>
<connor> so i just stopped saying it </connor>
<connor> that was because someone tweeted at me </connor>
<connor> saying stop saying it i was like well i </connor>
<joey> don't really need this word </joey>
<joey> like you know because i said it on the </joey>
<joey> podcast and you know i realize </joey>
<joey> afterwards i'm like </joey>
<joey> yeah i mean there's like way better ways </joey>
<joey> to describe that </joey>
<joey> what i was trying to that feeling i was </joey>
<joey> trying to get across without using that </joey>
<joey> and i'm like yeah i don't really need to </joey>
<joey> use that word i haven't said it since on </joey>
<joey> like podcast or anything so i'm like oh </joey>
<joey> i haven't said it ever and i just don't </joey>
<joey> feel the need to and i'm like cool </joey>
<joey> thanks for letting me know </joey>
<joey> commented like if i have a bad habit let </joey>
<joey> me know i'll try and get rid of it yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah </joey>
<connor> uh if you're like connor you're fat [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> you i'm working on it </connor>
<joey> other things okay now the ones i hate </joey>
<joey> the most are connie you're fatter </joey>
<joey> it's like wow thanks </joey>
<joey> [Music] </joey>
<connor> that's always rough because that's like </connor>
<joey> oh my god yeah i always feel bad for </joey>
<joey> people whether </joey>
<joey> it's in that situation it's rough but </joey>
<joey> comments comments be brutal sometimes </joey>
<joey> comments really do pick apart like </joey>
<connor> everything yeah yeah but it's cool </connor>
<connor> though because sometimes you miss </connor>
<garnt> something </garnt>
<garnt> yeah exactly it i i feel like having a </garnt>
<joey> good balance is the healthy thing </joey>
<joey> because </joey>
<joey> um you have to find this balance between </joey>
<joey> knowing that you can't please </joey>
<joey> everyone um and finding a balance </joey>
<joey> between okay this this </joey>
<joey> this person's making a legitimate point </joey>
<garnt> i i can change my behavior </garnt>
<garnt> because you know he yeah they they're </garnt>
<garnt> making a sound argument and i completely </garnt>
<joey> understand i mean the comment section </joey>
<joey> full of yes men is just </joey>
<joey> kind of boring isn't it well i mean you </joey>
<connor> know people have their </connor>
<connor> you know when i read comments about </connor>
<joey> trash takes i'll be like i [ __ ] hate </joey>
<joey> joe or i [ __ ] hate connor yeah right </joey>
<joey> and i'm like well i mean i get it right </joey>
<joey> because it's like i guess to outside </joey>
<connor> like characters that's fine it's all </connor>
<connor> good dude </connor>
<connor> you've got your favorite i get it it's </connor>
<connor> all good dude </connor>
<connor> [Music] </connor>
<connor> yeah i don't know it's it's but then </connor>
<connor> sometimes they go a little too far with </connor>
<joey> it like man i wish connor would [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> quit the podcast </joey>
<joey> i'm sorry that's not gonna happen </joey>
<garnt> anytime it's not gonna happen but like </garnt>
<connor> if it did do you really </connor>
<garnt> do you think everyone wants that like i </garnt>
<garnt> don't know there are some that are just </garnt>
<connor> like man i wish connor would just </connor>
<connor> deck gaunt in the faces i'm just like i </connor>
<connor> will off camera </connor>
<connor> and i was like man is this is this how </connor>
<connor> friends act you know at least wait till </connor>
<connor> the trash tastes special where we </connor>
<connor> like to have a boxing match or something </connor>
<garnt> right not that we have anything planned </garnt>
<joey> and that was just me </joey>
<joey> boxing confirmed i'd actually like </joey>
<joey> ironically </joey>
<joey> love to be like a youtuber boxing match </joey>
<joey> because i just think like one </joey>
<joey> mailing's like getting ideas right now </joey>
<connor> it's like multi-million dollar day </connor>
<connor> i wish i could bring in </connor>
<connor> multi-millionaire i i don't know because </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> one you get an excuse to train you could </connor>
<connor> probably hire a personal coach you know </connor>
<joey> yeah i'd probably get in mad shape for </joey>
<connor> that and it would probably be fun i </connor>
<connor> guess i'll play the villain i'd love </connor>
<connor> that that'd be so much fun </connor>
<connor> but who would i fight though you know </connor>
<connor> that's the thing right yeah i haven't </connor>
<connor> got any enemies </connor>
<connor> so i should start beef with someone now </connor>
<connor> stop flexing </connor>
<connor> what do you want is not having enemies </connor>
<connor> like something to brag about like man </connor>
<connor> conor doesn't </connor>
<joey> god doesn't hate anyone i mean i don't </joey>
<garnt> even ask for enemies and i have enemies </garnt>
<garnt> i mean enemies are very strong yeah some </garnt>
<connor> people who dislike me </connor>
<joey> but like i i don't have any like open </joey>
<joey> beef with anyone on youtube </joey>
<joey> right i mean i don't really [ __ ] do </joey>
<connor> anything i just kind of just </connor>
<garnt> do my own thing i mean there's a </garnt>
<garnt> difference between having youtuber beef </garnt>
<garnt> and having actual real beef where you </garnt>
<garnt> have a big problem with someone yeah </garnt>
<connor> yeah yeah i was like would you what </connor>
<connor> would you </connor>
<connor> categorize like the ksi logan paul stuff </connor>
<connor> would you just you pure youtube b </connor>
<joey> for like legit that has to be youtube </joey>
<joey> beef right it was so over the top </joey>
<joey> i mean i don't like i think they're here </joey>
<connor> with each other </connor>
<joey> yeah and i think along the way they </joey>
<joey> started liking it yeah </joey>
<connor> i'm pretty sure it started as a </connor>
<connor> legitimate beef and then they were like </connor>
<connor> oh </connor>
<connor> we can make money off we're making tens </connor>
<connor> of millions of dollars </connor>
<garnt> hold on hold the phone i mean i feel </garnt>
<joey> like the line is blurred </joey>
<joey> where you have a financial incentive to </joey>
<joey> have beef oh yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah if not like </joey>
<connor> if they're just like [ __ ] talking to </connor>
<connor> each other see the light bulb light and </connor>
<connor> and over mailings head right now just </connor>
<joey> like lighting up bro </joey>
<joey> she's like she has a pog face right now </joey>
<connor> they made they made like over like what </connor>
<connor> twenty thirty million dollars each </connor>
<garnt> yeah like that because it's not it's not </garnt>
<garnt> actually beef like personal beef about </garnt>
<garnt> anything that </garnt>
<garnt> really matters like no one told like one </garnt>
<garnt> of their moms to go [ __ ] themselves or </garnt>
<garnt> like oh you know </garnt>
<connor> like yeah the insults were dude the </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] uh the pre-match [ __ ] like beef </joey>
<joey> like [ __ ] talking things were the best </joey>
<joey> part of the boxing matches they were </joey>
<connor> so bad at talking [ __ ] to each other it </connor>
<joey> was like it was like wrestling well </joey>
<joey> because yeah </joey>
<joey> my dad is nintendo yeah he's like my dad </joey>
<garnt> knows </garnt>
<connor> me emotion my dad's goku </connor>
<connor> and he's got the dream it's just like </connor>
<connor> yeah watching watching </connor>
<garnt> if you didn't give a [ __ ] about any </garnt>
<garnt> youtube boxing it was quite entertaining </garnt>
<garnt> as much as uh it was entertaining to </garnt>
<garnt> watch like i paid for the pay-per-view </garnt>
<garnt> because i'm like you know what </garnt>
<connor> if i if i can if you can make this a </connor>
<connor> thing on youtube i'm i'm more i </connor>
<garnt> paid for it because i'm just like you </garnt>
<garnt> know what you are making entertainment i </garnt>
<garnt> i [ __ ] get that i i'm </garnt>
<garnt> i'm watching a clown fiesta and i'm </garnt>
<garnt> watching to i'm paying to watch the </garnt>
<garnt> circus but i'll pay to watch the circus </garnt>
<connor> you know </connor>
<connor> no and i i want more of this i think </connor>
<connor> this is great for youtube and also </connor>
<connor> for boxing it did like wonders yeah and </connor>
<connor> it was like it's like the whole </connor>
<connor> the renaissance of boxing right now well </connor>
<joey> i mean for like the people in our age </joey>
<joey> my dad loves boxing and my dad's age </joey>
<joey> bracket love boxing </joey>
<joey> yeah they they love it but like you know </joey>
<joey> under under 30 and i think </joey>
<joey> mid 30s i don't [ __ ] give a [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> about boxing yeah a lot of people don't </joey>
<joey> i mean i'm sure there is a </joey>
<joey> there's a good there's a good segment of </joey>
<garnt> people who probably love boxing and mma </garnt>
<garnt> and all that yeah but it wasn't like </garnt>
<connor> nearly as popular as it used to be with </connor>
<garnt> our age group at least yeah </garnt>
<garnt> yeah because boxing was like you know </garnt>
<joey> some of the most classic moments in </joey>
<joey> sports in </joey>
<joey> our boxing matches like anything like </joey>
<joey> rumble in the jungle you know anything </joey>
<joey> with muhammad iconic </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] iconic to this day and you know </joey>
<garnt> i i grew up in an era where </garnt>
<garnt> i didn't even watch any boxing match i </garnt>
<garnt> don't think i don't i didn't watch </garnt>
<joey> boxing i think i've ever sat down and </joey>
<joey> watched a boxing </joey>
<connor> match in my life i i would just my dad </connor>
<connor> loved watching it and he'd be like man </connor>
<connor> this guy's fighting this guy for the </connor>
<connor> world heavyweight and i'm like who are </connor>
<garnt> these two people </garnt>
<garnt> no no because if you're a kid and your </garnt>
<garnt> parents weren't into it then how the </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] can you </garnt>
<garnt> afford to watch the pay-per-view yeah </garnt>
<garnt> right like there's no way you could </garnt>
<garnt> watch it it's always an american time so </garnt>
<connor> it's always that like </connor>
<connor> 3 a.m like sky which is already like 40 </connor>
<joey> pounds a month and you pay an extra 20 </joey>
<joey> pounds on top to get the pay-per-view </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah it's just yeah crazy yeah i </joey>
<joey> mean </joey>
<joey> i i don't know it's like uh what do you </joey>
<joey> think about the whole i don't know this </joey>
<joey> is changing gears too fast but uh we </joey>
<joey> think about the whole </joey>
<joey> thing where everyone's like man they're </joey>
<joey> they're ruining like boxing </joey>
<connor> by bringing in these influences to it </connor>
<joey> because it's happened with chess as well </joey>
<joey> uh by bringing in these like </joey>
<connor> non-traditions where you bring in like </connor>
<connor> you know you kind of i guess </connor>
<garnt> the way they would argue is that you're </garnt>
<garnt> diluting like the sport right </garnt>
<garnt> like i don't unders i don't understand </garnt>
<garnt> how </garnt>
<garnt> putting more eyes onto a sport ruins it </garnt>
<garnt> yeah because the whole point </garnt>
<garnt> of keeping a sport alive is that </garnt>
<garnt> a sport is kept alive by how many </garnt>
<garnt> viewers watch it </garnt>
<connor> yeah i mean there's there's a side of it </connor>
<connor> where i can understand </connor>
<connor> like you know for chess like at least </connor>
<connor> you know what if you start at age 12 </connor>
<connor> right and then you're like you're like </connor>
<connor> 30 now you're a grandmaster you've </connor>
<connor> literally been playing your whole life </connor>
<connor> for chess right yeah you're about to </connor>
<connor> like this is your time to shine </connor>
<connor> and then [ __ ] pogchamps has like you </connor>
<connor> know </connor>
<connor> 20 30 times more viewers than anything </connor>
<connor> you ever will get </connor>
<connor> i i could i could understand why they're </connor>
<garnt> mad yeah right that just sounds like </garnt>
<connor> that just sounds like a villain </connor>
<connor> protagonist to some sports animals i </connor>
<garnt> understand </garnt>
<garnt> i've been in backstory to some sport </garnt>
<garnt> it's super easy to understand </garnt>
<garnt> why they would get mad but then you know </garnt>
<joey> if you like anyone it's like a youtube </joey>
<joey> video right if i make a youtube video </joey>
<joey> and i'm a small youtuber </joey>
<joey> right about um about this mike wazowski </joey>
<joey> figure </joey>
<joey> right right and then gone you know who </joey>
<joey> has </joey>
<joey> you know a million uh let's say gonna </joey>
<joey> say ghana's three million right and a </joey>
<joey> youtuber ten thousand makes a video </joey>
<joey> about mike wazowski and god pretty much </joey>
<joey> does like nearly a one for one video </joey>
<joey> you know but in god's style right yes </joey>
<joey> that guy will be angry he's like god </joey>
<joey> just made my video but to a bigger </joey>
<connor> audience he's gonna get all the views </connor>
<connor> what you're not seeing is a huge kick </connor>
<joey> that you're gonna get a bunch of </joey>
<joey> trickle-down views yeah of course and </joey>
<joey> that's what's gonna happen </joey>
<joey> with all the stuff is that yeah you're </joey>
<joey> gonna see the immediate results of </joey>
<connor> you know getting uh the trickle-down </connor>
<connor> effect from all these massive events </connor>
<connor> with like </connor>
<joey> normies if you will right but they but i </joey>
<joey> think the problem is that most of these </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<connor> quote-unquote purists don't see it as a </connor>
<connor> trickle-down effect they just no no i </connor>
<joey> don't know </joey>
<connor> they see it as like sloppy seconds right </connor>
<connor> well yeah they see it as like you're </connor>
<joey> ruining the sanctity of my sport it's </joey>
<joey> like i wanted all the guys to come to me </joey>
<connor> first </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah yeah but you know it's you </connor>
<connor> know again more eyes more sponsor money </connor>
<garnt> it's all good yeah i mean like i think </garnt>
<garnt> we talked about this like two weeks ago </garnt>
<garnt> where you have to evolve with the times </garnt>
<connor> right </connor>
<connor> and there's got that you have to have do </connor>
<connor> you have to find a way to garner </connor>
<joey> interest in your sport </joey>
<joey> it's like keep up or get left behind </joey>
<connor> yeah i mean you know sports like boxing </connor>
<connor> and chess are </connor>
<joey> lucky that they've been they've had such </joey>
<joey> a good history and a good legacy where </joey>
<joey> that has like kind of carried them a bit </joey>
<joey> in the modern age yeah where they have </joey>
<joey> like a solid fan base </joey>
<joey> yeah but obviously you know if they want </joey>
<joey> to modernize to a point where they want </joey>
<garnt> to get </garnt>
<garnt> bring in a bunch of new viewers you got </garnt>
<garnt> to mix it up and chass is having like a </garnt>
<garnt> massive renaissance now yeah yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i'm happy for chess like chess streamers </garnt>
<joey> the biggest ones are yeah hey cara is </joey>
<joey> pulling in like plus 25k i think a </joey>
<joey> stream </joey>
<joey> uh like and a bunch of the other bigger </joey>
<connor> ones pulling in like over 5k </connor>
<connor> viewers on twitch and it's not like you </connor>
<joey> know just because you're like pulling </joey>
<connor> new viewers i feel like </connor>
<connor> that doesn't like dilute you know the </connor>
<connor> history that has already been built </connor>
<connor> like people are still going to look back </connor>
<joey> to like the greats of the times yeah </joey>
<connor> once they get all the greats people just </connor>
<connor> people just don't like that they're not </connor>
<connor> the ones that are solely being talked </connor>
<garnt> about right </garnt>
<garnt> i mean i i think one of one of the big </garnt>
<garnt> things is that i think </garnt>
<garnt> i don't know i might be talking out my </garnt>
<garnt> ass but it seems like </garnt>
<garnt> like a lot of the younger generations </garnt>
<garnt> are less there's less of a focus </garnt>
<joey> on sports and more people are like </joey>
<joey> getting into like video games and stuff </joey>
<joey> like that like we literally talked about </joey>
<joey> how uh my nephew got bullied because he </joey>
<joey> wanted to play sports but everyone was </joey>
<joey> playing fortnite whereas when i was </joey>
<joey> growing up </joey>
<joey> yeah it was the other way around the </joey>
<joey> cool kids were playing sport and that's </joey>
<joey> why sports </joey>
<joey> had such like so many eyes in it and now </joey>
<garnt> i think because </garnt>
<garnt> less kids might be interested in sports </garnt>
<garnt> you know </garnt>
<garnt> you have to find a new way to appeal to </garnt>
<garnt> a young audience otherwise </garnt>
<garnt> they're just not going to give a [ __ ] at </garnt>
<connor> the end of the day this is going to </connor>
<connor> sound weird </connor>
<garnt> but i think that video games are now </garnt>
<garnt> more accessible than sports yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> and i think </garnt>
<joey> why they're doing better like if you </joey>
<joey> want to play a game of rugby or football </joey>
<joey> you need what like at least five aside </joey>
<joey> you need a lot of people to get that </joey>
<joey> done you gotta get out and a lot of </joey>
<joey> space yeah a lot of space right like </joey>
<joey> anyone can play a video game on their </joey>
<joey> smartphone or whatever anyone </joey>
<joey> anyone can download channels yeah like </joey>
<joey> it's like </joey>
<joey> you know a lot of the sports like i love </joey>
<joey> i love swimming but like </joey>
<connor> finding a swimming pool in japan is so </connor>
<connor> hot yeah without paying out the ass </connor>
<connor> right yeah and there's not one anywhere </connor>
<connor> near us and like i don't i don't [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> know where to go </joey>
<joey> i mean there's one there's like gyms </joey>
<joey> that have them but you have to pay like </joey>
<connor> 150 bucks a month to access them yeah </connor>
<connor> most sports that i </connor>
<joey> liked as a kid i realized how lucky i </joey>
<joey> was that there was like in the uk you </joey>
<joey> have so many </joey>
<joey> sports centers all around where you can </joey>
<joey> do this but now i'm like fine it's </joey>
<joey> so hard to do the sports that i want to </joey>
<joey> do and get into it yeah i want to get </joey>
<joey> back into sports and get like a newer </joey>
<joey> generation into them because it's like </joey>
<joey> i mean i'm not being funny how are you </joey>
<joey> going to convince a kid to go you know </joey>
<connor> play golf when he can play mario golf </connor>
<connor> it's so accessible </connor>
<garnt> so easy like and the problem is golf </garnt>
<garnt> looks so boring </garnt>
<garnt> i'm sorry but golf like i i cannot there </garnt>
<garnt> are some sports where i'm just like i do </garnt>
<garnt> not understand how people can watch this </garnt>
<garnt> and be entertained because </garnt>
<garnt> i've like i've played golf before um </garnt>
<connor> because like i </connor>
<connor> um i used to like live kind of near </connor>
<connor> driving range and it's just so </connor>
<connor> i you know had a period where i i just </connor>
<connor> really enjoyed playing golf it was </connor>
<connor> really satisfying to like smack the ball </connor>
<connor> um i wasn't rich enough to afford my own </connor>
<connor> golf club so </connor>
<connor> you know i had another barrier to entry </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah yeah it's like that's not a </connor>
<connor> barrier to entry but </connor>
<garnt> it's really fun to play golf my god it's </garnt>
<garnt> so boring to watch </garnt>
<connor> i cannot watch a golf game i mean i'm </connor>
<connor> sure the people who are watching this </connor>
<connor> who love watching golf and i'm sorry </connor>
<joey> disappointing </joey>
<joey> but there's like there's so many sports </joey>
<garnt> like that though like i used to play </garnt>
<garnt> tennis </garnt>
<joey> like a lot i can but i cannot sit down </joey>
<garnt> and watch a tennis match oh i don't know </garnt>
<garnt> i can </garnt>
<garnt> sometimes some games but they all long </garnt>
<garnt> they are live </garnt>
<garnt> but it's so but i find it just so weird </garnt>
<joey> and interesting how like </joey>
<joey> i can i myself love playing the sport </joey>
<joey> and yet i can't bear to sit down and </joey>
<joey> watch the sport </joey>
<connor> yeah like you'd think if someone played </connor>
<joey> the sport they would be </joey>
<joey> just as interested to watch it as well </joey>
<connor> right because they're not always because </connor>
<connor> the inverse is also true as well where i </connor>
<joey> might like </joey>
<joey> have no interest in playing the sport </joey>
<joey> but i love watching it oh yeah but like </joey>
<joey> that's good </joey>
<connor> yeah like me with league is that a sport </connor>
<garnt> but uh yeah i mean like for example i </garnt>
<garnt> don't know there's there's always going </garnt>
<garnt> to be like massive sports like football </garnt>
<garnt> oh yeah uh which that's not going to go </garnt>
<garnt> away that's like too deeply ingrained </garnt>
<joey> but </joey>
<joey> i feel like that that's why the olympics </joey>
<joey> is so weird to me right </joey>
<joey> because you end up watching a load of </joey>
<joey> these sports which </joey>
<joey> you would in any other circumstances </joey>
<joey> have no interest in watching but </joey>
<joey> yeah it's the olympics you know does </joey>
<garnt> anyone want to watch like men's </garnt>
<garnt> volleyball </garnt>
<joey> anyone you know i never gave a [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> about archery until i watched </connor>
<connor> there are a lot of it that are </connor>
<connor> interesting when you have them or you </connor>
<joey> experience them </joey>
<joey> once every four years oh yeah yeah </joey>
<joey> they're and your country's kind of in </joey>
<joey> the race right cause you've got a little </joey>
<connor> you've got </connor>
<connor> you've got a horse to root for right </connor>
<connor> yeah you know </connor>
<connor> i don't think uh archery week by week </connor>
<connor> monday night archery you know </connor>
<connor> like you know you've got to build your </connor>
<connor> little story lines you've got to build </connor>
<connor> up yeah the olympics definitely opened </connor>
<connor> my eyes to like some sports being </connor>
<connor> really fun i never [ __ ] saw him oh my </connor>
<connor> god curling and </connor>
<connor> i never thought i'd be into it but i was </connor>
<garnt> like you know what </garnt>
<joey> this this is hype as [ __ ] i don't know </joey>
<connor> why curling is like a mario party game </connor>
<connor> that actually </connor>
<joey> got turned into a realtor it's like a </joey>
<connor> mini game but like every round is </connor>
<connor> curling literally like by accident </connor>
<connor> like let's just [ __ ] make it real </connor>
<connor> yeah </connor>
<joey> that's one sport i really want to play </joey>
<joey> like try out is there like a sport that </joey>
<connor> you've never done that you want to try </connor>
<connor> uh speed ice skating looks so cool </connor>
<joey> there was um that's that's that seems so </joey>
<joey> dangerous i thought about that because </joey>
<connor> there was uh somebody watching </connor>
<connor> reached out to me on twitter and i was </connor>
<connor> like because they were verified and </connor>
<joey> they're like 1 000 followers </joey>
<connor> and they were they were on like yeah </connor>
<connor> they were a pro ice skater and like </connor>
<connor> america canada yeah yeah i love trash </connor>
<connor> taste they were on the olympic team </connor>
<connor> oh wow wow like ice skating and they </connor>
<connor> watch us i think i think </connor>
<connor> ice skating is real cool real cool </connor>
<connor> teach me i love ice skating i'd love to </connor>
<connor> like go fast and do it but i mean yeah </connor>
<connor> that's too dangerous </connor>
<garnt> yeah i slammed my face i'd have to like </garnt>
<connor> get past that mental barrier of just </connor>
<connor> like you know you know when you reach a </connor>
<garnt> certain speed and </garnt>
<garnt> especially if you're not used to it you </garnt>
<garnt> have to get past that barrier i'm just </garnt>
<garnt> like i'm going a bit </garnt>
<garnt> too fast now if i fall it's really gonna </garnt>
<connor> hurt </connor>
<connor> i want you know what olympic sport i </connor>
<connor> want to exist but will never exist it's </connor>
<joey> like you know the </joey>
<joey> when you go to like round one here and </joey>
<joey> you get the the zorb ball </joey>
<joey> it's like football where you're wearing </joey>
<joey> like this is the ball where you can </joey>
<connor> run into each other that'd be such a fun </connor>
<connor> olympic sport </connor>
<joey> people on the field [ __ ] just [ __ ] </joey>
<garnt> crazy honestly like if you ever come to </garnt>
<connor> japan come to round one because most </connor>
<connor> round one have this </connor>
<joey> you're going to see you're going to see </joey>
<connor> another sports </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah so you're gonna see it on </connor>
<garnt> screen now this is this you can easily </garnt>
<garnt> get access to this </garnt>
<garnt> um yeah they're everywhere and then a </garnt>
<garnt> lot of round ones in japan yeah they're </garnt>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> bb gun shooting yeah yeah it's </connor>
<garnt> surprisingly because </garnt>
<garnt> we i remember when we did it right in </garnt>
<garnt> the [ __ ] summer which was a </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] stupid move right right after we </joey>
<joey> had like the biggest bowl of curry </joey>
<joey> so we were like we were in the [ __ ] </joey>
<connor> sword balls just like rolling around </connor>
<joey> which is like </joey>
<connor> oh i'm going to throw up it's </connor>
<joey> surprisingly uh </joey>
<joey> it was back there we haven't been there </joey>
<joey> in so long yeah it was surprisingly </joey>
<joey> [ __ ] tiring to do that though oh yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah like </joey>
<joey> it looks it looks really light to just </joey>
<joey> run around no it's not </joey>
<joey> it is it's kind of like playing a mario </joey>
<joey> party game right because like </joey>
<connor> it feels like you're because you're </connor>
<connor> playing football but it's got this like </connor>
<connor> really janky physics engine </connor>
<connor> it's like trying to drive a car and like </connor>
<connor> cyberpunk or something like that custom </connor>
<connor> game mode </connor>
<garnt> it's like big head mode where you're </garnt>
<garnt> i love that to be a sport are you guys </garnt>
<garnt> gonna go watch any of the olympic sports </garnt>
<joey> if it happens what the [ __ ] do i apply </joey>
<joey> no well no supposedly now that like i </joey>
<joey> think it's being confirmed that </joey>
<joey> they're not going to bring any </joey>
<joey> foreigners in right so but you can go </joey>
<connor> see it at the stadium which means </connor>
<connor> there's going to be way more available </connor>
<connor> seats for the actual olympics </connor>
<connor> i kind of want to do it just because </connor>
<connor> like do you know how to get tickets </connor>
<connor> i'm going to look into it i have no idea </connor>
<connor> because like if i can find it out then </connor>
<joey> i'd want to go just to say i've been </joey>
<connor> right yeah the only time i've ever seen </connor>
<connor> tickets available the only way you could </connor>
<connor> win it was by buying something from </connor>
<connor> panasonic and you get entered into a </connor>
<connor> lottery </connor>
<connor> yeah which which of maybe you'll get the </connor>
<garnt> right to buy it yeah that's that sounds </garnt>
<garnt> like a very japanese </garnt>
<connor> japanese thing to do i don't want to buy </connor>
<connor> panasonic i want a ticket to the </connor>
<garnt> olympics </garnt>
<garnt> because this would be the second time </garnt>
<connor> that i've lived in a city </connor>
<connor> where the olympics was held because i </connor>
<connor> was there for london </connor>
<connor> you went there in london i was in wales </connor>
<garnt> at that time oh yeah so i was like yeah </garnt>
<garnt> i was living in london at the time and </garnt>
<garnt> uh </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i mean i when </garnt>
<garnt> during the normal olympics things just </garnt>
<garnt> like get super super busy </garnt>
<garnt> and i don't really like crowds that much </garnt>
<garnt> anyway </garnt>
<garnt> so go like i didn't want to go through </garnt>
<garnt> the hassle of going through it to a </garnt>
<joey> sporting event and </joey>
<joey> i don't know i i didn't care enough </joey>
<joey> about the sport </joey>
<joey> for me to want to go to this big </joey>
<joey> sporting event where i you know i just </joey>
<joey> i literally just said the olympics is </joey>
<joey> where you watch sports you normally </joey>
<joey> don't care about but </joey>
<joey> right you watch it because it's the </joey>
<joey> olympics right um </joey>
<joey> so i don't even know what sport i would </joey>
<garnt> want to watch like </garnt>
<connor> would you just </connor>
<joey> but it's like a bad game like it's a bad </joey>
<joey> matchup it's like a stomp it'll be like </joey>
<joey> america versus like </joey>
<connor> venezuela and basketball like it's like </connor>
<connor> oh i mean yeah come on obviously </connor>
<joey> venezuela is going to cry </joey>
<connor> no i feel like i don't know with those </connor>
<connor> kinds of stuff i feel it's just you go </connor>
<connor> to just enjoy the atmosphere you know </connor>
<connor> because like i remember </connor>
<joey> have you been i've never been to the </joey>
<connor> olympics but how would you know that </connor>
<joey> feels good </joey>
<joey> well because well i mean every other </joey>
<connor> sporting event i've been to </connor>
<joey> because like i remember i went to go </joey>
<connor> watch uh like but like japanese </connor>
<connor> atmosphere though in a crowd </connor>
<connor> they're not very rowdy are they yeah </connor>
<joey> that's not true </joey>
<joey> i went to go see the baseball here and </joey>
<joey> it was really really fun i mean it was a </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] game </garnt>
<joey> really what was fun about it i i i say </joey>
<joey> this </joey>
<joey> having been to a baseball game in the us </joey>
<garnt> and uh i kind of found it a bit boring </garnt>
<connor> oh really </connor>
<connor> oh okay you don't love the kiss cam gone </connor>
<joey> what </joey>
<joey> what i feel okay okay this might be </joey>
<joey> biased because i i actually quite enjoy </joey>
<garnt> watching the baseball everything but i </garnt>
<garnt> also don't enjoy cricket either </garnt>
<garnt> right now i'm just making i'm just </garnt>
<connor> making an enemy of like the us </connor>
<garnt> australia india now who where who who </garnt>
<connor> else wanted to do all the sports </connor>
<joey> they all suck well because like i </joey>
<joey> remember i went to go watch a rugby game </joey>
<connor> and it's like i'm not huge into the </connor>
<connor> rugby but </connor>
<connor> watching robbie games is fun though yeah </connor>
<garnt> yeah on the tv yeah oh i'm in person </garnt>
<garnt> yeah oh yeah well i'm like i win i went </garnt>
<connor> to go watch the rugby and it's like it </connor>
<connor> was a [ __ ] game because our team got </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] destroyed but i still had a </connor>
<connor> really fun time just because of the </connor>
<connor> atmosphere yeah everyone's wrapping up </connor>
<garnt> the crowd </garnt>
<connor> yeah yeah yeah but the baseball was the </connor>
<garnt> same thing as well like my team was </garnt>
<garnt> losing but i didn't really give a [ __ ] </garnt>
<joey> because it was just </joey>
<joey> i don't know it's just fun you know </joey>
<garnt> cause like how how we had fun was just </garnt>
<connor> getting </connor>
<connor> very very drunk </connor>
<connor> and like everyone was just very drunk </connor>
<garnt> and it was just like i don't know what </garnt>
<connor> the [ __ ] going on i'm having a good </connor>
<garnt> i'm having a good time now though </garnt>
<connor> because i'm pretty drunk another </connor>
<joey> milliliter </joey>
<joey> i was like yes i'll pay for another </joey>
<joey> eight dollar hot dog </joey>
<garnt> yeah i don't know i just i just like </garnt>
<garnt> having an active component to my sport i </garnt>
<garnt> guess i i </garnt>
<garnt> i i how can i say this i don't like when </garnt>
<garnt> sports are stop starts </garnt>
<joey> you know i i like it to be like so </joey>
<joey> you're not into like the nfl </joey>
<joey> or anything like that oh my god bro </joey>
<connor> watching nfl is hard </connor>
<joey> the amount of ads they have i'm gonna </joey>
<joey> get yeah but it's also very stop start </joey>
<garnt> heavy game right </garnt>
<garnt> but like i feel like the nfl is like i </garnt>
<garnt> can get into the end of nfl because </garnt>
<garnt> when the game is in motion that i i've </garnt>
<garnt> like </garnt>
<garnt> it's hard to find a sport as exciting as </garnt>
<garnt> the nfl </garnt>
<garnt> when everything is in motion right </garnt>
<garnt> winning over our american audience </garnt>
<garnt> like because there's so there's so many </garnt>
<garnt> things going on in such a short period </garnt>
<garnt> of time </garnt>
<garnt> whereas you know i look at something </garnt>
<garnt> like cricket or baseball </garnt>
<joey> and there's only you know there's yeah </joey>
<joey> it's very stop stop it's it's very stop </joey>
<garnt> start and </garnt>
<garnt> there's you know there's i'm gonna sound </garnt>
<garnt> like so i'm so sounds so bad it's just </garnt>
<garnt> i just see like a guy trying to hit a </garnt>
<connor> ball you know </connor>
<connor> what do you prefer american football or </connor>
<joey> rugby oh it's hard i think rugby i'd </joey>
<joey> like overall i prefer rugby but i i've </joey>
<garnt> had more exciting </garnt>
<garnt> like moments watching american football </garnt>
<garnt> um i feel then you would really </garnt>
<joey> enjoy afl what's the afl the australian </joey>
<garnt> football </garnt>
<garnt> it's it's like it's basically like nfl </garnt>
<garnt> no it's australian if we're representing </garnt>
<garnt> our own country i have to talk about afl </garnt>
<garnt> because someone's going to talk about it </garnt>
<joey> but afl is basically like it's it's like </joey>
<joey> it's australian football but think of </joey>
<joey> nfl but if it was just one continuous </joey>
<garnt> play that never stopped </garnt>
<joey> right okay that sounds pretty fun and </joey>
<garnt> it's like </garnt>
<connor> twice the field size as well okay it's </connor>
<connor> exhausting it's [ __ ] exciting </connor>
<joey> afl players are legitimate athletes like </joey>
<connor> they how do they do that in australia </connor>
<connor> as opposed to like every other sport i </connor>
<joey> think i saw something which is like in </joey>
<joey> an average </joey>
<joey> afl game a player can run upwards of </joey>
<garnt> like 20 kilometers </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] for like well for and it's and it's </garnt>
<joey> a two-hour game </joey>
<garnt> [ __ ] oh my god and a split but they </garnt>
<connor> split i bet they made that game that </connor>
<connor> long on how long </connor>
<connor> australians need to drink yeah </connor>
<connor> that's why afl games are the best to </connor>
<connor> watch at home because it's like two </connor>
<connor> hours of drinking [ __ ] it </connor>
<connor> 30 minute recess you know it's good it's </connor>
<joey> perfect yeah but i think you'd really </joey>
<joey> like if you don't like the start stop </joey>
<joey> aspect of </joey>
<garnt> nfl i think you'd really like because i </garnt>
<garnt> do i really like a lot of </garnt>
<joey> sports where like there's a lot of </joey>
<garnt> things in motion you know oh yeah love </garnt>
<joey> football love watching basketball </joey>
<connor> i when i went to canada i loved watching </connor>
<garnt> uh the hockey </garnt>
<garnt> i think i could read against you [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> fun yeah so </garnt>
<garnt> fast-paced that's that's a sport where i </garnt>
<connor> think watching that </connor>
<connor> like live would be super super fun right </connor>
<connor> yeah i'd love to watch that like the </connor>
<garnt> atmosphere just sound this looks </garnt>
<joey> super like and in the background it's </joey>
<joey> like oh this might turn into a fight </joey>
<connor> exactly right </connor>
<connor> sadly i've never lived anywhere where </connor>
<joey> it's like a popular sport </joey>
<joey> yeah sucks i want to but like every time </joey>
<joey> i when i went to canada i was like </joey>
<joey> literally like i was watching it all the </joey>
<joey> time </joey>
<joey> yeah it's so funny it's really i want to </joey>
<joey> go and watch one next time i go canada </joey>
<joey> america </joey>
<joey> but yeah i would see i said something </joey>
<joey> nice about america for once </joey>
<connor> i got an angry email that was like um </connor>
<connor> they were like the subject was </connor>
<connor> please educate yourself on america okay </connor>
<connor> you talk about america all the time but </connor>
<connor> you always get everything wrong </connor>
<connor> in our culture totally incorrect i </connor>
<connor> should find it i think i deleted it </connor>
<connor> though because i was like shut the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> up </connor>
<joey> yeah i don't wha what about uh what </joey>
<garnt> about like the sumo </garnt>
<garnt> sumo oh i cuz i really want to go watch </garnt>
<joey> the summer i think that would be fun to </joey>
<joey> watch yeah i i don't watch enough sumo </joey>
<garnt> to have an opinion or i haven't tried to </garnt>
<joey> watch enough zoomer to have an opinion </joey>
<joey> you know someone in the someone in my </joey>
<joey> twitch chat notified me that there's a </joey>
<connor> twitch channel that streams the sumo </connor>
<connor> really yeah with english commentary oh </connor>
<garnt> my god so like every now and then when </garnt>
<connor> it's on i just kind of flick it on leave </connor>
<joey> it in the background while i'm working </joey>
<connor> because i'm just like </connor>
<joey> [ __ ] like don't even have to turn my tv </joey>
<joey> on it's on twitch that's [ __ ] great </joey>
<garnt> have you ever like gotten into a sport </garnt>
<garnt> or something because of a show you </garnt>
<garnt> watched or an anime </garnt>
<garnt> or something like that because like the </garnt>
<garnt> only reason i gave the nfl a chance was </garnt>
<garnt> because of [ __ ] eye shield and i hate </garnt>
<garnt> i sound like such a weeb for saying this </garnt>
<garnt> that i'm just like </garnt>
<garnt> okay i'm gonna give an nfl i'm gonna </garnt>
<joey> give the nfl a chance </joey>
<joey> mine's even worse i got into tennis </joey>
<connor> because of prince of tennis </connor>
<connor> hey hey i got into like cycling from </connor>
<garnt> yomushi did you actually yeah </garnt>
<garnt> okay i found the email all right hey </garnt>
<garnt> khan i love the podcast but if you </garnt>
<garnt> if you could do me and the rest of </garnt>
<garnt> american fans a favor </garnt>
<garnt> could you please stop throwing </garnt>
<garnt> misconceptions around about us </garnt>
<garnt> maybe educate yourself a little bit and </garnt>
<joey> how we do things here instead of </joey>
<joey> believing the typical stereotypes </joey>
<joey> it's almost every podcast now you say </joey>
<joey> something about america that's </joey>
<joey> completely false so it only applies to </joey>
<joey> one percent of us that is </joey>
<joey> and it's just annoying like what i don't </joey>
<joey> know i wish they gave examples so i </joey>
<joey> could be like okay it's fair right now </joey>
<joey> yeah so you can </joey>
<joey> are we wrong about things most the time </joey>
<connor> mailing a lot of it </connor>
<connor> a lot of it's right a lot of it's right </connor>
<connor> apparently here's the problem with </connor>
<connor> america right </connor>
<connor> wait wait go on okay okay well there's </connor>
<connor> many problems </connor>
<connor> so right something that applies </connor>
<joey> to one state does not apply to another </joey>
<joey> because america is [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> it's so varied like meline do you not </joey>
<joey> think of like </joey>
<joey> you feel very different to other states </joey>
<joey> right like you don't feel like you have </joey>
<joey> anything in common with people from like </joey>
<joey> florida right </joey>
<joey> yeah so like someone from like i can </joey>
<connor> relate to someone </connor>
<connor> from any part of the uk and i can </connor>
<connor> understand everything i understand how </connor>
<connor> you live </connor>
<connor> everything's the same but yeah for like </connor>
<connor> someone in like california right you </connor>
<connor> can't possibly relate completely to </connor>
<connor> someone from like minnesota </connor>
<garnt> no no like it's a team totally different </garnt>
<garnt> culture a totally different vibe </garnt>
<connor> shut up maybe like there's so many </connor>
<connor> because it's so vast there's so many </connor>
<connor> different like </connor>
<connor> micro cultures and everything yeah like </connor>
<garnt> definitely like whenever i go </garnt>
<garnt> visit sydney's family in milwaukee and </garnt>
<connor> wisconsin </connor>
<connor> um it's like there's definitely a </connor>
<garnt> midwestern culture </garnt>
<connor> that's oh yeah yeah from traveling the </connor>
<connor> us </connor>
<joey> you realize like how different they all </joey>
<joey> view each other as </joey>
<joey> like americans yeah it's completely </joey>
<joey> different it's really interesting yeah </joey>
<joey> so [ __ ] you </joey>
<connor> i'm kidding i'm kidding i'm kidding he </connor>
<joey> did he did say he was a big fan of the </joey>
<garnt> foreign sorry </garnt>
<joey> yeah have you guys seen any like obscure </joey>
<joey> sport that </joey>
<garnt> you like that you've only you only know </garnt>
<garnt> about because it's been recommended on </garnt>
<garnt> youtube or something </garnt>
<garnt> but then like it actually looks pretty </garnt>
<joey> [ __ ] hype ah there was one </joey>
<joey> i forgot what it was but i think it's </joey>
<joey> like an indian sport or a </joey>
<joey> southeast asian sport where it's it's </joey>
<connor> volleyball </connor>
<connor> but you kick the ball what the [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> it's literally just think of volleyball </joey>
<joey> but like you know how vulnerable you </joey>
<joey> pass it with your hands yeah </joey>
<garnt> but instead of your hands you kick it </garnt>
<connor> it's not just football tennis </connor>
<garnt> kind of don't say that </garnt>
<joey> every sibling like players like how gay </joey>
<joey> how do you ruin the sanctity of our </joey>
<garnt> sport </garnt>
<garnt> that sounds good like have you seen </garnt>
<garnt> stuff like professional tag </garnt>
<connor> and stuff like really skill tag is </connor>
<connor> [ __ ] awesome like vox did a video </connor>
<connor> about how it came to be as well </connor>
<garnt> how do you think how did they come </garnt>
<connor> together just a guy who was like really </connor>
<joey> obsessed with the idea of making like </joey>
<joey> tag courses </joey>
<joey> just kept like building them and people </joey>
<connor> were like yeah this is pretty fun </connor>
<joey> actually you know what's one excuse what </joey>
<joey> i really enjoy watching ultimate frisbee </joey>
<garnt> yeah ultimate yeah that's a really </garnt>
<garnt> [ __ ] that's really fun well </garnt>
<joey> in the us i think it's quite popular </joey>
<joey> because like monkus brownlee right plays </joey>
<garnt> it </garnt>
<joey> oh really yeah he plays it is it an </joey>
<joey> olympic sport it's not is it no no </joey>
<joey> it's not olympic sport he mentioned it </joey>
<connor> quite a lot though in his videos and </connor>
<connor> he's shared videos of him playing it </connor>
<joey> yeah i guess outside of america it's not </joey>
<joey> really like a thing i mean i remember </joey>
<joey> we played it for like sports once for </joey>
<garnt> school and it was really fun yeah i mean </garnt>
<garnt> we played it in school as well so it was </garnt>
<garnt> definitely a thing but it was more seen </garnt>
<garnt> of just as just it sounds like the most </garnt>
<joey> college sport ever yeah </joey>
<connor> you know what i mean like i am past time </connor>
<joey> i have the luxury of being able to play </joey>
<connor> ultimately frisbee </connor>
<connor> it's the ultimate it's the ultimate that </connor>
<joey> like </joey>
<connor> yeah why why ultimately we don't have </connor>
<joey> ultimate football </joey>
<joey> yeah we do what what if they called it </joey>
<garnt> like epic frisbee </garnt>
<connor> i'd be playing it right now yeah i'd </connor>
<garnt> like to join our epic frisbee team </garnt>
<garnt> that's the kind of sports you you'd </garnt>
<joey> think you'd see on twitch or something </joey>
<joey> right </joey>
<joey> frisbee i could see the ultimate frisbee </joey>
<garnt> on twitch </garnt>
<garnt> why not that'd be [ __ ] awesome like </garnt>
<garnt> yeah i mean i feel like twitch would be </garnt>
<garnt> the perfect platform for a lot of these </garnt>
<garnt> more obscure sports like </garnt>
<garnt> professional arm wrestling as well have </garnt>
<garnt> you seen that that's like the most </garnt>
<garnt> dude bro sport i've ever seen right </garnt>
<connor> that's like the slapping slapping </connor>
<joey> yeah yeah most critical love to </joey>
<garnt> commentate on like what i love what i </garnt>
<garnt> love about watching professional uh </garnt>
<garnt> professional arm wrestling is is it is </garnt>
<garnt> that like they're </garnt>
<garnt> egging each other on to do better right </garnt>
<garnt> it's it's almost like it's almost like a </garnt>
<garnt> gym session was like </garnt>
<garnt> you got this bro no no you got this bro </garnt>
<garnt> ah </garnt>
<joey> actually you know the best one is i </joey>
<joey> decided this is the best one the best </joey>
<joey> sport you've seen on the internet three </joey>
<connor> times forget about but remember there's </connor>
<connor> badass </connor>
<connor> yeah it's the like sumo but with the </connor>
<connor> like the the </connor>
<connor> like robot wars oh yeah yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> like sumo it's a sumo ring with like </connor>
<connor> where they have like mini robots and </connor>
<connor> they have to push each other out and </connor>
<joey> it's from where the on my own machine </joey>
<connor> there is </connor>
<joey> yeah it's like the what was that show </joey>
<joey> it's in japan wars i think </joey>
<joey> no but america did a version of it </joey>
<joey> i think that clip is from a japanese </joey>
<joey> it's from the japanese one where they do </joey>
<joey> it with miniature ones because the </joey>
<connor> battle bots and robot wars in the uk </connor>
<connor> were like [ __ ] </connor>
<joey> giant yeah yeah yeah like these ones are </joey>
<connor> like tabletop well </connor>
<garnt> yeah it's something to destroy it's </garnt>
<connor> supposed to push the other thing out </connor>
<garnt> that's really cool it's really [ __ ] </garnt>
<garnt> cool there's nothing getting destroyed i </garnt>
<connor> am not </connor>
<connor> interested my man monkey brain not happy </connor>
<garnt> no destruction </garnt>
<garnt> i mean i i kind of miss robot wars i </garnt>
<garnt> don't know i don't know </garnt>
<garnt> when it got cancelled is it still a </garnt>
<garnt> thing it's probably not silly i don't </garnt>
<connor> think that's right </connor>
<connor> i don't think battle boxes are the sort </connor>
<connor> of thing either male 1 check that out </connor>
<garnt> yeah it's </garnt>
<garnt> one it's one of the few things we had </garnt>
<garnt> growing up with that made engineering </garnt>
<garnt> look cool </garnt>
<garnt> right because because it's really hard </garnt>
<garnt> to make engineering look cool </garnt>
<garnt> right but you you see you see these like </garnt>
<connor> mechanics that would be </connor>
<connor> like a really cool way to teach </connor>
<joey> engineering coding </joey>
<joey> like an all-in-one thing yeah get them </joey>
<connor> to make just a little thing [ __ ] move </connor>
<connor> around a little bit like why not teach </connor>
<joey> this </joey>
<joey> the one thing i loved about uh </joey>
<joey> battlebots though was just like </joey>
<joey> just just the fluctuation between like </joey>
<joey> the different people </joey>
<joey> that who clearly had completely </joey>
<joey> different skills in engineering like one </joey>
<joey> robot was like </joey>
<joey> this robot is an automated arm that can </joey>
<joey> you know grab and pick up robots </joey>
<joey> and then there's another dude's like the </joey>
<connor> challenger comes in it's like i </connor>
<connor> attached 60 knives onto this point and </connor>
<joey> the only function he can do is go </joey>
<connor> forwards and backwards saw on wheels </connor>
<joey> yeah that's literally it like it's so </joey>
<garnt> funny </garnt>
<garnt> and you see like some like piddly robots </garnt>
<garnt> that had like the most </garnt>
<garnt> depressing flipper of all time i </garnt>
<joey> couldn't even flip my grandma </joey>
<joey> and then it goes up against like [ __ ] </joey>
<garnt> hypno disc or something it just gets </garnt>
<joey> absolutely destroyed half of them like </joey>
<connor> don't even move like </connor>
<garnt> in practice so it's just like it's just </garnt>
<joey> the door stopper on wheels </joey>
<connor> and then like i don't know if battlebots </connor>
<connor> had this but the uk one had this where </connor>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> the the show runners had their own like </connor>
<connor> ops </connor>
<connor> robots oh yeah yeah that would just like </connor>
<connor> when the nothing was happening </connor>
<connor> they'd be like send out charles or </connor>
<connor> something like that sir kill a lot yeah </connor>
<connor> and they're like </connor>
<connor> this just [ __ ] massive clearly like </connor>
<joey> absolutely god to your engineering world </joey>
<joey> created </joey>
<connor> coming back </connor>
<garnt> i'm just getting reminded of all like </garnt>
<garnt> these old television shows i used to </garnt>
<garnt> watch as a kid now </garnt>
<garnt> remember gladiators was that was that </garnt>
<garnt> part of that's very </garnt>
<joey> very old that's very very that's like </joey>
<connor> 90. that sounds really familiar what is </connor>
<garnt> that </garnt>
<garnt> it's basically like very much inspired </garnt>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> the whole like kind of sporty-esque like </connor>
<connor> really intense </connor>
<garnt> physical sport yeah it's it's it was </garnt>
<garnt> kind of like instead of </garnt>
<garnt> like instead of like uh what what's </garnt>
<connor> what are like the shows that like four </connor>
<connor> guys and stuff is based around </connor>
<connor> wipeout wipe out so instead of like </connor>
<connor> going against an obstacle course you'd </connor>
<connor> have an obstacle course </connor>
<joey> but then you'd be competing against a </joey>
<joey> gladiator which was like this kind of </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> really fit muscular person and it that </joey>
<joey> would have there would be this </joey>
<joey> competitive element where you'd have to </joey>
<connor> beat </connor>
<garnt> like beat this person like this yeah on </garnt>
<garnt> on this obstacle course or something </garnt>
<connor> like that </connor>
<connor> or you'd have to just like literally </connor>
<connor> fight them yeah </connor>
<joey> that's the final turtle basically you </joey>
<garnt> get to the end he's just standing there </garnt>
<joey> i mean i the best way i can describe it </joey>
<garnt> it's basically something very </garnt>
<garnt> it's like wipeouts with uh with </garnt>
<joey> wrestling basically </joey>
<joey> anyway so it's like so it's like real </joey>
<joey> time like you're fighting </joey>
<joey> like or not fighting but like with the </joey>
<connor> glasses there's like one i think there's </connor>
<connor> one event in it where like you both had </connor>
<connor> like the </connor>
<connor> those like long poles with like cushions </connor>
<connor> on the end </connor>
<connor> and </connor>
<garnt> the platform yeah i remember that i mean </garnt>
<connor> i know that sure is old because then </connor>
<connor> like i think when i was watching that </connor>
<joey> like very early 2000s everyone's wearing </joey>
<joey> like latex and spandex and i'm like oh </joey>
<joey> yeah i'm pretty sure all that's just </joey>
<joey> taken from takeshi's castle right </joey>
<joey> yeah what's the other one the japanese </joey>
<joey> one's called like uh i think it was it's </joey>
<joey> called like um </joey>
<joey> ultimate banzuki or something oh yeah </joey>
<joey> yeah i think well like literally they </joey>
<joey> will do so this is this show is so fun </joey>
<joey> you should watch clips on youtube it's </joey>
<joey> really [ __ ] cool so what they would </joey>
<joey> do is right is that they would have like </joey>
<joey> someone either they would be a generic </joey>
<joey> thing or they'd have an expert so they'd </joey>
<joey> bring on like </joey>
<joey> 10 expert pogo people and they would </joey>
<joey> build like a [ __ ] impossible </joey>
<joey> pogo obstacle course right and they </joey>
<joey> would have to do it and like the [ __ ] </joey>
<joey> they would do is insane </joey>
<joey> yeah and it was always it wasn't just </joey>
<joey> general people it's like no they get </joey>
<joey> professionals </joey>
<joey> and there'd be people who like they'd </joey>
<joey> have to be um they'd bring people who </joey>
<joey> are professionals </joey>
<joey> like handstands yeah and i'd have to do </joey>
<joey> a whole course </joey>
<joey> handstand walking around like going </joey>
<joey> upstairs going on wobble yeah i've </joey>
<joey> definitely seen it like </joey>
<joey> it's really [ __ ] cool you should </joey>
<joey> watch this just type it in i think it's </joey>
<joey> i have to oh </joey>
<joey> my goodness i think it's cool something </joey>
<joey> like that yeah </joey>
<joey> and like the stuff they'd have to do was </joey>
<joey> crazy like they had that um </joey>
<connor> you know that mario party game where you </connor>
<connor> have to like there's like seven things </connor>
<connor> stacked like have a hammer and hit it oh </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> they did a game where two people had to </connor>
<connor> do that i need to like get it they just </connor>
<joey> hit them all </joey>
<joey> out right but obviously when they hit it </joey>
<connor> yeah they would like tip the thing over </connor>
<joey> yeah it was really cool </joey>
<connor> that's based off like a traditional </connor>
<connor> japanese like toy yeah </connor>
<garnt> yeah yeah yeah yeah it's really cool </garnt>
<connor> what's like the best concept of the </connor>
<garnt> like like a like reality tv program that </garnt>
<connor> you've seen </connor>
<connor> like physical like game show challenge </connor>
<garnt> anything like ninja warrior </garnt>
<garnt> like the original the japanese original </garnt>
<garnt> sasuke yeah yeah that's really good </garnt>
<garnt> there's this really old uh reality tv </garnt>
<garnt> show that channel 4 made </garnt>
<garnt> i can't remember the name because it was </garnt>
<garnt> like a one-off series right but i always </garnt>
<garnt> remember it because </garnt>
<garnt> i thought the concept was genius because </garnt>
<garnt> what they did </garnt>
<garnt> is this was this was way back when when </garnt>
<garnt> big brother was like a massive thing </garnt>
<garnt> but the twist was they took they took </garnt>
<garnt> these group of people right </garnt>
<garnt> um that uh weren't exactly the brightest </garnt>
<garnt> brightest bunch of people but you know </garnt>
<garnt> wanted to be on a reality tv show </garnt>
<garnt> and they would basically they basically </garnt>
<garnt> convinced them that they were going to </garnt>
<garnt> go to space </garnt>
<joey> right oh i think i remember this so what </joey>
<joey> so what happens is they they literally </joey>
<joey> go </joey>
<joey> they literally like take them astronaut </joey>
<joey> training right right </joey>
<joey> and make them go through all the </joey>
<joey> training but also feed them like a bit </joey>
<joey> of fake information right </joey>
<joey> because they had they had this real mock </joey>
<joey> spaceship </joey>
<joey> um and they taught them that you know we </joey>
<joey> we we're using new technology where </joey>
<joey> it doesn't require rockets it's kind of </joey>
<joey> like an airplane where like slowly </joey>
<joey> circles up to the earth's atmosphere </joey>
<joey> these guys would believe it right and </joey>
<joey> they thought they thought they were like </joey>
<joey> being trained in russia </joey>
<joey> what's the name of the show i can't </joey>
<joey> remember i'm gonna have to look it up </joey>
<joey> because </joey>
<joey> it was a genius show um and like at any </joey>
<joey> point </joey>
<joey> if like at any point one of them could </joey>
<joey> have found out right because they were </joey>
<joey> they were </joey>
<joey> um the t the producers said you know </joey>
<joey> you're gonna be trained in russia </joey>
<joey> it's not gonna be in england and what </joey>
<joey> happened is they just took them on a </joey>
<joey> plane and just like </joey>
<joey> circled round and just landed in a </joey>
<joey> landed in like a abandoned airfield in </joey>
<joey> surrey or something like that </joey>
<joey> so they were just like in the middle of </joey>
<joey> england they were thinking they were </joey>
<joey> going to space </joey>
<joey> and they actually took some of these </joey>
<joey> people and just </joey>
<joey> uh have you ever been on like one of </joey>
<joey> those fake roller coaster rides </joey>
<joey> where where where it's like it's kind of </joey>
<joey> like the 4d ones yeah like the 4d ones </joey>
<joey> where where you know you just </joey>
<garnt> you just you just kind of like have this </garnt>
<garnt> spaceship that just kind of turns </garnt>
<garnt> out it's cool yeah it's called space </garnt>
<connor> cadets </connor>
<connor> yeah it aired in 2005 on channel 4. yeah </connor>
<joey> yeah channel 4 normally does all the </joey>
<connor> really bizarre </connor>
<garnt> really unique game shows yeah okay if if </garnt>
<garnt> if you got like </garnt>
<garnt> if you got some time you want to kill </garnt>
<garnt> that's honestly it was such a good </garnt>
<garnt> concept and it was a one-off as well </garnt>
<garnt> one off season um it was just hilarious </garnt>
<garnt> it was [ __ ] hilarious </garnt>
<connor> highly recommend it yeah the first thing </connor>
<connor> that comes up when you google it is like </connor>
<connor> controversies </connor>
<joey> that's been quite controversial i guess </joey>
<joey> so but i want to watch that now </joey>
<joey> yeah that sounds really funny yeah that </joey>
<garnt> was like this did the uk has some really </garnt>
<garnt> unique game shows </garnt>
<garnt> basically there's a game show in the uk </garnt>
<garnt> um i think it was literally called </garnt>
<garnt> hunted </garnt>
<garnt> and they would have like i think six </garnt>
<connor> pairs </connor>
<connor> or ten pairs something around that and </connor>
<connor> basically what they would do is they </connor>
<connor> were like </connor>
<connor> all right you have like one day and then </connor>
<connor> we're gonna start trying to </connor>
<connor> like track you if you're a fugitive all </connor>
<connor> right so like any of your if you use </connor>
<connor> your phone </connor>
<connor> if you use your phone if you do anything </connor>
<joey> you make calls you go to places like </joey>
<joey> they'll find you </joey>
<joey> and so some people were really good at </joey>
<joey> it and some people were terrible at it </joey>
<joey> and like yeah and then they had to </joey>
<joey> survive </joey>
<joey> two weeks yeah two weeks later two weeks </joey>
<joey> and then go to a </joey>
<joey> location to get like a plane to like to </joey>
<joey> escape </joey>
<joey> right right and uh yeah what one one </joey>
<joey> team did win </joey>
<joey> that sounds really fun it was really </joey>
<joey> cool it was really it was really popular </joey>
<joey> the first season and the second season </joey>
<connor> i think was a bit [ __ ] yeah and </connor>
<joey> didn't do too well yeah </joey>
<joey> i feel that's a concept like at first </joey>
<joey> that would be like wow that's cool but </joey>
<joey> then i feel it get </joey>
<joey> old quite fast yeah because there's so </joey>
<garnt> much there's only so much you can do </garnt>
<garnt> once you know the formula and once you </garnt>
<connor> know the secrets like just something </connor>
<connor> like the the </connor>
<joey> logistics behind that must have been </joey>
<joey> like crazy </joey>
<joey> yeah like i wonder how much of that was </joey>
<joey> faked though as well because </joey>
<joey> you surely can't have access to all the </joey>
<connor> like </connor>
<connor> the police forces like yeah credibility </connor>
<connor> right because it's just a waste of </connor>
<connor> police time and services right that's </connor>
<connor> just a lot of government </connor>
<connor> hold on wait we gotta find the fake one </connor>
<connor> you know what i mean </connor>
<connor> i wonder but in a concept really cool </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah </connor>
<garnt> was that on channel four as well that </garnt>
<garnt> was on channel four as well channel four </garnt>
<garnt> makes some good like one-off reality i'm </garnt>
<connor> surprised i've never heard of any of </connor>
<joey> these </joey>
<garnt> yeah channel 4 makes really good tv </garnt>
<garnt> shows in general yeah like some of my </garnt>
<garnt> favorite are definitely like some of the </garnt>
<garnt> darren brown specials i don't know how </garnt>
<garnt> famous darren brown </garnt>
<garnt> is outside of the uk right now i'm </garnt>
<connor> probably not so much i've never heard </connor>
<connor> darren brown oh my god </connor>
<connor> some of the [ __ ] this man did was crazy </connor>
<connor> oh my so his favorite thing that he's </connor>
<connor> ever done so dan brown is a magician </connor>
<garnt> from the uk </garnt>
<garnt> he's he's he's a magician that </garnt>
<joey> himself but he's more like a mental </joey>
<joey> magician mentalist </joey>
<joey> i'm not even like it's [ __ ] i'm </joey>
<garnt> talking about the word mentalist this </garnt>
<connor> makes this makes it sound fake </connor>
<connor> this man is just one of a kind yeah yes </connor>
<garnt> man he's like he's </garnt>
<garnt> he's a showman he says like everything i </garnt>
<garnt> do is like there's </garnt>
<garnt> it's it's like not so much that it's </garnt>
<garnt> fake but like it's </garnt>
<garnt> there is like magic involved he doesn't </garnt>
<garnt> claim to be have special powers or </garnt>
<garnt> something like that he just claims to </garnt>
<garnt> understand psychology </garnt>
<connor> and plays on that right yeah so there's </connor>
<connor> this one tv show that he did and it is </connor>
<connor> literally my favorite and it's so </connor>
<connor> big brain this whole thing so i i'll </connor>
<connor> spoil the end of it so i'll warn you i'm </connor>
<connor> gonna do that but i'll spoil it for you </connor>
<joey> because it's but </joey>
<connor> it's still cool either way if you watch </connor>
<joey> it so what happens is this tv show </joey>
<joey> starts and you're following this </joey>
<joey> perspective this one woman and i know </joey>
<joey> this one </joey>
<joey> so basically what happens is that um so </joey>
<connor> the show is is that he </connor>
<connor> basically he knows which horse is going </connor>
<garnt> to win in these horse races </garnt>
<garnt> right so the exact name of the special </garnt>
<garnt> is called the system </garnt>
<garnt> so the way he markets it is that he has </garnt>
<garnt> a system </garnt>
<garnt> that can 100 predict which horse is </garnt>
<connor> going to win in a horse race </connor>
<connor> and so it's like this this middle-aged </connor>
<connor> woman and you know we follow her </connor>
<connor> he calls her up he's like listen bet on </connor>
<connor> this horse go now so she goes and she </connor>
<connor> bets on it and the cameras are following </connor>
<joey> her </joey>
<joey> she bets on it she wins right it's like </joey>
<joey> oh [ __ ] okay </joey>
<joey> and then he rings her up again he's like </joey>
<joey> right now put all of your money </joey>
<joey> on this horse now then like then a week </joey>
<joey> later yeah and she puts </joey>
<joey> she puts all the money on it she wins </joey>
<joey> again right it's like what the [ __ ] is </joey>
<joey> how is he doing this </joey>
<joey> yeah this is legit like whole like this </joey>
<joey> is a fully legitimate yeah </joey>
<joey> it's like a public gambling that anyone </joey>
<joey> can battle right </joey>
<joey> it's a real horse yeah he gives him the </joey>
<joey> money doesn't he he gives them a </joey>
<connor> thousand pounds right </connor>
<garnt> i think i can't remember it's been a </garnt>
<garnt> while but i i do </garnt>
<garnt> no i don't think he gives him any money </garnt>
<connor> does he know well so anyway </connor>
<connor> she wins and it happens again and he's </connor>
<connor> like all right now bet again </connor>
<connor> all the money on this horse she does it </connor>
<connor> again and she wins </connor>
<connor> right and i think it's one more time </connor>
<connor> he's like all right now this is the </connor>
<connor> final one bet all of your money on this </connor>
<connor> again and </connor>
<connor> she wins and you're like what the [ __ ] </connor>
<connor> is going on yeah he's literally guessing </connor>
<connor> and then he reveals right and as the </connor>
<connor> episode ends that like he's literally </connor>
<connor> done </connor>
<connor> like a tournament bracket of like every </connor>
<connor> single race there's nine horses </connor>
<connor> so every single race he's literally </connor>
<connor> found nine people </connor>
<connor> and told them to bet on the different </connor>
<connor> horses he's literally gone through and </connor>
<connor> done like a giant like hundreds of </connor>
<garnt> races so it's like a pyramid so like at </garnt>
<garnt> the beginning he started </garnt>
<garnt> like thousands of thousands of </garnt>
<garnt> contestants and he said </garnt>
<garnt> you know um i i you know he didn't </garnt>
<garnt> reveal who his identity was he was just </garnt>
<garnt> like an </garnt>
<garnt> anonymous tip and so you know </garnt>
<garnt> part of like a certain amount people won </garnt>
<garnt> they got eliminated </garnt>
<garnt> he gave him a refund and then he went up </garnt>
<garnt> to the next bracket and then he kept </garnt>
<garnt> he basically kept enough of a group of </garnt>
<garnt> people to make sure there was </garnt>
<connor> at least one point and it's so simple </connor>
<connor> yeah so cool but when you're following </connor>
<connor> this story and her perspective it seems </connor>
<garnt> like like literal magic yeah yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> because all he was trying the message he </garnt>
<garnt> was trying to say was </garnt>
<garnt> like don't forget about perspective just </garnt>
<joey> because you are winning doesn't mean </joey>
<joey> that </joey>
<joey> like doesn't mean like there's a magical </joey>
<garnt> system or something like that </garnt>
<joey> it's it's what to do with probability </joey>
<joey> that sounds right up my alley dude </joey>
<connor> he's literally a [ __ ] junior yeah his </connor>
<connor> shows are amazing and like he did one </connor>
<connor> where </connor>
<garnt> he's done so many questions like i think </garnt>
<garnt> one of my favorite ones is like the ones </garnt>
<garnt> where </garnt>
<garnt> he actually he actually fakes a zombie </garnt>
<garnt> apocalypse </garnt>
<joey> right oh that sounds familiar yeah i </joey>
<garnt> might have seen that yeah yeah </garnt>
<garnt> so basically he takes us he takes this </garnt>
<garnt> one guy right </garnt>
<garnt> um so how he gets people on the special </garnt>
<joey> is that people apply to be on his </joey>
<joey> specials right </joey>
<joey> right but he doesn't tell anyone that </joey>
<connor> they know they he doesn't tell anyone </connor>
<joey> that they've succeeded right so </joey>
<connor> he gets thousands and thousands of </connor>
<connor> applicants and he chooses one out one </connor>
<connor> out of everyone </connor>
<connor> so he takes this guy and he puts he </connor>
<joey> basically </joey>
<joey> um hypnotizes him so he like passes out </joey>
<joey> and he wakes up </joey>
<joey> in this like abandoned hospitals all </joey>
<joey> right </joey>
<joey> and you know it's it's basically just </joey>
<garnt> this guy </garnt>
<garnt> going through a zombie apocalypse except </garnt>
<connor> the truman show right because they get </connor>
<garnt> everyone around him </garnt>
<garnt> to act right as if there's a zombie </garnt>
<joey> apocalypse yeah yeah so this guy </joey>
<connor> literally believes that there's like a </connor>
<garnt> zombie apocalypse i think this is on i </garnt>
<garnt> think this is on netflix as well so you </garnt>
<connor> can actually watch this on there </connor>
<connor> there's another one where he sees if he </connor>
<connor> can convince someone to commit murder </connor>
<connor> jesus like fake murder right he sets up </connor>
<connor> the situation </connor>
<connor> that one's not as good as the other ones </connor>
<connor> but like they all vary in quality but </connor>
<connor> you're definitely gonna have an </connor>
<connor> experience like you definitely can't </connor>
<garnt> find anything like it </garnt>
<connor> what's the name of the show again just </connor>
<garnt> type in darren brown daryl darren darren </garnt>
<garnt> darren brown but he's he's done a lot of </garnt>
<connor> stuff </connor>
<connor> live shows are really popular as well </connor>
<garnt> i've been to his live shows actually oh </garnt>
<garnt> really it's really it's really good </garnt>
<connor> there's like a lot of psychology things </connor>
<joey> he basically like manipulates like </joey>
<joey> perception </joey>
<joey> yeah yeah yeah yeah it's really just </joey>
<garnt> interesting stuff yeah </garnt>
<garnt> it gives you a lot of perspective and </garnt>
<garnt> you know he he goes in saying you know </garnt>
<garnt> no </garnt>
<garnt> all of this is just magic you know like </garnt>

<joey> you can eat if you eat this then you go </joey>
<joey> on to the next round and if you survive </joey>
<joey> the entire round you get a prize money </joey>
<joey> or something like that right but like </joey>
<joey> the the food or what you have to do is </joey>
<joey> like usually considered </joey>
<joey> gross according to americans right at </joey>
<connor> least and like vegetables </connor>
<connor> that kid who's just like all a vein </connor>
<connor> popping out it's like corner when he has </connor>

<connor> [ __ ] and take your [ __ ] </connor>
<garnt> we all get mocked okay 2021 um but yeah </garnt>
<connor> fair factor </connor>
<connor> yeah anyway like spinach </connor>
<joey> with a [ __ ] celery </joey>
<connor> celery without hummus </connor>
<connor> i'm so [ __ ] americans i don't </connor>
<connor> actually believe this i'm joking this is </connor>
<joey> a joke this is a bit eat the celery or </joey>
<joey> take the hummus and go home </joey>
<joey> no but basically it's like it's like you </joey>
<joey> have to do something gross or eat </joey>
<joey> something gross and if you decide to do </joey>
<joey> it then you move on to the next round if </joey>
<joey> you don't decide to do it </joey>
<joey> then you get kicked off and basically </joey>
<joey> each step it just gets worse and worse </joey>
<connor> and worse i don't know i might be </connor>
<joey> talking about </joey>
<connor> this this is how i remember yeah and </connor>
<connor> then what's wrong with us one of the </connor>
<connor> watch people do </connor>
<garnt> [ __ ] stupid [ __ ] like this i don't </garnt>
<connor> know </connor>
<connor> it's entertaining actually i don't know </connor>
<connor> the flashback to another darren brown </connor>
<connor> special </connor>
<connor> okay he did another special as well </connor>
<joey> which is great where the audience get to </joey>
<joey> choose whether something bad happened to </joey>
<joey> the guy or something good happened to </joey>
<joey> the guy </joey>
<joey> right so they would follow a guy in his </joey>
<connor> daily life he obviously said yeah yeah </connor>
<connor> yeah yeah </connor>
<joey> and literally the audience every single </joey>
<connor> time chose bad things </connor>
<joey> and like one of them was like almost </joey>
<connor> like his family gets christmas presents </connor>
<connor> early </connor>
<connor> or he gets [ __ ] kidnapped and he </connor>
<connor> literally got kidnapped because the </connor>
<connor> audience wanted to see him get kidnapped </connor>
<connor> we're [ __ ] up we are [ __ ] up do you </connor>
<garnt> know what the most [ __ ] up thing about </garnt>
<garnt> that special was </garnt>
<garnt> so it so it the the special basically </garnt>
<garnt> ends right </garnt>
<garnt> with you know the audience shows a bad </garnt>
<garnt> thing happening like he got kidnapped or </garnt>
<joey> something </joey>
<joey> and then i think as they were trying to </joey>
<joey> kidnap him um </joey>
<joey> he got into a car crash now the car </joey>
<joey> crashed the car crash was staged the </joey>
<joey> audience didn't know this right </joey>
<joey> the car crash was stopped and so the </joey>
<joey> audience seemed hit by a car </joey>
<joey> and then it's they just like this </joey>
<connor> unplanned thing darren brown just walks </connor>
<connor> off </connor>
<connor> and then you're just you're just left </connor>
<joey> seeing like the audience kind of like </joey>
<connor> [ __ ] like what's </connor>
<joey> one of the audience members going like </joey>
<connor> uh excuse me you're not being funny but </connor>
<connor> like this like it's not our fault yeah </connor>
<connor> hey no </connor>
<connor> i can't remember exactly what she says </connor>
<connor> but she's like excuse me this ain't this </connor>
<connor> isn't funny </connor>
<connor> like can you tell us what's going on </connor>
<connor> like why would you make him go through </connor>
<joey> this </joey>
<joey> and it's it's like the lack of </joey>
<joey> self-awareness and self-irony that you </joey>
<joey> literally came on a tv show </joey>
<joey> and he kept voting for bad things to </joey>
<joey> happen and then something bad thing </joey>
<garnt> happened that wasn't scripted but </garnt>
<garnt> because it wasn't scripted suddenly it's </garnt>
<connor> a serious matter right </connor>
<connor> right yeah it was like really </connor>
<connor> interesting because it was basically </connor>
<joey> just like you as the audience does not </joey>
<joey> care about who is on screen </joey>
<joey> right you just want to see bad things </joey>
<joey> happen you know these are people </joey>
<joey> it's really good because you know it's </joey>
<joey> staged well because this is what you </joey>
<connor> think right you think it's all fake or </connor>
<garnt> like or you don't care </garnt>
<garnt> it was it was a message about like an </garnt>
<joey> anonymity within like crowds i don't </joey>
<joey> what's the word i'm looking for </joey>
<joey> like the hive mind yeah like the hive </joey>
<joey> mindset right where if you have </joey>
<joey> anonymity you </joey>
<connor> responsibility is kind of like taking </connor>
<joey> off you and you're willing to do </joey>
<joey> like you want to do things that you </joey>
<garnt> might not do if you know you were the </garnt>
<joey> one responsible </joey>
<joey> i'm pretty sure i saw like at least four </joey>
<joey> like </joey>
<joey> black mirror episodes though i like that </joey>
<connor> yeah it's yeah </connor>
<connor> i mean but black mirror sucks now yeah </connor>
<connor> oh my god it sucks so much </connor>
<connor> i went downhill real fast yeah yeah yeah </connor>
<garnt> is there anything else you guys want to </garnt>
<connor> bring up or </connor>
