<SPEAKER_02> - When I landed in San
Francisco, I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Fuck, this air sucks." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm breathing it in, I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh my God, the pollution." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - How can you tell the pollution levels? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, when you breathe in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> When I land in the fucking
country, I step off the plane, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I take a deep breath. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, "This air's shit." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Why is this insane? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It literally sounds like
the stupidest superpower. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (gentle upbeat music) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Gentlemen, I have the
intro for this, all right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Gentlemen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What if I told you, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you could get anime for free? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> For free, gentlemen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wait, are we fucking
jumping right into it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because that's gonna be
the first topic for today, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but right now, I have with
me the boys, Garnt and Joey, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I am monkey-brain Connor.
- You didn't even say hello. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> You just fucking opened
up with this like-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's what every good
sales pitch does, bro. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Illuminati conspiracy theory. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Every good sales pitch
starts with the hook. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Literally reminded me of
that Wolf of Wall Street, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like, "Sell me this pen." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because now, they're
listening, they're intrigued. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "How can we get free anime?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - What a hook, what a hook. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - They don't wanna know
about "Trash Taste." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They wanna know how they get free anime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Did you just do the OG... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt stammers) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Did you just... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh my God. I can't fucking talk today. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, he did, he did. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - A natural salesman never
stumbles on his words. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I said free anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I wasn't stumbling. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Tell me more, salesman,
who's totally not shady. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, if you just go
to the Kickstarter page. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, we're gonna talk about that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We're gonna talk about that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Anime Tube, is that what
it's called, Anime Tube? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Anime Tube.
- Well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's the first topic for today. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Two weeks ago, we wanted to
talk about this last week, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but Chris came on,
inconvenienced us again. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We would have spoken about this last week </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause we wanted to
talk about Anime Tube. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - We know Chris goes into
fits when we talk about anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So we got, so we're gonna
be like three weeks late, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but the whole debacle
is kind of finished now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - We have all the info.
- Well, it like, lived </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and died within the
span of a day, I think. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Yes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Pretty much. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was very interesting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Essentially what happened is
this thing called Anime Tube </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> popped up on Kickstarter </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and offered to give all
the kind, anyone, really-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Group] Free anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Free anime? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And you're probably thinking, "Well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> they probably only got like,
you know, C-rate shows, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, really terrible. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - What do they have? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They said they were going to, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they were in talks to get Evangelion, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey gasps) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Love Hina, which has been
stuck in copyright Hell, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not copyright, licensing Hell. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Specifically Love Hina. I dunno. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I dunno who just put
specifically picks Love Hina </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to be on the list, but.
- Death Note, Attack on Titan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Full Metal Alchemist.
- Demon Slayer. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Full Metal Alchemist. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Even though these were already all on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> streaming platforms already, you know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I imagine that-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And the ones that aren't
have been out of print </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for the past 20 years.
- They say Re:Zero as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Ugh, I didn't, I didn't see the list. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - They've got everything. It's Anime Tube. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know? I mean, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and so I can't, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know how much
these properties are worth, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but I can't imagine you getting
Evangelion for less than </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a hundred million
or something ridiculous. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It sounds absurd, but it's
probably worth that much, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> So clearly these guys have
big bucks to spend around. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, I'm just glad
a company is giving </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the power back to the people
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and taking on small indie
companies like Sony. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Fuck license holders, man! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Taking on small indie
companies like Sony and AT&T. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, someone's gotta
take these indie companies </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> out of the field.
- What were they gonna do? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> What were they gonna do with it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So essentially this
Kickstarter promised that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and it raised in one day like $110,000. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Which is absurd.
- It literally came out of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> nowhere because I remember we were, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we literally came in the Trash
Taste studio in the morning </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then it was just all
over my Twitter timeline. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, what the hell is going on? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> And we all looked at it
and we were just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> wait, this Kickstarter launched yesterday. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's raised over a
hundred thousand dollars, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> promising people free anime legally. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what is going on right now? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> It was an absolute disaster. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - April was about three months ago, guys. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You're a bit late to the joke right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. It was just a mess. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was hilarious, dude. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was a mess. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think it's so many levels to it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's so many things that
are really sad about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> One, you know, I think
it's safe to say that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> this was either the most
overambitious Kickstarter </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of all time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was, they were lying. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Or the most genius scam. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, yeah, I mean, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you have to be careful
when you say these gabs, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can get sued. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So try not to get Trash
Taste sued here, Joey. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But from what I saw, yeah, it's a scam. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's a scam. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, I'm protecting myself. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm not going to say the S word, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> but I'm going to say
that it looked very sus. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll say the other S word. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Little sussy scam. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's a sussy baka is what it is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know, I genuinely wonder because, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, again, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> they promised to have all
these titles that there's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> absolutely, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not even Netflix or Amazon
can get all of these shows, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is some serious amount of cash </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and negotiating power, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that I doubt a Kickstarter
would be able to convince </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the Japanese investors.
- If Netflix and Sony </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> can't even get the
rights to some of these, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what suggests to anyone that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> this Kickstarter group will be able to? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Evangelion literally couldn't be-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Evangelion's been out of
print for the past 20 years. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You couldn't get the license for it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> until Netflix somehow managed, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> probably don't even want to know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how much Netflix played for that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Anno, the creator, didn't
even have the rights to it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for the longest time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> until he had to fucking fight
with Gainax to get it back. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's insanity. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. I mean, the thing is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think there's, as you said, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's so many layers
to it because, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> in theory, it's a nice idea. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> having somewhere where you
can watch anime legally. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Truly a utopian society. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - In this utopian world-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - One part of me feels bad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause we're like laughing at the, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> imagine trying to take on the
big guy "ha ha ha, funny." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> But if it was a good
attempt, I would be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "Go for it, go for it!" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - If it was a good attempt. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> But keep in mind you're
taking on companies </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like Sony, like Netflix, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, like people who, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have a bit of dollar in
their pocket, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just a bit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't think we're trying to be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah, we love corporations
and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like a lot of this was driven by, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, the people's
hatred towards corporations </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you know, I get it, you know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If you don't want to
support the big corporations </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because of whatever
reason, you know, I get it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> There's a difference between </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not wanting to support big corporations </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then supporting whatever this is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (Connor laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Blindly accepting
anything that you want. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like not wanting to buy paracetamol </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from your pharmacy, so you
go to the local drug dealer. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I guess so, in some sense. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like bidding in a horse race, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but the horse has two legs. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's why I felt so, kind
of, just sad about it, really. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I felt sad that there was
enough weebs out there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that were this desperate to
stick it to the companies </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that they would throw
their money into a void. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Dude, weebs want free shit, man, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> at the end of the day.
- That's the thing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> this is also what I don't understand, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> is that we have weebs
that are this dedicated </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to say fuck you to companies </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that they're willing to give money away. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But you could, they could just pirate it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> if they really want to
really get it for free. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not saying you should. I
condone that, do not do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you're gonna </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (Connor blubbers) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, it's also like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> with the money that they
gave to this Kickstarter, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because there were a lot
of people who were giving </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hundreds of dollars to this Kickstarter. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And some people I saw
were giving literally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thousands of dollars to this Kickstarter. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - When I looked, there
was a thousand backers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> giving a hundred thousand, so. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Rough, on average, a
hundred dollars each, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - They're giving a lot of money to this-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's like a year's
subscription to Netflix </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or Crunchyroll or any of them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's not about the money, Joey! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It's about the message I'm sending. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's about sending a
message, the message of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I got scammed." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, it's the, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's the thing is where, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> if anyone just literally
used a single brain cell, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to think about the logistics of this-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The logistics! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just the logistics of
why this would not work </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the first place or, you know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> A hundred thousand seems like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a lot of money to any normal person. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like a drop in the fucking bucket </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for anime licensing
fees and all that stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - You can maybe license-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Half an episode. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, no, not even that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You can maybe license the thumbnail. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Half an episode of like a C-tier anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Pretty much, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What surprised me is that they were, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the shows that they were listing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> as the shows they were going for, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> were like the fucking triple A titles </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that are worth millions and
millions of dollars, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, God knows how
much Netflix actually paid </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to get Evangelion out of licensing hell. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause Evangelion was out of like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> couldn't be licensed by any
Western company for like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> feels like a decade or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Literally since it was made. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Since ADV collapsed, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't think of any other </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> company that has successfully
licensed Evangelion. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I think people
like to think of anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as still this kind of underground thing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but some of these shows
are easily, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> worth over hundreds of
millions of dollars. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Just think of the merchandising
of these shows as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The IP is so expensive. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Think about the mega shows, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> any of the Shonen Jump shows like My Hero. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How much is Attack on Titan worth? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Fucking Demon Slayer. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, I mean, Demon Slayer
is a billion dollar property. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, exactly! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's already proven to be that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's really, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just, I don't understand. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Like every, none of this, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who were these thousands
of people who gave money? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I legitimately want to know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I legitimately want to know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's obviously very young,
impressionable anime fans, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> right, who were just hoping
for this utopian society? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I wonder if some parts of it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we're just completely oblivious about, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> whether we take for granted some of them, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause we, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, we work with Japanese companies. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We know how these things are. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You can't go around
saying you're in talks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that is like the biggest
no-no in business. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And especially here, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel like it's never a done deal </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> until it's done deal in Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Did you read the FAQ? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What was the, what did they say? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I've read some of it. What was the, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> do you remember the thing
about licensing or something? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I remember one of the FAQ's, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> one of the questions was, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> "Isn't anime licensing really expensive?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And they legit went, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Actually, anime licensing
isn't as expensive </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as everyone makes it out to be. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The only reason nobody does it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and nobody talks about
it is because of NDAs. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But we are in talks with
real Japanese anime licenses. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And that was pretty much, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that was pretty much the
answer to the question, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Can they get anime licenses?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - They literally just shot
themselves in the foot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> They didn't have to answer that question. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - You can't say you're
talking to these companies. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's all very secretive,
you know, intentionally. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - All these companies are like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Do you know this guy?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Well, yeah, 'cause if it
was a guy, there was a, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so they also, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I think the person, I'm
not sure if the CEO, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> someone representing write staff. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Anime. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Which is the American company, I think. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which buys the licenses for, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> again, I'm not sure. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Either way, they buy
licensing or they sell, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or they sell DVDs of anime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They reached out being like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "So apparently you've
listed some of our titles, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you say that we're in talks." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And the guy tweeted at him, saying that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "We've never been in talks." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And then they replied saying, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "We sent you a message on LinkedIn. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That was there. We're in talks." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm in fucking talks
with all the people that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> email me about weird shit then, aren't I? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> The fuck? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Bro, I DM'ed you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Why didn't you DM back?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - "I sent you my LinkedIn
DM, please respond. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> We're in talks now, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Hundreds of millions
of dollars are at stake </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because of my LinkedIn DM." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - "I sent you a DM, please
give me the anime license." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - "Please give me the IP." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> That's how </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> anime licensing works, right?
- I'm in talks with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all my favorite succubuses
from all the hentai. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've sent them a message. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> They haven't responded
yet, but we're in talks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> We're working on an arrangement. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just insanity. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - We're part of this
one-sided conversation. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was just, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Connor laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, it all burned
down in flames, luckily, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but it was just, oh my God, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it was such a fucking mess.
- It was just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so bizarre to see. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And, you know, we knew it was
gonna come down in flames. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Hundred percent. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, I think right now, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's been taken off Kickstarter, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - As far as I know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Can you check? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Navi] It's still here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Group] It's still there? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Navi] But the funding has stopped. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So, no one's giving them anymore funding. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Navi] Okay, it does say "suspended." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - So, Kickstarter suspended the bitch. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - $111,000. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know how true this is, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I did see a screenshot
pop up on my timeline </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the other day though, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that shows that they haven't given up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They've started a
newsletter, which you can, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which you can subscribe to for a dollar. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So for a dollar, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for this newsletter, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you can subscribe for updates. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - These people are just taking your money. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Updates of what? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Talks in the anime industry?
- I don't know! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I legit don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - "On this week's newsletter, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we're in talks with ADV." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Trying to get the rights. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's just absolutely tragic. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's obvious that, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm not being funny,
but there's a reason why </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Netflix doesn't have its
own Discord server as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> They had their own Discord server, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and they started banning people. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's like, what is this? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This is a fucking YandereDev's game. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What is this? This is
like, what's going on here? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's so obvious that they're just, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause they've done this like
two times before apparently, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And they failed twice.
- Oh, yeah! I saw they've made </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> other Kickstarters.
- So they're trying to make </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this Kickstarter. This is their
third attempt of doing it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I think that another
app similar to it popped up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on the Microsoft store and
was taken down before as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> They have a history of doing
this and failing and whatever, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but clearly, you know,
every time it comes around, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it seems to get some
money. So I guess, why not? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - They got some real balls to do it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like three or four times. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - No shame, man, if you get money. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm sorry if you fucking
gave money to that Kickstarter. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I mean, I would say, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I like the idea of it.
- Noble intentions. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Intentions aside, I like the idea of it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Everybody wishes for it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, everybody wishes for it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I feel like, you know,
in the era we're in now, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think we're past the golden
age of streaming because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we're past the point in time
where you could get every show </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you physically, feasibly
watched on one platform. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's unfortunate that that's the case, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it's kind of evolved
into a similar era </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to what the cable era was like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But I mean, when pe-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when corporations started to realize that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there was money in streaming, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this was going to be the way
that things were gonna evolve, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> unfortunately, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because unfortunately,
money talks, you know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And if there could be a platform </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> where every anime you ever
watched was on a single platform, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm sure someone would
have done that already. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm sure someone with a lot of money </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> would have done that already. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Hate to be the bearer of bad news, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but anime is a business. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Whether you like it or not. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Streaming is one of
those businesses where it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> now on impossible to get into it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> unless you've got massive investors. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Maybe like 10, 15 years ago. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Maybe, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> if you were at the start
of the streaming age, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like when Crunchyroll first started, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but that time's passed now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> You can't just be the little guy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> taking on the big guy anymore. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Quibi as well had like,
what, 6 billion dollars. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - The fuck is Quibi? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, exactly! You don't
even know what Quibi is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wait, what's Quibi? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's a, it was made, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was founded by the guy who </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> left Disney and founded DreamWorks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I can't remember his name. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And made Quibi, a streaming service. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh my god, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember that shit.
- It was an absolute </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> dumpster fire, but it had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> billions of dollars in investments. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was insane.
- Yeah, but it disappeared </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> after like two weeks, right? Or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, it was like, you got a free trial </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> then you have to pay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it literally just tanked immediately. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> They paid for so many
original shows as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Who's on there? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't fucking know.
I didn't go on Quibi. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Did anyone use Quibi? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I didn't even know about this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah. How'd you not know about this? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was a couple of years ago, I think. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Was it a couple years ago? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was like two years ago, I think. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> No, it was like a year ago. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Was it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think I might've-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't even count last year. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Last year, frankly, just flew by. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can't remember anything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Did it happen in
2019? It was a year ago. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm still 22 as far as I'm concerned. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 2020 was just like fucking
King Crimson existed in 2020, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and just fucking erased the entire year. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We just skipped it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Literally felt like
last month was April 2020. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This is really weird. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I mean we're already
halfway through 2021, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is terrifying. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Didn't Mixer die as well? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. Mixer died. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Man, fuck, I wish I got
offered to move to Mixer. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I would've got a nice cash out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Ninja's just set for life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He's the only reason anyone
knows about Mixer, I think. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But yeah, I mean, even with
those failed platforms, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they had millions and billions
of dollars invested into them </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> by angel investors. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - They definitely wouldn't
start up a fucking Kickstarter. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - And unfortunately,
even if you have, what's, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> what would be the most successful
Kickstarter of all time? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's very telling that
we can't think of one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Group] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm sure there is some good
ones out there, I just, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I've never been interested. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Any good Kickstarter, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you could just buy the thing
when it fucking comes out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I'm just thinking of the money, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with the money that Kickstarter can be, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people can invest into Kickstarter. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Even the most successful
Kickstarter of all time would </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> probably have trouble getting
into the streaming field. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - The only one I remember was those </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> sunglasses that had the
built-in headphones into it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Remember those? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That was successful?
- There was a Kickstarter, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I remember it because it
was during my uni days, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> but there's this pair of
sunglasses where on the brim here, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was like this new
technology and audio where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it would vibrate, and the
vibrations would travel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> through your ears and the music
would come into your ears. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I remember it was a successful case </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that was millions of dollars. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's not success. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is that the most successful </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Kickstarter of all time?
- Wait, what the fuck is that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - The Ouya. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Group] The Ouya? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The Ouya is the most successful? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Are you kidding me, Navi? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Navi] Number eight. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, number eight. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> The Ouya is the number-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wait, how much money did the Ouya raise? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Navi] $8,596,000. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, but you gotta bear in mind, right, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> even if someone raised-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Navi] Most successful
is actually Pebble </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> with 20 million dollars. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - [All] Pebble? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Man] The smartwatch. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Even if somebody raised
200, 300 million dollars, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that doesn't mean shit for streaming. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You can't buy much with that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, that's what I'm trying to say. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Even with the most successful
Kickstarters of all time, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> to get into this field, you
need external investors. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If they really want to challenge
the big guys, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause there's a lot of
money in there right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Most of us are broke! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - You could gather all the
anime fans in the world </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and it probably won't even be enough. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't understand how people
can invest in Kickstarter </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> after it's just, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> track record's poorly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Have you ever donated to a Kickstarter? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why? You save like $20, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you got to put a
hundred in for some shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's like, I'll just
wait 'til it comes out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've done a few, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but not like the stupid amounts
of money that some people-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> every time I look at a Kickstarter, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I see, you know, the top tiers, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> which are like a thousand, $10,000, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you see one left, two left. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, who are these people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that are just dropping $10,000 on this? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - For stuff that
genuinely needs the money, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I would be more inclined. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like a game or something that I'm into. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I would, but I haven't though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Most of the time, the
stuff that gets the most </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> is just like fucking
pre-orders, essentially. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The product's made, they
know what they're doing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you're just pre-ordering. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I mean, with Kickstarter, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel like if it's a small indie project </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> or something that you can see </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> feasibly getting funded on
Kickstarter, I would support it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think the last Kickstarter
I supported was actually </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> the Trigger anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think they funded the second OVA of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey And Garnt] Little Witch Academia. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I supported that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - That makes sense to me, that seems like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is why Kickstarter should exist. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - But if you're coming
in trying to change, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> stir up an entire industry or whatever, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Kickstarter's just not
going to do it anymore. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think Kickstarter is
really good for, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a small indie team to
do some kind of project, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but on like a fucking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> industry changing project,
you need something else. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Usually Kickstarter is for, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of at a, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it stops at an artistic level, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's not really the thing
that you go into to be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm gonna cause a scene
in the industry, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fucking everything on
Kickstarter is the same shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, all right, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> get the stock image of people running, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> play the music mood and the, you know-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The ukulele one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That one or there's always
some motivational thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then it's just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have you ever had this
problem that isn't a problem? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Well, now we can solve it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And then it looks amazing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then you think about
it and you're like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's all shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's always the same type of people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with a Kickstarter too, isn't it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's always the way too
overly enthusiastic, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> "Hi, my name is Kyle." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It'll either be someone from California </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> or someone from Eastern Europe. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> With a really thick accent explaining why </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> his fridge is the best fridge. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's like, okay,
that's cool, that's fine. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I just don't want it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - "With our last project,
'The Walking Fridge,' </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we raised $200,000. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's insane." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just realized that Kickstarters </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> are basically the modern infomercials. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Pretty much. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Pretty much. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I just don't believe
any single advertisement </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where someone gives it to a random person </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and they're like, "Whoa, it's amazing." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just don't believe that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Even if it actually happens,
I just don't want to see it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't even believe it when </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> there's the thing which
says "not a paid actor." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> You sure about that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Going back to Anime Tube, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> did you see the fucking
testimonials they had </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> on the Kickstarter post page?
- What were the testimonials? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think they just got some random people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> they found on Discord to
give them testimonials </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of their app or something like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - "It's good!" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What were the testimonials? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Let me see, let me see. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Let me see if I can bring it up right now, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> But... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, I mean, it's all the same, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It's literally-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Let's see.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's just like, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I frankly don't really do, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't trust anyone who
shows me their review. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Just let me see your
reviews. I'll have a look. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] "It is routinely
maintained, it's comfortable, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's quite logical and ergonomic. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's way beyond any
competition. I like it." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Of course it's beyond
the fucking competition </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when you can just take the
licenses and rip them off a DVD. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] "The best app for on-hand anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I used to spend days looking up series, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but now I just use this app with ease." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Thank you, Robert. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Thank you,
Stephan, Robert, and James. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] With the most rudimentary anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> profile pictures. I've ever seen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. I mean, it's just, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we're going to look back on this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's just going to feel
like a fever dream, you know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It already does. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's fucking stupid. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Don't do that! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - This episode is sponsored by Honey. </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_01> the Honey button drops down </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and all you have to do

<SPEAKER_01> You wait a few seconds </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> as Honey searches for its coupons
it can find for that site, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and if Honey finds a working coupon, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you'll watch those prices </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> drop!
(Connor and Garnt groan) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Joey, stop seducing me like this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I can't hear these words right now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm literally coming. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I recently bought a new pair </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_00> Link's in the description below. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Back to the episode. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't trust reviews on
websites that aren't like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a third party's website.
You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Even some third party websites, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Even Amazon, they're all fucked, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And especially if it's on your website. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Bro, I don't trust your reviews. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Five stars? No way. It's on your website. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I just don't trust
Amazon reviews in general. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Especially in Japan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, we've talked about
this before, right, to be fair. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I mean, that's why they
have the certified seller thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> A certified buyer bought
it, which makes more sense. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - We need more people like Meilyne. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, Meilyne reviews-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Hit them with the hard
opinions! No bullshit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Meilyne, Meilyne, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the top 5% Google reviewer.
- I just feel like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm a shit reviewer. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I don't really give a shit, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> as long as it does the thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't care, some people get so-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Have you ever written a review </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for an Amazon thing or anything? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm always five or one star. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm that guy, I'm that kind of guy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Because to me, it either
works or it doesn't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And if it looks fine, fine, that's it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - If it does the thing
I paid for it to do-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Five stars.
- That's great. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're not those assholes who are like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Two out of ten. The box
was bruised." Or whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, people rate
furniture and they're like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> "It was complicated to build. Two stars." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but that's surely, that's just-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's on you, bro. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I feel like that's
an interpretation thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Is the thing good? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> At the end of the day,
you're only going to build it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for like one hour or two hours or three. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - There are some times
when I'm just like how, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm pretty sure you
need a PhD to translate </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> the instruction manual
that they gave, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Every IKEA furniture. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I know what you mean
but at the same time, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> okay, I have a coffee table right now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that was so over-engineered </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and the amount of screws and
shit for it was totally stupid. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> That was three hours </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> out of the two years I've been using it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't give a shit
about those three hours </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> looking back now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's why I write the
review like three months </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> after I get it, because then I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh yeah, it's good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's still standing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's why I wait. If it
breaks up after like one month, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all right, fine, that's one star. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It shouldn't have broke
one month after I use it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But when people who, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> these people who write
it and they're like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> "The cardboard box was
slightly damaged, you know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The furniture took a little
longer than I'd like to. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, fuck off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - "The delivery man had a bad attitude." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's got nothing to do with anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - And then as well, even
if it breaks, I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all right, how long, reasonably,
did I expect it to last? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> My bed's broken, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but it's two years, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is that-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You also spent, what,
a hundred bucks on it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was 300 bucks for
the mattress and the bed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Which is very cheap
for a bed of your size. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Considering how much
we've spent on Amazon </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to get our first furniture, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think the furniture I have
right now has lasted very well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, my bed is like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this design of this bed is, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when I was building it, I'm like, huh. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> This doesn't seem super
structurally stable. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I understand why it was three stars now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Well, basically, you know that meme </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with the Cheeto in the door, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> holding the door closed? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There's a tiny plank, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like a piece of plywood
that basically is holding up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> the middle of the bed
and all the way on it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - That doesn't sound safe. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - If you stood on that and jumped on it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it would just crack, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Well, one time, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think I just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I don't know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I wouldn't say I get
into bed aggressively, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I'm not polite about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're not gonna be like-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm not sneaking into my bed, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I just kinda like, you know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Hop on, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just fucking does a
clothesline on the bed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or something like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - WWE Smackdown Arena! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> No, so I just popped on my
bed and I just heard the boom. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then I looked under my bed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and this thing had just
fucking went to the side. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, oh, that's all right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's not even screwed in? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, no. It's literally
just put in with the weight. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There's just a plank of literally,
like if this is the bed-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Connor mumbles) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's just like this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You just gotta center this piece of wood. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> It's literally like this size as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And so when I looked and it was like this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was just like, oh, it's all right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I do that every time it does it now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, that works, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's probably time for a new bed, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, probably time for a new bed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, you're moving soon, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gonna upgrade your breads, which-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Bread? My bread? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Upgrading my breads.
- I do have to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> upgrade my bread.
- From white to rye. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - You can feel the springs on it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and everything right now, can't you? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I kinda like feeling
the springs, though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why?
- Really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's got a nice feel to it, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't.
Does no one else, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> someone else is like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I like feeling a little bit of a spring. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - We're looking around the room, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not a single person is like, "Mhm!" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sounds like peasant talk to me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Listen, okay. I'm-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Shut up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - How dare you? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No king wants to feel the
springs on the bread corner. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Stop saying bread! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What is your obsession with bread? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't want springs in
my fucking bread, Garnt. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That'd be really awkward,
trying to cut it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - The knife keeps bouncing back! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's a slinky in my bread! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Well, I, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, when I go to a hotel, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I have their amazing, you know-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Fucking whatever the little hippo is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The brand, I don't know
what it is. Sleepy's? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The anti-gravity mattress </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or whatever the fuck it's called. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The hippo. It's Sleepy's, the brand. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I think it's a hippo in the UK. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is that a brand? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Anyway, it's some deluxe,
divine, 10,000 sheet. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, oh, it's pretty good, this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's great, that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But also, those beds are ridiculous. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I don't, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't think they're that
much better than a shitty bed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know about that, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know about that one, chief. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know a shit mattress
when you're on it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I had a memory foam
one at my parents' house. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't like memory foam ones. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Those ones, I don't like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Really? I love those. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - When I first-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Well, yeah, it's 'cause
you gotta break it in. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> You really, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> after like a year, it's amazing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like putty, you just
kind of sink yourself into it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It takes months for it to
actually get the right shape. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But then it's amazing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, I want to see, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> feel some bounce in it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> With the memory foam one, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it feels like I'm sleeping in quicksand. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Where you just sink in and you just like-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, that's the thing though, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the comfort envelops you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - But the thing is, you know, I mean, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like that's like
admitting you're just single </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> if you get a memory foam one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's not an exciting bed, you know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What do you mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What do you mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Do I need to explain, Garnt?
- Yeah, please. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's no bounce. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Connor laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I gotcha. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's just depressing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like fucking on a beanbag, you know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't use memory foam beds, so. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - There you go, then,
you know what I mean. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause I like the bounce. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I like the bounce normally
when I'm sleeping, you know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - What are you, fucking
sleeping like this? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (Connor and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You can rebound them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I need some bounce when I'm fighting </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> my sleep paralysis demon. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Get off! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do I really need to
explain this? Come on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I get it. I get it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Sometimes, you know-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Sometimes, you just wanna
play a bit of basketball, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Sometimes you just
wanna dribble some balls. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, sometimes, you need to dribble. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Could you catch my drift guys? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Use your imagination. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Spring breads are awful for that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] No, you can use </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the springs.
- Stop saying bread! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I said bed there, didn't I? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You literally said, "Spring bread." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my fucking God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (Connor laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Does Garnt go to the bakery
and ask for a mattress? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Give me your finest bed, please. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my God, what is this fucking convo? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Have you ever slept
on a waterbed before? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I imagine that must be fun.
- That sounds horrible. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's really fun. It's like literally-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That must be. Is it actually
fun? Is it comfortable? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's really, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I find it to be super fucking comfortable, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but that's because again, it's, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but I find memory foam
to be really comfortable. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So it's kind of like that because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the mattress kind of follows
you as you're moving around. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - But then if you're in a-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like you become the mattress. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - If you get a double
memory foam mattress, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you guys are never going
to touch each other. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> You guys are going to be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> "We have our crevice. It is set. Goodbye." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's what I don't like
about memory foam mattresses. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> You just sink in, and there--
- It's a single bed thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - There's no movement. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm not seeing enough movement anywhere </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on a memory foam mattress </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You sink in and that's just it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's what couples
do when they agree that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they're just not having sex anymore. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It's true, I mean-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like, "Let me just
sink into my crevice." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, yeah, because you have your, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you literally, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if a memory foam is set,
it's so uncomfortable </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to move to a position where it isn't set. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - What about memory foam pillows? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah, I like the pillows. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Do you like the pillows? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Nah, I like feeling that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I like a little resistance,
I like a little bounce. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> On like whatever I'm sleeping-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You fucking the pillow, Garnt? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I like when the pillow fights back. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Garnt's like suffocating Sydney. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I like it when the pillow's hard to get. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think the pillow needs
a little bit of firmness. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I like it when the pillow's
a tsundere, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - If you sink in too much, then-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I do like being able to, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if I'm kind of just not
happy with the pillow, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I can just like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Connor pants) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Punch the shit of it. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, literally. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Until you're like, all
right, it is refreshed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, 'cause sometimes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you just gotta fucking
tenderize the pillow, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Fucking get the fucking steak tenderized. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> You want to go like-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt grunts) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> All right. Now it's puff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I used to... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I used to use two pillows exclusively, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but now for some reason I can't use two. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Is that getting old? Is that an old thing? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, I've actually gone the opposite. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I used to be able to
just sleep on one pillow, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but now I need two. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can't do two anymore.
It has to be one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Why?
- I dunno. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Maybe 'cause my, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when I was a child, sorry, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> my mom probably bought the
shittest, thinnest pillows. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Maybe that was why. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I was like, yeah, I
always sleep with two, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm like this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, I always sleep with two pillows. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, I was the opposite. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I had the really, really
thin pillows, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And we couldn't afford another pillow. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I was just like, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think that's why I had two. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> why am I waking up with
a headache every morning? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh, it's because all the
blood is rushing to my head </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from being like this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Japan has these pillows </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you get in hotels
and stuff that I hate. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Which ones? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like double-sided ones, but-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Double-sided? Aren't
all pillows double-sided? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> There's two different types
of material on each side. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey and Garnt] Oh! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And one of them is literally
like solid beanbag. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like a bean bag that you have to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> physically move around to-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's the sand one, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it's horrible. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I love those ones.
- And it's sticking into </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> your neck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> No, what? What? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I love, you know, when
you're sleeping on a futon, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the sand pillows that you get-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, I hate those.
Give me something soft. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I love those because it,
again, it gives me that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> perfect height where it
makes me sleep so well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Did you just say sand pillows? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It feels like sand. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like a beads sand. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's rock solid, though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like if you packed
a bean bag a little, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with too much beans. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I stayed in a hotel one time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like, when I left, I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> fuck that, that fucking
sand. It was horrible. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh, you could've just
flipped it. I'm like, what? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I didn't know that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Most of them are two-sided. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> So the other side will be a normal pillow. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh. I always just like go to the hotel, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> just touch the sand side.
I'm like, I'm satisfied. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll take that.
- I hate the sand. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Maybe 'cause I used to sleep with those </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> at my grandma's place.
'Cause that's all she had. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It just makes me feel
like I'm in a hospital. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know why. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Hospital? But the
hospitals have super pillows </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> that kind of go around you like this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> You sink in and it's just like-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't think, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I've never stayed in a hospital. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - You've never stayed in a hospital? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've stayed in a hospital once. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm trying to remember if
I have. I definitely have. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just, it's not a
common occurrence obviously. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Maybe I have some time in my childhood. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just taking a weekly trip
to the hospital, just, casual. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's a free hotel in
the UK if you get injured. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Have you ever injured your-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have you ever been to the hospital, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with an injury and stuff like that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Have we ever talked about that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like you've injured yourself so bad </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that you had to go to the hospital. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like breaking a bone or anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I've never had any bad
injuries, I don't think. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - No. You? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I had once. I have stitches. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You can still kind of see
it right there on my finger. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That was the only time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I fell when I was two years old </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I landed kind of
like my hands like that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and a piece of glass just
went straight into there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So they had to pull it
out and give me stitches. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But that's about it, really. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Damn, that was a boring--
- Yeah, that was boring. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was hoping you guys would have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hurt yourselves, you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Connor's like, the time
I fucking crashed a car. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was like, guys, broken
bone? Please, please? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Guys, any injuries? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Are we that boring, that
we haven't injured ourselves? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I have strong bones, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know what you're talking about. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I drink my milk, bro. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've had some pretty bad injuries. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> But for some reason I just never had, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> never been like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I've always been like,
walk it off, walk it off. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's just your arm falling off-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I probably have broken
my toe or something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and just not known about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's pretty common, though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel like it's pretty common. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've sprained my wrist. Did that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's like the most
boring injury of all time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Sprained my wrist, uh, yeah." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. It was from like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think I told the story when I, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I failed a jump skiing
or snowboarding, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And that was fucking horrible. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I thought I was gonna die, but I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll snowboard it off.
I'll snowboard it off. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just kept snowboarding,
and I was winded as fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's how you know we're inside kids, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when we haven't broken
any bones or anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - What are you expecting, Joey? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know, man! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - We're fucking anime nerds and gamers. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've been very lucky. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wanking yourself so hard </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you dislocate your wrist
or something, I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think about all the injuries I've had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and how I've just never
had any damage from it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like, that's very lucky. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Tipped a quad bike, when
I was like ten, on myself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And you didn't go to the hospital? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I wasn't injured at all. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Tipped a quad bike on
yourself. How'd you do that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, I tipped a quad bike. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause you know, my mate owned a farm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and I loved going to his house </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause it was just basically
like a free theme park. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Farms are great when you're
ten, cause it's like-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Especially with a quad bike. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - He had a quad bike! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And his dad didn't give a shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He was just like, "You can
just go on the quad bike." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So he just let us go on the quad bike. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like one of those
fucking danger addicts </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when I was a 10 year old. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just wanted to do dangerous things. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So my friend, he was used
to going on the quad bike, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and he was just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Yeah, it's all right.
Just don't go too fast." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like, all right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Immediately went too fast. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was just turning really, really fast. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And when I was going so fast,
the bike just went like, oh. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It just flipped over,
did like a barrel roll. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> So, it tipped, but I think
I was small enough where, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know how it happened, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it tipped, I didn't get hurt at all. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I just got up, and the
bar was a little fucked </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> on the thing, but we hit it
into place and it was good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then I went back on it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - You went back on it?
- Yeah! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I would not fucking go
back on it if I flipped. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was like, yeah, dude, that was so fun. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Let's do it again! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - "Almost died, let's do it again!" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Have you guys had any
near-death experiences before? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've told the story about how I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> got launched with a bounce castle, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yes, yes, yes.
- Oh, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - That was probably level one as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I remember telling
you this a few days ago, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I think the nearest
death experience I had was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> probably the most lamest
story I could tell, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but it was during a snowball fight, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So, in university in England,
we don't get a lot of snow. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> We get snow once or twice a year, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And so anytime it snows, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone takes the opportunity
to play around in the snow. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And in university, what that means is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> we just go out and have a bunch
of snowball fights, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So it was one dorm versus another dorm. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And we were having a snowball fight </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the middle of this residential
area in Bristol, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So it wasn't in the middle
of a field or something, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was literally on the
roads and the pavements. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I remember we were
just throwing snowballs and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one fucker, right, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, you have the snowballs and some, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the common courtesy is you
make the powder snowballs. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And you throw those.
- Yes, of course, of course. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Of course. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - One fucker decided to make an ice ball. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> You know what I mean. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The ones where it's like melted ice </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you fucking pack it in and-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - On the side of the road. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - On the side of the road
where you just like-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - At least he didn't put a stone in it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> People used to do that in my school. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Seriously?
- I had that as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I feel like ice balls are even worse </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because you get the hardness of the ice </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and the coldness as well,
which is numbing as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's basically just getting
a cold rock thrown at you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - So I was standing right
by the side of the road </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I see the snowball coming </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm just like, it's
a snowball, whatever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Hits my fucking balls. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then I realize, number one, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that is perfect aim because
it literally hit my balls. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Number two, that is not
a snowball I just felt. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That is a solid ice ball
that just came full force, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right to my fucking balls. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I have a really similar story,
but except total opposite. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It was at the beach. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And my dad and I were at the beach, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I think I was like maybe 11, 12 years old. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And my dad and I were kicking
the rugby ball around. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> One thing I really liked
was trying to catch </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the ball that gets kicked really high up, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then you kind of get under
it and grab it like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So we were doing that a couple of times. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was practicing that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And one time my dad just kicks
it really fucking high up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like, all right, I got it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Sun's in my eyes, but I
got it. I think I got this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it comes down, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it misses my arm, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it just perfectly flicks my knob. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - It just flicks it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's worse! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It didn't even land on my
balls. It just flicked it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It just went, "pow," like that on my knob. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I just collapsed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - 'Cause if you're not a
guy, if you're not a male, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's really hard to
describe the pain you feel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when your knob gets flicked or some, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you feel an impact on it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's not your dick or balls that hurt. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It's above it that hurts. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's just the entire area. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's the flick. The flick
hurts the most for some reason. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And so obviously this happened to me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was in total agony, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Because your mind just goes blank. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I start walking forward
and I didn't realize I was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> walking right into the
middle of the road, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Jesus Christ! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because I was just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt groans) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then the last thing
I remember is my mate go, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Garnt, what the fuck?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And he grabs my bag and
pulls me back, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> He full on pulls me back </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then I just see this
fucking bus just going </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt imitates bus screeching) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right in front of me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And yeah, that was the closest
I've come to dying, I think. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Imagine dying while grabbing your balls. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think you actually just missed out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> on your own Isekai story. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - That was your chance.
That was your one chance. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, that was literally
an Isekai origin story. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, I got an ice ball in my balls. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Now I wanna watch an Isekai story </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that literally starts out like that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where the protagonist
gets smashed in the balls, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and then gets transported
to another world. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Jesus Christ, that's scary. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know if I've had
any near-death experiences. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I had a really stupid accident one time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We had one of those big trampolines, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like the... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the big ones. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There's two sizes, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The small and then there's a big one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey And Garnt] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Had one of those. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And I loved doing front flips, back flips, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all the works on it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You name it, I jumped it, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I jumped it. I flipped it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And one time, I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just gonna do it on my knees. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was practicing doing tricks on my knees. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And one time I just did
something, landed on my knees. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And instead of me jumping
back, my back just went like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> while I was still on my
knees, so my back just-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Oh, Jesus. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've never had this pain in my life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I wanted to throw up immediately, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I couldn't move. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Probably just winded yourself, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know what I did,
but it was fucking horrible. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Scared the shit out of me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was so winded and it was horrible. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It was so horrible. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like twelve and I
was like, what's happening? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Why do I wanna throw up? Oh God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That must've been scary
for people watching you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> where you, literally your back just goes-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - No one was there. It was just me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Damn. You could've died </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> on that trampoline.
- Where was this trampoline? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was at my house. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, you had a trampoline at your house? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Your parents are like, "He's probably </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> having fun on the trampoline." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Meanwhile, he's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey moans) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> "Help!" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Having a trampoline
at your house was great </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when your friends came over, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause you can just fucking fight on it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, we didn't have a backyard </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> big enough for a trampoline. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I didn't have that much space. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Our backyard's pretty big. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, you're a country boy, aren't you? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, it's Wales. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all chatter) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Most people have a pretty
decent sized backyard. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It was really good though.
I mean, yeah, it's great. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> We'd just fight on it and stuff. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - As you do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So in other news, Japan
is back on lockdown. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - No way! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, you know what, we
had a pleasant two weeks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, we had two weeks out of lockdown. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - What blows my mind is that
they cancel spectators now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> for the Olympics. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It's starting this month, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, in a couple weeks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What the fuck? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Actually, by the time this is up, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> it's probably already started. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's insane to me that
they canceled it this, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the spectators this late when, you know-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But the athletes are
still allowed in, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, I get that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But as if they didn't know
how bad the situation was, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like, "Whoa, shit, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it didn't get better
suddenly? What the fuck?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> To me, it's insane that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know, it's also just
irresponsible as well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because there's probably people
who booked hotels, you know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause even in Japan, right, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you can come from Hokkaido,
wherever the fuck you are, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you can come and watch. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Poor people probably booked
time off work, maybe, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> probably booked some hotels. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, they use their limited pay leave. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like the Cyberpunk release, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but just on a scale ten
times that, you know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - If somebody booked
time off work in Japan, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> they ain't playing around. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> That doesn't happen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The Japanese government
just puts out a tweet, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is just the fucking-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The yellow-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - TwitLonger thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - We have delayed the Olympics again. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We have canceled
spectators. We apologize. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, it's just, yeah, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> unfortunately you're not, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we're going to have to wait even longer </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> for the new Figure episode
because we're still </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> under a new lockdown and it
just feels like this entire year </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> has just been a lockdown. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But not really, for us. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It feels like now that
the rest of the world </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is kind of getting back to normal, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's really weird seeing timelines </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where people are having parties </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and going out without masks and stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm just here like,
yeah, this is just life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is life, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is just life now for us, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's weird, 'cause it's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I know we spoke about this a lot before, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it's because it's
such an ongoing thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it changes throughout the time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, all right, restaurants open. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> All right, okay, cool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But now they close at
8:00. All right, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But now they can serve alcohol. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay, but now they can't. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, wait, what's going on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What the fuck is going on? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just, I'm so confused. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The limit is three.
No, the limit is six. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The limit is four? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then it's like, all right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And then Google Maps is
completely unreliable now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> because now all the
opening and closing times </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> are a fucking lie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's totally dependent on the place </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and whether they're doing it, and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> most of the time, they're not the ones </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> updating their Google page. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> So you don't even know
if shit's open or not. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - The only thing that
has stayed consistent </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> throughout this entire thing is comedy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> It's literally the only
thing that stayed consistent. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Pretty much. I mean, you
want to go to a new place now, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you check out on Google Maps. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh, they're open. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You turn up at the door
and they're not open. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then you try to find another place </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's just kind of like
playing a roulette wheel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> of just seeing what you can do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause it's, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> lockdown here has been really weird. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause we say lockdown,
but it's just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you can still go out and work. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You just can't really do
anything else but that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, the trains are still
fucking packed as shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah. If you get an
eight o'clock train, still, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, you're fucked. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> You still get squeezed in. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There will be people
pushing you in, still, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> during all of this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And that's why a lot of the
experts say it's so worrying </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in Tokyo because the density is insane. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> You can't just social distance anywhere </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> in this fucking town. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And yeah, did you see that thing with the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Tokyo hotel or something, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> where it was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> the foreigners have to
get a different elevator </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from the Japanese one?
- Yeah, yeah, I saw that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I saw that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Classic Japanese xenophobia. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey cheers) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I heard that it was a misunderstanding. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know if this is true. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's what they always fucking say. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I heard this was a misunderstanding of, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was supposed to be for people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> who came from a foreign country. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Even though, realistically, right now, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you're probably safer if you've
come from a foreign country. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. I think that was a lot of the, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> even though </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> some people were trying
to defend it, being like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "No, no, they meant people who
just came in from America," </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> or whatever, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But a lot of people arguing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Well, Japan has not
handled this very well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't think they're in the
place to be able to, you know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't even think, what is it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like less than 10% of the population's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> got the vaccine, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's probably higher now
by the time this comes out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But I mean, still, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's nowhere near where it should be, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> considering the Olympics
is fucking starting. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - To me it just seems like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> why not just socially distance,
in general, in the elevator? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Why not just let two
people go in at a time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on the opposite end? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Why'd have to make it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like the distinction? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, I dunno. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean they could be-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> That's too logical. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> That's too logical for the Japanese-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Japan is just a little, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you know the thing that sucks about Japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is that they're just a little too quick </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> on the decision to make
it harsh on foreigners. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They're a little too comfortable
with making those rules. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - They're always--
- They're like a little too-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (Connor laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like, "Is something wrong? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It's the foreigners!" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - They're just a little, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just the speed at
which they'll be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh, maybe we should just maybe
discriminate a little bit." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm feeling a little
discriminatory today. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like that image of that guy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who falls off the bicycle. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's just like, "Oh,
it's the foreigners!" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Damn foreigners! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - You know, the one time, you know, they, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people do try and justify it and all that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> But it's just the ease at
which sometimes Japan does it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> which bothers me the most. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like we had that thing from the, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think we did talk
about it on the podcast, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the Ibaraki Prefecture. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't think we have talked about that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The Ibaraki Prefecture
gave a warning out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for people not to
interact with foreigners. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's right, yeah, I remember. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - That was one of their warnings. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Don't interact with any foreigners." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think, again, people defended, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> some people defended it being like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> well they don't mean people
from a foreign country, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but there's no way for
Japanese people to be able to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> distinguish between </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a person who came from a
foreign country recently. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> It was very obvious what
they were trying to say, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which was just stay away from foreigners. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know, which, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> it's a massive yikes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - If this happened in
literally any other country, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they'd just be called out for it, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> By everyone. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, luckily though, in a sense, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> at least what I've seen on social media, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they have been called out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> That's why they're so quick
to retract and being like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh no, it was a misunderstanding." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was retracted very fast. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> And I mean, you can imagine why. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's supposed to be very, it's an-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The hotel is quite a, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> what's it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> notable hotel. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's a big franchise. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's generally an expensive chain. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is it an expensive chain? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, the Tokyo hotel is a very, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> quite pricey. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, I thought it was just this really-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's a premium hotel. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And you know, normally for rich tourists. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like if the Hilton
was like, "No Asians." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's that level. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just sad. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Very sad. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I forgot what, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was going to say something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I had a really good point,
but I fucking forgot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm dumb.
- Must have been a good point. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was such a riveting point, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> but oh well, lost to time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, it's just like, it's, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> obviously we're grateful to be here, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but it's just, it's weird that we, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it's not exactly that we
feel discriminated against, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> obviously. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just sometimes there's
just a lot of little things </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that we see and we feel, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and obviously hearing news like this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it kind of adds to that, little by little. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I mean, when I
speak to someone my age, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've never ever felt that in Japan at all. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just feel that the government in, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> almost in every country, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's just older people
kind of out of touch. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I feel that's
the real problem here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel it's especially
prevalent in Japan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> because, again, the older
population is, the majority. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - If it is, that's totally fine </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> because that's what the voters want. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Literally all the voters are old. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, wasn't it like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> one of the people on
the Olympic committee, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> just saying that women shouldn't-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Women shouldn't talk? Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Women shouldn't talk and
just stay in the kitchen </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> or something like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was something, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was something along the lines of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> women shouldn't be allowed
to talk at meetings </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because they talked too long. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, that was it! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - At the Olympic meetings. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I'm like, that's
what dudes in the fifties </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> used to say to their wives. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - But that was the ex
prime minister of Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Was it?
- It was the, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> he was the prime minister of
Japan, as far as I'm aware. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Can you Google it just to confirm that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> But as far as I know, it was
the ex prime minister of Japan, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which is just very telling. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm not saying, you
know, the UK is much better, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> we're fucking awful with that shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But again, they're very quick
to get called out by it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But then people calling
out the Japanese government </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> for a lot of the stuff, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> a lot of the time it is the
younger people who are doing it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - The social media generation. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it was the ex
prime minister of Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Navi] Yoshiro Mori. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, Mori Yoshiro, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - But he's also like, what
91, years old or something? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And he's the fucking-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm not being funny,
but no one 91 years old </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> should be making countrywide decisions. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I think at that point you
are just so far out of touch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with the country. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Absolutely. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - You can't. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I mean, it's
just like, at that point, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you don't really, I mean, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're 91, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Why would you care to change for society? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Because, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> at that point, you
already know who you are. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You're not going to put
in the effort to change. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's just, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah, at that point, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you probably shouldn't be
running a country, you know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm like, should it be at 70 something? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But then, Bernie makes
me always think like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> damn, okay, maybe old people,
maybe they know what's up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, yeah, I completely forgot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I guess this is our
political, my political-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Fucking too political on the show. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - This is probably the most political </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> we've ever gotten on the show. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - What, just naming politicians? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He said the name! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's one of those things
where it's like, I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> It's just, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> they're a little too comfortable
with dishing that shit out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Whenever I hear stories
like that, there's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a part of me that hears that
kind of stuff happening, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and just makes me wish
that young people in Japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> were a little more politically interested. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, they pretty much have no interest </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> or even if they do, they
don't talk about it publicly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no. No one talks about it publicly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Barely anyone has any interest. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No one believes in the government here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They're just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Yeah, whatever. They're
just doing their thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> As long as we're not in a war
with another country, we good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - The consensus seems to be, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from when I've spoke to people, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is that they're like, "Oh, I don't care. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> As long as they don't ruin my life." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's a lot of young people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who don't even know who
the prime minister is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wow. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It just goes to show
they're that out of touch. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - But in Japan, you don't get
to choose the prime minister. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No.
- You choose the party. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then they choose the prime minister. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Whereas, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I think that's technically
the same in the UK, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but it's not done like that at all. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We're promised who the
person is when we're voting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And that's how it is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But in Japan, you vote for the party </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and you don't get a say who they pick. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - But, again, it's like,
I've talked to young people, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> some same age, a little bit
older, a little bit younger. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And there's a lot of
them who don't even know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> what the political parties
are or what they do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They're just not interested
in it whatsoever. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's like-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I kind of get the vibe
that everyone is just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> so overworked. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> They don't have time to care. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's the last thing
they wanna worry about. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's pretty much
the vibe I get, is like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone's just fucking fighting
for their life as it is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Everyone's just trying
to get through the day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> They don't have time to
care about other issues, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a lot of the time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I remember when they
raised the GST from 8% to 10% </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and there was all these mobs. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I saw that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - All these mobs of all
these old people being like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "How fucking dare you?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Meanwhile, the young people are like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Understandable, have a nice
day, I'll just work harder." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, they just don't care. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, "Oh, they made a new law? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Sick. I guess I'm just gonna have to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mold my life around this new law, now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Speaking of dumb Japanese laws, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> you can be arrested in
Japan if you mod games, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like save files. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, that sounds about right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Can you actually? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - A guy in-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - The Skyrim community
are sweating right now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - A guy in Nagano, I think, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was arrested and fined 65,000 pounds, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> about $100K in dollars, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for selling Breath of the Wild
save files that were modded. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Seriously? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, no joke. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And apparently, like I've read about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Apparently, one of the main
reasons why this law was passed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> was because, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> guess which company pushed for it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Nintendo.
- Yeah! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Of course they did. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - But obviously they tried, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> obviously that shit just, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> America's like, "LMAO, no." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They're not passing that law in America </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because you have the right
to do whatever you want </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with the products you buy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> But yeah, Nintendo somehow
managed to push for a law. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - To be fair, I think the
selling part was the problem. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> If you just put it online-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But it's also illegal to
even mod a Switch in Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You can't mod a Switch in Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - But I think it was
extra bad for the dude </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> because he sold it for money. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, isn't it technically illegal </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> everywhere to mod a Switch? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> So, in the U.S., </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's counted as you bought a product, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you're allowed to do whatever you want </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with that product. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> You can do whatever you want. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - So what's the illegal part, then? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Buying the games, getting the games? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Apparently. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I think the way they've
managed to pass the law is that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's still an ongoing
thing, like a service. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You don't actually own the game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You own a copy of the game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And by changing it, you're
ruining or infringing-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - If you buy a Nintendo
product, Nintendo owns you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There is no escape. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Didn't Apple try-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know if it's illegal, again, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> can you check it if it's
illegal to jailbreak your phone? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't remember. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm pretty sure it's not-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think it is illegal.
- I think it is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - In every country? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know. Is it, or
does it just break warranty? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I thought it just
broke warranty in the UK. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can't remember though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Man] It definitely at
least breaks warranty. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I know that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Everyone knows that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Generally, you're allowed
to do what the fuck you want </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> with the stuff you own. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've never hard of
anyone getting arrested </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for jailbreaking their phone. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just the idea of a raid
going on into some guy's house. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, "Get down! Stop! Drop
the Legend of Zelda copies! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Put them on the floor!" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, in Japan, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The thing is in Japan, right-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Boys walk up with hazmat suits. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - When they arrest people in Japan, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they don't arrest you with two people. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> They send like twenty fucking
police officers, in Japan, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when they arrest you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - The send the boys down, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They got the whole squad coming. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Navi] Overall, it's breaking
your iPhone's warranty. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The legality, I think it
differs between the country. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But in terms of Apple,
it's like, you don't get-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, no, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They're not gonna fucking
sue you for doing it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Navi] So, it's just
your warranty's gone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, that's understandable. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Most products do that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, "Hey, if you change this thing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> we're not gonna fix it for you." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - If you break the seal that says, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Breaking the seal breaks the warranty," </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then generally, that
breaks the warranty, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, but then I feel, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you also have to understand that Japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is falling a little bit short
on most common sense laws, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like Fair Use, for example. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Fair Use just isn't a thing here, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> as we've found out many times. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just seeing all these
videos of Nintendo fans </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> pleading with Nintendo
to change their mind. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then, after living
here, I'm like, dude, it's-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's not gonna happen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's not how it rolls. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, us pleading with Nintendo </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is not gonna fucking do
anything unless you're-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We should start a Kickstarter </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> to get them to change the laws! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Unless you are fully
100% Japanese and in that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> boardroom meeting with
them, isn't going to matter. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Unless you're Shigeru
Miyamoto, it's not gonna change. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, definitely coming to live here </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and seeing how it works on the inside, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just like, yeah, it's a lot of, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no matter how much noise
gets made on Twitter, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think most of the time it's
going to fall on deaf ears. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, so the way that
I've come to realize, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at least from living here, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can say anything
you want over an email. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You can explain everything
as well as you want </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> through a different person. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But unless there is a
Japanese guy there in the room </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at the board meeting, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> explaining something
directly to the person, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it will not get changed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - You can't have a Zoom call,
you can't send an email, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you can't send an angry tweet. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know, you could fucking
ratio the shit out of Nintendo, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they'll be like, "I don't give a shit." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You need to have someone there
explaining to the person, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in person, speaking fluent Japanese, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and possibly having a Japanese passport, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> before they take anything seriously. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Even then it's like, "Oh, so
what company do you work for? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Who are your backers? Who
are you representing?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've worked at places where
I've wanted to shoot there, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I've had a friend tell
them, who wasn't Japanese, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> "Hey, can we shoot
there? And they're like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> "No, I don't know about it." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But then you have a Japanese
person do the exact same thing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like if Kaho hits them up and is like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Hey, this is what we're doing." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And they're like, "Oh, okay, sure." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, what? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just they don't believe you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> They think you're lying
'cause you're not Japanese. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Like you don't understand. You
don't understand how I think. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - These sneaky foreigners
trying to get around our ways. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's bizarre. It's really strange. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But that's just the way that it's, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> businesses is done here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it makes so much sense now
why these companies do this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fucking stupid shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, oh, I totally get it now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I'm kind of like sitting
in that halfway point, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause if I don't open
my mouth, they'll be like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "This fucking foreigner
tryna get around me." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> The moment I open my mouth, they're like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh, you're Nihongo? Nihongo Jouzu? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> All right, let's do it, boys." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - All right, let's do business, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Exactly. I rock up, let's do business. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> "No, you're a foreigner." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> JK, I am Nihongo Jouzu actually. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And they're like, "All right, I'm sorry. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> All right. Let's do some business." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, it's so fucking embarrassing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. And I feel like companies
in Japan are very, very, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what's the word? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They very much stick to
the hierarchy of decisions. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And if you're not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the same level, you can't comment. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Are you talking about the pyramid? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The pyramid scheme. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The pyramid scheme. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, if you're not in that meeting, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> your opinion doesn't matter
no matter who you talk to. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> So I feel like when people
are like, all right, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> even if like, I don't know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because Nintendo has
a Nintendo of America. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'd love to know how
much Nintendo of America </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> has a say over what
Nintendo, the Japan office, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel like-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Probably not a lot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like people would, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah, I think it's probably not a lot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Just based off like what I've
seen from other companies here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where you would think that
they would have an input, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but they don't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Doug Bowser is like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "So can we change this thing?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And they're like, "But
we're in a Zoom call. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You're not in the office.
So, I don't know about that." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Again, it's all speculation, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but I imagine it's, if any,
from what I've seen here, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's very difficult to get things done </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you're not the same level. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Basically, the longer I live in Japan, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the more respect I have
for Suzaku in Code Geass. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause you watch Code Geass </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and everyone wants to
be the Lelouch, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Everyone wants to be the fucking Lelouch. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Bring down the system,
fuck the corporations. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But then I'm just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yo, Suzaku's out there
working his fucking ass off </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to change shit, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He's the real one. He's the real one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - He's climbing that pyramid, boys. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - He's climbing the hierarchy, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - If this was IRL, Suzaku would
still be a fucking grunt-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> He's like, "Well, what
do you mean, you're 22? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> No permission for you." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - "Do you have work experience?
Then stay the fuck down." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - "Oh, you're an honorary Britannian? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> No, no. What the fuck is
an honorary Britannian? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> You're not one of the--" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, yeah, he wasn't even one of them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> There's no way he could pass. No, no, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> He's the guy who changes
the vending machines. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Come on, they wouldn't let him. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Garnt had to pee, so we're back. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What have you been up to,
Garnt? How was your pee? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was great, it was great. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, speaking about the
rest of the world healing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it's getting to the point
now where I kind of meet </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> lots of people that are
planning their journeys home. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And that includes us as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Or me and Connor, at least. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, you two are. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - You know what I was
missing the other day? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I know I must be fucking mental. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was missing a pub. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What's wrong with that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Pubs are great. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've talked about how-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - But I mean, Garnt's talked
about how he doesn't like pubs. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've talked about how pubs are-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But Garnt's a fucking idiot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, Garnt thinks the
architecture here is great. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Garnt is a fake British person. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Maybe.
- Yeah, he's Thai. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm an honorary Britannian. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You got him there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I guess so. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Got em! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Got got. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Came full circle. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - But, yeah, I just had
this overwhelming urge </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to go to a fucking
Wetherspoons, and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> what the fuck is wrong with me? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Every week you should get that urge. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey snorts) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> The moment Friday takes over, you're like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Fuck, I want the Curry Club and a pint." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It's great. You can get like a Curry, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a whole Curry meal </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and a full pint of your alcohol of choice, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like 10 bucks. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then Fridays is fish
and chips Fridays as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know it is! You know it is! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - "Now you're speaking my language!" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I don't know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> now that we are in the
process of being able </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to go back to our
countries, it's just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it feels good, and it feels like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I get to kind of look forward
to all the things that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have made me feel kind
of homesick, I think. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause I didn't think I would
feel too homesick about England </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> until I kind of moved out of it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and couldn't go back for a while. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think this lockdown
or pandemic has definitely </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> proven to people that like,
"Oh, maybe I am homesick." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just give me enough time
before you're homesick. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - First year, I was like, it's
all right, it's not that bad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, oh, okay,
I can get used to this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Then now I'm just going insane. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Now I'm like, nothing is open,
I can't fucking do anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Can't film any cool videos half the time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Every single thing is like boring shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then now I can't, I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So we're booking a trip home. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't even know what
the fuck is happening </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because every country
keeps changing its mind </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on what's happening. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> So I'm like, wait, do
I book the hotel for, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how many days is lockdown? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> When will they get rid of it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Are you? Are you getting rid of it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Tell me if you're getting rid
of it. I would like to know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> So it's really difficult right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Isn't home quarantine an option though? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, in the UK, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> You can quarantine in your
own home or in a hotel. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then Japan might
be doing or is doing-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Vaccine passports. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think that's to
return to Japan, I think. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, to return to Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Which apparently, you
could apply from the 26th, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> my birthday, woo. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The ultimate birthday present. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Which is when we get
our second dose as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> So yeah, I don't know what's happening. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I guess I'll figure it out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What's the first
thing you're going to do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> when you go back to England? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's what I was going to ask as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Pub? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I am going straight to the fucking pub. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Check into the hotel, I guess? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean that's the practical answer, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - But after that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> After you've settled
down at the hotel room, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what's the first thing you want to go to? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Tesco's? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Tesco's meal deal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Actually, I want a fucking meal deal. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They'll probably have one at the airport. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I'll probably get a
meal deal at the airport. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Tesco's meal deal, banging. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Three pound, fuck, dude. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Choice of my favorite sandwich fillings. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - But if it's the airport,
it's probably like seven pound. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I guess it's like four. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's just gonna be so weird
going to a shop or a Tesco's. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I genuinely miss airports. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I miss going to an airport. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I miss-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just chilling at the
airport waiting for my flight. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You get to watch so much
shit when you're on a flight. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've haven't been able
to watch TV in so long, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause I haven't been on a flight. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You get so much watching
done when you're on a plane. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm chilling in the
lobby, having a coffee. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> When you finally you've checked in, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> your bags are in the thing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's actually kind of chill,
that hour before your flight. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I like the feeling of
going on a long haul flight, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> just knowing-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause it kind of like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> aside from the long
haul part of the flight, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just like the feeling of knowing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it feels like I'm going on a holiday. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It feels like I'm going away for a while. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's, there's
something about going to, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to the airport of your home country. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> It just feels like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, mum's cooking
or something like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It just feels, I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It just, there's something about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I know what you mean, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because every time I go visit Thailand </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I step out and I see the Thai airport, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm just like, oh, I'm
getting all nostalgic </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's just the fucking airport. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> It smells different. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - There's some guy shouting at you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no, no. Every
country smells different. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And I don't know why it is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I totally get that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But I literally step out
of the airport, go to the, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the Thai airport has this certain smell, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Gatwick and Heathrow
has this certain smell. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm just like, I can't
describe what it is, but I just, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it just feels comforting. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I didn't know that
airports smell different </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> until you go off the
airplane and you're like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> damn, I recognize this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - "I recognize this." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I dunno if this is the
talk of a madman right now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, no, I get that whole smell thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I don't. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like when certain smells
trigger certain memories. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just feel like it's the
breathability of the country, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, like some-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That makes less sense. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because when you land in Japan, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> depending on which airport
you land, the air is stuffy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - When I landed in San
Francisco, I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Fuck, this air sucks." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm breathing it in, I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Oh my God, the pollution." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're literally just
saying the same thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> as what he said but just rephrased. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, he said smells. I'm
like, pollution level. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like Tokyo-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - How can you tell the pollution levels? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, when you breathe in. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Can you not breathe the
quality of air? You can't tell? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I can, but-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, but I can't do it at
different fucking airports. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I can. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What are you, a fucking bloodhound? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - When I land in the fucking country, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I step off the plane,
I take a deep breath, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm like, this air's shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why is this insane? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He called me the fucking insane one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - You literally breathe
the air and you're like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this air is polluted. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It literally sounds like
the stupidest superpower. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - When I went to-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I can tell pollution
levels in the air I breathe. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - LA has horrible air,
and San Francisco had-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Most big cities have horrible air. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Depends. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's what makes up the city. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I can't tell the air pollution
differing from most cities. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, for example, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> there's a difference
between Bangkok and London, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Tokyo's awful. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Tokyo's air is horrible. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Tokyo's fine. It's fine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What are you talking about? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You don't know 'cause
you've been here too long. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What are you talking about? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Tokyo's fine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It is not. It tastes like shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> When I breathe it in,
I don't like the smell. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't like the taste. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Navi] Jakarta is horrible. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Anywhere in Southeast Asia is horrible. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Literally go to anywhere in
Southeast Asia, go to China. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're not selling me on it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Man] Singapore is fine, though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yo, fuck off. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Singapore is not fine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're literally
surrounded by countries. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I landed in Singapore Airport </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was like, this is
a really pretty airport. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> God, it smells like shit, though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's why the airport
has so much plants. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> With the first breath, it lies to you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So you think, oh, it's actually good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Then you leave the plant fucking-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I've seen their airport. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just full of plants
and shit. That's why. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's a really pretty airport. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Out of every airport I've been to, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Singapore Airport is by far
the best fucking airport. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - A hundred percent. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And I have no idea why
the Singaporean Airport-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know which country
has the best tasting air </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> upon landing in my experience so far? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Amsterdam had the best air. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> When I got off that plane, I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> damn, this is some clean air. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I can agree with that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - See, even you can agree. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> When I got in Charles de Gaulle in Paris, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, put me back
on the fucking plane. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Get me outta here. It's
bad enough I'm in Paris, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> let alone having to
fucking breathe this air. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was like that when I landed in JFK. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, my God.
- In New York, I was like-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey retches) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - The New York air, you're like, "Bruh." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't even need studies to
tell me this air is polluted. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This is what I'm saying! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You can tell, when you get
off the plane, you breathe, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're like, ooh, this is rough. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, but that's the same logic </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> as what Garnt was saying about-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, he was saying smell. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It smells different to me.
Maybe it's the same thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're always biased
about your hometown airport. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> You're always biased. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think that-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I guarantee people living
in New York from New York </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is like, JFK has the best smelling airport </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> because it smells like home. Guaranteed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Maybe I just don't
know what fresh air is, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I'm a city boy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was saying to Garnt
when I get the train </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> from London to Wales, like
when I step off the train, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when the train opens and I
breathe in Wales, I'm like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> holy shit, this is what
actual air tastes like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's because you're
from there, though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm like, whoa. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So there's probably a bias. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's not like super industrial. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> There's just fucking fields everywhere. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Me and Connor were walking to the office </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and Connor was like, "God,
this air tastes horrible." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm just like, Connor, what the fuck? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Tokyo air is great. I don't
know what you're talking about. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - What are you on about?
It's like a mega city, bro. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The air is fucked here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - For a city, the Tokyo air is
actually pretty good, I feel. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Could that possibly be
the most wankerish thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that Connor has ever said? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh, the air tastes horrible
here. Get this outta my face." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm just saying, it tastes polluted. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - That could probably be
the most privileged thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you could have said in your life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - "My air is better than yours." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - "My air is better." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Bring me my fresh air,
canister, won't you? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Connor's mum comes to visit from Wales </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and she just brings like a jar of air. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> She's like, "Connor, breathe this in." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> What did Meilyne write? Did
she write "incest" again? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - She's giving me the air quality. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> What is this? Is this the rating? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Higher is better? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Meilyne] Lower is better. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's bullshit, there's no way. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Let me see this, let me see this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Also, Rhyl is terrible. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So, air quality index. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So, the higher it is,
the more polluted it is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Amsterdam, 69. Nice. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> San Fran is 31. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I hate the fact that we've
got the whole fucking office </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> to laugh at the number 69. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> San Fran air quality index is 31. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And then Wales is 68. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is Rhyl. Doesn't count. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Rhyl's a shithole. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So basically, what
Meilyne is saying is that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> San Fran air quality is
twice as better as Wales. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's fucking biased as fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Meilyne's from San Francisco. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's why Meilyne pulled that shit out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - She just came up with a random number. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - No fucking way. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - She's like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> "Facts don't care about
your feelings, Connor." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Maybe they took that out
in some vineyard somewhere, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where there's perfect air, but
that city is fucking awful. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Your nostrils are dirty. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Connor's got those
dirty Welshmen nostrils. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - If you're born and raised in the city, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> your nostril hair is longer. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Did you know that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Google it, Google it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Where'd you get this piece of-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - On the next episode of Scientology. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because your nostrils
need to filter more shit, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so it naturally just grows longer. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I get that, but where
the fuck did you read that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know, I just heard it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I read it somewhere. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It's true. Look it up. Google it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, I believe the logic
because it's just like-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's why Meilyne has
these massive bushes going on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> She's gonna kill me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm going to get a
death threat after this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> While Navi looks it up,
it's true. But, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know why I heard about that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I dunno, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Navi] There is a research about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is there actually research about this? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Called "How Climate
Helped Shape Your Nose." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, yeah, no, I get
that, but nose hairs? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Type in what I said. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Nostril hair, I'm still searching. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Type in "nostril hair length, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> correlation city."
- I feel sorry for the person </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> who actually did a full-on study on this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Who woke up one day and was just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> "You know what? I want to
measure nostril hair length." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - "My friend's nose hairs
are longer than mine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> There has to be a reason behind that." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - We need to know these things. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We don't know enough about the human body. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> We need to know everything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So we can just tell what
the fuck's going on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, is this like
when you were talking about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> fucking mouth breathers and all that shit? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Mouth breathers having no chin. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't know if this is
one of those lies or not. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It could be. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> But, in my head, it's one of
those things where I'm like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't even care if this
is bullshit, it makes sense. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Weren't you scared? Because
you were going to the dentist </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to get not retainers, but the-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The mouth guard. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The mouth guard thing.
And you were just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "I don't want to breathe--" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Generally, it's better to breathe </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> through your nose, anyway,
just for air quality. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Especially when it has to filter </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> through all those nose hairs. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It has to fucking filter through. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - All right, Navi. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - All right, Navi, what is it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, there is a study in like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but it's a very old article. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - "Study," he says. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - There is a study on Tumblr. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I could be chatting out
of my ass for all I know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel like you are, Connor. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - If there are any nose
hair experts watching this, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> could you leave it down in the
comments, please? Thank you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Navi] "The Nose Hair
Indicator for Air Pollution." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That sounds like an Onion article. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That doesn't sound real. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Navi] I know, it doesn't sound real. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - The nose hair-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It would make sense, though, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If you were born in a place
that was more polluted, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> naturally, it would make sense
that your body would want-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel like that's something
your mum says to be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> "It's a good thing you're
not in the city, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They have long nose hairs
in the city, Connor." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - "You don't have to trim
your nose hairs, boy." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like a wives' tale. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I always felt like I had
a long nose hair anyway. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I'm like, fuck, imagine
if I was born in the city. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'd have Tarzan's crotch in my nose. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Navi] So, interactive
indicator of poor air quality </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> using nose hair length as a rough metric </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for just how much nasal
fiber one would need to catch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and filter harmful particulate
matter in ages over 10. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - That sounds like I'm right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Navi laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Navi] But it sounds ridiculous, though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I literally stopped listening </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> halfway through that sentence. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Did you get that off WikiHow? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Also, I don't know why, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I started getting recommended videos about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> breathing from your mouth </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I dunno why I was getting
recommended this stuff, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I watched it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - "Watched by other mouthbreathers." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I watched it, and it was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was one of those videos
where it's like, this is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this would be, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if I wasn't dumb as fuck,
this would be so convincing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It felt so manipulative, these videos. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> They were like, "Look, there's twins. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> One of them was allergic to hamsters </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they had a hamster in their room. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And thus he couldn't
breathe through his nose </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and look what happened to
his chin. It's all gross." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - What, they just showed
a fucking picture of Leafy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> or something like that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why you gotta do him like that, man? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's bullying, bro.
We'll get demonetized. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - One of them is Leafy and the
other guy is like chin dude. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was like one had
a clearly defined chin. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like buff as shit Chad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - One had a clearly defined chin </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and one had the, I don't
even know what you call it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's not really a chin. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It kind of like leads into it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And that's generally
believed to be unattractive </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> amongst Sigma male people. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I love that as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's where your chin is
getting swollen into your neck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Kinda, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's one of those things
where you're like, huh, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone I did meet who I feel
like had that kind of face, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> did breathe through their mouth, I think. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then it's one of those
things where it kind of, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it builds on your ignorance of it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and your anecdotal evidence of it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But then I, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I saw more videos about it
and I was like, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the more I feel like it,
the more this is like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> feels like some kind
of Sigma male bullshit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know what I mean? I
felt like I was getting fed, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I don't know how accurate it is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because then I start watching videos about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> apparently doctors who specialize in, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what they'll do is, they'll,
fuck what do they do? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They'll do something
so that when you sleep, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when you normally do it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that you breathe through your mouth </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and they'll go, "Look, it's fixed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> His chin is fucking normal." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - What, they're just
like, "Here's some tape. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Put it on your mouth while you sleep." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was one of those things-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - His chin is normal. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I didn't particularly
care to learn more about it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or check how real it was. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But now it's in your head. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And now you're just
like, "But what if I do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> breathe through my nose?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I generally want to breathe
through my nose anyway, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because it's just the whole of, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when you breathe through your mouth, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it isn't being filtered and shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'd like to live as long as I can, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> so I can be as stubborn as
I can for as long as I can. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Maybe I can become a Japanese politician </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and make life hell for
all the young people. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Full circle, baby. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, I feel like you do breathe </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> through your nose most of the time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You can only tell who
the mouth breathers are, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> No, no, no. Let me finish my sentence. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> You can only tell who the mouth
breathers are when you like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're in a hotel room. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And there's always the one
snorer who is just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know sometimes when
you're bunking with-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I snore sometimes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Sometimes. When you're really tired, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but sometimes you are
with a group of mates </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you know who the
fucking snorer is, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's like a fucking
time limit of just like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> "All right, I've got literally
half an hour to fall asleep </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or I'm not sleeping tonight." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it's not just the snorers, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because there are the snores
that do it through their nose </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then there's the snorers
that do it through their mouth. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, you can tell when people
snore through their mouth. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, it's so weird, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I grew up breathing
through my mouth. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> So I was a mouth breather
when I would sleep, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when I was a kid. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But that's because I had
like horrible hay fever, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so my nose was constantly
blocked all the time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> So I literally used to sleep-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It sounds like a lowkey insult. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, "I knew you were a
fucking mouth breather, Joey." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It is. It's used as an insult. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's used as predominantly an insult. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - A fucking mouth breather. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because it's-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - By who? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - A lot of people use it as an insult. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Not me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's a pretty good descriptive insult </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I feel like, you know,
as much as I wouldn't use it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you get a very good picture of
what they're trying to paint, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when someone calls you a mouth breather. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It sounds funny, I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - You fucking mouth breather. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Fucking mouth breather, God damn it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I just became, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> for a little bit, I
definitely became paranoid </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> that I was breathing through my mouth. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Am I becoming a mouth breather? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I remember that stage. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'd be like, oh my God, my
breathing's off 10 seconds. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> My fucking chin. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> But then, because I feel like
I have a semi-defined chin, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I guess. I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Semi-defined chin. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I haven't got this Chad level-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You have a nose breather chin. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I was like, yeah, I
did breathe through my nose </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as a kid, so it makes sense. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But then again, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like it all goes
on anecdotal evidence, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, everything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know how accurate it is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it felt like pseudoscience
when I was watching this shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Pretty much. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was enough to make me care, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> even though I know I shouldn't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Now you've made a lot
of people self-conscious. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Everyone watching this is gonna be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh shit, do I breathe through my mouth?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - 90% of people are just doing this like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Do I have a chin? Am I good? Am I good?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Isn't it sad that we
give a shit about chins? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't care about chins. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why do we care about chins? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Dunno. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Did your parents ever
tell you an old folk tale </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> or something to get you
to do something as a kid? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, yeah, all the time.
- I dunno, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I dunno what Japanese things there are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because in Thailand, it's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> one of the things is
if you eat on the bed, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then you'll get, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when you reincarnate in your next life, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're gonna reincarnate as a snake. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm just remembering this now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That sounds epic! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm down, sign me up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And that was what I was told </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> to not get me to eat on the bed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I don't, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I guess it worked because I
hate eating on the bed now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Japan is infamous for all
these Proverbs and wives' tales. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> One of them was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you sleep immediately after you eat, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> then you turn into a cow. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think Thailand had something
similar to that as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I guess. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think my mum stopped telling me these </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because whenever my mum told me them, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I would immediately go and try them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just, as a kid, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I just never believed
anything people told me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> When people would be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't walk under ladders or some shit, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause apparently it's
superstitious, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think it's a safety issue. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Or a black cat walking past, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I would just go and do all those things. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'd be like, I don't, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember one time my mum was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "What the fuck are you doing?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I just kept opening the umbrella in doors. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, I want to see
if something bad happens. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I just kept opening it indoors. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - In Japan as well, there's that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - And nothing happened. I was like, oh. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, that's the thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, some Japanese
Proverbs are based on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> actual facts that are
harmful to your body. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So the sleeping after
you eat thing is actually </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> has a little bit of logic to it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because if you do sleep
immediately after you eat, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then all the gastric stuff
goes up your esophagus and it-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why'd it make me so damn sleepy? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Burns your esophagus
and damages your throat. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I'm like, oh, okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, there's actual reasoning
behind that, that's cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But then there are some which just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't whistle at night
because snakes will come. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm like, snakes are literally deaf. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Bro, that sounds amazing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We got a snake army.
- They have no ears. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Snake army. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - How snake charmers, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it isn't from the music,
it's from the movement. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - From the vibrations. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, the movements. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's literally the movement of this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The movement of the
guy that they follow. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - How did snake charmers start? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - They just wake up one
day and they're like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "You know what? I wanna charm some snakes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I got a flute. I got a basket." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - White people are stupid. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Do snake charmers even exist anymore? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - You don't really charm them, do you? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You just make them dance a little bit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right, but is that a thing that's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> is there a person out there
somewhere in the world </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that's like, "Yes, I am a
professional snake charmer." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Probably. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's probably a mouth breather. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why, why? You're obsessed
with that word now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Now that you've told me it's an insult-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - All snake charmers are mouth breathers. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - If there's fucking psychics out there, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> there can be any job, I
don't really give a fuck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I just feel, though,
it's one of those pseudo </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> occupations that were kind of
very timely back in the day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, you know, a soothsayer, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No one goes around being like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "I'm a professional soothsayer." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - What's a soothsayer? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They're just like budget magicians. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, what is that, actually? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - A soothsayer is a person who goes around </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and tells fortunes and
tells your future and stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, that's a load of shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - You mean, like a fortune teller? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Kind of, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's an occupation that shouldn't-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - But soothsayer sounds way cooler. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's an occupation that should have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> gone out of business. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think it did go out of business. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, fortune telling. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, fortune telling. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - How that shit still exists, I dunno. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I have friends who do
that and I'm just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're a fucking idiot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, really?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - With like what, the crystal
ball or the tarot cards or? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - They'll read their hands and stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, palm reading. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I'm like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> have you seen some of the fish out there? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Do you think God really
gave enough of a fuck </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to worry about putting
inscriptions on your hand </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> of what your life's going to be like? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Man couldn't even finish half the fucking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fishes in the ocean. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Are you serious, bro? Like, come on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No, no, he did not inscribe, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he doesn't give a fuck about you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, I like doing
it every now and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just to see what they say. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - We like to feel interesting as people. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's an egotistical need that we have. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But I genuinely believe that
we are not interesting things. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It is up to us to make
our own lives interesting. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And horoscopes and all
that and all that nonsense, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just don't believe in any of it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause I'm like, nobody
gives a fuck about this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You don't believe in star
signs or anything like that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - No.
- Honestly, I don't. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, me either. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Anyway. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, me either. Anyway. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - The whole blood type, the
whole lines on your hands. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> All of that shit, I just
think it's fucking nonsense. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think it's cool. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And when someone tells me, I'll listen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think it's cool for
the sake of entertainment. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I view it as more of
just an entertainment thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> or like a conversation starter, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's not something I take seriously. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But I'm like, is your
life is so fucking boring, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where this is the stuff
that gets you excited? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This is what you look forward to? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> You need lies to tell yourself </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to feel like you're
doing something in life? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Just go and fucking do something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Some people need that, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Some people need that encouragement. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Stop. Go and do something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Stop reading your fucking hands. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Only mouth breathers do that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The reason why you have
no chin is not because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> of a line in your hand, okay? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's because you breathe
through your mouth. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Connor's like, "Fuck reading your hands, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but please breathe through
your mouth. That's real." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think that there's
behavior that you can do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that can affect your health
and your body, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's, I feel like that's fair to say. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, I feel-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But I think that no mystical entity </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> decided to carve some
fucking lines in your hand, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and that would decide how your
personality was going to be. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No, fuck no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, yeah, there
is a clear difference. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because I feel like there
is a lot of little things </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> you just don't know about your body </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then you don't figure
it out until you hit like 30 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or something. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And then you realize, oh-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We also don't know a lot of the stuff </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about the human body. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We're still barely understanding
how the mind works, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, we're still fucking
decades or centuries off </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to figuring out how that works. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, all of America
doesn't even have bidets. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> So how the fuck are they gonna have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> scientific breakthroughs? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I can't believe it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You can't have a
scientific breakthrough, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not with a bidet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They call themselves
a first world country. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Not having any bidets. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If they haven't figured that out, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> how the fuck are they going to figure out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what's going on in the brain? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Sorry, go ahead, Garnt. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I completely forgot-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - You were talking about
how they haven't discovered </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> anything about the brain. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, it's just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> part of growing up and growing
into your thirties, I guess, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is just realizing that sometimes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you just have a problem with your body. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And like, as a kid, I
thought everything's fixable. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Everything will go back
to normal, eventually. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And then you don't realize that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sometimes you just have a problem </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and then you just learn to live with it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It's sad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - You just kinda hope that
you don't get a problem </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that's too insufferable. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Life-threatening, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like kidney stones.
Fuck, if I get those, fuck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Everyone around my age </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just starts talking about their knees. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And luckily enough, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I haven't felt anything
about my knees yet. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like lower back pain,
knees, neck pain, headaches. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's just like God decided, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> all right, everyone gets a debuff at 30. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Everyone gets a different one, you know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like the moment you turn 30, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> God comes to your sleep and
just clocks you in the knees. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, "You're 30 now!" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah. I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I watched that video of, what was it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> It was probably on your guys
recommended as well of like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> how do kidney stones-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was just going to watch that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I had it on the "Watch
Later," I never did. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - A super interesting
video, I recommend it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> But it's like-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Explain it to me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Basically, it's this guy who, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he got big off Tiktok, I think, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because he's like a, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he works in forensics or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But basically he uses the
bodies that, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you donate to science </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and to study things about
the human body, basically. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And this guy got really big on Tiktok. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I forgot his name. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Basically just doing short videos of like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Did you know that this is a real stomach? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm going to open it up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and show you how food is
digested," or whatever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And he has a YouTube channel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and he literally gets a real
human body that was donated-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Where is he getting these--? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - People donate their bodies
to science after they die. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's Tiktokers. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - He works in some kind of
scientific research facility-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - He's fucking Dexter or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - "Here's what I dug up earlier!" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like the modern day Dexter. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He's not a forensics expert.
He's just a Tiktoker. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Has anyone checked
this guy's credentials? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is he legit? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - He's just insane. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm sure if I turned up
with a body being like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "No, no, a guy donated it." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, some guy donated it, very kindly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - "Officer, it was a donation." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - But basically, he
gets a proper human body </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and opens up the kidneys </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and explains how kidney stones form </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and why they fucking hurt and stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> man, I can't imagine something that big </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> traveling through my dick. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - How big is it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Some of these are big, bro. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Some of these can go like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - But you have to just hope
they break down in your kidneys. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause they just can't
go through the tubes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They use ultrasound-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Ultrasonic? Yeah, ultrasonic on your like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kidneys to break it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - They literally scream at
it to crumble, essentially. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey yells) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt yells) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then it shatters. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> That's literally what they do, sometimes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's actually the title
one audio they play. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey yells) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Get this shit out of me! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But in worst case scenarios
where not even that works, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that it's so crystallized and so hard, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they literally go through your
penis with a pair of tweezers </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to just pull it out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Grant groans) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I did not need to hear this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm sorry. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I did not need to hear that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, this guy.
Institute of Human Anatomy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> That's the guy. Really
cool Tiktok channel. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sounds legit. Let's just
hope he's not a serial killer. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, he sounds nice. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't want any tweezers
going in my peepee. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I can't. I literally
can't handle hospitals or, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I just faint immediately doing anything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's why I'm really
nervous to get older </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> because you have to do, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know, when you hit like a certain age, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you have to do annual
colonoscopy and shit like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just not looking forward to the day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> where a camera has to go up my arse, like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Hospitals are pretty,
the only fear that I have, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that I think it's irrational. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I guess, is that what it counts as? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, 'cause lots of bad
stuff happen at hospitals. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I know that shit's
gonna happen to my body, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not used to it, I don't like it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't like anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I just, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I always get so lightheaded
'til I faint. It's horrible. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You scared of needles
or anything like that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, I don't give a shit about needles. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's operations and stuff terrify me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's just things entering my
body that shouldn't be there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Even when I went to the
dentist the other day, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> just having the fucking shit in my mouth, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fucking loud as fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey imitates whirring) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was getting lightheaded.
I was like, fuck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, that's why everyone
hates going to the dentist. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause you hear sounds in your mouth </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that just shouldn't be made anywhere near. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's weird 'cause I
didn't give a fuck as a kid. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I didn't care at all when I
had to go and do that stuff. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But I dunno what happened
between after age 18 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> where I suddenly started
being terrified of it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not really sure why. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I can barely give myself eyedrops, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> let alone something going into my body. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, sometimes you have that friend </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> who's had like 10 surgeries. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, how the fuck are you doing this? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> How are you not fucking
freaking out all the time? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Maybe they are, I dunno. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like when my dad comes back </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from his annual colonoscopy, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just like, you
know, it's the same vibe </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as, yeah, I just went to the pub. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think I legit would faint. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - How do I tell the doctor,
listen, I'm a little bitch, bro. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know what's gonna happen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> You gonna loop me up
or something? I dunno. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm lucky enough to have
never needed to have surgery </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or anything like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> But just the concept of
it fucking terrifies me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> That's one thing that
fucking keeps me up at night. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Even if it's not a
life-threatening surgery. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - The whole idea of being under anesthesia </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> just terrifies me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I hate the surgeries
where you're not on it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Or you're on light one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like the surgeries when, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I think my parents, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my mum had something with a heart </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and she had to be awake for it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And that sounded terrifying. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, because apparently, I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It sounded awful. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Apparently, you can feel it and stuff. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey and Garnt groan) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, it's terrible. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Exactly, right, it's horrible. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But if you have to have it,
you have to have it, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But I think maybe it came from, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I had to get, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'cause I had hemophilia where I'd like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if I bleed, you know, don't stop bleeding. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I had to go like every three
or six months to the hospital </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to go and do tests just to make
sure it wasn't getting worse </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or getting any better. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Luckily it didn't get any
worse, but yeah, it was awful. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I hated going. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it was just a terrible
experience because-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think it's because of
the atmosphere in a hospital. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That hospital atmosphere. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So the ward I'd always had to go to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> was just filled with old
people that were dying. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And some of them couldn't
even think or talk. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I felt so bad 'cause
they would talk to me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and they just didn't understand. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It scared the fuck out
of me when I was like 13. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, oh my God, oh Jesus. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because it's that glimpse
into a possible future, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Of like, "Oh, shit, I could
be like that one day." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - And the smell. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Talking about smells, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> hospitals do definitely
have a distinct smell. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Even thinking about the
smell makes me uncomfortable. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's what I hate
about the dentist as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The dentist has that type
of smell that's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey exclaims) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what is that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Dentists smell sanitized. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like it's overly sanitized. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> You know where it's
like, this is too clean. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it's like you just
stepped into a crime scene. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Everything's bleached to shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, everything's bleached to shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I hate it when the
doctor doesn't talk at all. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Doesn't crack jokes or anything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I like it, 'cause when the nurse, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when the nurse is funny as fuck, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel so good. I feel like I'm chill. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> When the nurse is cracking jokes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> She's like, "Yeah, I do
this all the fucking time." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And she's telling me about funny, old </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> other patients and stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel so more at ease. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> When the doctor doesn't say anything, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, what's going on? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Talk to me, what's going on? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - When the doctor doesn't
smile or anything like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm like, whoa, what's going
on, bro? Come on, tell me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I know you're being
serious with your job, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but you know, help me calm
down a little bit, dude. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, fucking hell. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like we're at a job interview. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I remember there was only one time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I ever wanted to go to the hospital </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and it was this one specific hospital </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I think I went to one time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> had a GameCube right when it came out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - What is this mythical hospital? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Why don't more hospitals do that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I was like, all right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I saw it as I was leaving, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, next time I
come in, I'm gonna play it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then I went and someone
fucking stole the controllers. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So they had a GameCube with
no fucking controllers. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> They're like Super Mario
Sunshine, Super Mario Strikers, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Super Mario Party Brawl. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They had Brawl somehow. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You couldn't even buy that game often. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why did they have this at a hospital? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think it was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a charity had given them or donated, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a room where, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause it was like, when I was like 12. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> So it was for the kids. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, that makes the asshole
who stole the controllers </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even worse. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Some fucking dickhead stole
a fucking GameCube controller </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from a children's hospital </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> that had been donated from a charity. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What? Who does that? Who does that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's probably a mouth breather. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I feel like we're gonna get in trouble. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know if this is
a controversial insult. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is it a controversial one? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't even know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't even know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - If it is, we apologize. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just can't take that
insult seriously anymore. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Navi] Apparently, it was an insult </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> back in the 1940s America. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's been around for that long? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Jesus Christ. This is the
first I'm hearing of it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - This is like, if I
taught you the word bussin, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> you found that it was racist or something. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, "Shit, I've been
saying it the whole episode." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I wanna know the motivation
of someone who steals a game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> controller from a-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It was already a rare console at the time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Honestly, it's probably
another kid, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was probably another
kid, I imagine it was. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Another kid who just
doesn't have a GameCube </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> or is wanting a GameCube. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Or they stole a GameCube from somewhere </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and forgot the controllers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause GameCubes, at that time, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I think were quite
expensive and they were, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean the games aren't
cheap 'cause it's Nintendo. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, the games still aren't cheap. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Imagine you're rich
enough where your parents </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> buy you a GameCube but
not enough controllers, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so you steal it from a
kid's hospital. Like what? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What an arsehole. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I dunno. Really strange. Really bizarre. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Fuck that kid. I was so
excited to play fucking Brawl. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What were you in the hospital for? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I dunno, I was just
getting checkups, I think. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - You're like, "Mum, can we
go to the hospital, please?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I know I went to the hospital a lot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I know I had a lot of, I think, injuries, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> but all of them ended up
being just chill ones. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just like, no big deal.
- Just like a bruise </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like bruise, sprains, nothing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Luckily I just never broke bones, so. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know how I got so lucky, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause I fucked my body up so many times. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know how I got so lucky. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like, "Why is
my kid so enthusiastic </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to go to the hospital?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - And also, sometimes you get like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> your parents would buy you a
sweet or something afterwards. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They'd be like, "Yeah,
you get some nice food. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Because you went to hospital." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I thought when you said sweet, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I thought you meant like a hotel suite. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just bought me a suite. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We call 'em sweets in the UK. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If you buy chocolate or
that, it's like sweets. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Do you know what we
call them in Australia? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Lollies. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - We have, if they're lollipops. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Do you refer to all candy as--? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - All candy are lollies. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - We refer to lollies as just lollipop. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - But in Australia,
they're all called lollies. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> There's this infamous meme
photo of me from back in the day </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where I'm at an airport in Sydney. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I just thought it was really funny. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I just posed next to
this sign that just said, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Bagged Lollies," and I just did that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's made its rounds on meme forums. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm glad that the lollipop is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the worst candy of all time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause now I can say, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I hate lollies in every sense of the word. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> No, I remember when I used
to get it like age 10, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they give you a lollipop. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You're like, for fuck's sake. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's the cola flavored fucking lollipop. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I like the cola flavored ones. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fuck, that sucks, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You mean the Chupa Chups, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - The cola flavored
Chupa Chups are the best. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, fuck off. Cola flavored
sweets are just not good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - They suck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like eating hard, flat Coke. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And that's the best way I can describe it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like flat Coke is bad enough as it is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Let's make it hard. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I never liked it. Who liked lollipops? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They fucking sucked. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, I'm not going to
go out of my way to eat a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> fucking Chupa Chups now, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I won't complain if
someone gives me one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was made to make kids
eat sweets for a long time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> that aren't actually a lot of sweets. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was smart. I realized this is waste, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> this is not optimized. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can eat way more than this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I have teeth to break this down. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I hated it. I'd never
go for the lollipops. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - What's your favorite type of candy? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like the one that you always go back to. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think chocolate is
the best sweet thing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but that's often not considered candy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It's kind of in its own thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I really liked the-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Haribo. I love Haribo. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sour Haribo were pretty fucking good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I like sour Haribo. I
like the laces, you know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, the sour strips, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, the sour strips,
the rainbow sour strips? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Those things slap. I love those. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - In Australia, did you
have the penny sweets? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Penny sweets? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, we had this in the UK. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, where you go to a, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> literally a fucking candy store </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and you get given a bag
and you just fill it up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yes, yes, yes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean those, I think those
fucking candies slapped. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - The biggest one in
Wales is in my town and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's literally like the size of this set. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's huge. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Every single wall is candy. It's good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And they used to have these
really fucking sour things. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Like they're the most
sour sweet in the world. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> They're just dunked in that
fucking horrible sour stuff </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you gave us that one video. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It was just fun. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I love sour candy, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. Sour candy is my
favorite, but it's awful though, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'cause you can't drink anything afterwards </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and water tastes bad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Water tastes sweet, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I kinda like that though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - What? No. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's something about
that, where it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> every other drink tastes
like absolute shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> But when the water is
sweet, I'm just like, ooh. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> That's kinda nice. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, I mean, I don't
think it's that bad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's fucking water. It's just water, bro. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think I'm too British, I
think I like crisps the most. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They're just my favorite snack. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Walkers crisps? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, Walkers crisps are amazing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We have so many good crisps in the UK. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause it's like a national identity. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like every single lunch must
have a bag of crisps in it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Not chips, crisps. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Crisps.
- Crisps. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Nah, they're called chips. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We have so many good brands of crisps. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I fucking love Monster
Munch. I love McCoy's. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Monster Munch sounds epic. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Dude, Monster Munch fucking slaps. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I will say the best crisps I miss, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Walker's Max Paprika Flavor. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's just McCoy's
kind of, but like lighter. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> McCoy's are thick. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Nah, nah, nah. 'Cause
Walker's Max has the right-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - These must sound fucking
stupid to any Americans. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> They're like, "What are they saying?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm just like, what are these? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - The Walkers Max crisps
have the right amount of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oiliness to them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's just like, it's a little unhealthy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's kind of weird, 'cause
we give like, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know what the standard lunch is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in Australia or America. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> But if you ever have a lunch in the UK, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it normally just comes with crisps. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's a given that-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, like school lunch? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Most lunches come with a bag of crisps. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I guess like, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I used to eat chips
and stuff during lunch. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - But then it's really
common as well to just have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> tons of bags of crisps
in your house in the UK. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, we have that as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Every meal deal you get
in the UK includes crisps. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like it doesn't matter if
it's fucking Tesco's or-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - You go to Subway, there's crisps. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You go to Greg's, there's crisps. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It's always like, it comes with the lunch. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's such a staple in
the British lifestyle. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What, just like salt flavored or? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, we have so many flavors, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I think they're amazing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've yet to find many
brands of crisps that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't like in the UK. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like Quavers, I love Quavers. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I love, even though you have to buy-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, Quavers, have you seen these before? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Basically cheese flavored
like thin curls of-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, they're cheese flavored, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> but they don't taste
anything like Cheetos. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, it's much lighter, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you can eat seven bags in one sitting, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> no problem, 'cause it
just tastes like air. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The whole thing is like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's light and has two calories </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, but it has like
two bites in the bags, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so of course it's two calories. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, that's what it looks like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> They're fucking amazing, bro. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Never seen that.
- I think those are okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We have these Pom Bears. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What are they called?
They're in France as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Pom Bears? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, like the bears
crisps. They're just bears. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've never seen those before. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They're really good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What the fuck are they? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They're in Europe, too. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, they're German, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They have those there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But the other British ones, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> dude, Monster Munch is my favorite. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Chris loves Monster Munch
too, I think, and McCoy's. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> He's really British, though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - McCoy's is okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I still stand by the Walkers Max. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Let me Google British crisps.
There's so fucking many. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - This has been like a
fucking tangent, hasn't it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - All Australians watching
this can agree that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the best chips we have
is Red Rock Deli chips. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That is the one brand
that I've been saying, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> since the beginning of my
career, I will happily sell. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - We recently, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about at this time, before I left, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> we recently started having
a boom of high-end crisps </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the UK. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, you mean the kettle chips? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Kettle chips are the bomb.
- I do like them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Tyrrells are massive now in the UK. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Tyrrells? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They're called Tyrrells. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You sometimes see them in
Japan, they import them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Really? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - As like premium British crisps. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This one's in French.
They're called French Fries. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Do you have these?
- I think so. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They're just crisps that
are shaped like french fries. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, we have those. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - They're really fucking good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't think they're
called French Fries, though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> There's a different brand for those. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - We have Squares by Walkers as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I fucking love Squares!
- Ah, Squares fucking slaps. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay, now you're talking, Connor. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Now you're talking. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Dude, they're so good.
- Squares? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'll put them on screen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I assume they're square. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They're crispy, salty squares, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and the salt and vinegar
ones are super fucking salty. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They have salt and
vinegar, prawn cocktail, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and cheese and onion. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Prawn cocktail? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've realized cheese and onion
is a very British flavor. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Is it?
- Fucking cheese and onion-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause we don't have cheese
and onion flavored stuff </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> in Australia. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Dude, you're missing out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Cheese and onion is honestly,
I think, the best one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The one brand of chips that
I thought was fucking awesome </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> was when I was in Ireland, I had Tayto's. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Tayto's? I think that's
a specific Irish one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Specific to Ireland, but
the cheese and flavor Tayto's. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Man, orgasmic. They're so fucking good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - But, wait, fuck, what
were we on before that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Squares. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Squares? Squares are really nice. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We also have Hula Hoops. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Hula Hoops? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Do they have these in America?
I'm pretty sure they do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They're just the ones you put on your, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they can fit on your fingers. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They're like rings. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah, I know those.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - We have Nik Naks. I
really like Nik Naks. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I never had those. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's a very like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like marmalade coated crisps. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Marmalade? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right? I think that's what it is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Is that what it is? I
can't remember what it is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We have Wotsits. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - That sounds weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - What are they called,
Wotsits in America as well? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think they have Wotsits in America. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They're like Cheetos. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. They kinda feel like Cheetos. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Jacob's Minis. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Sensations. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I remember Sensations, oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They had premium bagged crisps. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, but these are all
Walkers brands, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, they're all owned by Walkers. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause Walkers is like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> what are they called in America, again? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Lays. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I wish we had this
conversation last week </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when Shu was here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I don't have another
Australian to relate to. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Damn it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - People have like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> apparently there's so
many news organizations </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> in the UK have done tier lists of crisps </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from bottom tier to high tier. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's an after dark-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's a special. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - We also had a bag of crisps
that was really popular. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It was called Salt and Shake. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was like a bag of crisps
that hadn't been salted, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it would come with salt. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And the whole gimmick
of this thing was that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you put the salt in and you'd shake it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - You'd literally salt it yourself. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - And it tasted like shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was about to say,
that's kind of innovative. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because it was just unsalted evenly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Like the salt would stick to the bottom. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then the rest of the
salt's just at the bottom. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was terrible. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> If you come to the UK, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I really highly recommend
trying all our crisps. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't really rate the
Japanese ones too much. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Nah, they're pretty bad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The pizza potato ones are pretty good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know why you
like the pizza potato ones. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. I told Chris, I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> next video that I want to make with him </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> is trying all the Japanese crisps. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause it was just two
super British people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> complaining about crisps. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause there's a lot of meh ones here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Most of the ones you find
here are just pretty meh. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Especially the ones from like the company. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - The flavors they have is so bizarre, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they have Doritos here, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but they're taco flavored and
it does not taste like taco. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, they have Cheetos here as well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it doesn't taste like Cheetos. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - But that's how I feel
about pizza flavored stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, what is the flavor
of pizza anyway, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Crust. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, no crust apparently. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Not a single fucking crust in sight, mate. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You won't see a crust. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - You should love it,
technically. There's no crust. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean it's a pizza. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's a pizza! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's a pizza! You need
the crust in the pizza, j </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just not the crust by itself. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You hearing this? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - This man is dumb. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm not going to start. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We're not gonna start talking about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> fucking pizza crust again. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We've moved on. We've evolved from that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Let's just talk about the patrons </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> before we get onto that tangent. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Talking about people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who are definitely not mouth breathers, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> look at all these Patreons. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I bet it's going to insult
so many people, oh my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I really hope not. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I really hope there isn't
a mouth breathing community </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> on the Internet that's
just gonna come out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But, hey, if you're not a mouth breather, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> then maybe go over to our
Patreon, patreon.com/trashtaste. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'll laugh if this
episode ages super horribly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Probably fucking will. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - This becomes like the next racial slur. </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_01> - I'm literally Googling right now, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Is mouth breathers offensive?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It doesn't matter because
the way Garnt said it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sounded a little too cozy. A little too-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was a hard M on the
word mouth there, Garnt. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't like the way you inflicted that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I hope you enjoyed this
episode of Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - We'll see you guys next week. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It says, "Being called mouth breather </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is used as a derogatory term </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> used to describe someone who is, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> well, here's the urban
dictionary definition, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> literally someone who
lacks enough intelligence </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that they never learned to
breathe through their nose. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - All right, well, that's been
this episode of Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And on that bombshell, good night. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Bye! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (gentle upbeat music) </SPEAKER_01>
