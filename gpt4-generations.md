        'Joey (The Anime Man): Oh, are you talking about "I Just Got Reincarnated as a Washing Machine?!"\n' +
        "Garnt (Gigguk): Oh my god, I can't believe that's an actual anime, man. Does it come with a fabric softer or detergent waifu too?\n" +
        "Joey: You joke, but it actually does. And it's kind of amazing how they managed to pull it off. I don't know whether I should be impressed or disappointed, to be honest.\n" +
        'Connor: Only in the anime world can we find such ridiculous concepts executed to an absurd level of perfection.\n' +
        `Garnt: Honestly, the whole "reincarnated as" genre has gotten so out of hand lately. I wonder what's next! Reincarnated as a toilet brush? Actually, I might be giving someone an idea right now, and I kind of hate myself for that.\n` +
        'Joey: You know what though, as ridiculous as some of these shows are, the popularity just speaks volumes about the creativity and variety we have in the anime industry.\n' +
        `Connor: That's true, but sometimes I fear that it's overshadowing some of the more "traditional" or "serious" anime that comes out each season. For every "Washing Machine" anime, there's a hidden gem buried that people might not have a chance to watch because they're drowning in isekai absurdity.\n` +
        "Joey: Yeah, but that's why we're here, right? To dig out those hidden gems for the viewers of Trash Taste!\n" +
        "Garnt: Absolutely! I think it's our duty as anime connoisseurs to separate the trash from the treasure.\n" +
        'Connor: Speaking of which, any recommendations from this season that you guys think would surprise everyone?\n' +
        `Joey: Oh, I have one. It's called "Moonlit Melody" and it's a beautiful story about a classical pianist who slowly loses her hearing. The animation and music are just stunning.\n` +
        "Garnt: Ah, that sounds right up my alley! I'll be checking that out tonight for sure.\n" +
        "Connor: Well, on that note, I think that's a perfect way to wrap up today's episode. Thanks for joining us for another weirder-than-usual episode of Trash Taste!\n" +
        "Garnt: Don't forget to check out our Twitter and leave a comment with your favorite anime from this season. And as always, we appreciate your support!\n" +
        'Joey: Until next time, stay trashy, everyone!'

        "Joey: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to another episode of Trash Taste! I'm your host for today, Joey, and as always, I'm joined by my boys, Gigguk and Connor.\n" +
        "Gigguk: What's up, guys?\n" +
        'Connor: Hey, everyone!\n' +
        "Joey: So, today we've got something interesting to talk about. Our favorite underrated anime. Boys, what are some hidden gems that you think deserve more love and attention?\n" +
        `Gigguk: Well, personally, I think "Bokurano" is a pretty underrated mecha anime. It's dark, twisted, and has a really interesting premise. Definitely not your typical giant robot show.\n` +
        `Connor: Dude, totally agree with you! That anime messed with my head the first time I watched it. It's not just about mecha fights; it really dives into the psychological aspect. I'd add "Kino's Journey" as well, such a chill and philosophical anime, but it doesn't get the recognition it deserves.\n` +
        `Joey: Both great picks! "Bokurano" definitely took a unique approach to the mecha genre, and "Kino's Journey" is just so captivating with its episodic storytelling. For me, I'd have to say "Haibane Renmei." It's just such a thought-provoking and atmospheric show, but I rarely see anyone talking about it.\n` +
        "Gigguk: Oh, that's a good choice too! It's been a while since I've seen that, but yeah, it has such a unique vibe to it.\n" +
        'Connor: I also think "Monster" is an underrated classic. The atmosphere is dark and the storyline is amazing, but not many people seem to talk about it.\n' +
        'Joey: True, true! There are a lot of hidden gems out there, so guys, make sure to share some of your underrated anime picks with us on Twitter or in the comments!\n' +
        "Gigguk: Make sure to check out these amazing shows if you haven't already.\n" +
        "Connor: And as always, thanks for tuning in to Trash Taste. We'll see you all in the next episode. Sayonara!\n" +

        "Joey: Welcome back everybody to yet another episode of the Trash Taste podcast! I'm your host, Joey, and with me as always are my good buddies, Connor and Garnt.\n" +
        "Garnt: Hey, what's up guys!\n" +
        'Connor: Hello everyone!\n' +
        `Joey: So, today I figured we could have a little chat about something we've all come to love throughout our years in the anime community. Let's talk about "fan service" and how it has developed and changed over time. I mean, it's quite the trashy topic, isn't it?\n` +
        'Garnt: Oh, definitely.\n' +
        'Connor: Perfect for us!\n' +
        `Joey: Right! So, let's start with defining what "fan service" actually means. Garnt, want to give it a go?\n` +
        `Garnt: Sure thing! So, in general, "fan service" is content that essentially caters to the desires of fans, often through sexually suggestive or provocative scenes, but it can also include other elements like references to other works, splashy transformations, or cameos. It's basically anything that creators add to a series to attract and entertain viewers beyond the core story and characters.\n` +
        "Connor: Yeah, and while it's true that fan service has become a pretty big part of the anime culture, it's not exclusive to the medium. You can find it in movies, TV series, comic books, and basically any form of entertainment.\n" +
        `Joey: No doubt about that. So, let's talk about how fan service has evolved throughout the years. Personally, I remember watching anime like "Neon Genesis Evangelion" and "Cowboy Bebop" where the fan service was definitively more subtle compared to some of the stuff we see this nowadays.\n` +
        'Garnt: Yeah, those were definitely different times. Back in the 90s, you would usually get a flash of skin, or maybe a slightly sexy pose, and that was as far as the fan service would go. But over time, creators have started pushing the boundaries, often going all out with shower scenes, beach episodes, and...well, everything ecchi.\n' +
        `Connor: And nowadays, you have entire series that arguably revolve around fan service, like "Highschool DxD" or "No Game No Life." Sometimes it feels like they're competing over who can feature the most colorful lingerie or outrageous scenarios.\n` +
        'Joey: But do you guys think all this catering to the fans is detrimental to anime as a whole? Or is it just a fun, harmless way to engage with the audience?\n' +
        `Garnt: I think, like most things, it depends on how it's done. Well-executed fan service can actually enhance the experience and make things more entertaining. There's even anime where the fan service is a major part of the humor or the story, like "Kill la Kill" or "Food Wars," and it works great.\n` +
        "Connor: I agree, it's all about balance. Some shows can genuinely benefit from some levity or fun added through fan service. But others are just pandering and can really detract from the overall narrative, especially when it's gratuitous.\n" +
        "Joey: Great points, guys. Well, that's our Trash Taste talk about fan service in anime. What do you think about it? Are you a fan of it or do you think it's getting out of hand? Share your thoughts in the comments below! And don't forget to like, share, and subscribe for more of our anime discussions!\n" +

      content: "Host 1: Gigguk: Alright everyone, welcome back to another episode of Trash Taste, the podcast where three anime-loving degenerates talk about whatever the hell we want. I'm Gigguk, joined, as always, by my lovely hosts Joey and Connor.\n" +
        "Host 2: Joey: The Anime Man: What's up, everybody? How ya'll doing?\n" +
        'Host 3: Connor: C-DawgVA: Hey guys, excited to be back for another episode.\n' +
        "Gigguk: So, today we're diving into a topic everyone's got an opinion on - the most controversial anime hot takes!\n" +
        'Joey: Oh boy, this is gonna be a wild ride. Just let it be known, friendships may be destroyed today.\n' +
        'Connor: Yeah, so should we be using a friendship alert system to rate these hot takes?\n' +
        `Gigguk: You know what, let's do it. Hot Take Level 1 - "I disagree." Hot Take Level 2 - "We can't be friends." Hot Take Level 3 - "I'm disowning you as a human being."\n` +
        "Joey: Perfect, alright I'll start off with Hot Take Level 1. Dubbed anime is superior to subbed anime.\n" +
        'Connor: You know, I have to say, Hot Take Level 2. Depending on the anime, I actually like dubbed better. I mean, Cowboy Bebop, for example, is iconic.\n' +
        "Gigguk: Yeah, that's definitely a Hot Take Level 2 for me. While some dubs are amazing, usually the original Japanese voice acting is on another level.\n" +
        "Joey: Alright, let's step it up to Hot Take Level 2. The Monogatari series is just a harem disguised as a masterpiece.\n" +
        "Gigguk: Oof, that's a Level 3 for me. I mean, yes, it has harem elements, but the depth of the storytelling, the characters, and the many layers is phenomenal. Come on, Joey, do you even have taste?\n" +
        "Connor: Actually, I'm with Joey on this one. Monogatari is smartly written, but I couldn't get past the harem feeling for me.\n" +
        'Joey: Thank you, Connor. Okay, Gigguk, your turn.\n' +
        'Gigguk: Alright, brace yourselves. Hot Take Level 3: "Attack on Titan is overrated and Eren is just a bland protagonist with no character development."\n' +
        'Joey and Connor: *simultaneous gasps*\n' +
        "Connor: Dude, that's a Level 3 for me too.\n" +
        "Joey: Yeah, I mean, I haven’t caught up with the manga, but I think it's brilliant, and Eren's character does grow and evolve.\n" +
        'Gigguk: Friends? Still friends, right?\n' +
        'Joey: Yeah, still friends... for now.\n' +
        "Connor: Maybe let's end the hot takes before we all disown each other.\n" +
        "Gigguk: Agreed, let's move on to discussing some of the weirdest anime we've come across.\n" +
        "Joey: Sounds good, and remember, don't take our hot takes too seriously, everyone. It's just a bit of fun!\n" +

        '[C-DawgVA]: That sounds good to me. Want me to start?\n' +
        '[The Anime Man]: Sure, go ahead.\n' +
        `[C-DawgVA]: I think my favorite this year has definitely been "Steins;Gate 0." I've always been a huge fan of the original "Steins;Gate," and the adaptation of "Steins;Gate 0" was just amazing.\n` +
        '[Gigguk]: Ah, "Steins;Gate 0" was definitely great. For me, my favorite this year has to be "Attack on Titan Season 3 Part 2." The reveals, the action, and the emotional moments were all outstanding. What about you, Joey?\n' +
        '[The Anime Man]: Personally, I think "Demon Slayer" has definitely left a huge impact on the anime community this year. I mean, the animation and the story, just everything about it got people talking.\n' +
        '[C-DawgVA]: Oh, for sure. The animation in that was just on another level.\n' +
        '[Gigguk]: So, what are we looking forward to next year?\n' +
        `[The Anime Man]: For me, I can't wait for "Evangelion: 3.0+1.0." It feels like I've been waiting forever for it.\n` +
        `[C-DawgVA]: I'm really excited for "Re:Zero Season 2." I loved the first season, and I'm really curious to see where the story will go.\n` +
        `[Gigguk]: Those both sound great, but I'm looking forward to "The Promised Neverland Season 2." The first season was great, and I heard the manga was fantastic.\n` +

        '[C-DawgVA]: Anyway, it looks like we have a lot to look forward to next year.\n' +

'<joey> So, have you guys played any video games based on anime recently? </joey>\n' +
"<garnt> Yeah, I tried out that new Demon Slayer game. It's pretty fun, but I'm not really a big fan of arena fighters. </garnt>\n" +
"<connor> I played My Hero One's Justice, and it was alright. But, overall, sometimes it feels like anime games tend to be a hit or miss. </connor>\n" +
'<joey> I agree. There are some fantastic ones like Dragon Ball FighterZ, which I think really set the bar high as far as quality and gameplay go. </joey>\n' +
'<garnt> True, but then you have games like the Attack on Titan one that had potential, but it ended up being a bit underwhelming considering the source material. </garnt>\n' +
"<connor> You never know what you're going to get when it comes to video games based on anime, I suppose. </connor>\n" +
"<joey> You know, I wonder why there haven't been many slice of life anime turned into video games. </joey>\n" +
"<garnt> Well, I think it's because slice of life anime isn't as action-packed as something like Dragon Ball or Demon Slayer. Developers might struggle to create interesting gameplay. </garnt>\n" +
'<connor> That being said, I think it would be nice to see a change of pace, like a K-On! rhythm game or something along those lines. </connor>\n' +
'<joey> Yeah, it would be interesting to have a game that relies more on character interactions and development than just battles and fights. </joey>\n' +
"<garnt> Exactly! And with the growing popularity of visual novels and adventure games, I think there's a market for that kind of experience in anime games. </garnt>\n" +
'<connor> How about something like a Persona-like game with characters from various slice of life anime interacting in a high school setting? That could be fun. </connor>\n' +
"<joey> That's an awesome idea! I'd love to see characters like Hachiman from Oregairu, and maybe a few characters from Toradora come together in a game like that. </joey>\n" +
"<garnt> So, a massive anime crossover with a chill, character-driven story instead of high-octane action… I'm down for that! </garnt>\n" +
'<connor> Me too! Maybe we should pitch that to some game developers. We could be onto something here, guys. </connor>\n' +
"<joey> Alright, I guess that's our million-dollar idea: a new world of video games based on anime, focusing on character development and interactions. Let's make it happen! </joey>\n" +
"<garnt> Absolutely! And hopefully, it'll inspire more developers to take risks and create unique anime games in the future. </garnt>\n" +
"<connor> Agreed! It's about time we saw a change in the anime gaming scene. </connor>"

<connor> up and adds up yeah every single time </connor>
<joey> yeah they asked me especially if your </joey>
<joey> dad is asking what beer this is </joey>
<joey> um like they had cover charge in one </joey>
<connor> place because current charge is pretty </connor>
<connor> common in Japan yeah yeah 500 to 1000 </connor>
<connor> yen you get a snack or something and my </connor>
<connor> dad was like did I did I get scammed and </connor>
<joey> I was like no no it's </joey>
<connor> it's normal but it uses on guard with </connor>
<joey> everything yeah yeah like an ATM he's </joey>
<joey> like is that ATM safe and I was like </joey>
<joey> they're all safe every ATM's safe I mean </joey>

response:
```
"<garnt> So, I've been thinking a lot about anime adaptations of manga lately. </garnt>\n" +
'<joey> Oh? Like which ones? </joey>\n' +
"<garnt> Well, you know how some anime adaptations just give off the sense that they're not living up to the manga's full potential? </garnt>\n" +
"<connor> Oh yeah, definitely. It's such a letdown when that happens. </connor>\n" +
"<joey> Totally, especially when it's a series you really love. </joey>\n" +
'\n' +
'<connor> I think one example that comes to mind for me is "Tokyo Ghoul". The manga was amazing, but the anime adaptation just didn't hit the mark. </connor>\n' +
'<garnt> Yeah, I agree. I feel like they just tried to cram too much into too little time, which made it hard to follow along. </garnt>\n' +
'<joey> Right? And don't even get me started on "Berserk". The 2016 adaptation was just...yikes. </joey>\n' +
'\n' +
'<connor> Oh god, yeah. That animation was horrific. </connor>\n' +
"<garnt> You'd think for a series as iconic as Berserk, they'd put in more effort. </garnt>\n" +
"<joey> It's such a shame because the manga is absolutely incredible. It deserved better. </joey>\n" +
'\n' +
'<connor> On the other hand, what do you guys think about anime adaptations that actually surpass the manga? </connor>\n' +
'<garnt> That's a tough one. I mean, "Attack on Titan" pulled it off. The anime made some aspects even better than in the manga. </garnt>\n' +
'<joey> Yeah, that's true. And I think "Demon Slayer" is another example. Ufotable's animation really brought the series to life. </joey>\n' +
'\n' +
"<connor> Oh, for sure. Whenever I see those stunning visuals, it's hard to go back to reading the manga without thinking about how much better the anime is. </connor>\n" +
'<garnt> It just goes to show that when done right, an anime adaptation can not only do justice to the manga but also elevate it to new heights. </garnt>\n' +
"<joey> Absolutely. It's just a matter of finding the right balance between staying faithful to the source material and letting the anime bring its own style and flare to the story. </joey>"

<connor> it's just like it's it's very fun taking </connor>
<connor> them around but after like like multiple </connor>
<connor> days of this I've been getting this same </connor>
<connor> question I'm like I'm gonna lose </connor>
<connor> my mind being asked these questions over </connor>
<connor> and over again but it's been fun they </connor>
<connor> love the bullet trains everyone seems to </connor>
<connor> love bullet trains as well every foreign </connor>
<joey> person I think people from outside Japan </joey>
<joey> just like find that concept so insane </joey>
<joey> yeah because it's like well like I think </joey>
<joey> like China is the only other country </joey>
<joey> that has trains that go that fast yeah I </joey>
<connor> think I think no Europe has high speed </connor>
<joey> rails does it yeah I don't think it's as </joey>
<garnt> well connected nearly as well connected </garnt>
<joey> yeah or run on time or because I think </joey>
<connor> like a million people a day use the </connor>
<garnt> shinkansen which is like insane amounts </garnt>
```

response:
```
"<connor> So, guys, can we talk about how anime merchandise plays a massive role in an anime's popularity? </connor>\n" +
"<garnt> Oh, definitely! I've always thought that merch sales and the anime's popularity go hand in hand. </garnt>\n" +
"<joey> Yeah, I mean, just look at the sheer amount of merch available for some of the more popular series. It's insane! </joey>\n" +
"<connor> And it's not just limited to figures and keychains; we have clothing, accessories, even snacks branded with our favorite characters. </connor>\n" +
"<garnt> I think that part of it comes from brand loyalty. Once you're invested in a series, you're more likely to buy its merch to show your support. </garnt>\n" +
"<joey> Plus, there's something satisfying about having physical items that represent your love for a particular show or character. </joey>\n" +
'<connor> Sometimes I wonder if certain anime are created just for the purpose of pumping out merchandise. </connor>\n' +
"<garnt> Haha, wouldn't surprise me. I've heard of productions making creative choices based on their merchandising potential. </garnt>\n" +
"<joey> I guess it's a business at the end of the day, and merch is a big part of what keeps the anime industry alive. </joey>\n" +
`<connor> It's also interesting how well some shows sell despite their actual content. Like, take "Hyper Ultra Moe Moe Battle High School DX," for example. </connor>\n` +
"<garnt> Oh, don't get me started on that one. I could barely get through a single episode, yet you see their merch everywhere. </garnt>\n" +
"<joey> It's almost like the quality of the show doesn't even matter as long as the characters are marketable. </joey>\n" +
'<connor> But on the other hand, you have shows with fantastic writing and animation that barely make a dent in merch sales. </connor>\n' +
"<garnt> Yeah, it's a shame when that happens. It usually leads to series not getting renewed or just fading into obscurity. </garnt>\n" +
"<joey> I wish more people would be open to supporting anime that isn't just centered around hype and fan service. </joey>\n" +
"<connor> At the end of the day, though, I can't deny that merch plays a huge role in an anime's popularity and success. </connor>\n" +
"<garnt> Definitely, and I don't see that changing anytime soon. If anything, I think we'll only see more creative ways to market our favorite shows through merchandise. </garnt>\n" +
"<joey> Yeah, as much as we hate to admit it, we're all suckers for that limited edition figurine or collector's box set. It's just part of being a fan. </joey>"
