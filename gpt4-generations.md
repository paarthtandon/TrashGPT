        'Joey (The Anime Man): Oh, are you talking about "I Just Got Reincarnated as a Washing Machine?!"\n' +
        "Garnt (Gigguk): Oh my god, I can't believe that's an actual anime, man. Does it come with a fabric softer or detergent waifu too?\n" +
        "Joey: You joke, but it actually does. And it's kind of amazing how they managed to pull it off. I don't know whether I should be impressed or disappointed, to be honest.\n" +
        'Connor: Only in the anime world can we find such ridiculous concepts executed to an absurd level of perfection.\n' +
        `Garnt: Honestly, the whole "reincarnated as" genre has gotten so out of hand lately. I wonder what's next! Reincarnated as a toilet brush? Actually, I might be giving someone an idea right now, and I kind of hate myself for that.\n` +
        'Joey: You know what though, as ridiculous as some of these shows are, the popularity just speaks volumes about the creativity and variety we have in the anime industry.\n' +
        `Connor: That's true, but sometimes I fear that it's overshadowing some of the more "traditional" or "serious" anime that comes out each season. For every "Washing Machine" anime, there's a hidden gem buried that people might not have a chance to watch because they're drowning in isekai absurdity.\n` +
        "Joey: Yeah, but that's why we're here, right? To dig out those hidden gems for the viewers of Trash Taste!\n" +
        "Garnt: Absolutely! I think it's our duty as anime connoisseurs to separate the trash from the treasure.\n" +
        'Connor: Speaking of which, any recommendations from this season that you guys think would surprise everyone?\n' +
        `Joey: Oh, I have one. It's called "Moonlit Melody" and it's a beautiful story about a classical pianist who slowly loses her hearing. The animation and music are just stunning.\n` +
        "Garnt: Ah, that sounds right up my alley! I'll be checking that out tonight for sure.\n" +
        "Connor: Well, on that note, I think that's a perfect way to wrap up today's episode. Thanks for joining us for another weirder-than-usual episode of Trash Taste!\n" +
        "Garnt: Don't forget to check out our Twitter and leave a comment with your favorite anime from this season. And as always, we appreciate your support!\n" +
        'Joey: Until next time, stay trashy, everyone!'

        "Joey: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to another episode of Trash Taste! I'm your host for today, Joey, and as always, I'm joined by my boys, Gigguk and Connor.\n" +
        "Gigguk: What's up, guys?\n" +
        'Connor: Hey, everyone!\n' +
        "Joey: So, today we've got something interesting to talk about. Our favorite underrated anime. Boys, what are some hidden gems that you think deserve more love and attention?\n" +
        `Gigguk: Well, personally, I think "Bokurano" is a pretty underrated mecha anime. It's dark, twisted, and has a really interesting premise. Definitely not your typical giant robot show.\n` +
        `Connor: Dude, totally agree with you! That anime messed with my head the first time I watched it. It's not just about mecha fights; it really dives into the psychological aspect. I'd add "Kino's Journey" as well, such a chill and philosophical anime, but it doesn't get the recognition it deserves.\n` +
        `Joey: Both great picks! "Bokurano" definitely took a unique approach to the mecha genre, and "Kino's Journey" is just so captivating with its episodic storytelling. For me, I'd have to say "Haibane Renmei." It's just such a thought-provoking and atmospheric show, but I rarely see anyone talking about it.\n` +
        "Gigguk: Oh, that's a good choice too! It's been a while since I've seen that, but yeah, it has such a unique vibe to it.\n" +
        'Connor: I also think "Monster" is an underrated classic. The atmosphere is dark and the storyline is amazing, but not many people seem to talk about it.\n' +
        'Joey: True, true! There are a lot of hidden gems out there, so guys, make sure to share some of your underrated anime picks with us on Twitter or in the comments!\n' +
        "Gigguk: Make sure to check out these amazing shows if you haven't already.\n" +
        "Connor: And as always, thanks for tuning in to Trash Taste. We'll see you all in the next episode. Sayonara!\n" +

        "Joey: Welcome back everybody to yet another episode of the Trash Taste podcast! I'm your host, Joey, and with me as always are my good buddies, Connor and Garnt.\n" +
        "Garnt: Hey, what's up guys!\n" +
        'Connor: Hello everyone!\n' +
        `Joey: So, today I figured we could have a little chat about something we've all come to love throughout our years in the anime community. Let's talk about "fan service" and how it has developed and changed over time. I mean, it's quite the trashy topic, isn't it?\n` +
        'Garnt: Oh, definitely.\n' +
        'Connor: Perfect for us!\n' +
        `Joey: Right! So, let's start with defining what "fan service" actually means. Garnt, want to give it a go?\n` +
        `Garnt: Sure thing! So, in general, "fan service" is content that essentially caters to the desires of fans, often through sexually suggestive or provocative scenes, but it can also include other elements like references to other works, splashy transformations, or cameos. It's basically anything that creators add to a series to attract and entertain viewers beyond the core story and characters.\n` +
        "Connor: Yeah, and while it's true that fan service has become a pretty big part of the anime culture, it's not exclusive to the medium. You can find it in movies, TV series, comic books, and basically any form of entertainment.\n" +
        `Joey: No doubt about that. So, let's talk about how fan service has evolved throughout the years. Personally, I remember watching anime like "Neon Genesis Evangelion" and "Cowboy Bebop" where the fan service was definitively more subtle compared to some of the stuff we see this nowadays.\n` +
        'Garnt: Yeah, those were definitely different times. Back in the 90s, you would usually get a flash of skin, or maybe a slightly sexy pose, and that was as far as the fan service would go. But over time, creators have started pushing the boundaries, often going all out with shower scenes, beach episodes, and...well, everything ecchi.\n' +
        `Connor: And nowadays, you have entire series that arguably revolve around fan service, like "Highschool DxD" or "No Game No Life." Sometimes it feels like they're competing over who can feature the most colorful lingerie or outrageous scenarios.\n` +
        'Joey: But do you guys think all this catering to the fans is detrimental to anime as a whole? Or is it just a fun, harmless way to engage with the audience?\n' +
        `Garnt: I think, like most things, it depends on how it's done. Well-executed fan service can actually enhance the experience and make things more entertaining. There's even anime where the fan service is a major part of the humor or the story, like "Kill la Kill" or "Food Wars," and it works great.\n` +
        "Connor: I agree, it's all about balance. Some shows can genuinely benefit from some levity or fun added through fan service. But others are just pandering and can really detract from the overall narrative, especially when it's gratuitous.\n" +
        "Joey: Great points, guys. Well, that's our Trash Taste talk about fan service in anime. What do you think about it? Are you a fan of it or do you think it's getting out of hand? Share your thoughts in the comments below! And don't forget to like, share, and subscribe for more of our anime discussions!\n" +
        "Garnt: Yeah, and leave any future topics you'd like us to discuss in the comments as well!\n" +
        "Connor: We'll catch you all next time on Trash Taste!\n" +
        'Joey, Garnt, Connor: Bye!\n' +

      content: "Host 1: Gigguk: Alright everyone, welcome back to another episode of Trash Taste, the podcast where three anime-loving degenerates talk about whatever the hell we want. I'm Gigguk, joined, as always, by my lovely hosts Joey and Connor.\n" +
        "Host 2: Joey: The Anime Man: What's up, everybody? How ya'll doing?\n" +
        'Host 3: Connor: C-DawgVA: Hey guys, excited to be back for another episode.\n' +
        "Gigguk: So, today we're diving into a topic everyone's got an opinion on - the most controversial anime hot takes!\n" +
        'Joey: Oh boy, this is gonna be a wild ride. Just let it be known, friendships may be destroyed today.\n' +
        'Connor: Yeah, so should we be using a friendship alert system to rate these hot takes?\n' +
        `Gigguk: You know what, let's do it. Hot Take Level 1 - "I disagree." Hot Take Level 2 - "We can't be friends." Hot Take Level 3 - "I'm disowning you as a human being."\n` +
        "Joey: Perfect, alright I'll start off with Hot Take Level 1. Dubbed anime is superior to subbed anime.\n" +
        'Connor: You know, I have to say, Hot Take Level 2. Depending on the anime, I actually like dubbed better. I mean, Cowboy Bebop, for example, is iconic.\n' +
        "Gigguk: Yeah, that's definitely a Hot Take Level 2 for me. While some dubs are amazing, usually the original Japanese voice acting is on another level.\n" +
        "Joey: Alright, let's step it up to Hot Take Level 2. The Monogatari series is just a harem disguised as a masterpiece.\n" +
        "Gigguk: Oof, that's a Level 3 for me. I mean, yes, it has harem elements, but the depth of the storytelling, the characters, and the many layers is phenomenal. Come on, Joey, do you even have taste?\n" +
        "Connor: Actually, I'm with Joey on this one. Monogatari is smartly written, but I couldn't get past the harem feeling for me.\n" +
        'Joey: Thank you, Connor. Okay, Gigguk, your turn.\n' +
        'Gigguk: Alright, brace yourselves. Hot Take Level 3: "Attack on Titan is overrated and Eren is just a bland protagonist with no character development."\n' +
        'Joey and Connor: *simultaneous gasps*\n' +
        "Connor: Dude, that's a Level 3 for me too.\n" +
        "Joey: Yeah, I mean, I haven’t caught up with the manga, but I think it's brilliant, and Eren's character does grow and evolve.\n" +
        'Gigguk: Friends? Still friends, right?\n' +
        'Joey: Yeah, still friends... for now.\n' +
        "Connor: Maybe let's end the hot takes before we all disown each other.\n" +
        "Gigguk: Agreed, let's move on to discussing some of the weirdest anime we've come across.\n" +
        "Joey: Sounds good, and remember, don't take our hot takes too seriously, everyone. It's just a bit of fun!\n" +
        "Connor: Yeah, taste is subjective, and that's why it's called 'Trash Taste.' See you all next time!\n" +
        'Gigguk: Bye!'

      content: "[The Anime Man]: Hey, everyone! Welcome back to this episode of the podcast. I'm Joey, also known as The Anime Man, and today we have two amazing guests with us.\n" +
        "[C-DawgVA]: Hey, I'm Connor, also known as C-DawgVA. How are you all doing?\n" +
        '[Gigguk]: Hey, guys! Garnt here, or Gigguk. Glad to be on this episode.\n' +
        "[The Anime Man]: So, I thought we could discuss our favorite anime from this year and what we're looking forward to watching next year.\n" +
        '[C-DawgVA]: That sounds good to me. Want me to start?\n' +
        '[The Anime Man]: Sure, go ahead.\n' +
        `[C-DawgVA]: I think my favorite this year has definitely been "Steins;Gate 0." I've always been a huge fan of the original "Steins;Gate," and the adaptation of "Steins;Gate 0" was just amazing.\n` +
        '[Gigguk]: Ah, "Steins;Gate 0" was definitely great. For me, my favorite this year has to be "Attack on Titan Season 3 Part 2." The reveals, the action, and the emotional moments were all outstanding. What about you, Joey?\n' +
        '[The Anime Man]: Personally, I think "Demon Slayer" has definitely left a huge impact on the anime community this year. I mean, the animation and the story, just everything about it got people talking.\n' +
        '[C-DawgVA]: Oh, for sure. The animation in that was just on another level.\n' +
        '[Gigguk]: So, what are we looking forward to next year?\n' +
        `[The Anime Man]: For me, I can't wait for "Evangelion: 3.0+1.0." It feels like I've been waiting forever for it.\n` +
        `[C-DawgVA]: I'm really excited for "Re:Zero Season 2." I loved the first season, and I'm really curious to see where the story will go.\n` +
        `[Gigguk]: Those both sound great, but I'm looking forward to "The Promised Neverland Season 2." The first season was great, and I heard the manga was fantastic.\n` +
        "[The Anime Man]: Yeah, I've heard good things about the manga too.\n" +
        '[C-DawgVA]: Anyway, it looks like we have a lot to look forward to next year.\n' +
        "[The Anime Man]: Yeah, definitely. So, on that note, I think we'll wrap up this episode. Thanks for joining us today, Garnt and Connor.\n" +
        '[Gigguk]: No problem, mate. It was great being a part of this.\n' +
        "[C-DawgVA]: Thanks for having me. It's always fun chatting about anime with you guys.\n" +
        '[The Anime Man]: Be sure to hit the like button and subscribe for more discussions like this. See you all in the next one. Bye!\n' +
