<SPEAKER_06> - Like my family to this
day still call me Gig. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So I'm completely comfortable </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> with just people calling
me Gigguk or Garnt. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - If my parents call me Anime Man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> I would think I was like
disowned or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (both laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - If they call me the Anime
Zone on the other hand, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> then now we got a problem. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (upbeat soft music) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What's up you eccentric
ecchi enthusiasts? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> Welcome back to another episode </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_09> - This is a professional production. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> - You've ruined my intro. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> Goddamn it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Excuse me Meilyne, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I thought we- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> we have professionalism on this. </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_09> in Anime and everything else in the world. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I'm your host, Joey. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Wait, is that an intro now? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I guess. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - My God, that was like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that went from 'What the
fuck are you saying?' </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to 'Man this is a smooth ass intro'. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> We didn't agree on any of this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm a professional after all. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm your host for today Joey, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and as always, joining me </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> are the boys, Garnt and Connor. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Hey guys. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - No nickname, I don't know. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay, okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm the Hentai Kid and
this is GiggUK Arizona. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And the 93% </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - All right
- All right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You guys are on the subreddit
have just been going crazy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> with those memes, right now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean, we don't pick them nicknames. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> They pick the nicknames
at the end of the day. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Right?
- Exactly, exactly. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So, yeah guys, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what are we going to talk about today? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> Oh, wait. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> You were thinking about
something, all right? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - I watched- </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - That you wanted to talk about </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> You were thinking something
spicy to talk about. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, you talk about YouTube </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> but I think before we do that, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I watched "Perfect Blue" recently. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Oh! </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_00> (group clapping) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_09> - You broke your Satoshi Kon virginity. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm proud of you, I'm proud of you. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Unlike Garnt, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Where if we bring up a show, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you're like "Yeah, you should watch it." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Garnt's gonna be like, "Whoof." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I actually started
watching "Dorohedoro", </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - You actually did? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - Everyone is breaking their cherries. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - I just thought because of
the Full Metal Alchemist curse. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - They're no gonna to know that </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> because that was on the episode </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> where we recorded an episode </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> and then the audio just
wasn't recording apparently. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah, it's the lost
episode you'll not get to see </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> - I did like a 10 minute speech on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> why Dorohedoro was good
and you should watch it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But no, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Perfect Blue, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> How did you find it? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - It was amazing.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> - I knew it was going to be good, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Everything I've seen of it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and the amount of works that its inspired. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> It's obvious it was going to be good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But yeah, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was kinda not ready for
what I was going to watch </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey chuckles) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No one is when they're
going to watch it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like it was a lot, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> some of the scenes are pretty whoof. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like how would you feel watching it today? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> Because this came out in, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think 1995 or something like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Which 1995? 1997? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It came out in the nineties </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's at least 20 years old. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - How'd you feel it is now watching it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> for the first time in today's climate? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - It's really creepy being
like an online personality </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> watching a story about-
- [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Another online personality </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> - And that's, what's
scary about it, right. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> Is that the themes in that
are just as prevalent today, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> as it was back then. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Garnt And Connor] Yeah.
- If not worse I feel </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No no, I feel like
it's more relevant today. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> Over 20 years later than
it was when it came out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Do you wanna explain
quickly what the story is? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> Cause it's been a while
since I've watched it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh my God, I mean that's hard. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (both laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's a mindfuck, it's horror </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> but it's essentially there's
this girl who is an idol. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_01> She then quits becoming
an idol to pursue a career </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in film acting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But then, that's all sort of
like a side plot, I guess. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But there's a guy who
was obsessed with her. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And the whole point of the story is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that he is obsessed with
the image of the celebrity </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not the actual personality
of the celebrity. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then it's kind of
a story about how much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as an online personality or a celebrity, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> how much of your public persona do you own </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> and how much of that do
you have control over. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Is it actually you, who is the real you? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Is it who you perceive yourself as online? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> Or is it who you are as a person? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> And the fact that this came out </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> in the nineties, where- </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - It's way away ahead of its time. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Like what the fuck right? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> It predicted so much about how </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> social media would work
and our perceptions </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of like online celebrities, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and how people are viewed online. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> And- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just like Satoshi
Kon's cinematography </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is just so out of this world. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I love that scene, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the one scene I vividly remember </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> is like when the stalker guy is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> at the main character's concert. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And he just hold his hand up. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, that was such a good shot. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That is just so, so good </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> because it's just such good imagery. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah
- Right. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - He was ugly as fuck. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - He looked like a human beetle. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (both laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> I was like, "Oh, so he's the bad guy." </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_02> - This boy was the OG ugly bastard. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_09> - [Garnt And Connor] Yeah </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Every ugly bastard
was based off that guy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No kidding. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's amazing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> Like it was, I feel like
it's, again, like you said </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's so relevant at this time. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And I think anyone can- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> I think it's more relevant now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> than it wasn't when it come out. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - And the way he pulled it off as well </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> because it wasn't just a simple story. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_00> It was weaved in with just
pure top-class filmmaking. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, there was a point </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when you don't notice the transition </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it transitions into,
"Okay, what's real? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What's like her imagination? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> What's part of the film?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because one of the genius
parts of this story </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is that because she's
like an actress as well- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - They use of the world of the acting. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah.
- They use the world </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of the acting and like the filmmaking </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to blend into her real life. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So you don't know which scenes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are like really happening </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and which scenes are just being acted. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_09> And its, it fucks with your mind. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah, 'cause like there's
three worlds, right? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> 'Cause there's the real world, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the acting world </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> and then the stuff </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that she's seeing in her head.
- [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - And it's so hard trying
to like unwind all that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And trying to figure out what's what. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> But then I guess, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> almost a certain extent, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're not supposed to.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You're supposed to be confused. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah, it's the fact that it's so blurry, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_02> is what's showing you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> why this whole thing is so scary. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because you don't even
know watching what is real </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and what is not real. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I feel a lot of that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of like, theming
in Satoshi Kon's movies </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> really transitioned over
to his latest stuff. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Did you ever watch "Paprika"? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I haven't
- Yeah, I did, I did. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Because Paprika, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I mean, for those of you who don't know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's literally- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] My favorite spice.
- [Joey] Anime inception. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean, it's totally different </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because it's like inception </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is like a heist movie in a dream. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Satoshi. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Paprika is on a base level. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Yeah, they're both about dreams, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but Paprika is like 10
times more imaginative </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in how he approaches its visuals, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> when, in like, they're in
the dream world, right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - And how he shows the dream world </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> versus the real world is very
much like in Perfect Blue. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Where you don't realize, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh, we're in a dream world now." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Or, "Oh, we're back to reality." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And he does that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so seamlessly through the scenes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> It's really incredible. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think Perfect Blue is my
favorite Satoshi Kon movie. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> A close second is Millennium Actress. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - [Joey] Millennium Actress, yeah. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - I saw a lot of people </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> said that he was his best work. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Because I think he
took a lot of elements </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> from Perfect Blue in terms of, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so Millennium Actress, isn't a mind fuck. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> But it basically tells
the story of this girl </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> through film basically. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So they, I think, she was- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> The name's Millennium Actress. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> She's an actress. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - She's an Actress. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I was like, was she an actress? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm just like, wait a
minute, of course she was. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Damn. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Millennium farmer. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> (both laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> She was a farmer. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But they show this
woman's whole life story, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just through various films that she shot </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or maybe she didn't shoot them. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But it's just such, again, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's such a seamless transition between </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> real life or the 'Canon'
real life of the movie </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and a movie in a movie. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> If that makes sense. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's good. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'Cause I mean, I also feel like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> because of the position we're in, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> it was like a weird, uncomfortable. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - It was Uncanny Valley, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - Some parts were a little bit too close. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Just like, cause obviously
there's the personality </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> that we show in our videos, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then it's our own personality. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> Like, I don't have to
deal with it too much, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 'cause I feel like I'm pretty close </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> to what I am in real life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think all three of us are. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt And Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But I definitely have some friends </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who are YouTubers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> who are very, very different
to how they're perceived </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm sure Emily won't mind me saying. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Emirichu, she's like a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> story time animator, right? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Very like this image of
like pure, right, liken. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> (Garnt and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Everyone thinks that she's
like a Disney character. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - But like you hang out with her, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> she's a normal person, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, if you follow her on Twitter, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you will see it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right.
- Right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And this is the thing right is that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I know she gets stressed
out with it more than most. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> And she's told me a few
times that she's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "I wish you would just stop treating me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like a Disney character." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Like people won't let us say things. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause when she says
things like, oh you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that are a little crude maybe. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - She gets a lot of comments being like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this is not how you're supposed to act. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's not you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, people literally tell her, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "You shouldn't act this way. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This is not how you're supposed to act." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's weird 'cause it's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't have to deal with that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If I do whatever the fuck I want </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and people like ha ha
funny, you know, teehee. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But like it's really creepy seeing people- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was weird for me- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> - Force these things onto her </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah, it was really weird for me </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> because I met Emily IRL </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> before I saw any of her YouTube stuff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> So, it was- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> Me watching her videos, it was kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> a reverse shock for me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Garnt And Connor] Yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was like, wow, you're so pure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> - Not to say that Emily
is like crazy or anything. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> She's just a normal person. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No no
- No </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I haven't met her personally but </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - People are more dimensional
than a Disney persona. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, yeah exactly. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - She doesn't even try </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and put that on herself, right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That's just because you know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - That's just get how
the audience perceive it. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> It's funny because Sydney or sydsnap, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> She has like the opposite problem where </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> people come to me and they're like, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> "Why Sydney acting so hyperactive </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> and so loud in her videos?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm like, the big difference
between Sydney in a videos </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and Sydney in real life </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is that Sydney in her
videos has a volume button. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's true. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I can physically turn her
down when she's in a video. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> I can't physically turn
it down in real life. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - You can put like a normalization. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Can't do that in real life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> That shit peaks. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - You can't put a limit
on her voice, yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, and it's just, it
was really uncomfortable. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Like I said, it's uncomfortable at times. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> It's really like unnerving. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> And again, if take away anything from this </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> you should watch Perfect Blue.
- Yeah </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - If you consume any
form of online content. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> - Did you watch Requiem For A Dream? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> - No, no I haven't </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> - Or Black Swan?
- Black Swan? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> - I saw a bit of Black Swan. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I got really bored and I turned off. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, a lot of, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, both of those movies are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> heavily, heavily influenced. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah, yeah, I show that Black
Swan was heavily inspired. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's funny that you fell
asleep during that one. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Because Black Swan is
basically the same storyline </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - [Connor] I think I was
in a plane and you know, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> sometimes you're in a mood, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> where you're like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> "I don't wanna watch a movie,
but what else can I do?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm thinking I put Black Swan on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, it was not
the right environment </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> to watch Black Swan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Very dark room. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - 10 inch LCD, eating
those shitty pack nuts. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - I have this genre I like to call </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 'Plane Movies', </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> where it's like movies </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you would never ever watch, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_09> but when you're in a plane, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> you're like "Eh". </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Every Jason Statham movie. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah I know
- [Joey] Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> Every Mission Impossible. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - I'm pretty sure </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> his career and the Rock's career </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> are solely being funded by planes. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> Like no one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Why else would you watch
that fucking shark movie </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that Jason Statham was in? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which shark movie? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The whole movie was
him fighting a shark. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> - What? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - What's the movie called? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - Are you serious? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> Is this a movie? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's on the screen right now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Sharknado 4. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's just a movie </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I can't describe any of it to you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> It's just, the whole thing
was just this really- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - Jason Statham versus the shark. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like imagine Jaws on steroids </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and that was like the whole movie. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It was so bad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, was it called like Megalodon? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That was like mega-something? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> Megachad? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> (group laughs) </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_02> - Megachad
- Megachad </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Jason Statham is Megachad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> (Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> There's just too much fucking, oh my god. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> So many movies, but yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Jason Statham movie. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, no, I agree with
the airplane movies thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've, I've seen more movies on planes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> than I think I have in, like,
cinemas and my own room. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah, I feel bad for anything </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I watch on a plane. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause I feel like it automatically </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> loses two points out of 10. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> Just because I watched it on the plane. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No no, I know what you mean. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - Like I never have a positive memory </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> of binge-watching a series. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - But, sometimes I just
wanna fucking watch </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> some shitty thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, have you ever had
like before a plane, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like you download something
you actually wanna watch, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like an anime or a series of manga. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then you're like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Ah, I don't really feel like watching. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Let me watch this shitty
five out of 10 show that's, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or movie that I would never watch </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> under any other circumstances. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Mine is worse because I
go on a plane being like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> "Okay, I can work on a script
because I have my laptop." </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Do you work on a plane? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - No
- Okay </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> (Joey chuckles) </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - I plan to every single time. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I'm like, "Okay, I'm gonna
like work on a script </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> or I'm going to play this game. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I'm going to finish it while I'm </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_02> on this 10 hour flight to the US. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But instead, now I'm going
to watch this really crap </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> documentary about this topic
that I just do not care about." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But because you're forced to watch it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> by the end of it I'm just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> "That was very informative." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I learnt a lot, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm glad I watched that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> - People who can like work on planes, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I don't know how they do it. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can do it on domestic flights. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> - Oh, I can't, it's a, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> you're a fucking madman </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if you can work on planes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think you have to be a sociopath. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm sorry. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> I guess I'm a sociopath. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> (both laughs) </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_07> - I think so, I think so. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's weird, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Because, with airplane
movies, as you said- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah
- Yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's always like two points lower than </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you would watch it in a cinema. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_09> - Cause it's not a comfortable
viewing experience- </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, it's not. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Which is all the more reason
why I wanna re-watch Maquia. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> Because I watched Maquia on a flight. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What the fuck is Maquia? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - You never heard of Maquia? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I would never watch an anime film </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> that I want to watch on a flight. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I remember hearing people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> watching Your Name </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when it was like out in theaters </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and the only chance they had to watch it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was on the flight. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm just like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> "Oh, I feel so sorry for you. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> Why?"-
- I know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And that's exactly same experience I had </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> with Maquia because I
missed it in the cinemas </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> before I went to US but
it was on my flights </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> to US so I was like, "Perfect, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I can finally watch it."
- Yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But in my head I was like, Oh no, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I have to watch it on this tiny screen </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with these crappy ass
headphones that I had </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> because I didn't bring
my proper headphones. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But I watched it on the flight. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I cried like a fucking bitch. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Oh my God. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Which makes me more, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> it makes me more inclined to go watch it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on like a big screen. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] Yeah, yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because I know if I
watched it on the big screen, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I would be crying even more like a bitch. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> - You just get a text </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> from like row three, seat C, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> that's like "Why you crying so damn loud?" </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like that meme template.
(both laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But yeah, if you don't know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> do you know Maquia? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I know
- I know, I do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So Maquia is this movie that was, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> it wasn't advertised anywhere. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> Was it? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was very under the radar. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> I think it was by PA. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Was it by PA Works? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> No. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's not PA Works, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> it was written and directed by Okada Mari. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah
- What was it about? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - She did Onahana- </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Oh, okay.
- Yeah </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - She's basically known
as the anime writer </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> who is known for like all
those series that make you cry. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. She's like the
master of making you cry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And Maquia was the movie that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> it was a first directing debut. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> But the thing is it wasn't
advertised anywhere. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Even in Japan, it wasn't
advertised anywhere. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> And I only found out about
it because my friend, Nabi. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah
- Let me know about it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But, he let me know like two days </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> before it was gone from the cinema. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I was like, cool. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I guess I can't watch that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But then it was on the flight and yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But that's the thing, right, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when you watch something
that's really funny </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or very emotional on a plane- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You can't just burst out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah you can, just fucking cry. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> - I can't do that
- I'm in the middle seat. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Dude, I've cried on a plane. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was literally doing like a, this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Like trying to hold it in
(others laugh) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - They're like, "What you
want? Chicken or beef?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> (imitating sobs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Beef
- Beef </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I didn't want this white guy sitting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> next to me to think, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "What the f-, this guy's
crying to a cartoon?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (group laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> "What the hell's wrong with you?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> But yeah, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - What's like the riskiest thing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you've ever watched in the flight? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey chuckles) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What do you mean risky? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> - I saw a guy on a plane
watching porn one time. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> (others laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> I thought that was impressive. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - I remember the first time
I watched Prison School </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> on a flight. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That was, like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - How the fuck did you do that? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - I was just like, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> "Okay, I really want to
watch Prison School." </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I downloaded it- </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - You should put explain
how bad Prison School is </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> so that people can appreciate this. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Okay, Prison School is like, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> before there was inter-species
reviewers basically, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> there was like Prison Schools. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - It's one step away from Hentai. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah, for like how far
you could push ecchi. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, there's a scene where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think the guy pisses
on the girl accidentally, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - As you do, as you do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - As you do, as you do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's fucking- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_09> - I hate it when that happens.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> It's hilarious though, it's hilarious. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> It's one of the funniest </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> ecchi anime that I have seen. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It was out like a few years ago. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Wasn't it? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> How old was it when it came out? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Twenty </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> seventeen, twenty eighteen.
- Yeah, cause I was a big fan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> of the manga. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It was one of the few manga </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that literally had me crying-laughing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- When I was reading it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So I was like, I got to watch
this when it was out but- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Except it has a very unfortunate ending. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> Doesn't it?
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I haven't read to the ending yet. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Don't spoil for me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's a bit unfortunate. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Because I was the same. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I read the manga and I thought this is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> one of the funniest things I've ever read. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then just, Oh man, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't want to say too
much about the ending, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's, eh, not that great. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - So I was watching- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - How the hell though did
you watch that on the plane? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Okay, so- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Cause I felt ashamed
watching it by myself </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wait, wait, wait, hold up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> Where were you sitting? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Okay, I was sitting on the end, right. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> And I had an iPad. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Oh that's, wait so, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> the whole, everybody walks gets to see it. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't care about them, right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> I care about the people
sitting next to me. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> - Why? Why do you not care about them? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - And the person sitting next to me </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> was like a little kid. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (group laugh) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - You're like, "You're gonna love this </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> when you're older." </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - So, at the beginning, right. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, okay, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> I was trying to be discreet
about it, all right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was on the iPad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I was trying to watch it as close </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to my face as possible, you know? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You know, like trying to be discrete. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Just putting blinders on this thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> And then it was like a 10 hour flight, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so my arms are going to get tired. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then about like an hour in, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, I don't fucking
give a shit anymore. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> And, you know, if the
kid wants to look over, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there's some culture in his life. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - You wanna be a Chad kid, watch this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Because, it wasn't the only
thing I watched, as well. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Cause the new season of Game
of Thrones was on as well. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> So I thought, you know what, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I've already watched Prison School- </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Finish it off with a
Brazzers video, why not? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - [Joey] Why not, why not. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - I mean they can't blame me that time </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_07> because it was on their selection, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So, you know, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm sorry kid </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or you're welcome kid. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - He's probably a massive
fan of the show now, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> he's like,
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_02> thank you for opening me up to the world. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do you get to the point
on a long ass flight, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like a flight that's
over like eight hours, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Where you have one hour left </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> and you need to pick something to watch. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_09> And that one hour of content
is like the worst watching. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't even bother
with that kind of stuff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> If there's less than two
hours remaining on a flight, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_09> I just don't even bother starting it. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - What do you do? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - I either read a book or sleep. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> - What the fuck </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's just like that Twilight zone- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's awful, I hate that- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I hate it because it's the same </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> when I know I have to
do something in an hour </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm like I could
squeeze in an anime episode </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_09> in this time. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's like yeah.
- But I never do. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I watch a random Family
Guy episode, I guess, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> cause I hate myself. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_09> Big Bang Theory episode
right after, why not? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, Big Bang Theory is never worth it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] No, no, no.
- It's not, you know that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - When I see people
watching that on the plane </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for like six hours straight, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, "What's wrong with you?" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (both laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What went wrong? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> Where this is the pick. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> - I couldn't escape from The
Big Bang Theory thing, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because of my surname. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> - Bazinga!
- Yeah, so many people </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> are like, "Oh look, The Big Bang Theory." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> (both laughs)
Or like, shut the fuck up. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> No. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Already hate the show. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - First of all, it's pronounced BAZINGA. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah
- All right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Goddamn it, but yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's gonna be on the Reddit now, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> that's gonna- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I remember seeing
you tweet the other day </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> that you don't realize how
much porn is on Twitter </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> until you see it in public.
- There's a lot of porn. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's like, apart from
what you like as well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> we've already touched that topic. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But you know, when you're
sitting at home on a couch </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you're just scrolling past, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> you're just immune to this shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> When you're sitting in
like a crowded train, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there's like a grandma to your left, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like another little kid to your right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> And you're like, "Man, there's just a girl </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sucking dick right on my timeline." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (both laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's just out there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Wait, like IRL? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Huh? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like real life stuff. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, hentai, of course. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I was gonna say it like "What
accounts are you following?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Jesus, I though I was bad, goddamn. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_09> - The reason I tweeted that </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> was the other day I was on the train. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> And like that was, you
know, it's the worst right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Where the image is cropped-
- No, I was about to say that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And you're like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And you're like, what's this? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And you open it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's just like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause what it was was two people, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Two people dressed as cowboys- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Joey] Yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - On the top, right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So I opened it, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and then they were naked
from the bottom down. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (laughing) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Riding each other, like anime characters. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And because I was asleep, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it took me like four seconds to realize </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> what I was looking at. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> But, like, I was holding
my phone like here. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> So the two women who were sitting
next to me definitely saw. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And I was like, "Oh yeah, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I should not show this." </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> But okay, when I moved to
Japan the first week or so, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, "Oh God I shouldn't share </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what I'm looking at on my phone." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> But now I'm just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> "Hentai, hentai." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah
- I don't give a shit. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> How do you think I find the
time to like all the hentai? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I do it on my commute.
- [Connor] You have to. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Cause there's always that picture </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where you're like, this is a 50/50. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> Am I going to see titty? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Or is this just an ecchi picture? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Am I gonna see- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Where it's just like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> it gets cut at like top
of the cleavage, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah yeah, like that right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - I have nothing or </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And the facial expression,
it isn't like ahegao. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like neutral right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just like a
slightly blushing picture. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> (voices overlapping) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I know exactly what
you're talking about. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It just like a slightly blushing picture </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and be like, this could be </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just a really nice piece of artwork </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> or it could be just be somebody
getting dicked from behind. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I have to click to find out, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> (group laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like Reddit 50/50. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> - Do you remember that time? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> Can we tell that story? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah, you can tell him. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_00> (both laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Garnt had like this photo of like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> a woman who was in a Naruto costume. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it was heavily cropped. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> So all you could see was like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> her shoulder upwards. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - It was Tsunade.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Cause how I found it was </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> Revel House, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Dee, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Deesidia, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> had liked it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> And I thought, I saw the top half. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I thought that's a good cosplay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - It looked like a wholesome cosplay. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah yeah, I'll like that one. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> - We were all sitting in
the living room, right. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> Then Sydney barges and is like, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> "Garnt, what the fuck have you liked?" </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> (group laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And we were all like, why? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Whoa, what's going on?
- What's going on? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So, we go and we expanded this image </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> and like 70% of it is
like her with her ass, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like full bare ass out. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> So, the exact pose she was doing, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> it was like top half was like this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but then the bottom half was just- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey and Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The bottom half was just like this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> (laughing continues) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> - He was like, wait what? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> So he goes, opens it. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> He's like, "Oh shit." </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> And we all, we all went
to it to Twitter to look. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> Because it's like six
of us in a living room. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And we all went to see it. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> We all start fucking pissing ourselves. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> (laughing). </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Cause Garnt had basically retweeted this. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - [Joey] Oh my God. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> - It was so funny. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> I nearly fucking lost it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I was laughing about that for like a week. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm gonna find the photo. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> - Speaking of weird stuff on Twitter, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you've been watching some
weird stuff on Youtube. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Speaking on weird stuff on twitter, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> stuff has been happening on Twitter. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (both laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Jesus Christ </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I mean, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> YouTube, every single YouTube
community seems to be on fire. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> We're doing pretty well
there, Anime YouTube right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - Surprisingly
- So far. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, it's kind of wild right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> I mean, I don't really want
to get into the specifics </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> of all of that. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> It's all speculation. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm sure, if you guys
have a Twitter account, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know what's been- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Basically the whole
of YouTube is on fire </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> and, every day you log
in on Twitter, it's just- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Twitter's just adding
the fuel to the fire. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> I mean, it's just, at this
point it's just exhausting, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> right? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - It's so hard to keep up with. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> And like, I obviously don't
wanna sit here and be like, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> "Fuck the victims" or whatever. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm not trying to say that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> What I'm trying to say
is it's so exhausting. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - As like, I don't know, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> shall I say consumer or
just person on the internet, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there's just too much
information for me to be able </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to keep up with everything
that's going on now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - There's only so many tweet
logs I can read it in a day </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> before I just start to the
big sigh starts to kick in. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I wanna care, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> I want to support all these
people who are coming out </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> with all these statements, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> but I also don't wanna help a situation </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I don't understand anything about. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - And then also there's
just, there's just too many. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> It feels like our brains are
being like D-DOSed right now, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> by information.
- Yeah </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Cause like not only is the
world ending with Coronavirus </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> which we've just forgot about </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> - You know, we gonna
deal with all this shit </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> and figure that out and
it's just, oh my God. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> It's impossible. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't even know how the drama channels </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> are keeping up with all the
stuff that's coming out. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - They're just frothing
at the mouth, aren't they? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> With all this content. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, I made a joke on Twitter saying, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "The only people benefiting from 2020 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> are the drama and news channels." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But, it really does seem
that's the case, you know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because everybody else is just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so sick of what's happening. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And I feel bad saying that, all right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> Because as you said- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - I just wish it didn't happen. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> You know what I mean?
- Right, right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's tragic that the bar </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> for being a somewhat
decent content creator </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> is just not touching kids now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just keeping your
genitals in your pants. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - You know, it's sad
that it's come to that. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (Connor chuckles) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - All right.
- It's just, all right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_09> I guess just making content
is not even thing anymore. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because, remember like five years ago </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when it was controversial to
have a sponsor in your video. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> And now it's kind of "controversial", </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> if you do something
really weird with kids. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And it's just like, what's
- I don't know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean, YouTube changed
and evolved so much. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> Thinking about, just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm going on like a content perspective. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's always this kind
of like YouTube-meta </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about the content you should make. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause I remember like commentary channels </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or drama channels didn't really
exist like five years ago. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> Because, I don't know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Cause I remember thinking, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> 'Why would anyone be
interested in YouTubers </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> talking about other YouTubers?' </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - I guess it's like
the way that, you know, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> the reason why TMZ exists, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - It gets to a point, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where YouTube got so big </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> and you can only like there people- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I mean, I basically only
watch YouTube at this point. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I watch anime, I watch Netflix but. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> It's like 80% YouTube,
right, what I watch. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It would make sense that
then a market would appear </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for being able to just
talk about YouTuber drama </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> and dumb shit that YouTubers do. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Cause, my God, do they do some dumb shit. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, and a lot of them, unfortunately, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> get away with a lot of it as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - And I think it's just because
there was not as many eyes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> on just what YouTubers
were doing back then. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause it was just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> why are you talking about a YouTuber? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> They're no celebrity. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> They don't have any power. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - As much as all these YouTubers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like to wish they were a celebrity. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (both laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We're main stream. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, but I don't know,
like Twitter is just been. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've always enjoyed Twitter </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I've always said to people, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it's kind of a nice in-between
of social and business. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> At least in terms of like
as a YouTuber using Twitter. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> - I don't understand what, like, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_00> a regular person would need Twitter for. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right?
- I think it's a cesspit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I never used Twitter
before I started YouTube. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no, nor did I. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I never cared about Twitter
or anything like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> But, I think as a YouTuber, it's kinda of- </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - You have no choice. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - It's almost required at this point. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> - Next to a YouTube channel. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I doubt we would be friends, right, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> if we didn't all meet on Twitter. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, nah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - Socialize with each other. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_00> - To me, Twitter is just
basically Facebook for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> influencers online, I guess. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_09> I get to follow what
everyone else is doing. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Not just in my own circles, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> but in like other circles as well. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Because that's basically the only reason </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> I go on Twitter apart from </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> ludes and memes, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Porn and you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> - The rest of Twitter just makes me </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> (sighs) </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - Sometimes, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - I totally get it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> - You can't have a debate anything, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> really, on Twitter. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And people aren't interested in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> having their opinions changed. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> - The moment you join in on an
argument you've already lost. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> - That's why I like, obviously, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> we're all human, we all
have opinions on things. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> But I think the reason </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> why most of us just don't
comment on anything. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> Cause it's like if you comment, you lose. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - If you get involved, you lose. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> - We can't be fucked </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> joining on this losing battle, right. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just a waste of energy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like, if I want it to get involved, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't think Twitter
is the right platform- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no
- To get involved. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Like a lot of things, like
some things yeah definitely. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I feel like there are other platforms </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> or other means that can, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> that you can use
- Yeah, definitely </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - To get involved. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - And it's just like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> it's crazy how even the
most agreeable statements </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> can become controversial on Twitter. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Like I saw, someone who was just like, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_00> "Yeah, don't fuck kids." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And there was somehow
people in the comments. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - How dare you? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Somehow, there was
someone commenting like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_09> as a playing devil's advocate, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> it's like what? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_00> This is just like drink water. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> I thought this was a thing </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> that everyone was just
understood was the thing to do. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> But, somehow
- Unfortunately common sense, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> nowadays, it's not as common
as we'd like to think it is, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> all right. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Which is why I just,
again, even if I think </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> me commenting on something or like, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> getting involved with a
drama, it's like a slam dunk. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm like, it's not worth it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Cause it's like four people who are like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> I don't know though. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - You could say you got
to drink water to survive </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and people would be like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "But I like drinking Coke." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (Connor and Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Can I not do, are you telling
me that I can't drink Coke?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> - You fucking right wing. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> You like water- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Coke once water, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> right? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - It's just, I hate it so much. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it's unfortunate
- It's kinda why, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just kind of like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_09> switch off and post my occasional memes </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> to Twitter and get on with my YouTube. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel for me, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's been like that for
the past couple of years. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_09> And it's just kind of gradually </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_00> gotten worse and worse until today. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, before I wouldn't hesitate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_09> to post an opinion about something, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> regardless of how controversial was. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah I notice, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> you don't really post your
opinions much anymore. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - No, because every time I do-
- You got a lot of shit. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - There's always some group of people </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> who's just so quick to
coming on to me like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Oh, no, you're a terrible person </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for saying this very personal opinion." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - You are, Joey. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (both laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, apparently, according
to the Internet I am. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And now I just, I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's so much, as you said, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's so much I want to say </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> but I guess that's the double-edged sword </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of having a big following. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah, yeah </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - And a quote-unquote
influence on the internet. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah, yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - I think I've become content with </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> not having to say my opinion. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I mean, you look at like
JK Rowling and you're like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> please, stop.
- Yeah </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> - Please stop saying your opinion, right. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> But like, that's the thing, right. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> You get famous or whatever </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> and you think my opinion
deserves to be heard. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> It's a right for it to be heard. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> And it's like, shut the fu- </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> No one gives a fuck about what you think. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - Sometimes no one gives a shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - I think like that's
the biggest reality check </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> as a YouTuber is like just learning </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> that no one gives a
fuck of what you think. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Cause just make videos for me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, pretty much. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> (Connor laughs) </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Cause I mean like, for me, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_00> I see myself the same way
as I did like 10 years ago, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we're all just fucking normal guys </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who had like the same fucking life </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as most other people watching this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> And I went through fucking university. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> No one gave a shit about
my opinion back then. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Why would people give a
shit about my opinion now? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> Because I have shitty opinions on Anime. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> That just doesn't make
sense to me, you know. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - I just don't think my opinion
is better than anyone's. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I think my opinion is just
as shitty as some people. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - And isn't that hilarious
how so many people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who are against like channels like us </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who are so quick to be like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Oh, he thinks that his
opinion is so much more grander </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> than everybody else's because
he has a large following. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He has influence on the internet." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And yet we never say or mean that ever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like they're putting words in our mouth. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> - I mean, it happens. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> I just kind of accepted
that stuff happens like that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> but I don't get too beat up about it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I mean, it's part of like you said </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the double-edged sword of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> having a very large audience. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like we could not talk
to this large an audience </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> if they were like in real
person, there in real life. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And you're going to get like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> something you're gonna say is gonna </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> inevitably get misconstrued </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or something like that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And some people are
just not gonna like you. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - We talked about it last time. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - It's a hard thing to learn </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> that you're just gonna have to accept that </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_07> you're not gonna be universally liked. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah.
- It's weird. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> But, you know, what's a one good example </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> is that I remember. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know when you first
start uploading videos </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when you got that first
dislike and you were like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> "Huh? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> Huh! </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Whomst disliked this? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Tell me thy name." </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> You know, you're like,
you want to find out </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> why they disliked it.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you're looking at
like down here right now, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can see like 120 or
like 300 or a thousand, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know how many
views we have, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You just accept really quickly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you're gonna have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_09> like 200 dislikes straight away. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> and you don't know why.
- Yeah, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - I don't know why 30
people disliked my video </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> when it goes live, but
it happens to everyone. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> And I want to know why. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> But it's something that as a YouTuber, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> you just come to accept. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> But I guarantee if any of
you start a YouTube channel, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> you'll know when you
get that first disliked. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Cause it's gotten sting and
you're going to be like, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> "Argh!" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But, I've always said to people who, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> because so many people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when I go to panels or
conventions or whatnot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The question that I'm sure
all three of us get asked </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> is 'How do you start a YouTube channel?' </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like 'What tips do you have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for a beginning YouTube channel?' </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I've always said to people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> that the moment you start
getting dislikes in your video </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> is when you know you've made it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's, because it's true. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Because now-
- It's actually true </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_09> - Or you're fucked up </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, or you fucked up really bad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But, if your video start to get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> maybe like one or two
dislikes, it's like, you know- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Maybe 10 times the
amount of likes. right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Then that means you know you've made it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because now you're reaching
a wide enough audience </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> that you won't be able
to please everybody. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And that's the end goal really
for content creators, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Oh definitely. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because I think it's kind of futile </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that there are some
content creators out there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who are just really desperate
to try and please everybody. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I always just want
to tell those people, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> "Dude, it's not gonna work." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, you just have to accept </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that if you're on the internet, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people are going to
hate you for no reason. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And you just have to accept that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Like it's, I mean, you
read the comments, right. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_00> And you see that some people
make really odd conclusions </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from your behavior. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That are really odd and general </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and someone, no matter what you do, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_09> and what kind of personality you show, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> one person is going to
perceive it in a bad way. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - [Joey] Right.
- Like it's gonna happen- </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like, if we were just to take </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> all the videos where we've collaborated, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> apparently Connor's like
manically depressed. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> (Garnt And Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - Because I just have a face </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> where like naturally, I
always get this in person. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> People think I'm mad at them, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_09> but I just have a face
naturally that's just like. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_02> - You just have a
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_09> - You just have a resting bitch face. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I've always had
that since I was like a kid- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - But, there's always that one
comment when it's just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> "Why is Connor so depressed?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's got like a thousand upvotes, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> - "Is he just not happy to be there? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_09> - It was on like your Engrish video. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Where it's like, okay, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> people like "Yo Connor,
not, like, super energetic." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's like, it's not my video. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_09> I don't want to be that asshole </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> who's like "It's about me." </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> You know, it's like, if I'm
on like Joey's channel, right. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> Joey's doing his intro, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I'm not going to try and interject. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> It's his fucking intro. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - You gonna be like "Hello guys" </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - I'm not so self-centered </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> where I think that I'm
on someone else's video </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that I have to be the center of attention. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I'm there to be on Joey's channel. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Right,
- Right. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> - I don't see it as like,
I need to entertain. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> - We're not all like
Guy Fieri every episode. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> - I'll contribute when I can join in. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> But I'm not gonna cut you off. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah
- Yeah, right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's your channel, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because it would piss me off </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> if someone was like trying to really </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> show me up on my own channel. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Like bro, come on, we're collabing, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> just be normal. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> - This is my channel, alright.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - Know your place. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because wouldn't be weird, right, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you're doing a video with someone, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> let's say you're a new YouTuber </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and your friend comes over, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_09> and, you're like, let's make a video. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> And your friend is like his normal self. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> The moment that camera turns on, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> he's like, "Yo, what's up?" </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> You're like, "Wow, what the fuck man." </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> (Joey And Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> "What happened?" </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> That would be weird, right. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Cause obviously I'm not
like that all the time. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, yeah </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - It's just something that's
like, I don't know, man. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Okay, question for you, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> I get this every single time I do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a panel at convention. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I get the question that goes, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "How do you deal with hate?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Because I'm of the philosophy, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you never deal with it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you just come to accept it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah
- Yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - Right, you just learn
to just get over it. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Do you remember how you- </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, like that's like a very, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm like I feel very passionate about this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because I feel like there's
no right answer for this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I feel like the right answer is that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> we just basically got to
check ourselves online </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and just don't be a fucking dick. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> All right, because it's
unfortunate, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Because I get this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I get asked the question a lot as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And every creator I've talked to, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's no solution, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You just get used to it, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You just, you just got
to ignore it, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And to me, that's fucking insane. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey And Connor laugh)
Cause that's not a solution. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's a coping mechanism,
you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah,
- Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - But that's the only thing we can do </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> when we have to deal with hate. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm sure she won't mind if I share this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> but Jessica Nigri-
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Really good friend of mine. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> I asked her this-
- Damn, is that a flex? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> (all laugh)
- Anime flex. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> I asked this question to her because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when she blew up, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> she was getting noticed by everybody. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But at the same time, when
you blow up in that sense, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you also gain a lot of
haters unfortunately. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's just how it works, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so I remember, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I think Aki asked her the question of, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "How do you, how did
you get through that?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because we all saw, as a third person, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> just how brutal her haters were- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - She got a lot of hate. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, she got a lot of
hate in her primetime. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And so Aki asked her, she was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> "So, how do you like deal with it?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I think Jessica said
it in the most perfect way. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And she just said,
"It's not that you deal, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you do end up dealing with it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it never stops hurting." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, no, it- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I think that just
perfectly sums it up, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you learn to deal with it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it never stops hurting. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Every time, if you see
that one hate comment, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> that's just, it just hits you in that, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the worst spot possible. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Like you'll learn to deal with it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> because you've seen so
many examples of it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - But, no matter how immune you are, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> there's always that one
comment every so often </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that comes up that you're just like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Aww. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> - "Oh, that just ruined my whole day." </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And I thought I was above this, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> but you're never above it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - [Joey] No, you're never. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - I'm a person who I'd say, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not self-conscious about many things. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'd say, on average, for people I speak to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's maybe like one or two things </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm self-conscious about. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah,
- And it's just like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Dude, they consider whatever they want, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but if they hit that one thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> that I was worrying about that one day. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - That shit hurts. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think one story that I've experienced </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on like a secondhand experiences. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm sure Sydney is fine
with me telling this story </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is that she was, she became a meme. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - This was back when cringe
culture was like at its prime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So she made like, she made
a video when she was a kid, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that was like, it was kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a parody of like yanderes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_09> and just like the anime weeb kind of girl. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> But it was to the point </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> when people couldn't
tell that it was satire. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Cause they don't know the personality. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah, yeah </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> They don't know the person. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> She wasn't really a YouTuber back then. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> She was just a girl on the internet. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Girl who uploaded a video. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah. Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Then years later, Leafy
featured it in a video. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah. I remember that </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - And that just fucking blew up. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah, yeah </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - She became a meme and I like, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> I was on YouTube at this point. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I know like the right and wrong things </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that you can do online. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But even seeing it from
a secondhand perspective, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was like, it was hard. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because she'd wake up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and she would just get death
threats every single day. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I had to just delete Twitter, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> delete Facebook, because it
got to the point when people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> from her school were
messaging her about it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's how widespread it was. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And like, I've never
talked about this publicly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it was fucking hard. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because like I love Sydney </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and like I did not know the right way </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to deal with it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> So, what I did was I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> okay, this is the only way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I could make it a bit better. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I wrote like a parody
video for her, which is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you've seen Sydney's video called like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "How 2 be a Tsundere" or
something along those lines, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where she basically satirizes it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That was my way of trying </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to help her get out of it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because you know on the Internet, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you say something is bad </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or if you say you're hurting, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's only going to
make it 10 times worse. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So I tried to deal with it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> by just trying to make a joke out of it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And to an extent, it worked. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But to this day, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Sydney still like sometimes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> she gets notifications on her Facebook </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or her Twitter and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It affects her. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It never went away. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah, I bet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because we went through
like a whole year period </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where she was just afraid of social media. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because she was afraid
of opening up a message, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then someone new was like mocking her </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> or someone she knew
personally was mocking her. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this is why I like, feel really strongly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about this because I don't
feel like there's a right way </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you can deal with it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] No. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - The only way we can deal with it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is just to make sure
that we, as a community, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> don't act shitty online. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And just know that there is a person </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> behind that avatar and we can, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's so easy to forget, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a lot of the times, even
for us, you see a number, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we see our view counts, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and we're just like,
that's just the number. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> But like behind every number, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> behind every avatar, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there is someone there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And especially with what's
been going on online nowadays, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know I mean, and some of the stuff </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's been happening on
Twitter and YouTube recently. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think it's super important that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we as a community, try to just act better. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because there's no way to regulate this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So the only way I can think of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> is just to promote just acting better </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and being better online. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Since when did it become so hard </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for people on the internet to just act </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a normal fucking human being? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> - It's... </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> weird </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> because the mentality
people have is just strange. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> Like my old housemate used to
do, like, K-pop dance videos. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And like, there may be like, I don't know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like 20-30 comments on most videos. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And I remember there was
one time when someone said </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> that she looked like chubby
in one of the dances. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then she replied being like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "What the fuck?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then this person replied saying, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_09> "Oh, I never thought you'd see it." </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> That's the thing, right. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - That's the weird mentality </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> that I think some people have </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> where they think, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> "Oh, they're never gonna see this." </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Like, no, we'll see it. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah
- [Joey] Will see it. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> - And I think every YouTuber has said that </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> time and time again. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> We see it, we see it. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> But then a part of me is like, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> 'Is that like a bad thing to say </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> that we gonna see it?' </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> Because then is that gonna
make them comment more? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I just feel like this is a... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> This is a problem that's never
going to have a solution. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Except that just, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> maybe if we keep repeating the message of </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> "Be a little careful." </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> Cause, I'm not going to get
mad or upset about anything. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I might get a little bothered,
but I'm gonna be fine. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But-
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - With some of the unfortunate stuff </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> that has happened recently with, you know, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> a lot of online personalities,
some taking their own life. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, exactly </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's really, it's pretty terrifying that </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> to think that maybe some of my friends </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> might not be able to handle that, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, and that's why, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think I'm sure we can all agree that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> we all very strongly
advocate for mental health </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> among YouTubers.
- [Connor] Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And there's a reason why </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so many YouTubers do have
mental health issues. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Is because of stuff like this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because of this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> Cause we're never like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> us, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just as human beings, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> evolution never taught us how to deal with </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> (Connor chuckles) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> 50 million people sending
you a clown emotes. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, exactly.
- You know what I mean. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - You don't learn this in school. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, no </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You just have to learn
through trial and error. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And unfortunately, a lot of the times, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> some people are just not
psychologically equipped </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to handle a certain amount of hate. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Or a certain amount of
backlash or anything like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And yeah, I mean, you know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Do you ever find that we like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> did you ever like do YouTube
or like watch YouTube videos </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> to like escape real life sometimes? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, that's what it was.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> - But, like now sometimes you feel like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you have to switch off Twitter </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and switch off YouTube and
escape that in real life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah, yeah.
- You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like isn't that messed up?
(Garnt chuckles) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's a bit weird
- It's weird </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> cause it's so easy, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> just like going back
to Satoshi Kon, right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It is totally like getting
sucked into another world. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh yeah, yeah.
- Right? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It is a separate world where
you exist in that world. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And the best way I can
describe getting a lot of hate </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> is it just, I don't know why,
but it just feels suffocating. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah.
- You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You could be sitting
in your living room. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> No one's there, but you
could just feel suffocated </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> just with all these comments
being thrown onto you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's really hard </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> and there's no right way to
deal with it as a person. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> You just- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because isn't it interesting that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> we could upload a video
and it get 200 dislikes </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and we're saying, "Oh,
it's only 200 people." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - But if you think about it in real life, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> that's like walking into
a fully packed cinema </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and all those people just
immediately turning to you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and saying "Fuck you".
(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's what it feels like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's what 200 dislikes looks like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah.
- And it's so weird, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> how so many YouTubers are
just kind of numb to that now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's also weird </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> 'cause there are a lot of YouTubers </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_07> who never got off the ground, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> who I think should have. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Because it really crippled them. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know if she's
will be okay with me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> talking about it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm just gonna fucking do it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So, you know, like the 'Hit-Or-Miss' girl? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Remember that was a
thing like two years ago? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - The one you interviewed? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - So, I should pretty introduce
how I actually met her first </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> so that we can go into it. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> So before she blew up
as the Hit-Or-Miss girl, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> she met me at a convention
because she was a fan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And one of my friends after she blew up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was like, "Yo, on her Instagram, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> she's got a picture with you." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, "What the fuck? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know this girl." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I went to an Instagram, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and sure enough, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> she had a picture with me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I Dm'ed her and we were chatting. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, "Yeah, if you
need any help with anything." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause normally when I
speak to new YouTubers </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or YouTubers who are blowing up, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, "Hey, if you need any help, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, with negotiating ad deals, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you need help dealing with anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> Let me know, I'll give you advice. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'll help you, get you all sorted." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> It's chill
- Right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Cause it's hard. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I wish someone had helped me. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - So then, you know,
she had all these plans </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and stuff to make </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> content, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> which I think she should have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because she was in a very rare position </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where she could have gotten a career for, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at least like 5-10 years- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Off the fame, the level of
fame that she had at that time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh no, definitely. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was insane.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - If you were around this time, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you'll know she was like the thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah
- Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> It was, I mean, my video was garbage </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and he got a million views. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> (Joey and Connor laugh) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> It was a terrible video. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Joey] Yeah.
- Right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It was purely based
off her face and her name </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - A million views just like
that, right, not even a problem. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> And there was compilations
of her doing anything </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> with a million plus views on YouTube. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Cause she didn't upload anything. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah
- And people wanted it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I was telling her, you know, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> we filmed a video for her channel. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I was trying to help get her started. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But she made a mistake, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> which I tell other YouTubers, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> everyone's going to be like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> "What do you mean Connor?"
Because you did this." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Is don't make a fucking Discord server. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think having a Discord
server that you're involved in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like you're actually moderating yourself, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is the quickest way to get
people to start disliking you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It is cause if you have to ban someone, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> they'll be like, "CDawgVA,
he banned me for no reason. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Fuck that guy." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Right, so she made a Discord server </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and bear in mind, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> she was already like kind
of a target on 4Chan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Because they wanted to find
out information about it so- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> - This became like cesspit of a Discord. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I know she'll probably say that it isn't, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> but like I've seen a few- </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> - As a third person. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - I've been around the internet. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I know a cesspit when I see one. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I know a 4Chan breeding ground- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And they were out for blood for her. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like they doxxed her like multiple times, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they were finding out where she was. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> They found her boyfriend </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> which she hadn't revealed. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And they were making it
hell for him and her. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> They were like threatening </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> that they were gonna come to her house </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then they would mentioned
their address and stuff. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And like that was a, I
reckon, her chance of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> having anything was ruined
because she was so preoccupied </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with all this shit and
trying to deal with it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Of people just hating on
her, finding her address, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> saying horrible things about her, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> saying that she was a dude all the time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was horrible. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Many times she would message me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like really upset about it being like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "What do I do? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know what to do, man." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Countless horrible stories. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know what I can share </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and what I can't share </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> so I just won't share anything. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Right.
- Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Just really horrible things </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that was happening to her
left right and center. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_09> Cause she didn't set up the
precautions to deal with this. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - [Joey] Oh no. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - And she didn't know what she was doing. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Because even then, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there's only so many
precautions you can set up. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah, yeah </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I mean, the bigger you get, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> you normally limit ways that
people can communicate with you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You normally make it very difficult </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> for people to be able to
one-to-one talk with you. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> - Also, because it's
just very hard to talk </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> to that many people with
that big an audience. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - If I opened my DMs on Twitter </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_01> and I was like, "Hey guys, open DMs." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - My DMs would be pretty much unusable </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_09> within two days, right.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> - So, and it's just
like, it's really tragic </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> because she easily
could have had a career. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> - Oh no, she could have. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - And she's watching this now thinking, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> "Wow Connor, you should
have told me this." </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> But it's like, how can I
tell you to make a career? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Right?
- [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - I did my best to help. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> - And push </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> - If she's not the one acting on it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> then there's not much you can do. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> - But she wanted to, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember she wanted to. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know if she
really wanted to or not, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> but there was definitely
opportunity there. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> And it was just, it was
really sad seeing hate- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like hearing this, I
understand how hard it can be </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> especially in the situation
she was in because, yeah. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - That was a rare situation. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> That doesn't happen, right. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah, it doesn't happen often. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> But you know, when you get
to that point when it's just, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> you're scared to go online, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> going back to what I
experienced with Sydney. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I was like, I had to like
just uninstalling everything. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Like I remember, I was </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I took the phone off of her and I'm like, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> "Okay, just let me go
through the hate comments. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'll make sure it's safe for you." </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And man, going through the
phone on behalf of her, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I felt fucking shitty. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because some of the
things people can send </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> are fucking horrible, okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Especially back then. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So I can totally understand being like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> dude I just don't want
any involvement in this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because if you go into that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> thinking that you can
make a career out of this, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with that kind of toxic environment. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> I think, at that point, you do
yourself more harm than good. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - In the longterm. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And I think, there is always a time </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_09> when you can make a career online </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> but I think there is a
healthy way to go about it. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Absolutely. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - And the less healthy way to go about it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - I mean, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I think there was definitely
room for her to do it. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh no, I think that was if- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Even if, okay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm not trying to compare, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> but like, it's like a similar situation </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with the Neekolul girl. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - She became a huge streamer now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And I think at the peak
of the Hit-Or-Miss thing, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> it was bigger than the Neekolul girl- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah.
- Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So I think it was easy, but
she just didn't do anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> And her parents were also pretty
much like against anything. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - Didn't take any of this seriously. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - Cause the thing is, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> if you want to make a career out of it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you do need like a very good
understanding of the internet. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah, which is why-
- And know how it operates. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - Which is why I was
trying to help her out. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Not like, hey, and you know, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> there was also like a ton of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> opportunistic YouTubers
coming out of the woodwork </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to try and get that piece
of the pie, if you will. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Right.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - She would tell me about all the stuff </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that some of these YouTubers are saying. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was like "Oh my God!, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> some of these dudes are slimy, bro." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> - It's just, I don't even know. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> - Internet's a scary place man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> - It is. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_00> Which is like, I'm so glad
I didn't just blow up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm so glad I got, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> the slow climb. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - The slow burn.
- Yeah, yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because I got to make every mistake, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I got to make all the fuck-ups, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I got to learn everything myself. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Before I actually had to
learn all that, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> So I can deal with it now,
because I learnt it all. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But a lot of these people who blow up, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like, "How the fuck do you, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how do you learn how to
negotiate an ad deal? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> How do you learn how to deal </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with like a hundred plus hate comments?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, yeah
- Yeah, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - How do you know? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> No one tells you how to deal with this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't get much hate, but you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> everyone gets a little bit. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> - This episode of Trash Taste is sponsored </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> by BOOK WALKER. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Have you guys heard of Book Walker? </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> which is a pretty popular manga series, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's about to get an anime added to it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm like at the time of recording, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> we haven't watched the anime yet </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> but I'm so hyped for this one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah,

suggests the Trashiest. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> (Garnt And Connor laugh)
You see what I did there? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It kinda sound a little trashy. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It is a little bit, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> but here's one that's not trashy, Re:ZeRo. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay. I'm hype, I'm high. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> There's my waifu R.E.M, I'm hyped. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - Are you fucking serious? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - What do you mean by serious? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, look, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm gonna be the 1% to
flaunt over Beatrice, okay? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm sorry. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (Garnt hits table) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, take it.
- Yes, oh my God, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> I thought I was the only one. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> Oh my God.
- Yes. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - This is like, when two
pedophiles meet each other. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey And Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I thought I was the only one. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Yes, Beatrice, best girl. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, not only that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We also have Neon Genesis
Evangelion, the manga series. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Or if you want some high
quality light novels, </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> And once again, thank you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for sponsoring today's episode. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Back to the video. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So, I mean like, here's a question </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> for you guys then, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like what do you think of the state </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of Anime YouTube right now? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And do you think it's in a healthy spot? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, I mean I guess
compared to what happening </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> on other communities right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] I mean. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Compared to the SMASH community, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> Anime YouTube is like the Virgin Mary. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_02> - Nintendo is probably thinking, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_09> "Holy fuck, we dodged
a bullet from being-" </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_02> - Super Smash Bros is for good boys </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and girls, remember kids. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (group laugh) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, I mean, there was
a point, I will admit, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there was a point where I would look </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at the Ani-Tube community </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was like, "Fuck this community". </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (group laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, legitimately, there
was just like some people, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and just like, some fan
bases as well especially. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just some groups of people, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where I was just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> "Man, we don't need that
kind of mentality in here." </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> But what can you do, right? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> The Ani-Tube community, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> or at least the anime community online, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> especially in the last 5 years or so, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> has been growing so much more rapidly. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Like 5 years ago, it was
still very much a niche. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> But nowadays, it's gotten to the point now </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> where other communities are
starting to recognize the size </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> and power of the anime
and Ani-Tube community. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So obviously with that is gonna come </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> a lot of slimy behavior from
a group of people, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I mean like, it's been weird </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> seeing the Ani-Tube
grow as much as it has. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Because I remember there was a point </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> where you could just
point to a group of people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and be like, this is
the Ani-Tube community. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is the Anime YouTube community. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then everyone kind of
tried to get along together </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> because the group was small enough </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where you would know
everyone in the community. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] Right.
- So, you'd try to network </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and everything like that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, and we all tried
to do that at one point, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> didn't we?
- No, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> And then it got to a point </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where the community grew too big </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> for it to be under one banner.
- Right. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And there were too many
different personalities </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> for everyone to be able to mix. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> I feel like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that happened like 3-4 years ago. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And now, I feel like with Anime YouTube, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's a lot of different small communities </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that I'd grouped under one
general banner, I guess. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, it's like the
gaming community, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> When it first started, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm sure all these small creators </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> would come together and band. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But now that there are
just so many of these groups, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like small groups
within small groups. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> - [Garnt And Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - I mean it's, I bet
the Fortnite streamers </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> don't talk to the CSGO streamers. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right, right.
- You know what I mean. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, it's different. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's the same with anime, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, dude, I don't know any
fucking Dragon Ball YouTubers, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> but I know there are. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And like the Naruto YouTubers, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they all keep to themselves and stuff. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's weird. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - But it's weird </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because it used to be a point </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_09> when if you made anime content- </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - At all, yeah
- You were an anime YouTuber. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> And now there's people like Critical </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> making anime content, other people outside </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> making anime content as well. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And it's just become
a bit more widespread. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> And it's less-
- Everyone talks about anime. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's more general now
- Yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You don't necessarily have to advocate </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as an Anime YouTuber for you
to make anime content now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Everybody can make anime content. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I always felt like, on
the opposite end of you, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_07> where you were, I've always
been like a core of it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because you wanna be first, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> you're always one of the biggest. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> You've grown with it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> I felt like I was always
on the outskirts of it, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> where like, I was never friends
with anyone in it, really. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - The 93%.
(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Well, I mean, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> the only friend I did have </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> turned out to do some
really fucked up shit. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Should I tell the story? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I may have mentioned it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I mean I know the story. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, go for it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah fuck it, I'm going to say it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So when I first started
making Black Butler content, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_09> which if you don't know
what Black Butler is, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> it's a Victorian era anime </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> about a servant and a butler.
- It's 93%: The Anime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - It's very targeted
towards a female audience. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_01> When I started doing it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_09> I would do the voice of Sebastian. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Sebastian.
- [Joey And Garnt] Sebastian. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - And I would do prank calls, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> and I would call people up </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> and I would tell them, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh my goodness, my
refrigerator's running" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or blah, blah, blah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's a group of people
watching this right now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that are just frothing from the nostalgia. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They're like, "HE DID
THE SEBASTIAN VOICE!" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah, yeah, "I'm simply
one hell of a butler". </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> That line- </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey screams) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right so, I would do a lot
of Sebastian content, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so, in the show, there's a Sebastian </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then there's a Ciel, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> So I thought to myself,
"I need to find someone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who sounds exactly like this guy, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because I sound exactly like this guy." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey And Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I found a person who
insisted on being called Ciel, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> that's how into this character they were. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Joey And Garnt] Right.
- Right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And at the time, they had a big following </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> and we were known together. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And everyone just thought
we were best mates, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but like, I just thought they
were really fucking weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> First of all, I used to
just do the Sebastian thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> and then the moment the camera turned off, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> "I'm gonna go play games, uh, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm done pretending to be a British guy." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I mean, I am a British guy
but I mean I dumped him </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to be a British butler. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> But for them, it was like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They were living it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They never turned off the persona </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You couldn't not call them that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> because they would be
like, "What the fuck? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm called Ciel. You'll call me Ciel." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt cackles) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And bear in mind, this person's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know, 26? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> 27? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They should have, it was weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> 27 year old should not be like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> living with their parent- </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> - "I'm not Dave, I'm Ciel." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> - Right so, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> it was weird </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> and one time they came to London </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_02> and we hung out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it was really, really, really weird. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, so you met him in person? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I met him once in person, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cause I kinda felt like
they'd help me out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Because we did a lot of
Black Butler content, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but then they started to be really shitty. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And they used to, like, flake on me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then-
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, one thing they did
that was really suss was that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> when we collab together, you
don't ask for money from me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We're collabing, we both
had YouTube channels. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> When they were on my channel, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they would ask me to pay them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> - What? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - And I used to be like,
"That's not how YouTube works. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> When you collab, it's a mutual interest." </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - But you know, they were
like, "No, we wanna get paid." </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Because my videos were doing better. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> But I'm like that means that
your channel will get a huge- </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> So that was also really frustrating to me. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> So, I met them once in person </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> after about a year and a
half of not speaking to them. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> Because they were like, "I'm in London", </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I lived in London. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> They were like, "Wanna hang out?" </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> And I was like, "Fine, we'll
meet up for afternoon tea </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> as you do.
- Afternoon tea. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> these Americans. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_01> Filthy Americans, I'm joking. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So they turned up, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and there was like two other people there, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who looked very, very young.
- [Joey] Okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like, I asked one of
them, "How old are you?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause they, it was really weird as well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> cause they were like attached to them. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Right.
- And I thought, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> "That's really weird." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> But they wouldn't- </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> They would take it in turns
holding onto the person. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Joey And Garnt] Right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - I thought, "Wow, that's really suss" </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> And I just thought, "Americans
do American things". </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Because as a British person, right, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't understand things that
Americans do that are weird </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or fucked up. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Cause Americans are just quirky, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> Some Americans just do their own thing. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - We all have our own con stories </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> about people doing weird things- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_09> - That one weird American. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_02> (group laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I remember asking one of these kids, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "How old are you?" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And they were like, "18." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I remember thinking,
"You don't look 18, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you look like 16." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> And I was like, "Is your parent </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> okay with you coming here alone?" </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And they were like, "It's okay." </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And I was like, "All right, whatever." </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> And it was really weird, I went home, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I never spoke to them again </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I was really creeped out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I left early cause I made an excuse </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> that I had to go.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> - Cause it was just weird.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Cause there was just like
kids basically with him. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_01> I didn't sign up for this, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_09> I thought we were going to have </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> an awkward conversation </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> for like two hours, alone. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And then I'd go home.
(Joey And Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> I thought that was what it was. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And then two, three months later, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it must have been. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> No, no, no, it was like 8 months later. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I get a DM on Discord,
"Hey, you should see this." </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And it was a link to a local police report </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> and I thought, "What the fuck." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So I click on it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's like two counts of molestation </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and one count of felony molestation. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Aww. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh no, aggravated molestation. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Which I think is under 14 years old. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah
- Bruh. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Now, yeah, and they were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> person who identified as a male </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> but they were born female. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So I think that's why a lot of people </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> just never thought that
they would do something. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Joey] Yeah
- Right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - But yeah, I can't remember
what happened with them. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't wanna keep up with it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like I don't care, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> it's a mess. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I guess your hunch was correct </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> in that sense. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah
- And it's one of those things </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> where it's like fuck man, I
collabed with this person a lot. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think the moment I found out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that they were being
charged with all this stuff, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, even if, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you are innocent until
proven guilty, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But, it just didn't sit right with me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> leaving that stuff up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Even if there's a chance, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't wanna leave it up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I took all the videos down </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> which is like 40 or 50. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If you go to my Social Blade, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you'll see like views, views, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> minus 9 million views,
views, views, views. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I took them down. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I still get comments being
like, "Where are the videos?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like I don't want to
break this bubble, you know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, I guess you just did. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I guess I did now, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it was just, oh god, it was terrible. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_09> And you think back, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> and you're like "Fuck, why?
Why did you have to do that? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> What's wrong with you?" </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And I felt really guilty for ages </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> cause I was like, "Fuck, did I help them? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Did I facilitate this by giving
them more of a platform?" </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - It was just fucked up. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> Everyone I knew who was close to him </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> also was really weird. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it was just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was a thing of like
just record this one thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and then please leave me
alone, all the time before. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Because they were so weird </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_09> and I should have listened to my gut. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I don't know why I did, I regret. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean, you always have
that first kind of experience </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where meeting people on the Internet </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> might not be the best idea sometimes, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> or some people are just
really weird on the Internet- </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Some people are, some people are. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - And you don't always get that </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> until you actually hang out in real life, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> when it's not like in a Discord call. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, my early YouTube
career was definitely that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Because when I was still
doing gaming stuff, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> naturally I would also bond together </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> with other gaming YouTubers </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who were also trying to grow. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> So, I think this is back when
I had less than 10,000 subs. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I had this huge group of
friends I used to collab with. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> And a lot of them I never met in real life </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> until much, much later. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And when you do, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> you really get, as you said, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> you finally get a sense of
who this person actually is. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> And unfortunately sometimes,
they're completely different. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Garnt And Connor] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - It's scary how much some
people can just fake that shit. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - [Connor] Yeah </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Until they think they can
get away with it, right. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - It's really made me listen to my gut </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> when I have a bad feeling about someone. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And now I don't even try, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't humor them, I'm just like- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No, cause like right now, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's made, like, my
experiences have made me </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> like a lot more careful when
I meet people in real life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because you just have to be. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I wanna be, you know,
when you started out, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you tried to be friendly to everyone. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I wanna be friendly to everyone- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah
- Yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Cause I want give everyone
the benefit of the doubt. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But when there is just
this many people that, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you just gotta be careful sometimes. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And you gotta have that barrier up. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Also, over experience, I
feel like you get a much more </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> of a keener eye on stuff like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> Like you know if someone's doing something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_09> for like suss reasons, you know. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - It just makes me sad
the sheer amount of people </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> who do fucked up shit like this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah
- And it's just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't understand it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cause my head is not even
remotely wired like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> To me it's so foreign that
people could do this shit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's so confusing that so
many people do shit like this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah.
- And it's like, "Why? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> Why the fuck do you?-
- [Joey] Because the Internet- </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Don't fuck kids. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> How hard is that?
(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> How hard is it to not fuck kids? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't understand.
- [Joey] I know, I know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Um, excuse me, are you telling me- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> (group laughs) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's just the thing right, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I say that and then someone- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - How do you argue about that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> How do you argue about that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It's not even an argument. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's just like I don't- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Also side note, if I ever
do meet you in real life </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and you're like an online personality </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> that I might not know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> please introduce yourself
as your Internet handle. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've had so many times when- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh my god.
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're like, someone
introduces them to you, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and they're like, "Oh yeah, I'm Matt" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or something </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> and it's just like, okay. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Do I- </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> - Fans do that too, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> they're like, "Do you remember me?" </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And I'm like, "Who?" </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> And they're like, "X
girl with this avatar" </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_00> And I open up their profile </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> and they've changed it. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And I'm like, wait, how the
fuck was I supposed to know </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> who you are, if you don't
even show your face. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> What do you want me-
- Especially, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> especially people who
don't show their face. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, what the fuck.
- And like- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - "I'm Jacob", it's like I know 70 Jacobs, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> which one of the 70 are you? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I know right, so. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - Should I go back on topic to the- </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, no like introduce
yourself by your Internet handle. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> Just- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's awkward.
- I feel like, I get it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> Because it's weird, like
I feel weird being like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "Yeah, hi I'm Gigguk." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I get it. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - I just say, "Hi, I'm
Connor, CDawg online." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Just like introduce
yourself with that in mind. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So we know, because we don't. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Nowadays, people know each
other by their Internet handles, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> a lot of the times. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - More people know you for
Gigguk than Garnt, probably. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- That's cause, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> that's how it is. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - I mean, that's fine by me </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> because like, Gigguk, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know how you guys got your names </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I mean.
(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know the story with The Anime Man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know how the fuck
you thought of that name. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's all that SEO, bro. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> That's all it is, baby. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_09> - To get his views in the Recommended. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - But like, for me, Gigguk
has always just been, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> it was a family nickname </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> that my Dad thought up when I was born. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> So like, I'm just used to it. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> So if someone calls me Gig or Garnt, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> like my family to this
day still call me Gig, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so like I'm used to hearing that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm completely comfortable with people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just calling me Gigguk or Garnt. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - If my parents called me Anime Man, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I would think I was like
disowned or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - If you call me The Anime
Zone, on the other hand, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> then now we got a problem. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Now we got a fucking problem. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> (group laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I do that sometimes
just to fuck with Garnt. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - We do it, we do it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> We like to joke around on this podcast. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah.
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, that's the one thing I guess I- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's really weird right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I've never been used
to introducing myself as like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Hi, I'm The Anime Man." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because, before all of this, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was just so natural for me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm sure it is with a lot of people, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to just be like, "Hi I'm Joey." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Because I just want you to
get to know me as a person. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> But, it's weird now how, it's
gotten to that point where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if you just say, "Hi I'm Joey.", </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> some people will just be like- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Who the fuck's that?
- Do I, do I know you? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Which Joey are you?
- How many subs do you have? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (group laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Are you even verified bro? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (group laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> If not, don't talk to me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, it's scary, numbers
on the Internet, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Scary shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It really scarily changes the perception </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of how you see someone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Even if you don't mean it that way. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> - I think we touched on
that roughly in episode 1- </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - How we met each other and
how numbers played a factor. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Going back to what I was saying earlier </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> with the, how I always felt
like I was on the outskirts </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> of the community, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> I think that experience very
much solidified to me like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "I'm okay with not making friends" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Oh yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm gonna keep to myself, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> but yeah, obviously I have you guys. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - I mean I very quickly
came to the realization </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> that again, you can't please everybody. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Oh, no, no. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - So it's just best to like find that </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> however many group of people
that you know are cool </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_00> from here til now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And just stick around with them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_09> - One thing I always felt weird </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> about the Anime YouTube
community specifically, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> and this was very much as
an outsider looking in, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I mean I was in the community, right, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like I made content.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - But I never participated in anything </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> and I didn't make the videos </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> they would typically consider anime- </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - [Joey] Yeah right, right.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - No other community does this, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> where they try and like
rank who's the best </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> in their mind with content,
which I find really odd. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> You never see the meme
channels being like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Here's the tier list of
the best meme channels." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know what I mean?
(Joey And Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You never get like, "Oh yeah,
no, Dolan Duck is better than- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah.
- You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> No one gives a fuck. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Everyone is just-
- Yeah, no one gives a shit. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Everyone's just like, "I like Grande." </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> No one does this weird thing, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> but for some reason in
the anime community, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> they are obsessed with
like ranking each other. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> And seeing who has the best content. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> - I only just noticed it's
only the Ani-Tube community. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> - No other community does this </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> and it's so weird. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Does the gaming community do this? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> - No.
- No. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - No one does tier. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> And it's weird how like, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> on the outside looking in, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> "Wow, they really just normalized
this amongst themselves. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> They really just love
stroking each others egos." </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> And it's weird cause no other
content, no other community </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> does really does this where they like, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> all they do is complement each other. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> They're like, "Damn,
that was a good video." </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> It's like that business
meme, you know where like- </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> (Garnt laughs)
- Like, yes we did business. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> - Very good business.
- Great business. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> Great videos. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - Business executed. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's weird. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> And as someone who didn't
do the type of content, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> that anime content that they considered- </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - You weren't 'officially recognized'. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - As somebody, I'm sure
some of you are like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> know nothing about the
anime community, right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> So I'll break it down real quick to you, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> how the anime community
works as an outsider. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> And you can tell me if my
understanding is wrong. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Okay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - So I made anime content that
was very entertainment based. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I would take characters and
do weird stuff with them, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like prank calls.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - The anime community
has two types of videos </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that they consider anime content. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> If you see a tier list
likely anything else </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that is not this will be ranked lower. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And that's reviews or analytical videos. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And what I mean by that is obviously </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> reviews of shows if you review shows- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Or episodes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Or episodes, or manga,
you know whatever. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Analytical videos, where you do that shit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that you did in English class </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> where you break down why
the curtains are blue- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You basically write an essay about- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - You write a 20 minute video on </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> why Deku fists in the appropriate
way that he does, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> (Garnt And Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> It's how Deku mastered
his fisting technique. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> 20 minute video, red circles, right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> It's that type of content </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_09> where they like, or the
logic of Haruhi Suzumiya. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> It'll have a title like that, right. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - Basically, you gotta
talk about a specific show </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or you gotta talk about
anime shows in general. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - And it's a really strange obsession </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> where amongst themselves, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_07> all these small YouTubers, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'd say between </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 10-100k. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> They're obsessed with doing these videos </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and who can do the best of
these videos and ranking. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> - And it's so odd looking
from the outside in, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> it's just like, weird
watching them fight over this. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> And it's like, what's happening? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> This has gone beyond
criticizing each other's work. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> To a point of like extremes, I think. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Yeah.
- It's gotten really strange. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just become a giant circle- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And they don't really- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, it's a giant circlejerk.
- It's a circlejerk, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And they don't really recognize
any other type of content, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> and I'm okay with that cause- </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> What I think it comes down to most </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> is that most people who make videos, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> I'd say most YouTubers, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> make it to serve the audience </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> or to make content for the audience. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> These YouTubers in the anime community </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> make content for each other.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> - And to be appraised by each other </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and have their content, you know. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> If Gigguk gives me the A+ on my video, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> that's all I've ever wanted, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've passed this semester.
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Exactly, cause obviously
I want to be validated </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> by my peer, who doesn't right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But that's not the only thing I wanted </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> when I started making content. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> - No.
- No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - For these Ani-Tubers, it's
the be-all-end-all, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> - That's, I could be wrong, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> and I'm sure a lot of them would disagree. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> But from the outside looking
in that's what it seems like. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - I actually totally agree with you. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't think it's just the anime YouTube </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I've seen this specifically. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Or at least the Ani-Tube community. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I remember I had a very similar experience </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when I first started dipping my toes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> into the abridging community. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Now, this was all the way back in the day </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where abridging was like the shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Everyone wanted to be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like TeamFourStar. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And everyone was making
their own abridged content. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> And everyone had, like, a
lot of different approaches. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And a lot of them were shit, right. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Connor And Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - They all tried and they failed. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You can say that
though, you can say that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But a lot of them were shit- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - They were, they were. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because abridging is hard, it's hard. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've done abridging, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I can wholeheartedly
say it is fucking hard. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But what happened is this community formed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> and there was like these
forums that popped up. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> And what happened was people
would just start to criticize </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> each other's work, each
other's writing on comedy. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah.
- Right, and- </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Like they were all experts. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause it did become kind of a circlejerk, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> where people were, in the end, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> making content to appeal to each other. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> People were literally on these forums </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> reviewing comedy writing and abridging. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And not to say like-
(Connor laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - That sounds so pathetic. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Not to say that comedy, there
isn't a size around comedy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> Or like there isn't like a framework </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you can work off of. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But what that did, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> it just made a lot of
abridging so fucking stale. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And so fucking same-y.
- Yeah cause everyone's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> trying to please each other, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> so everyone's trying
to write the same shit. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - But then I also feel like what happened </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> is that when a big channel,
say TeamFourStar right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If they give positive praise to someone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who is up and coming, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> maybe they will think,
"Oh, they were nice to me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so I'll praise their writing." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> And then, it's just this giant circlejerk </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> of like the people who
want to be respected </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the new guys who want to be respected. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> They all just pass around the
compliments to each other. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Cause they're like,
"This is what we need, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> we need this respect from each other." </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah exactly. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And, I see the exact same thing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> with a lot of smaller Ani-Tubers now, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> where they try, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> they try to make content </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> to appeal </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> to each other- </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_00> - Other YouTubers.
- Other Youtubers, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is why whenever you see, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> whenever I see an Ani-Tuber </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that just does something
totally different. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> You can tell, right, when an Ani-Tuber </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> makes a video </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that is completely, and they
don't watch other Ani-Tubers- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - You can tell straight away. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Cause they always make
a name for themselves. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I remember the first time it happened </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was with Demolition D. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like, you can tell, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> he had a completely new style </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that no other Ani-Tuber </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> had before. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I remember like, I remember watching </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_09> one of his videos early on. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I remember thinking, "He's
gonna fucking blow up." </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - And that's exactly what happened </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> and now he's quit now. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> He's like that urban legend
for us Ani-Tubers, right. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> But he's like one of the most
respected content creators </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> in Ani-Tube. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> But like I remember John,
Super Eyepatch Wolf, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> when he first came out, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I knew he didn't watch
any other Ani-Tubers- </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Oh, you can tell, you can tell. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> - He fucking blew up as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm trying to think if
there's anyone recently. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Oh, I've got one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I've never talked about him before, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's this guy called Scamboli Reviews. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Okay
- You've mentioned him before. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - He's like very, I can tell
he's very new to the scene. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I've seen a lot of
opinions about him online </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> within the Ani-Tube community, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and a lot of it is very negative. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just because the way he phrases it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> phrases things, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the way he goes about his videos </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is way more like different
and some would say </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> brash and harsh, maybe arrogant. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But from like myself, a
content creator's perspective, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> comparing his content to a lot of things </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the other Ani-Tubers are doing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I could say he definitely has
a more distinct personality. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And he definitely stands out, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> even if I don't agree
with all of his content </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or the way he approaches the content. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I can see that he approaches
it, he just feels- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Got an angle right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - He just feels different from the rest, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> even though he's technically
doing analytical content. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> And he's like grown a lot faster
in a short period of time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I feel like we talked about this, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> making content to appease other YouTubers, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and sometimes you can
definitely tell that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - Oh yeah, I mean, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I think the reason why someone </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> like John, Super Eyepatch
Wolf, and yourself </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are able to get plus a million views </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on a video talking about
a very specific thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that maybe people aren't interested in. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Is because I think priority
is make the video good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Don't, it's not about
trying to appease someone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or trying to impress another YouTube. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because I feel like when you do that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're just going to iterate
on someone else's idea </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that probably wasn't
already good to begin with. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But you think it's good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cause in your mind, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> that's what you've been
told by the community </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> is the golden standard. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_09> - When it should be, just
make the good content. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - Just make content. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Because I remember going
back to the abridged thing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> The meta-game was try to make something </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> better than TeamFourStar. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was, it was like I'm going
to make an abridged series </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I'm going to try and
make this more respected </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> in this own circle than
what the big guys are doing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm pretty like TeamFourStar, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they didn't really give a shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, no.
- You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They were innovating with DBZ Abridged </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and HellSing Abridged. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And they were just doing their own stuff, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and they were doing stuff </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> cause they thought it was good, you know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> As someone who has been on
YouTube for a very long time, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you can definitely feel when
someone is making content </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> with a completely unique angle. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - You get a lot of the same reactions </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because a lot of, sometimes
people come up very fast </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and people are like, "Why
is he coming up very fast?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - A lot of the small YouTubers
get very bitter about that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And they're very harsh about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But then when I can look at the content, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> or any of us, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and we can see exactly why it succeeded. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We can break that apart. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And like, talking about TeamFourStar, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I remember, I'm a voice
actor, that's what I do a lot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> I've voiced a ton of abridges. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And the only time I've been laughing </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> while I was recording </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> was during the HellSing
Abridged that I did. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> And I remember I couldn't
get the lines done </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I was laughing too much. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_09> And I never have that problem
with any other abridge, right. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> - Taka's such an amazing writer. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> - It was such a good abridge for the time, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> it was incredible. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> It's because they didn't give a fuck </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about trying to copy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or trying to get the
respect of someone else. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> Because they would just
focused on making the product. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> - They just made shit that
they thought was funny. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - You know, that's what it is. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - And it's just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> not everyone who just
makes stuff for themselves </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> makes good stuff, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - That's not like, we're not trying to say </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_09> you can't improve yourself
by looking at other people. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Respect doesn't pay your bills. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt And Joey laugh) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> - That's a good way to say it. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_00> - Respect doesn't pay your bills, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - At the end of the day, you know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If typically, with how the
YouTube algorithm works, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like we all love to shit on it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But at the end of the day, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you make something
that people are watching, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> YouTube will be like
let's recommend it more. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If people are watching your videos, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_09> you will get viewed. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> That's just how it works, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> it sucks that it's like that. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Yes, there are occasions </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> where YouTube does it's little
fuckery and drops the ball </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah.
- But that doesn't happen </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> to every one of your videos. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah.
- And there are YouTubers </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> out there, you've seen a bunch of them </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> who are complaining like,
"Oh, I've been shadow banned." </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> No, your videos are garbage. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> It's- </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - That's the harsh truth, isn't it? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - It's just the truth, right? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Your videos are bad </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> and I can say that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because my videos were bad at one point. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - It's not just that, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> because I've seen many really
fucking great YouTubers, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> anime YouTubers as well, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who do fucking amazing content, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> no idea how to market their stuff. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> No idea, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> no idea </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> how to like, title and
thumbnail their videos. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's a big- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - There are like some Ani-Tubers </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where I'm like this is
a fucking great video </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> but I don't know what half these words </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> in your title mean, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> How is anyone going to
click on this video? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like, "Am I
clicking on an anime video </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> or am I clicking on a scientific study?" </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Connor] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Cause like some of these
words, I'm just like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> "Wow, I didn't know these
existed in the English language </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and could be related to
anime in such a way." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And it does suck in a way </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that you have to play to the YouTube meta </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of just how to title
and thumbnail a video. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Because, you know, I'm sure
we've titled and thumbnailed- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We don't wanna click bait, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we're forced to click bait. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, cause you do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> And there's different
levels of click bait, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but like, sometimes I'm like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> "You know what? It hurts me </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that I have to title it this way but." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's the only way. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's the only way people- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No one's gonna watch it otherwise. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And that's just part of being
a YouTuber, unfortunately. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_09> - Hate the game, not the player. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - Okay like, for example, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I did an Arch Knight sponsorship recently. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Love the game right,
but I titled the video </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "I Spent $800 On An Anime
Mobile Game", right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> It's not an anime, it's anime styled. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - It's a more accurate title, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> would be something like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "How To Play- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I love Arch Knights
- Yeah, like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that would be way more accurate </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but people aren't gonna click on that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> Because they don't know
what Arch Knights is. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> If I give them a generic enough title </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that's interesting enough, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> they'll click on it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's just trying to
strike that balance, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Between not lying to the audience </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but also being honest. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> - [Joey] Right, right. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - I had the exact same problem </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_01> with my Gacha game video. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause I put so much fucking work </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> into this Gacha game video </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> that I'm like, a lot of people do not know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what the fuck Gacha games even
are, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> How do I, how do I get
someone who has no idea </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> about Gacha games to give
this video a chance, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Cause I think it's a
pretty good introduction </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to the world of Gacha
and everything, you know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Go watch it, I put a lot
of time and effort into it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Links down below. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm gonna shout myself out.
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> I put like a month of
work into that video. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - This episode is sponsored by Gigguk. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - But like, it was just really hard for me </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> to figure out how to properly market </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this to an audience. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And that's part of the challenge </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of being a YouTuber. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Like, how long do you spend
on your titles and thumbnails? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Out of curiosity. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - Sometimes you just know </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> and sometimes you sit there
for 2 hours and get confused. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, nowadays, when
I think of a video idea, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> the first thing I think of, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> even before I start writing it a script </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or getting the general idea down, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is what's the title and thumbnail. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah, I think I do that
like 80% of the time. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah because if no matter what, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I can't think of a good enough
title or thumbnail for it. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> I usually don't even
bother doing the video. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Until I can think of like,
okay with this title, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> people click on it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then I can start working on it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And try and base my
content around that title </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as much as I can, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so that it's not like, "Aw,
this is completely click bait. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> This has nothing to do with
the content of the video" </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Which is hard and like annoying </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> because like sometimes I
have to sacrifice content </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> for the sake of the title.
- [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which is the worst thing you can do. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> - Going back to the point I made earlier </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> where I was mentioning
making shit content, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> I've been guilty of making shit content. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think we all have. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - When I was only making
Black Butler videos, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I remember I couldn't watch my own videos. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is that bad?
- No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> - Have you been there? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've always said to people, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you can't watch your old stuff, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> then that's good cause that means </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you're not only getting-
- More better. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> - Harsher on your content, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> but now you know how to
improve your content. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Just don't make that shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> - Do you ever feel like,
right after you made it, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> you're like, "This is bad." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I'm gonna upload it anyway? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Cause I feel like you wouldn't do that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, I don't get to that stage. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I do have like a bar of quality, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where I have, I've literally, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's been one video recently </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where it's been, I've
recorded it, I've scripted it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I've recorded it, edited it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and no matter I try to jig around with it- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It just didn't work.
- It just didn't work, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I just scraped it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And that was like a good
two weeks of work, as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Fuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - It hurt, but for me, if I'm not like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't always have to be like,
"This is the best shit ever" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, yeah.
- This like 10/10 banger, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> every fucking time.
- Just good enough. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Sometimes it's like,
"Okay, this is good enough." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And even that hurts me
to release sometimes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just like good enough. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But like question to you guys, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> have there been any videos
that you've ever regretted? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> Or like you can't-
- My first early part </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> of YouTube.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - My first four years. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I, okay I'm gonna say this
and I know it's not true, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> looking back I feel like I hated it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I know I didn't, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I enjoyed what I used to make. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But it was never what I wanted to make. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I made one or two things
that I did want to make. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> And then I made more of that </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> until I got stuck making
only Black Butler stuff. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Joey] Right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - And that was a nightmare to get out of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because like anything I made
that wasn't Black Butler, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> no one watched it. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> No one.
(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I remember, I
remember I moved to London </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I was making like 1500
pounds a month, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> - Which in London, this
is before tax, before tax. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> - Scraping by, just scraping by. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was basically scraping by </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I remember and for
some reason I was adamant. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> I'm like, "I'm not fucking
making these Black Butler videos </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> all the- </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I was still making them </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> but I'm not making them
all the fucking time. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - And all of them bombed, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> like straight up, all of them bombed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was getting like 1/3 the
views I was normally getting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, "I'm gonna go homeless. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm gonna have to go back to my parents </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and be like I fucked up." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But, you know, I was persistent. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, "No, I'm not. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm gonna make this fucking work. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They're funny, I think they're
better than my old stuff." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And eventually it did take off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But I remember, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the reason </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> why I realized I had to change </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was cause someone told
me, "Oh, that's weird </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you can't watch your own videos." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like at all, like not even reviewing it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I couldn't review it, I
had to get someone else </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> to review for me. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Oh really. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Cause it was like, I would
cringe too much watching them. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> (Joey laughs)
Cause I didn't like it. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah, I get exactly the
same feeling sometimes. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - But like now, when I make a good video, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, "I fucking love this part." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey And Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> - That guy's hilarious. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> - You watch it like two or
three times before it goes live, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> it's just like, yeah,
this is gonna be a banger. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I'm like, "Here comes the
joke, ah yeah, I killed a joke, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> I killed that joke.",
you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm so happy with what
I'm making right now. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It feels like a whole,
like I've been unchained </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But it's hard because
I see a lot of YouTubers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and I remember cause I used to help out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with a lot with comic doubles. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Who would dub like Undertale comics. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Remember that, when that was a thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> Homestuck comics. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - All of these people
who would dub comics, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> it was so easy to get hundreds
of thousands of views, right. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Cause these had huge fandoms. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> They would get to like 200k subs, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> they'd wanna start branching out. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Boom. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> None of the videos would get views, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> and I was like trying to help them. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> But a lot of people when
they get one or two videos </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that do bad or perform poorly, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> they're immediately put off. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They won't try anything else. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> They're just like it just doesn't do well, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it doesn't do well. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> And they don't want to figure
out how to make it work. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Cause it's basically
like starting from zero, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> with a little bit of an advantage. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_09> But you basically have to get
rid of all your old audience </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> and get a new one. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's probably less
discouraging starting from zero </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> because at least from zero- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You've got nothing to
lose, you know what I mean. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - Which is why my number one
piece of advice from the get-go </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_07> is make what you want,
don't make what gets views. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Cause I did that and I fucked myself over. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I'm lucky </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> because I feel like I'm
1 out of 100, right, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who managed to change his content. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, you got very, very lucky. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> - And get away from it. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Cause I was persistent. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I did not stop. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - I was kind of in a similar situation- </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Right, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Not to the extent of
you with Black Butler, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> but I was kind of there
when I did a lot of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Corpse Party stuff. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Right, I remember that, I remember that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I originally blew up
playing Corpse Party 2? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> Which was like the new Corpse Party game </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that just come out. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> But it was only in Japanese. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> The first let's play, that
was like the first let's play </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I ever did, I remember. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was like my eighth video or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Oh my god.
- [Garnt] Right, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it just immediately blew up because- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> I didn't know how dedicated
the Corpse Party fan base </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> was back then, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and it got to the point </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> where I would do Corpse Party 2, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it would just get insane amount of views. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Like way, way more than
any of my anime content. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - [Connor] Right. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - And then I found a Corpse
Party spinoff visual novel </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> which no one also did cause
it was only in Japanese. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I did like 30 episodes of that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> All the episodes fucking killed it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt And Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And it got to the point </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where any other video I
did during that period, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I'd say like over 90% of the comments </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> were filled with Corpse Party Rpers. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah
- Oh really? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Just like replying to
each other's comments </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> as Corpse Party characters.
(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I looked at that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> "Okay, I shouldn't get
stuck in this rabbit hole. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> This is bad." </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I gotta get out of here. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I gotta get out of here, dude. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> I gotta get the fuck out.
(Connor laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> - And one of the things
that I tell other YouTubers </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> who are like at 10-50,000, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who are stuck in a content </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where they can't get out of it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Where it's the only content </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that gets views by doing
the certain amount of thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> over and over again like
a pet almost, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like do the thing you did
but differently slightly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey And Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I always tell them like,
think of it this way, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe if you changed
your videos up entirely, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the 50,000 subscribers
that you're so desperately </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> clinging onto right now
could be a million, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, don't worry about
the subscribers you have, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> cause most of them only care
about that one thing, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> And if you want to change,
you don't need them. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Subscribers change all the time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> they always recycle. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Subscribers don't really mean much </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> in terms of view counts nowadays </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because it's all about Recommended. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, look at this channel. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah no, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> We're at like 300k breaking
over 500k every episode. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm like how is that happening? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - And it's like YouTube
used to be able to show you </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> how many people unsub from your channel, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but they removed it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> But it used to show you at like 600k, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was like plus 600,000
subscribers minus 80,000. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - You will like siphon
out people, in a good way. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like, you'll lose the
audience that you don't want. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And that's okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> But it's hard to teach people that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because like YouTube's hard. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Because all they see
is that minus 80,000 </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and they're like, "I could be at 680,000", </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> instead of 600,000 but.
- Cause like for me, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> part of the reason I feel
like I've been able to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> be on this platform for so long, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> is that I always like
try to change my content. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It's always like a conscious
effort at this point. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Same, same.
- Like if I look at my content </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> last year, and I'm making
the exact same content, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> like I don't feel like you need to do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a big fucking change straight away. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But if you gradually
change over the years, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it will be totally fucking different. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because like, if you look at
my content from 5 years ago, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> totally different from what I do now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- The way you implement that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is you do things a little bit at a time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> How I see it is, if I'm doing
exactly the same content </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as I'm doing last year, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to me, I've failed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I've personally failed myself. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I remember last year, it was probably </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like my best overall year, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in terms of views on my channel. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I was actually like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I was really unhappy with my channel. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Because this is exactly the
same stuff I've been making </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> last year for an entire year. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And it hurt me, it like hurt me. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I didn't know what
I wanted to do next. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So it took me, like, a little
bit longer to figure out. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Okay, I want to try something different </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in this way and that way. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But it's part of the secret </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of being able to survive
on YouTube for so long. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You're evolving.
- Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - It's like you constantly
have to be looking </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> for that evolution. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah well that's the
scariest thing, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There's nothing scarier than </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> YouTube viewers losing
interest in a YouTube channel </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> than the actual YouTuber losing interest </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> in their YouTube channel. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like I feel like you've
really upped your game </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in the last year.
- Oh no, you have. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> - I definitely have, I mean. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I think late 2019, 2019
for me was a weird year. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Because at the beginning of 2019, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> I was kinda in the same boat </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where I just kinda looked at my channel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I thought, "This is the
same shit I've been doing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> since I moved to Japan.
- [Garnt And Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just like a little bit better editing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, I mean, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think late 2019 was where I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "You know what, I'm gonna kinda slow down </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on the analytical stuff. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like do way less scripted shit, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and kind of just do more fun,
entertainment based stuff. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- I don't have to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> always be like the big brain boy of anime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> - Yeah, I feel like we all
rubbed off on each other almost. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - I think so
- Yeah, I think definitely </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> moving here and seeing how you guys work </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> has like given me like
a different perspective </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> about how content can be made. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> And like different approaches. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Cause I feel like a lot of people </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> when they think about
making their content better, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> they're like, okay, maybe
getting better equipment- </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - There's definitely a factor of that. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - And there is a factor of that, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> or sometimes like I gotta
make my writing better. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But sometimes it's just
what if you just try </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> approaching your content in
a completely different way. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- And I mean, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> going back to Ani-Tube </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where everyone tries to make content </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to appeal to each other. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> What I see is content being
approached exactly the same way. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - From like 5 different perspectives. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And it's all the same, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's just an iteration on each other. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> Like, they don't do anything different. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - Which is why I find it
weird about the tier list </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> because I can definitely see </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how you can find X content's better </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but to me, it's like, you're
approaching it in the same way. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Someone might have better
editing or better writing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_09> or just better or more interesting ideas, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> but it's still kind of in the same niche. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> - It's the same shit.
- It's the same shit. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - They can, they'll sit
here and talk about. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I remember, I don't know
which YouTuber it was, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> but they like, "His clip
selection was poor". </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> And I'm like, who the fuck gives a shit </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> about his clip selection.
(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Like, who cares? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Who watches a video of an anime review </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> and thinks this clip selection
is rather disappointing. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> You don't think that. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> If the video is at a point </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> where you're nitpicking that much, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> I feel like that- </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> - The content is stale at that point. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Unless it's that egregious, right. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Where the clip selection
is that poor, right. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> It shouldn't be a factor.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> - When you're talking about anime, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> picking the right clips
doesn't fucking matter </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> it's what you're talking about. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - As long as the clips not in 240p, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> no one gives a shit. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - I mean, which is why like, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I don't know like, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> personally the thing that I
try to improve the most on </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_00> is how comfortable I am on camera. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm always trying to up it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I wanna make it feel like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just like my best friend in the room. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Like how you doing? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> - I've always been
trying to figure that out </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_01> for the past year or so, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> even with scripted content. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> How do I make scripted content </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not look like scripted content? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_09> Because a year ago, you could tell </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_02> if a video of mine was scripted. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was very, very obvious. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I never script anything.
- From the way I presented it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_09> and the way I talked, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> but now recently, I've slowly kind of, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I've put more effort into
remembering my scripts, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> rather than reading a little bit of it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then using my short
term goldfish brain memory </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> to be like, "Recite these
words in a natural way please." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> (group laughs) </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> - Dude, I don't know how you, </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> I did a script recently for the first time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I hated it so much. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You get used to it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> I hated it at first too but. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - I just love being a crackhead, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> just saying shit.
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Just saying shit and then being like, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> we'll piece it together, we'll figure- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm like completely opposite, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I need, I love making a script. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like, I was that kid, it's weird </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> cause I was that kid who
was just sitting in school </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I would just be sitting in silence </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I would just laugh at myself. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I would just be like (chuckles) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Bruh. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Better run, better run. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - People thought I was like fucking crazy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah I would, I would. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But like, it was because
I had all these funny ideas </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> and funny jokes that I couldn't- </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - 13 year old Garnt: I'm a comical genius. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - Like I can-
- I'm a comical mastermind. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - There's no way I can
explain this funny thought </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> or funny joke I have in my head. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> But as soon as I started
making YouTube videos, </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like that's a funny thing, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> let's make this into a funny meme. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey And Connor laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And like I can actually visualize </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all the crazy shit going on in my head. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm not crazy, I swear to god. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Out of context, it
sounds slightly autistic. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> (group laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Just a little worrying. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sounds kinda rain man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it is a little rain man-y. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Good will hunting
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_09> Comedy good will hunting. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_00> My god. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't know though, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cause I started with doing
absolutely zero scripts. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I would maybe jot down bullet points, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I found myself, finding, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> running into that situation </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where I would just be like "Er, uh" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like way too much in between </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> while I was trying to
think up of something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, in the end, a video where
I'm trying to convince you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that you should think about
an anime in this certain way, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just ended up being this crackhead ramble </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that just was not convincing whatsoever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, "Okay, I gotta
start organizing my shit." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Sorry, I was just laughing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I had the exact moment. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was just laughing to myself </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because I thought of a funny joke. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - God damn it, Anime Zone. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I am so- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It just happened live on screen now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like god fucking damn it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Can we get a repeat of that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> At the moment you just see- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Cause I was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I wasn't laughing at what you were saying, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was just thinking of a funny joke. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> - You're not funny, Joey.
- Fuck you. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - I'm sorry, I was derailing. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> What were you talking about, Joey? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> I was totally intently listening- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm too in the moment, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I like don't find things funny </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> if I think about them too much. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> - I don't know, sometimes
do you just have that joke </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> where you just like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you just like, the more
you think about it, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the funnier it gets? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah, I have those jokes, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it doesn't come to the point </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where I'm just sitting there laughing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> - I don't think I'm funny
enough to make those jokes </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> where I'm like, "Damn, I'm funny. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Damn I'm good." </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - I know, I don't think like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> sometimes I don't think I'm funny enough </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> to think on my feet a lot of the times. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> - I'm the type-
- It's all I do. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> Like, I can't. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> If I think about a joke
too much, I hate it. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm like that type of guy </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> who spends 30 minutes in the
shower slam dunking people. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> With like witty remarks that I didn't make </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> at the exact time. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You don't know this bro </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> but I totally just fucking
destroyed you in my head. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey And Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - And then everyone clapped and cheered. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like the end of Evangelion. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - How often do you need to do this, Garnt? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> Where you need to think
about this in the shower. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Are you thinking about
your childhood traumas? </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Like this guy- </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like Sydney sometimes wonders </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> why I take 30-40 minutes
in the fucking shower, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on the fucking toilet, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and most of the time it's just me thinking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about different, that's
my most creative zone. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like that meme where it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> "He's probably thinking about other girls" </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Meanwhile Garnt, "Hell yeah,
I destroyed you in my head." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> (group laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Most of my video ideas come </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> when I'm shitting or in the shower. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know why, it's
just my special place. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's the zen, man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's the zen mo. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't, I feel like I'm on my phone </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> when I'm shitting. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> When I'm in the shower, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> I'm also on my phone. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I have a little thing,
I watch YouTube videos. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> All of my videos come right before, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm sure this is common, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but right before I go to bed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Where I'm just about to drift off, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just about to enter that REM state </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> and then all of a sudden, </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I wake up </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> - Activate. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> - I gotta write that down. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Have you ever had a really funny dream </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> or a really great dream that you, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you wake up from that dream and you think, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "That will make an amazing video" </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And then you make notes about it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> and then you read it in the morning </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and you're like what
the fuck was I saying. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've never experienced this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Half of my videos are like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where I'm drifting off and I'm like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> this would make a fucking hilarious video. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Half eyed, I write it on my phone, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I go to open it up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm like what the
fuck, this is a shit idea. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've never experienced that in my life. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I've texted in my sleep </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> but I've never had that. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_07> - I've written some mad gibberish. </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I think it's a million dollar idea </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> and then I wake up and there was like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Evangelion, Indian service call. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like what the fuck does this mean. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Wait is that a real thing? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Bye
- [Garnt And Connor] Bye. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (jazzy outro music plays) </SPEAKER_03>
