<SPEAKER_03> everybody shut up we're making art are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you enjoying this content right now is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that what you say before you start </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> recording content i shouldn't even </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> notice what you're doing it's so weak </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> we're in a new studio you can shout gone </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> can you give us an example content oh my </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> god </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> hello gamers welcome back to another </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> episode of the trash taste podcast i am </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> boy with boys you guys know us by now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and we have a themed episode as you can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> tell </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> we've never done this we've never done </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> this like like imagine this what if we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> make a three by three guys never done </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that before before have you heard of an </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> episode that will not go on a tangent </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm just kidding we will go well i think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because we're me and gartner plans to go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> out to the uk for a bit so we need to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> record a little more epic episodes in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> advance so our solution to that is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> themed episodes so that we don't have we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> don't run out of stuff to talk about we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> don't run ourselves but i like the three </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> by three episodes right because it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> just it's just a good excuse to talk </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> about [ __ ] that maybe we're not gonna </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> ever tangent towards it's just hilarious </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that we kind of brought back the three </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> by three like not the three of us i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> didn't even i didn't even know it was a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thing yeah right i don't even know if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> it's people haven't done since like 2010 </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but anyway we've done a couple of three </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> by three episodes in the past we did one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> on anime yeah uh we've done one on games </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> yep and i think this will be the third </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> one now we're gonna talk about </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> movies not anime movies yeah actual </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> live-action movies with real people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> people because i feel like we don't have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> to [ __ ] specify we watch real movies </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> well yeah of course because to some </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> people it's like oh so so so nine ghibli </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> films is that is that gonna be honestly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like i don't i don't get to talk about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> live-action movies a lot even though i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> feel like i've watched a hell of a lot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of live-action movies but yeah the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> biggest problem i had when making this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> three by three was i don't remember what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> the [ __ ] i've watched well if you've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> been watching movies god knows how long </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> my entire life there's no like my movie </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> listening yeah i feel like when you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> got into anime specifically it was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> probably a point where you really like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cared about it a lot yeah yeah what i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> mean so you made note of what you're </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> watching yeah yeah yeah you've been </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> watching movies your whole goddamn life </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because this is what you do well didn't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you go through like the imdb top 200 or </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> whatever i went through to remind myself </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> all right what have i seen okay i know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i like that that one's good but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> it's on my face i literally had to go </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> down that list to remind myself what </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> i've seen and what yes okay so what like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what logic did you guys use to choose </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> your three by threes okay so in my head </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i always have like a top three movies </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> ready because you know yeah you're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> always going to be asking hey what's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> your favorite movies i always have like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a top three but three by three you need </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> nine movies right so i'm like all right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all right i'll fill in the rest of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> six with like movies that i thought were </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really good that i want to recommend to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people yeah or movies that i know i've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> seen multiple times and i'll keep </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> watching multiple times yeah my mine </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> were not recommendations at all i was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thinking uh maybe i'll just make the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ones where like the movies i really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> really like and then i just like i just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i just went through like my list of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> movies i really liked and i just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> too many [ __ ] movies yeah right i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> literally could not narrow it down it it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> needs to be like a [ __ ] top 50 list </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> like i've seen most of the imdb top 100 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> i was like this isn't not helping it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> would just literally just be like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> imdb top 200 most of the time so like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just went [ __ ] that what are the movies </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that i've just seen the most and like if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's if it's on tv i'm just like i got </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> time to watch this movie i don't know i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> just i just pick movies with me think of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> something </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> feel feel things i don't know an aurora </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> movie that gave me an experience yeah i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> mean i i feel that i because yeah i feel </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like the problem with that for me is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that too many movies do that for me so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like you're out here like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> having an emotional breakdown every </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> movie you watch i like movies i like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> movies i always just i also it's really </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> hard also to like get rid of recency </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bias as well yeah like immediately i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> thought of like the last 10 movies i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> watched and i'm like were they as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> memorable yeah as these other movies </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that i probably haven't seen in like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> five ten years i must say there's some </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> movies on my list that i haven't seen in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] years and i've put them on just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> because i can't i wasn't sure about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> movies </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> i was like i was like obsessed with them </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as a kid yeah yeah so some of those are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> on the my list so the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> teletubbies movie </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> how far back we talking here pretty far </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> back you'll see so let's see if our </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> movie tastes are as pretentious as our </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> anime tastes yeah uh but we're gonna </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> decide as always with trash box [ __ ] to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> see who goes first </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that was a genuine bit all right who </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> wants to pick who goes first i'll go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> first </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> i hope it's not me you gave i really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't want to go first </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> oh thank god it's gone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> thank god it's gone oh [ __ ] i didn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> want to go first bring up guards 3x3 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> so your logic for your three by three </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> oh my god </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this is why i didn't want to go first </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> because i got it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i've gotta [ __ ] defend this [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> okay there are some there are some there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where i'm like okay okay genuinely good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> movies and then there's uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay so so this this is split into two </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> parts i just have our space jams in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] middle yeah like it's like okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> this is my movie as a [ __ ] kid walk </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like as a kid who grew up in the 90s </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that everyone went through a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> space jam face this is a classic okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's a [ __ ] classic i mean i didn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as a kid i didn't watch the [ __ ] nba </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> didn't even watch the [ __ ] looney </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> tunes and even as the as a kid i [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> watch this so many times every time it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was on tv i've rewatched this [ __ ] so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> much space jam's amazing it's a good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> movie it's not like a kid trying to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> justify you [ __ ] on the bed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like your parents </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> do you want to go through your list all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so kung fu hustle </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> all right that's good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that's a good movie that's great movie </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> rush hour </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yo i [ __ ] love rush hour yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> uh memento yeah scott pilgrim versus the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> world feeling you're gonna put memento </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> over something i don't know why yeah i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> don't know because i was that close to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> putting momentum </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> like this i feel god's gonna put memento </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't know why </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> um space jam of course the matrix first </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> matrix right yeah the first match okay </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> good the four year old version </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> uh snatch and confessions so this is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> very much split up into my childhood </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> obsession movies and then some movies </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that i just want people to watch and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> recommend and that's why i've just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> watched it so many times okay so before </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we i guess which movies have you seen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> joey here i've seen all of them except </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for kung fu hustle and confessions i've </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> not seen snatch sounds so familiar </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> snatch the one where this one where he </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] is like a boxer right yeah it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> not just a guy rich movie it's a good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> movie i think i think it's i think it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> guy richie's best movie like by far it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> that and lock stock and i was thinking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about putting a quentin tarantino movie </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> on but i'm surprised there is no quentin </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> tarantino </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay i had a feeling someone else was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> going to put it on okay so that's why uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's why i put on snatch instead of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> quentin tarantino because it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> snatch and like reservoir dogs which is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like my quentin tarantino move your </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> choice it's kind of like it's kind of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like the same kind of field for me yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and i feel like more people have know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about quentin tarantino which is why i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> wanted to put snatch which is kind of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like if you want kind of a british </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> quentin tarantino kind of movie where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just it's just like it's just got </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> amazing dialogue and i love i love the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> concept of a lot of different characters </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> have that's nothing to do with uh that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> has nothing to do with each other just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> kind of like merging in into one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> coherent storyline and uh there's just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bands there's the banter in this is so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] good that i still quote this to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this day like so many of the lines i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> come up with just comes from snatch </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just got great writing great </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] humor wow geek literally </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> stealing from snapchat yeah i haven't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> seen confessions oh me neither i've </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> never even heard confessions is actually </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> a japanese movie right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i know and it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's the one movie </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> i've read </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah yeah yeah yeah okay um i didn't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> know it was even based on the book but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> probably my favorite revenge movie of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> all time i think it's a miyabi book is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the one where it's like set in high </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> school yeah with like two girls </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> kind of kind of think so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> so the concept of this movie um is uh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the main character's a teacher right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah and she used to teach </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> uh teacher class right and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so these two students from these class </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> or i i think it's like two or three </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> students from this class they basically </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> uh they basically murder her </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> uh her daughter yeah um but because of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> japanese laws if you're like a miner </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> then you can't be charged even if you've </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> technically like killed somebody right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we're just [ __ ] yeah yeah which of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which is [ __ ] and that's like the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> whole premise of this movie yeah and the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> premise of this movie is just her </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> basically playing [ __ ] 5d chess </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> against these high schoolers and just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> coming up with a very unique like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> revenge scheme against these kids right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's kind of it's kind of like maybe </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> similar to old boy if you've seen old </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> boy but maybe just maybe just not as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] yeah i think uh i i think that's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> pretty [ __ ] up yeah old boys pretty </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] and my problem with old boy is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that i'm surprised old boy isn't on your </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> three by the way well my problem with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> old boys i really liked it but there are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> definitely some parts of old boy that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really push your suspension of disbelief </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like like uh without spoiling like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> without spoiling the ending of old boy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> or something there's some plot elements </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> where you're just like final twist yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> like the final twist where you're just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the final twist where you just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can the human mind be tricked into doing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this yeah that's like kind of pushing it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> what i like about confessions is that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's kind of like the same kind of deal </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where it's one person look uh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> getting revenge over people yeah but </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's just it's kind of like she's kind </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of like a light yagami lelouch kind of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> character where she it's it's a very </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's a very intricate revenge </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it's believable yeah and it's it's i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> mean it's believable because the whole </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> premise is [ __ ] to begin with because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is real like you know japanese </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> miners cannot be charged even if they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kill somebody and that's that's like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> premise of the movie but um the way it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> unravels </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is really really interesting and um for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a japanese movie as well one of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> biggest things i remember when watching </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this movie for the first time is that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> out of nowhere they start playing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> radiohead </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> hell yeah and i'm just like is that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] radiohead i'm listening to now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and so radiohead is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like literally one of the best parts of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this movie was just like you know like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> the the song for like the epic reveal </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where she reveals everything yeah it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just [ __ ] radiohead and i'm just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is this is the best reveal i've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> ever seen in the movie wait which </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> radiohead song is it um i i can't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> remember it's oh yeah yeah yeah it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> it's not a face remember the emotions i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> just remember the emotions man it's not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's not the most famous radiohead songs </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah it's it's it's the one movie that i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> think is like really underground because </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's a japanese movie uh and i everyone </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> who's watched it so far has been really </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> really [ __ ] impressed and i don't see </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> many people talking about this movie </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because yeah i feel like japanese cinema </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> uh japanese cinema in general just gets </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> looked over a lot but i feel like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> because they tackle very japanese things </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> more often than not yeah the way they go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> about things is very japanese and like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of like doesn't really make well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> not that doesn't make sense but kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> odd yeah there's a lot of like cultural </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> elements and like things that they throw </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> back to that where other people feel </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like oh that doesn't happen in my school </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah you have to kind of like just look </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> past a lot of things i think when you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> watch japanese movies or foreign </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah because like i've i've definitely </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> read this book before and i really </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> really enjoyed like back in like high </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> school as well i think it's quite an old </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> book but um </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah i mean for one i didn't even know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> that this was like a movie first of all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah i didn't even know it was available </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> in english because like a lot of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> japanese cinema doesn't make it outside </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_05> woman who wrote kokaku right like all of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> her books kind of like deal with this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> kind of like yeah it's kind of like </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_03> know if that's the thing what's what's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well i mean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know it's like it's like they're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the [ __ ] will ferrell movies and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> uh all the modern adam sandler films </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> outside of uncut gems yeah i've just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] made it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah that's literally only it yeah but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> also the adam sadler movies do extremely </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> well on netflix and not really some of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the most watched things on netflix the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> ones that they bought off i think i've </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> seen an adam sandler movie since because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> they're all so mediocre yeah and the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> only one that he he was amazing in which </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was uncut gems is absolutely [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> amazing yeah um it wasn't even his movie </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it was some he was just he's the main </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> actor yeah i've heard </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is that a comedy movie or is that just a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> movie it's a it's like a pretty pretty </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> uh brutal movie looking really [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> good though yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> all i've seen from that is the clip when </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> he goes oh my god i'm gonna come </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> if you haven't it's i think it's his </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> best role yeah but yeah 40 year old </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> virgin is like to me the infinitely </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> rewatchable comedy movie for me that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> used to play on british television i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> think like once a [ __ ] week no that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> why i've watched it so many times </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone in the uk has watched it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> because you used to play on like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> all the [ __ ] time this is also one of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> those movies that never leaves the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> airplane like exactly always playing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> like if you look up movies on an </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> airplane like the old classics genre </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> it's always interesting so many famous </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> scenes in that movie like the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> tit scene where they talk about feeling </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a boob okay it's like a sandbag </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> and the [ __ ] waxing scene as well </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> it's iconic it's iconic and i feel like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> this gets talked about less than maybe </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at least at least when it first came out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because the iconic was that one of his </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like most famous like is that one of the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> roles that i blew him up this was when i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> first started first started to know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> steve carell because i didn't know about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> him before because i think before that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> the only thing i've seen him in was like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> bruce or micey yeah but he had like one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> iconic scene he wasn't the main </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> character he wasn't the main character i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> mean it was jim carrey yeah um but i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> feel like this was his first movie where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i was just like damn this guy is funny </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> this is a funny [ __ ] movie yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> probably but i remember back when this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> came out um the iconic comedy movie when </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this first came out was super bad </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> classic everyone was like 2 000's humor </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like that was yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah everyone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and everyone was quoting super bad and i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was like kind of i kind of think the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> four-year-old virgin's funnier that was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> just me back then i thought super bad </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was funny for like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> two months no no when you're in high </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> school superbad is like the funniest </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] oh yeah it's like it's like you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> just going through it like when you've </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> heard of like the the you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> thousandth mclovin joke you're just like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> all right yeah i get it i get it it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> kind of same with borat right yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i mean </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> actually it's so fun um like uh sydney </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> had never seen borat before right so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> so she watched boar app for the first </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> time in 2021 about like about like a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> month ago okay </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like me someone who's like been quoted </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> more at throughout my entire high school </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's been quoted to death right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> um i i i you know it's hard to find it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> funny anymore because it's just been </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like everyone's just it's so ingrained </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's so ingrains that i just ceased to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> find it funny anymore she still found it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] hilarious oh it's so funny </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> like when i watch that movie all i think </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> is like god damn he's such a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> amazing actor yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he is there's app there's no movie that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> even comes close to like that kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> experience </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's crazy admittedly you know like i i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> could probably quote most of that movie </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but i'd be lying if i said every time i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> heard bora go my wife like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm like that's just hilarious </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because more i said my wife said you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just [ __ ] lost it and i was like oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] this was funny at the point i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> forgot that this was legitimately funny </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah the genius of [ __ ] bar </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it like made you on a surface level you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think that oh this is just funny movie </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> but it was really just a really [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> intelligent way of showing how racist </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> america yeah exactly and that's how good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and the best part was is that those </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people were the ones quoting it yeah it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> came out exactly but it's like a genius </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> way of showing it in a way that like he </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> made a he showed like how like i guess </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there was like racist problems in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> america before it was like you know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> talked about wildly today yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and still it was massively marketed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> towards the audience and i didn't even </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know that that's what he's poking fun at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> well that's what well that's what i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] loved about ali g back in the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> day oh my god that's a name i haven't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> heard anything like that there's a movie </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> as well </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah like that oh my god like the first </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> time i watched that like i thought </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everything was scripted and like a lot </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> of it is but like some of the interview </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> scenes stuff like that it's all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> non-scripted i'm like how the [ __ ] does </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> he do that he's just a genius like being </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> able to turn a situation and like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> make them look stupid yeah without </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> having to like make them think that he's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> playing a character yeah yeah he's so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> good at that yeah like he yeah he is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> actually like like a social genius </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because he knows how to work people so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> well yeah and the thing is like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i just he gets so invested in his </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> character </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's actually insane nightmare being </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> married to him </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which character are you tonight honey </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like because i remember like re-watching </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> borat with sydney there was this one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> scene where he gets drunk with a bunch </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> of american frat boys and at first i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like there's no way this is real this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> must be scripted right and so we looked </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> into it and uh it's totally real to the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> point got drunk with them yeah to the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> point where he got like blackout drunk </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> with them and just was able to stay in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> character this entire [ __ ] time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's [ __ ] dedication man it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> insane like so big i think by the time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> he goes to do these characters it's so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] baked in his head yeah he's this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> character that he doesn't even think i i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> oh i'm doing an act he's just yeah he </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> just that's just him he just thinks this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> is me yeah she's insane i don't know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just it's such an insane maybe you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> shouldn't put more out yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i didn't put bar on my i wish i did now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because i just like the whole i find it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> all so fascinating and like what is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> america is so [ __ ] funny as well like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> oh he's just so funny yeah he's very </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> very good absolutely [ __ ] genius yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um so aside from that i guess what else </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> haven't you seen jerry i've seen </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> everything oh come through hustle i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> haven't seen kung fu arsenal [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that's that's that stuff's good that's a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] banger i mean it looks [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> awesome it's like i i to me it's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> one of the closest you could possibly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> get to real life anime right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's it's it's somehow wacky </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> uh it's a wacky live-action kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> slapstick what it does is that it it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> does to parody martial arts movies yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it just makes a martial arts movie that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is just an anime right right yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> all the characters are like i have this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> power and then they do like all weird </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] spells and [ __ ] yeah yeah so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like say like the premise of this movie </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is like there's like this like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> axe gang right this very famous gang and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for some reason they invade this very </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> very small village </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that nobody's heard of and it's just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like this secret village where </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> coincidentally a lot of martial arts </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> masters have just like it's all situated </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in this one city </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so what happens is firstly they find </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> three martial arts masters who just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> happened to live in the city they didn't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> know they lived in the city like one </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> person was just like the i think like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> barber or something or so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> it's been so long yeah but the uh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> store oh yeah one was the noodle store </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> guy the taylor oh the taylor yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the laborer damn you remember the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> story you remember this better than me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ashley </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and so after they find out these three </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> martial arts masters are in this uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> village they were like well we got to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> send assassins to assassinate them right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so they send assassins to to like get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> rid of these three martial arts masters </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then it turns out that there are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> even more like higher up martial arts </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> masters just living in here just living </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hierarchy hierarchy pyramid </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and so like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> they just find out like more op people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just keep [ __ ] invading this village </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and they keep like more opie heroes just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> keep coming out of the woodworks it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] great it's just literally just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> escalation yeah it sounds so good it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> such a funny thing i've never heard of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this movie it's it's really if you watch </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> martial arts movies yeah which i don't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> like i used to yeah you'll know about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this just like it's well that's the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> thing like during high school i had like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a massive like spree of just watching </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> every bruce lee and jack chan movie yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and like all the martial arts movies i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> could think of same yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> but i never heard of this one for some </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> reason yeah i mean i feel like if you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> did go through that martial arts phase </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is this is like one of the peak of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's it knows the genre so well that it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of parodies itself right but at the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> same time takes itself 100 seriously </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> right right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's it's just one of the best </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's the best kind of movie yeah yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah exactly it does everything well for </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> martial arts movie um and that's why i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> love it it's got the wacky fight and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> it's got like the really well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> choreographed fights as well right um </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but speaking of martial arts fights that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> defines my childhood </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> rush hour </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah speaking of jackie chan there he is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> right there what can you say </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i i wish there was more russia </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i need the dynamic </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i really think that the rush hour series </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was what got me into the whole martial </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> arts genre to begin with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i mean honestly maybe same i don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know it was so funny my friend showed me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it when i was like really young and i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just [ __ ] fell in love with it it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> so fun yeah yeah i mean it's it's a like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> jackie chan and chris tucker was is a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> dynamic that on paper should never work </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they should never have the chemistry </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that they do but they have such good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> chemistry and the amount of times i've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> rewatched rush hour one and two </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> especially in my childhood it's just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like uncountable i actually don't know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how much how many times i've rewatched </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it because it's like it like defined </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a good like five year period of my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> life because that was what started my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> martial arts phase where i just watched </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> so many different martial arts movies </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> chan is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> very very funny yeah oh yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> he's one of the most charismatic actors </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> i feel like in that that's carried by </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> jackie chan like how good he is at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> playing like dumb yeah yeah yeah he's so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> good in this yeah him playing off chris </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> tucker it's just yeah it's just it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> christmas chris yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he's just funny by himself yeah yeah and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> jackie chan is also like funny by </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> himself for like a completely different </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> reason it's a completely clash of styles </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> but like i remember when i was doing uh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> during the uh not the anime awards the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> trash taste awards when uh i was doing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> the uh pizza crust i have a dream speech </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> right yeah people were just like wow </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> ghan's really uh god's really parodies </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> martin luther king really well and i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just like i actually just took that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> speech from rush hour too when chris </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> tucker did it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> all of your [ __ ] uh jokes and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everything come from [ __ ] movies yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everything you hear on giger is just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> movie quotes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean like this is the secret coming </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> out right when i'm just like these are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the movies i've rewatched so many times </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that they're just ingrained in my mind </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> was rush hour two the best one i think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it was what what was the plot of rush </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hour two the paris one no that was rush </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hour three that was that was that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> rush hour i love how he just immediately </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> knows it's like yeah that's russia i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> can't remember a distinction between any </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> of them they're all just all of the rush </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> hours kind of just blend together yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah um i remember rush hour one and two </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> were the good ones um </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> i think three was average three was kind </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> of like the continuous i mean i mean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> jackie chan was getting like a little </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bit old when rush hour three happens so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> he like you could tell that he couldn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> do as many stunts as he could do rush </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hour one and two i feel like was jackie </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> chan more like he he could get away </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> um but yeah i remember i don't know why </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but i remember as a kid i slightly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> preferred rush hour too i think that was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the slightly better movie but i mean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> rush hour one is still [ __ ] brilliant </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> as well i mean can we also just talk </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> about the fact that i fully expected you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to put memento in your three places yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> why why it just seems like have i ever </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> talked about no no it just seems like i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can't i can picture the gig video he's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like it's like guys what if i told you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you could go back and get pictures or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something i just i feel like i i would </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hear i was here like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i could i feel like i i can see you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> making a video about memento even though </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> you never have made a movie it just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> feels like a gig yeah if i can imagine </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> anyone making a memento video it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> either you or john </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like super i've actually </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> just seems like the kind of thing you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> would talk about it's just like a very </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like artsy film i mean it's a really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> good film isn't it an artsy film i think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's an rc film it's a bitter i mean </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like christopher nolan being </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> christopher nolan but being like i have </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> 500 iq watch me try to present my 500 iq </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> on film and it's just like memento is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> one of the few like films i think he's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> made that actually it's just like oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that was that was no long that was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> pretty smart i i got it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> memento actually was written by his </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> brother </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> okay yeah it's it's based off like it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> based off like a four-page novella </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> written by jonathan nolan yeah yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> christopher was like you have four pages </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> let me turn that into 400 and get guy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> pierce in it yeah because i remember </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this was one of his first movies and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they actually i think this was i didn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know it was based on a novella because i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know that they made a short film around </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this which i've actually seen and that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> also really good and they expanded on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this idea um and it's just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just like nolan with no budget like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but still doing the same kind of nolan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> ideas like before he had a budget and uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> lieutenant right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> it's tenant without a budget </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and then tenant happens and then he </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> forgot that he had to write like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> characters and a plot and just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to go along with the cool ideas </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> but like i feel like this and inception </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> i mean inception's been meme to [ __ ] to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like hell and back right yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> but i i remember the first time i saw </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> inception i thought it was [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> amazing of course yeah i mean like i i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> will always give nolan a chance just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> because his peak he always just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something interesting yeah yeah like he </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> always </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know even if he doesn't make uh the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> best movie he always has interesting </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> ideas and he always tries something new </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> which is what i can respect </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> not everything hits the mark </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> but it's nolan you can expect that he's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not going to stay in his comfort zone i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> mean memento is definitely one of those </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> movies that like or a you have to watch </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> more than once to fully understand but b </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> even after multiple watches it's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't get it yeah so to explain </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> memento to anyone who hasn't seen it uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is yeah it's gonna sound so weird </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it's a movie that plays in reverse </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> kind of kind of yeah because it's about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this guy who has a condition that gives </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> him short-term memory loss </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so he can only remember at most like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> five minutes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> something like like what a horrible </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> existence yeah yeah someone like that in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> real life i think actually yeah i think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> so yeah i mean this this is an actual </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> real condition that exists right somehow </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they made it into a real thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh you can't believe it oh my god i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> can't believe you got the same condition </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as that guy from memento yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but uh so because of this you only </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> presented like five minutes of this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> movie at a time and it's a movie that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> plays in reverse and it's about this guy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who has this condition and uh is trying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to get revenge for the person who </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> murdered his wife which uh which you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know it's uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> combine uh five minute memory uh five </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> minute short term memory uh with uh long </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> term revenge plot um things uh that's uh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the thing's about to get confused and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> things are gonna get confusing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> especially for the main character i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> watched this movie i don't know it's the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> one where like every time he comes to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> again he looks at his body because he </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> tattoos all his memories </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i think i've heard so much about this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> movie that i think i've seen it but i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> don't actually think i've ever seen it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> oh really right everything i have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> actually it's very good yeah but i know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the plot and i know what happened yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah yeah it's just everyone knows the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> thoughts because everyone you know what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> happens yeah okay so you know the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> twister i believe i do yeah yeah yeah i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> mean we're not </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah yeah but i think i know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> what the twist is yeah yeah but like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> just remember the first time i've </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> watched this movie and i'm just like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> damn this is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> legit like really clever 500 iq meme </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> aside you know you you don't have to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> have a high iq to enjoy this movie it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a very well made movie for such a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> confusing concept yeah because at the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> beginning you're just like how how am i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> supposed to follow along when the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> movie's playing in backwards how am i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> supposed to like how is anything </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> supposed to be surprising to me and um </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he finds a way to keep it interesting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> throughout the entire run of the movie </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then the ending kind of just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> slaps you in the face you're like oh oh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] i did not see that coming yeah okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and uh yeah and then i've and then uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> this kind of launched his career and i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> feel like this is one of his best works </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i agree with that wow thank you </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_03> really like scott it's a good movie yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> it's a good movie it's a good movie i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> think it's a really good movie um i mean </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm a huge fan of edgar wright edgar </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wright's the other director where i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just like whatever you make i'll [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> watch it edgar wright is like the master </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> of visual comedy yeah where like he he </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> manages to cut something in a way or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> just like edit something in a way that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just makes it like whoa that i wasn't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> expecting out of that but that's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> hilarious yeah it's just he's one of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> few people who whatever genre he takes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on he'll put his own spin on the genre </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah like it's it's so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> rare to find someone who you can just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> watch a movie not and you can just tell </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> this edgar wright through the editing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> itself because it's such a snappiness </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah it's just like the unique and the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the snappiness and the like it's very </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> it's very rhythmic isn't it yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> is this your favorite egg right film i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> think it is i think mine is still shawn </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> of the dead because i was debating </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> putting sean of the dead on hot fuzz i i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like fuzz that's a great hot fuzz is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> good i just feel like the first half was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a little bit boring </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um that's why i don't think it's as </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> strong as uh sean of the dead um and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> scott pilgrim i feel like is the most </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> edgar wright film there is i feel i feel </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> scott pilgrim couldn't be made by any </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> other no no that's that's the thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> right i feel sean on the dead sean penn </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> uh is that his name sean pan yeah sean </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> penn and uh nick </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> cannon no i was about to say nick fury </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then i was like wait that's that's not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> nick nick frost nick </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> the one that dies in every movie yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sean penn is the one that always dies in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> every movie </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> why is there so many shows </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> sean penn is uh who's sean </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> who the [ __ ] is that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> whatever now we've got a [ __ ] living </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> imdb page right here </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> she was she played uh kevin spacey's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> wife in house of cards </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i haven't seen house i haven't seen him </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> i've seen house of cards okay but going </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> back to scorpion the reason i put this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on is because like i do do really really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] like sean of the dead um but i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> feel like scott pilgrim is just the most </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> edgar wright movie to exist at the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> moment it's him on like his best form </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and i feel like it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this this movie kind of like i feel like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> defined a whole generation of nerds </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like you you've seen so many people who </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just based their entire [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> personality on this one movie you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> who you are you know who you [ __ ] are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like you meet you me you meet that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> person that like you meet one person </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> like that and like every anime </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> convention you go to of course yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's um but well i mean i think the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> reason why it works so well is because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> like again edgar wright's like way of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> directing is very like over exaggerated </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and like very not rooted in valley and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that works perfectly with scott pilgrim </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> because scotland was based off a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> comic book series all right so i know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm a very complicated was it the first </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> echo right film you watched oh sean of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> the show like i literally watched his </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> movies </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i feel like it's out of like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cornetto trilogy it's like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like the middle favorite for me it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like sean of the dead hot fuzz then i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can't remember the third one they made </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> balls in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> world's end that's it also i think hot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fuzz is like that's like where i grew up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> those kind of towns yeah oh yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> oh [ __ ] that's right it's very much like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if you're not like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> familiar with british like yeah it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> literally just like they ripped my town </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh i noticed they didn't but that's very </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> much similar to like yeah i feel like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that was the vibe they were going for </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's why hot fuzz like barely made it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> big in the u.s because like you know a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> lot of the references just americans i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> mean i i feel like sean of the dead and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> hot fuzz were both very much cold hits </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah yeah um because they're very much </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> ingrained in you know british humor and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> british culture you know you you watch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hot fuzz and you probably can get a vibe </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of what the place like he grew up in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is like nothing that happened to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you yeah yeah it's just like not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> something you can say for many other </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> british films even yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i mean people when when people think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> british films they or british culture </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they're like oh it's like harry potter </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> everything's like harry potter over </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> everyone's just whizzing yeah but i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> think another thing that's been lost </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> through time was just how [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> unpopular this was when this first came </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> out because now like it's like now it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> just like nerd culture haha mainstream </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> nerd culture hi i'm uh i'm a nerd guys </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> i identify as a nerd but i remember when </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i first saw this um in theaters i saw </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_03> brighton right wow really because nobody </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> wanted to see this [ __ ] movie </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> nobody is it a marketing issue huh was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> it a marketing issue </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> maybe maybe the nerds just didn't want </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to expose themselves right except for </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> guys </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> normally you know it's normally a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> marketing issue especially if it's a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> good movie </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean this movie this movie [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> bombed in the cinemas it was it was only </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> after definitely definitely cult yeah it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> definitely became a cult movie that got </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> picked up and more people watched as </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like nerd culture became more mainstream </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> but i remember the first time watching </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this it blew my [ __ ] mind how good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this was and i couldn't tell anyone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about it because nobody was interested </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in watching it like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> how did i sell this how did you sell </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> this to someone yeah like go back go </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_03> someone to like one of your mates or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> something this time is really good you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> want to watch it again </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_04> i'll just take you just shut up shut up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and i'll take you don't expect anything </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_00> there's good music space jam you already </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> mentioned that you grew up with that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> what about matrix though the matrix i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mean do you really feel that strongly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about the matrix honestly as a kid yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i did as a kid yeah i i feel like it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one of those things where i i just care </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> about it it's like referential like it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so famous and so referenced yeah but now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i don't really give a [ __ ] about the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> matrix yeah i don't really give about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> the i don't really give a revolutionary </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when it came out yeah it was like whoa </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> you can do that i was surprised like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that [ __ ] scene where they put the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> thing inside of it the stomach gave me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> nightmares oh i mean i've already talked </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> about that yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that [ __ ] gave me nightmares i will </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> say </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> um i don't think the matrix has aged </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> very well oh no definitely i've </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> definitely especially the first one i've </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> definitely rewatched it and i'm just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like oh god i thought this was really </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> cool i thought this was like the coolest </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> thing when it came out because that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that's why it's kind of [ __ ] it's kind </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of [ __ ] it definitely has an age wall no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it definitely has no age but that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> because there's been since the matrix </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there's been a million matrix yeah i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> just shot better but i mean like i feel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like part of the big reason i got into </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> anime was because of the matrix as well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> because i'm just like i see this and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then this was like my anime taste for a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> long time because i thought this was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cool as [ __ ] and i wanted to find more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> things like this iconic as [ __ ] yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's iconic as [ __ ] and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> i remember i think the first time i saw </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this when did this come out in 1999 97 i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> think okay i think i was like nine or </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> ten when i first saw it it's way too </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> young to be seeing this yeah yeah um but </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> i remember thinking this was like the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> coolest thing which it was it was for </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> the time right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for the time showing your age there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> when he like pulls the red and blue </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> pillow </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah which one is he gonna be but by my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my age when i was old enough to be able </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to appreciate it it kind of fallen out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh definitely because it was like what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like 16 so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah at that time right there'd already </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> been a million coins of matrix </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> by the time it came up for you like you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people are dressed like people in the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> matrix are like neck beards with holding </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a katana with like a fedora right this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is like you think you if the matrix was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> made nowadays it's just like the person </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who's just learned the way of the blade </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i didn't really watch many like </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_06> stuff yeah exactly you need to make sure </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> you love it first okay i'm speaking </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> i'm sitting you down </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> no no no no no i don't think you do i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't feel like starting unnecessary </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> honestly honestly i'm i'm i'm uh okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> i've pissed off lord of the rings fans </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> let me piss off star wars say it all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> right say </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> i know the plot to the uh the original </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> trilogy yeah like darth vader i just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> think darth vader looks [ __ ] boring </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> i've played the lego games so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> i know the story so i basically know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> star wars guys i know the story and i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just think that like darth maul [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> badass okay to be fair general grievous </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> only the coolest [ __ ] yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> general grievous is the the coolest </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] uh star wars character i guess </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> he is to be fair to be fair </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> [Music] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> star wars i'm just gonna say i think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> episode one is actually really [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> good i think it's well obviously because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i prefer the pretty small fight and the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> pod racing is like the two greatest </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> scenes in star wars honestly like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because the reason i prefer the prequels </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to defend myself is okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> number one i really don't give a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> about star wars i like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> it it's fair it's just not something i'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> interested i'm not passionate about star </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> wars either yeah yeah the lego games are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just banging </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they were just great sure and it's just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like i remember watching i've actually </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> seen the original trilogy a lot of times </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because someone's always got it on in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the background someone's always watching </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> it at some [ __ ] family um family </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> gathering or something was like playing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> at christmas i don't know why but </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> someone's always watching this i've seen </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it so many [ __ ] times and i i kind of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> find it like just boring i don't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just a very </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> standard movie with like it's it's it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what's original about star wars nowadays </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> well nowadays it's not because again </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like very much like matrix it's just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> being copied to [ __ ] it's kind of just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the matrix to me where it's just it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to me it's just boring now it's just a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> very normal standard movie and she's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> luke goes on the hero's journey and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> darth vader is the villain and yadda </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> yadda yeah that's why that wasn't really </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> interesting that's why i never like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cared to watch episodes seven eight and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> nine because in my mind i'm just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's not really like a fantasy to like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> i think so yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> episode seven was the only one where </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> people were like it was pretty good yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but like to me there are so many like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> scenes in the in the prequels that just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> stand out to me like that [ __ ] jewel </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> with darth maul and like okay [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gin i know everyone holy [ __ ] that is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> iconic to this day still is the best </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> spicy styles and it has the best theme </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> oh my god the ball theme dude yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> dolphin was terrifying as well darth </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> maul was [ __ ] tough [ __ ] darth vader </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah like like what's what's what's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> scary about someone having asthma </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> i have asthma does that make me [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> scary no also in the prequels we didn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> get to see anna can kill the kids yeah i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like that part </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> i like are you kidding me like like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> first time you see like um count dooku </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> fight yoda holy [ __ ] man that was that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> church for me to me that was like by far </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> the one star wars the only thing that i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> mean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the only thing that hurts me about the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the original three episodes is that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> jonah is literally in all of them yoda </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> is literally a puppet people love that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> though yeah i know but i said i don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> get that i prefer when he's like you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> know has a motion initially yeah yeah no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> i i liked him when he was [ __ ] sharp </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah when he was like flipping in the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> air when he brings out the light saber </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> he starts like doing [ __ ] like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gymnastics and all this [ __ ] i love </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> samuel jackson bro yeah samuel jackson </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> like samuel jackson is the only thing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that made the clone wars bearable yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah when he pulls out the purple </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> lights and i was like my man let's go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because like the coolest the only thing </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_05> never seen apocalypse now i haven't seen </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> apocalypse </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> the two japanese films okay so like as i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> was saying earlier like i always have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that like top three movies in case </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> anyone in like a panel always asks yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and my top three that i always bring up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is apocalypse now pulp fiction and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> goodfellas </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean those are all [ __ ] bangers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> obviously i mean this isn't this top top </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> uh 10 imdb films </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> i feel like goodfellas and pulp fiction </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> are definitely like oh yeah good fellas </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and pulp fiction are definitely up there </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> i've never wait no i haven't watched </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> goodfellas oh you've never seen </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> goodfellas i've never watched a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> godfather or goodfellas oh really yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> have you not you know it you know how </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> you said like sometimes you just save a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> movie that you just know you're gonna </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> love </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you know i don't need to watch it right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> now but i know i will and i know i'll </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> enjoy it yeah i mean like i feel like if </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> we're going through like that imdb thing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> right like most people are like oh yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> godfather like the godfather trilogy </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah that's definitely one of those and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's like the godfather trilogy is good </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> and like oh i like a lot of mods </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> scorsese films but i think out of all of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> them goodfellas it's a tie for me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> between goodfellas and casino </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i feel like cena is so underrated yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> casino feels very underrated man </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> scorsese film but i put good fellas </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there because it was like it's the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> classic it's the classic it's it's it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> was the first like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> score safe is what i'm seeing yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's it was the first monster scorsese </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like gangster film i ever watched yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah um and then like you know and then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> obviously i went back after that and was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like oh watch godfather and taxi driver </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and like all those i think the thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> about godfather is that i i obviously </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> recognize it as a good movie but there's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's there's a difference between me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> being like oh this is a really good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> movie too this is a movie that i really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> personally enjoy and for me godfather is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like something that i could recognize </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was really good it was just a bit slow </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sometimes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i feel like martin's called lazy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> gangster films it's just godfather but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> just a bit more condensed a bit more a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bit more snappy you know i mean i mean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah like uh martin scorsese did the do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> you departed yeah they did the party </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> that's probably one of my favorite </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's a fantastic [ __ ] i mean again </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> everything he's made like wolf of wall </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> street as well was fantastic yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> martial says he's just amazing he's just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> a great </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he's just a really really good filmmaker </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah consistent raging ball as well was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> another one oh yeah yeah yeah basically </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> every movie you can think of that has </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> robert de niro in it it's probably a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> scorsese film honestly they're like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> robert de niro and joe pesci is just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like one of the best duos like you you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> see them together and you know it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> going to be a banger film </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the part that killed me though was like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> i remember because i was i was telling </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> aki about this good good movie because </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> she'd never seen her before and she was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like who's in it and i was like oh uh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> you know robert de niro and like joe </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> passion is like yeah i know and then i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was like oh and ray leota's in it as </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> well and she's like oh yeah i know that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> guy from b-movie </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> [Laughter] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how does she know that because she loves </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> b-movie and i'm like you're dead to me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> oh that poor man that's it ray leona's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> legacy is literally goodfellas and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> b-movie </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because i did ask i can't think of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> another ray leona movie i'm sure he's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> been in a bunch of other movies i know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i've seen him in other things i just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> can't think of it at the top of my head </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but i mean like i don't really have to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> explain pulp fiction it's like one of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the most like i am normie cult classic </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> place i like cinema </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it's it's it's like i i swear to god it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was like either perfect or if if you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> want to look like you have a personality </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> in university you put a quentin </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> tarantino poster on your wall right yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's either a pulp fiction poster or a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> reservoir yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i put a tarantino film on my list so i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> guess we can debate it when we get to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> which one is the truth i mean i've seen </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> everything by tarantino he's like one of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> my favorite directors but i still think </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> to this day pulp fiction is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in my personal opinion it's my favorite </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's really close between pulp fiction </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and reservoir i i still put reservoir </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> dogs i'll save money </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> we will say we'll save we'll save that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> we'll save the quantity uh and then </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> apocalypse now is my favorite war film </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> okay so what's the apocalypse what's it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> even about apocalypse now is based on </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> the vietnam war yeah that's all i know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about it like basically the uh it's it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> told from the american side where like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> american troops are told so uh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> martin sheen is the main character </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and he is like set on a mission to go </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> and pick up a soldier from like he's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like he's like a vet who's the director </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> from the vin uh francis ford coppola </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's the same person who made godfather </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> oh yeah so francois koppler like this is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like one of his most famous films i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> think did you know francis ford coupler </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> is actually the uncle to nicholas cage </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> random fact that i found out at the end </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> of the day okay but anyway so basically </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's said where like martin sheen's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> character's team has to go into the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> vietnam forest to go and look for this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like vet who holds a lot of information </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about the vietnam war yeah basically </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he's kind of gone insane and is living </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in the vietnam war because it's marlon </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> brando </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> basically it's it's uh yeah so marlon </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> brando's character is this like viet </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like soldier vet who like holds a lot of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> information and like he needs to be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> brought back to the us army basically </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> martin sheen's character goes in tries </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to fight off all the the viet cong and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know tries to get him back basically </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> manchin's character is going through all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> of these like life and death situations </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> stuff like that he too also slowly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> starts to lose his mind and then </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> eventually and then you know that poster </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's pretty much [ __ ] awesome </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> poster yeah pretty much sums up like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that scene where he like comes out of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> the pool as there's like fighting </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> happening is one of the coolest [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> scenes in cinema i'm gonna watch that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> now that sounds cool like marlon brando </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> is like fantastic is it a thinking movie </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> i don't know what do i have to think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> during this movie well okay so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> apocalypse now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> has like a a director's cut called </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> apocalypse now redux which is like three </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and a half hours long because how long </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is the original three hours oh yeah so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it's all along okay okay because here's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the thing about apocalypse now because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everything you described i already kind </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of knew about because i knew like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> basic plot description and everything </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> like that yeah what makes it good </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> okay so in my opinion what makes it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> really good is just the fact well first </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> of all it's like the music choice in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that movie is [ __ ] brilliant it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like everything i [ __ ] love like in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> my opinion apocalypse now still has one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> of the greatest openings i've seen like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> any movie very iconic yeah um but i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> don't know it's also just like again </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's like it takes that like kind of war </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> element and weirdly enough it's a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> vietnam war film that doesn't really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have a whole lot of fighting yeah like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really the most amount of like fighting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> between the us army and vietnam really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> happens in like the first like maybe 20 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> minutes right and then the rest of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> movie is literally just you're inside </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the mind of manchin's character as he's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> slowly venturing closer and closer to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> his target and he's slowly like losing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> his mind as a result of war and it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a very like i don't know it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a really weird like psychological twist </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> on a war movie that you don't really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like because when you think of war movie </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right you think of like saving private </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> ryan whereas like yeah there's obviously </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> a lot of like you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> soldiers getting [ __ ] up in the war </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> scenes right but like there's also a lot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of like fighting scenes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right like gunfighting scenes or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> whatever the [ __ ] it is whereas </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> apocalypse now doesn't really have a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> whole lot of that it's like it's almost </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a psychological horror set during </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the vietnam war okay and i think that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> what personally that's what makes it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> really interesting to me yeah because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's cool because the thing is i think i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> know more about apocalypse now than the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> actual than actually seeing the movie </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> itself yeah yeah because i i know like i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think this has like a really interesting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> story behind how it was made yeah uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> because like i i think uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the director himself i think almost went </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> bankrupt making this movie or something </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like that yeah uh because he had to like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> convince the studio that he owned or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> something to like lend him the money to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> make this movie and he was out there for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like months and months shooting this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> movie it almost wasn't made and i think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like marlon brando just refused to read </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> the script yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> refused to remember his lines yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah he's been notorious for that though </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah he isn't here but this was the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> first movie where he started to become </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like this and then the godfather i think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> happened after apocalypse now which like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> then or was it the other way around i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> think it was the other way it might have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> been the other way around yeah basically </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah marlon brando doesn't appear in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this movie until maybe about two and a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> half hours yeah i thought i think like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> most of his lines are just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ad-libbed because he just refused to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> remember his line so i'm just like how </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> does that work how does that look like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i've ever seen any any of the movies </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that he's in but i know that he's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> notorious for being awful to work with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah yeah i mean you know like during </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> his prime obviously he was a fantastic </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and you know he's still a fantastic </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> actor in this movie as well but it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like it's very clear that he's not like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> at his peak but i feel like martin </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> sheen's performance in this movie is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just so goddamn good yeah that like he </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> does such an amazing job of like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> really like progressively showing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> someone going inside yeah yeah yeah i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> don't know it's funny might be a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> fantastic movie i remember i think it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> was on joe rogan i think um </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> no no no no um robert downey jr was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> talking about sometimes he didn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> remember lines yeah like i think when he </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> did </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> which i think sherlock he remembered all </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> his lines for but other movies he was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like just put put an earpiece in just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> feeding their lives well honestly like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> especially when he's like iron man he's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just acting robert downey jr </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he was saying you know some films don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> require me to get that deep into the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> character so there's no point in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> spending all this time learning the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> lines but like i think for like sherlock </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it was like quite difficult some of the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> lines in the way that he was doing it so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> he wanted to learn it yeah he's like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah it depends on the movie but the way </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> he's he made it sound made it seem like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> oh that makes sense then when you hear </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> about like the third party accounts of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> marlon brando yeah this sounds like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] hell yeah right and i bet like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know because there's a lot of big </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> actors in this name like um harrison </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> ford's in this movie as well yeah just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> before he's angry at everything this is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> before he's angry </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah but like i don't know just really </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> really good movie in my opinion um </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> king's speech all right okay i was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> surprised that that came out of nowhere </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i never i've never heard jerry mentioned </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> this film ever okay to be fair this is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> probably the most recent film i watched </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that really made like a massive impact </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> on me because like because he's obsessed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> with the royal family no it's because </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> aoki is obsessed with biopics </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> so before i met archaea i'd never really </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> cared to watch a lot of like biopics </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> biopics are like movies based off real </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> people's lives so essentially um and so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i watched a shitload of biopics with aki </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> so like imitation game was another one i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was thinking about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> um good movie theory of everything is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> another great movie but i don't know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something about king speech i mean </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> firstly i [ __ ] love jeffrey rush yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> he's like one of my favorite actors like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> everything that he had and he's done </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> such a [ __ ] good job in this movie as </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> well and i don't know it's just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> it's a really simple movie but it's just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> the acting in this is just so goddamn </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> believable yeah it's just so good </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> i've never actually watched it but i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> also um when i was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> growing up my best mate for like my </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> whole childhood had like a really bad </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> stutter yeah so i always had to order </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> from at things and everything yeah yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> and uh yeah i don't know this movie came </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> out and i think it was a big deal yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean i think it won best picture at </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> the oscars yeah it did yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i mean like i i the reason i knew a lot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about stuttering because again my best </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> mate had it and he had to go to a bunch </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of like uh therapy and stuff to try and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> get it because he was like you know like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> even like at like 16 17 18 yeah couldn't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like you know order at places right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right and so i i just got used to doing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it yeah um </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> and then yeah it was really interesting </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because i think in the movie they kind </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> of like gloss over it but like in real </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> life the way that you like get like you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can solve it there's like with so many </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> different methods yeah my mate had to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> wear like uh a belt </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> like a big belt around his chest to make </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> his breathing different oh wow </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah yeah yeah yeah i mean the movie </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> actually does go through like all the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> actual steps that oh okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> that the king actually had to go through </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and stuff like that and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah it's really interesting as well and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> it's just cool to think that like a lot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> of this stuff actually happened yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> and at the end like king </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> george was his name i can't remember i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> don't know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what whatever the king's name was like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> actually got over a stutter in real life </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> as a result of this dude who just you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> know solved it and i don't know it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just like it's very like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> because you like meticulously watched </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> through like every single step and every </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> failure of the game trying to get over a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> starter yeah it's just like the ending </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> speech is just really powerful and like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> really rewarding being like [ __ ] yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> dude you nailed that [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my man let's go i mean i saw it a while </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> ago and i just remember it was it was a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> good movie um </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i think this movie got me into biopics </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> oh okay yeah okay like after i was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> okay you know what i thinks might be </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of cool i'm glad you guys didn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> put any like documentaries or anything i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was like we have to say that for another </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> time oh yeah we'll save that from yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> we'll say that for another time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> connor would do like a [ __ ] 10 bites </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> um and then obviously bruce almighty </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> were talking about like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> who hasn't seen bruce i mean it's it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like morgan freeman is god i still think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> of morgan freeman as god morgan just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because of bruce almighty yeah it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the most 2000s film ever yeah it is like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> 2000 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> might come out 90s but yeah i think this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is like this encapsulates the feeling of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the 2000s exactly like everyone in it is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> amazing it's still funny to this day </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah basically </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like because of this movie if i die and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't see morgan freeman at the pearly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> gates i'll just want to refund on life </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like take me to hell </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> i explicitly died with the expectation </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> that morgan freeman </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um and then what's another obvious one i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> mean austin powell's gold members before </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> you get to these ones yeah explain </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> explain the japanese films the japanese </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> okay explain the hong kong wait which </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> one do you want to hear about the first </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> one the top one the top one okay so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> darshan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so this was during a time this was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> during like a very uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i guess pretentious period of my high </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> school life where i was like i want to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> watch a lot of really old films okay so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> darshan is one uh it's done by this guy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> called akira kurosawa oh it's an akira </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> creation </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> film who's known as one of the greatest </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> film directors hello i'm a film buff </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> mention one name hello i'm a filmmaker </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm a pretentious film boss so i sat </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> down and watched every akira kurosawa </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> film and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> is one of them and it's essentially it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> really hard to kind of explain but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> basically i think this movie was made in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 1950 i think yeah yeah black and white </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> film but basically it revolves around </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this like one murder case that happens </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in like edo period japan and it's and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the same uh i guess murder is told from </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> different perspectives and different </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> characters so like it kind of plays </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> around i don't know if it was the first </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> movie to ever do but it kind of plays </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> around with the whole like unreliable </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> narrator like logic that a lot of movies </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> use now and it's just like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i don't know the cinematography in it is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like it's hard to believe this movie was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> made 70 years ago yeah i mean that's why </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> every [ __ ] big director in their big </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> film buff still says his name </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> is your favorite director's favorite </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> director yeah yeah yeah yeah basically </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah and then like i i feel that darshan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was one of those movies that like took </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everything that akira curacao was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really good at in terms of filmmaking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah just like crushed it into like an </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hour 30 minutes like solid movie and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like mifune toshiro is like the guy in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the poster who's in like basically every </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] akira kurosawa movie but like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he's one of my favorite japanese actors </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just because like i don't know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> he he kind of you know there's that like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> weird stigma of japanese acting where </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's like way over the top and like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> really unrealistic yeah we've talked </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about it which we talked about like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> mifune toshiro in my opinion like kind </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of took that and almost made it his own </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah cause like every mufune toshiro </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> character is like so over exaggerated in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> terms of like emotion and like movement </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and stuff like that like i'd be very </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> surprised if he didn't do like theater </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> training yeah and [ __ ] like that but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like i don't know it's over exaggerated </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> but it's still like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> believable if that makes sense okay and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like it becomes really like kind of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i don't know what the right word for it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is i know i sound very pretentious right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> now but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it's a real go ahead </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> but like in my opinion </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like there's lots of really good </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> accuracy movies yeah i think the only </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one i've seen is seven samurai seven </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> samurais it was like the classic yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that's that's the one where that like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> fight scene goes on for so goddamn long </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that might be the i mean there's a lot </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> of like that was a really weird sure </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> there's a lot of fight scenes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> the other the other seven samurai did </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> they have a remake </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there was a western arena yeah there was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> a western remake also the magnificent </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> seven is the western version of that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> film uh which is also a classic i think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe i'll watch what are they called 13 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> assassins that's a remake right of uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> that's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i don't know actually </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> i think that's the first story is it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah is that a really really long </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> fight in seven sam right uh i don't know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> about seven samurai but like the one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that i can think of as a really long </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> fight is probably iran </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> you've probably seen seven samurai if </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> you've gone through if you went through </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the phrase of going through like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> imdb top you've probably seen it you've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> probably seen about five because like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i've watched a movie called seven </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> samurai that was in black and white and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there was a there was a fight scene yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that was like two hours long and i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just like sitting there like what is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> when is it gonna end i don't know about </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i don't think seven samurai was even two </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> hours long yeah no it was it was it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like three and a half hours </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah is there a long fight scene in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> seven sounds </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that was just a very long movie </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean it's probably the scene it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> probably the film you're thinking i want </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to know if i've watched it you've </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> probably seen it it's it's it's a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> classic like it's definitely on the imdb </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like there's probably about five </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> accuracy films if you go through the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> imdb it's actually only one it's only </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> seven samurai i was about to say </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um because that's the only one here </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's on the imdb top 250. so that's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> the only one that most people have only </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> seen probably even though he has like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> such a wealth of work yeah i mean ron </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was i think his first color film and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that was also [ __ ] fantastic i think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> i think the stigma is that a lot of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> akira kurosawa films are like based </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> around like samurai and [ __ ] like that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah when like later on in his career he </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> did a lot of like kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> rooted more in like modern day stuff </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there's there's another film that i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> thought about putting up there called </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> ikiru which means to live yeah and it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> essentially this like kind of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> coming-of-age story of this old man who </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> realizes that he's like about to die and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> basically like you know the movie the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> bucket list with [ __ ] yeah like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> morgan jackman jack nicholson i feel </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that completely ripped off of the cure </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because it's it's almost like because </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the concept is exactly the same it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> like an old guy wanting to like kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> rediscover his life and like really like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> give meaning to his life on his deathbed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay but like told him like a really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like cool artistic acura kurosawa esque </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right um </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i don't know yeah i mean he he's a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> legend for reading oh he's allegedly in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the film industry if you're a movie buff </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> please watch akira kurosawa what's this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> i've never okay kameron </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah so basically it's this movie have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> you seen it yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's okay i was not expecting anything </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> out of this movie so i actually watched </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> this film when did it come up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> it very it's quite quite recently it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> like a couple years ago yeah so i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thought it was just gonna be like okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so the reason why i think this movie is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> genius is the way that it was marketed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so the way that it's marketed you look </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at this poster and you think oh it's a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> zombie film yeah like a b grade zombie </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> film kind of thing okay it's completely </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not it basically takes the zombie film </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thing and turns it super [ __ ] meta so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> basically what it is it's like i don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> want to give too much away but basically </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the movie opens with this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 15-20 minute one cut zombie film okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like there's no cuts in it whatsoever </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then you think oh the credits roll </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and that's it but then what happens is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it goes back and it shows you how that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one cut movie is made but told in a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fictional way </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's really difficult it's really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] meta it's basically that sounds </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> cool it's basically a movie </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> on and there's like all sorts of like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> weird like it's actually a comedy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's also like there's all these like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> weird comedic shenanigans that happen </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> behind the scenes of them shooting that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> one-shot 20-minute zombie film yeah so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> the movie is about the making of that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> movie </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that honestly sounds like it's right up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> my alley yeah and it's i think you'd </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> you'd like that i'm just like this is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> this that's a goddamn </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i'll make a [ __ ] video on this i was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> i was not expecting this movie to be </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> good at all but it was one it's really </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> really funny and two again like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> whole meta aesthetic of it i was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> whoa i've never and what it gets even </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> more meta because during the credit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> scenes then there's a behind-the-scenes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> camera of that camera okay so it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a movie within a movie within a movie </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's like i love it i just love like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the whole meta aesthetic of it but like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i put this on there because like for one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> i barely know anyone who's seen it i've </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> never even heard of it yeah you'd like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i guess people will know yeah the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> english title is uh one cut of the dead </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> one of the dead yeah that sounds so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> cliche </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> but that's exactly it right like it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> plays to the strengths of zombie film </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> cliches and just completely flips it on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> its head and just turns it into like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> this wacky slapstick comedy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah and it's really really cool it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> sounds like an episode of harahi or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> something right yeah honestly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah i mean i feel like the last </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> zombie movie that i watched that i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> really [ __ ] enjoyed was trained to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> busan oh that's good </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> fantastic movie so good and like i i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> can't explain why it's really good </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> because it's just like a very like it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it has like the same beats as just a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> standard zombie movie but it's just just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just a really good movie it's a solid </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> movie this is a solid movie even though </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> even if like you think you're bored of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> the zombie genre </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like i think i am somebody yeah because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> i thought okay if you're bored of the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> zombie genre you need to watch that and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then i gotta watch twenty percent </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> they're gonna watch other [ __ ] yeah [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no but like one cut of the dead it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that was the time yeah one cut of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> day like yeah like i feel if there's any </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> movie i can recommend on my three by </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> three it's probably that one just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> because it's like it comes like both put </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it in the bottom right as well like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bottom left sorry like it completely </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> destroys what you think about movies </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah in a way that's like really fun and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> also like just again it's just meta as </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] if you want that whole meta thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like you'd love that yeah okay um and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> then i put gladiator on there just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> because i probably would have put </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> gladiator too it's a good film </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> uh yeah it's just good it's just very </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just good yeah just like there's no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> complaint like i don't have any like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> special memories with the movie i just i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just think it's really good clean story </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> just clean that's i like history </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> it's not it's not even history right i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like tournament arcs </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yes that's basically it right radiator </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> is just a tournament russell crow he's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> funny yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> is a great actor i just realized yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> this is basically just a [ __ ] shonen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> anime yeah set in rome and it's just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> condensed down into a movie dude </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> tournament arc revenge story yeah it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everything i want russell crowe it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> everything i want yeah and i feel like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> it's this and i i was like really close </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> to putting 300 on mine oh yeah because i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> think i like 300. i feel like gladiator </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> is the better film but i think 300 made </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> a more of an impression 300 is the more </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> entertaining variety yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> before before like zack snyder thought </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like before zack snyder thought i could </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> put slo-mo in everything </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> what if what if i just do it use it for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> everything like i remember 300 is so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> good not gonna lie man the slow motion </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> fight scenes in 300 still [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> slapped to this day i i feel i i still </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think it's zack snyder's best feeling i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> was 100 agree like he just he just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> peaked with that and he was just like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> how do i recapture this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> how do i same thing with all my other </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> films it's such a fun film it is a good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> film it's such a quotable just fun like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> bloody gory film such a cool story too </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah it's just it's just like facebook </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah it's [ __ ] awesome </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> as much as this one yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean somewhat yeah you cannot like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> watch 300 and not just come out just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> hyped as [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> punch someone the funniest thing about </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> 300 in my opinion is just how they made </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> xerxes into this like nine foot tall </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like brick [ __ ] house when i think in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> real life xerxes was like four feet tall </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like he was actually a [ __ ] never like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> zacks i was like no no let's let's get </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the biggest chad in the movie film </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> industry and just make him play cersei </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because i i think have you been have you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> been in a like movie theater where </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they've literally just gasped </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yes yeah because like 300 is the only </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> experience i've had in a movie theater </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where like the whole [ __ ] movie </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> theater just gasped </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um and that was the scene that was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the very final scene where he throws the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> spear oh yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that was such a good scene yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> god that's such a god i want to watch </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> 300 again </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's such a good film you can't not be </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> such a quotable movie i mean like all of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> these films like there's there's at </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> least one quote i can easily one or two </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> quotes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah let's get into this austin powell's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> why </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> it's gold member what's up with that i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> don't know i think it's the best austin </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> powers movie i don't really like austin </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> powell you know like austin powers </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i watched i re-watched gold member again </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> just because like one of my friends came </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> over to my house and was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i feel like watching gold member and i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was like and i was like i haven't seen </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> that movie in like 10 years but let's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> let's do is that movie still funny now i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> feel like it's not funny i think it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> still funny do you think it's funny </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> anymore i didn't find it funny when it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> first came out i'll be honest yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't know it's uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's again it's like that whole like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> it's it's the meta thing right it's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> the fact that austin powers as a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> character is it's just like james bond </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right yeah it's just so aware of what he </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is that yeah it's it's the potty humor </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> poo poo pee pee humor right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> it really is it kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i i like that humor i don't know why i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> didn't like this movie like uh the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> golden i've seen uh sorry the austin </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> power series i think i've seen all of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> them and i just thought like yeah that's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> all right it's i don't know it's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for me it's just like comfort food to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just go back to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's just like it's either that or bruce </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> almighty in terms of comedy films right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm like yeah this is still funny i mean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i i think it's just like the peepee hoop </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i feel like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it was a bit bit too in your face yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> when i think of austin powers i just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> feel like i i like recall and discuss </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> bit i think you know what it is there's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so many gross scenes in that film </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know what it is about gold member in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> particular i think it's like the same </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> concept as like when you see like you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> know a troll face comic </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> on twitter right where it's like it's so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> not funny that it's just funny again </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's just ancient music </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the second one this is the third one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> third one this is one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bastard yeah this is the last one oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> gosh yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> and like gold member is also played by </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> uh mike myers where he's like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] dutch guys like i love gold like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> that characters like it's so dumb that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like it's funny i just i just feel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like i put it in like the same category </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> as scary movie and do you remember scary </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> movie see i didn't find scary movies </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> funny at all i didn't find it funny at </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> all yeah and it's it's the 16 year old </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> me love scary movie yeah and then when i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> watched it again i was like oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> it's it's the same kind of like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> this is a parody kind of humor and i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> just like i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i never found that too funny i mean i i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> love pee pee poo poo humor jokes but it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was just a bit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> too in your face right right yeah i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't know yeah maybe i i i swear i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> probably got a few laughs out of it here </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and there but i don't know maybe i don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> know why i think i'm kind of just like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> numb to comedy movies now just because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> like the past five years of comedy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> movies have just all been really [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mediocre in mind yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> many many good comedy like i'm trying to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> think of like the last good comedy movie </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and like i genuinely four year old </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> virgin i genuinely think it might be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> cold </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that was like nearly as fun pretty sure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> superbad came off of this yeah right as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a white guy i'm obliged to say step </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> brothers even though i don't really feel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> since we're all doing hot takes on </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> movies i don't think i don't think i've </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> ever laughed at a well-feral movie no i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> mean there isn't a single will for a lot </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't think well i don't actually </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> think stepbrothers is freaking out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> there's one scene in step brothers that </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_05> i'm surprised one thing i'm surprised </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> that's not on here yeah is uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> trainspotting because you've talked </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> about that a bunch [ __ ] you know what i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> completely forgot about it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> actually yeah can we can we get rid of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> gold member and put train sporting no no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> someone criticized me because they said </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> when someone they asked me what my </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> favorite video game or whatever was and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i said different from what i put on my </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> three i think we make off three by </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> threes in like 10 minutes this is not </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like the end all of our actual exactly </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> exactly which try to make it interesting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah they're fine </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm thinking oh i've really enjoyed this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> is the end by uh a seth rogen film oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what yeah and uh what is uh 50 50 was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> really good oh 50 50 was great i haven't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> seen any of these </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> the ones where like the joke isn't just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> him being a stoner right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> and that's why is that even possible </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah wow all right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> okay yeah he does because i think i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> think with seth rogen like i watched one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> film with seth rogen in it and i was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like was it pineapple express </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> it might have been that's and i was like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and i was like i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> percent understand this actor in this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> character she's probably like that in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> every other movie yeah yeah i don't know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh my god [ __ ] can i talk about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> transporting okay okay sorry sorry sorry </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's so good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> okay have you guys seen it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> i have not you haven't seen it okay so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> trainspotting is this like oh god how do </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> you how the [ __ ] to explain train </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sporting i know that it's not about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> spotting trains it is not about spotting </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> trees so the term train spotting comes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> from heroin addicts where they try to uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> inject the heroin into their veins so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they have to spot the veins and that is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> referred to as train spotting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah so basically it's a it's a drug </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> film uh set in scotland </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> uh played uh mainly by euro mcgregor </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah who is in his natural habitat he's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in his natural uh accent so you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's going to be good uh very very young </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> ewan mcgregor yeah i think this is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> before star wars i think i think the one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> scene i remember from train spotting </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> apart from the baby scene yeah uh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was just toilet scene yeah just you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> mcgregor emerges from the toilet yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i've heard about this yeah i've heard of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> the scenes in trains yeah so very famous </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> scene is where your mcgregor needs to go </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know do a hit and he's at a pub and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> he goes into the closest no no that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right no he uh he gets the runs i think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from something yeah and he runs into a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> pub and goes into the probably the most </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> disgusting looking toilet imaginable </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah like it's it's like it's actually </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> foul and he drops his drugs into the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> toilet oh and because he's a desperate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> junkie and he took a shot beforehand he </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> starts hallucinating as he reaches into </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the toilet and just goes into the toilet </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and starts swimming into the inside the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> toilet emerges out of the toilet with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> the drugs oh my god it's a very very </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> bizarre movie but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> i showed trainspotting to aki right and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> she was she stopped it after five </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> minutes and she's like can we put </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> subtitles on because i can't understand </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what the [ __ ] they're saying </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to be fair </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> it's a very heavy scottish accent like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there are some scenes where even i'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> like oh i didn't quite catch what he </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> just [ __ ] said there so like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> americans this is what i'm saying </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> probably best to put subtitles being </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from the uk is like your english level </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is op yeah i understand any any form of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> the only reason why the only reason why </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i understand train sporting is because i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like watched it like over 10 times </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> i just remember what they say but uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i don't know it's just like it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> very brutal film but also it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> again like the music choices like yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> if with mute with movies if it's got a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> great music choice i'm all for it yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> same with my anime right if the ost is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> good it's a great movie i'd say if </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> there's like two like drug like films </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of like what how do i how do i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> describe this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> is that a category </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah drug movie drug movie like because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like i don't really know how to describe </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> train spotting it's just a movie about a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bunch of characters and that's sold on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it to be fair i like how their lives </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> revolve around drugs and like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> trainspotting is one of them and the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> other one is requiem for a dream yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is not a film i think like people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> should watch to enjoy but i think people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> should just watch it at least once yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> like realize wow i just just never want </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> to try heroin you know i just that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that's just a bad thing well i mean </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> train sporting was definitely one where </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> i was like oh never touching that [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah in my life [ __ ] that [ __ ] that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you know i was 50 50 but uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> if you ever have a friend who's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> maybe i might try heroin just show them </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> train spawn they'll probably be like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> nope never drink him for a dream or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> recreate for a dream i think i just got </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> full on [ __ ] depression for a week </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> after watching that film i mean </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> trainspotting is definitely another film </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> that is not watched for entertainment </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah probably more entertaining </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> than recording for a dream i i would </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like to say like tradespotting isn't a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> happy movie but it's like less bleak </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> than wrecking for a dream </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there's a lot there's a lot of great </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> scenes and it's like i don't know just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> again the acting's really good and it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just very it's a very raw film yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> requiem for a dream just sounds like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something you'd give an oscar to based </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on the title </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> to be fair there's some great [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> scenes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like [ __ ] that's awesome yeah the thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i can say about rec room for a dream is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that it's just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so [ __ ] powerful movie and it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's makes you feel emotions that it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> not pleasant feeling yeah but it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] powerful [ __ ] man speaking of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> powerful should we uh get onto my list </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> go on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> is it powerful </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> it's going to be powerful i actually did </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> put no country for old men oh wow </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> what's interesting is off camera this is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mine </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yes this one off camera uh she was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like oh yeah i wouldn't put her no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> control honestly i was so close to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> putting some of these on mine i know you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> were gonna put that oh okay okay because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i was like i was like maybe someone else </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is gonna put it man but that was so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> close to coming on my way this is a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> powerful list i think gentlemen i think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> you know what </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the only one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that i probably have like a little bit </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> of qualms with is uh tokyo no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> absolutely not this isn't a masterpiece </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if we're talking about overrated films </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> tokyo drift uh it is not overrated </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> listen the main actor you know his </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> entire fast and furious franchise i've </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> ever written he's actually i said he's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> he's an impeccable character actor the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> main actor in tokyo drift you know i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> don't know if you're being serious he </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> he he enveloped like he nothing is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> mimicked living in japan quite like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> tokyo drew you're right you're right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when i went to school and some and you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> know i love all one japanese actors in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> this you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know when i was in school in japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> with my black friend from america um </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> we dreamed of going to japan one day and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we were like what is the closest we can </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> get to it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> i think every every single point of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> tokyo drift is a master class in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> filmmaking frankly uh from the very </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> start you know in the american high </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> school scene it's very very much like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> how to still be in america yeah and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> naturally i race my cars and uh i cause </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> a lot of damage and don't get arrested </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and get exiled which i don't think is a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> punishment that you see </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> you know a lot of movies they would just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> arrest him yeah and i think he was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> really genius well you know like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> excellent full speed drifting through a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> parking lot which is just you know if </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you've ever been to a parking lot in any </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> country it's just impossible there's not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> enough movies that use exile as a as a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> good way of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> conveying the story </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> name a movie with exile in it i'll wait </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> there we go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> for good reason it's a medieval concept </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> that it hasn't been introduced in modern </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> films you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> exile exile he was exiled from arkansas </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> some i don't know where the [ __ ] he was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i don't know some hick town yeah and you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> know his accent is just amazing i love i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> love this guy's accent so so much i love </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> the accent i don't think i've ever felt </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> physical pain while watching a movie </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> before until i launched youtube i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gonna be honest i have not seen a single </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fast and furious film uh i've only seen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> tokyo drift and i you know because i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> didn't wanna i didn't wanna be annoyed </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> because we'd already found the best fast </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> and furious film so why watching i must </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> say you are not missing out on it no no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> tokyo have you watched your drift i i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> literally just said five seconds ago </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> literally five seconds i think it was a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> fast and furious film no i don't count </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> this as a foster future it's a cinema </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> experience it's a totally different it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> somehow worse no it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's if you add up all the imdb scores </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of the fast and furious films it's still </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> not as high as tokyo direct like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah because like zero zero zero </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> there's not much </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> tokyo drift is a great film uh that is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> close to my heart um in many ways uh not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> only did it get me into uh donkey kong </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> uh because of the dk oh yeah of course </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> this is the monkey origin story </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> there was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know it's almost </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> it's just there's nothing quite as uh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> groundbreaking as this film quite </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> frankly </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so what what's your favorite scene uh i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like the scene </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> he breaks his ipod and then he still </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> manages to sell the ipod broken and then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he doesn't check to he doesn't check to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to check the ipod before buying it uh i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> believe this is what happens and then he </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> purchased the ipod then gets annoyed </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that it was broken yeah but he never </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> once thought i should check this ipod </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> before buying it uh class and that's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just a great i thought that was a really </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> intelligent scene because that's how </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> they made conflict through a broken ipod </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what i want to know is um how there's so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> many fast and the furious films uh well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you this actually saved the fast and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> furious franchise </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> when you hear of someone saying fast and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> furious i think of tokyo drift yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> they're right most people i think think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> of tokyo drift and i'm like why like do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the other fast and furious films even </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> have names how does it like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> how does such a [ __ ] film become so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> iconic like that's what i wanted like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just like it is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> it is terrible by every single metric of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> the english word but i love this film to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> death it's like the room right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like the room of fast and furious </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just it's just got the coolest name </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i mean tokyo drift right it's a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cool last one so literally i know we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> spoke about this before but like it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> kind of like a gateway for me to japan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like yeah it goes actually it kind of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> legit got me into japan in many ways i'm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> sorry it was it was better </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> it's great because then i got to learn </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> actual [ __ ] all right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> also it was the very first dvd i ever </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> owned uh it was totally fair enough yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> it's in a glass cabinet as you can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> imagine i think that i think i think the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> vacuum sealed yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah mint condition has been graded </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> obviously </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i think the first dvd i ever owned was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> shrek </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> well honestly okay so tokyo drift is a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> terrible but amazing movie and i can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> watch it and enjoy it because you can </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just laugh at it now it's amazing to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> laugh at oh yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there's some of the dialogue that they </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that those poor actors have to actually </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> like say it's just hilarious yeah and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then it gets just not not fun at all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> towards the end right and then it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> becomes two different okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then it becomes too soon let me ask you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> one thing all right why shrek two over </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> strike one two is the most straight </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> straight two stretch two is the best </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> really it is dude two is the best bro </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> shrek two is the best like like shrek </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> run set the rules and then what is your </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> friend your english shrek one set the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> rules and then shrek two perfected </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> everything yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> okay look i'm not gonna go against the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> fact that shrek two is a good movie </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> strike two is the best bro but prince </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> charming is [ __ ] amazing i still </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> think shrek 1 is battle </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> shrek 1 is just an encapsulated </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> experience that is fantastic i think the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> problem with shrek 1 is that no one can </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> watch it seriously anymore because it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> being memed to the ends of the earth not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> enough not enough scenes in shrek to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> have been memed and i think that's why </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> two is just like i actually disagree </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because i feel like shrek is one of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> few franchises where the memes have only </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like put it into legendary status i am </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> never going to forget shrek anymore yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i can't like that's why </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> smash mouth can like retire because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> they've already been immortalized yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> through shrek memes strength is an </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> amazing film that you can watch anytime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> but i think people forget how [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> amazing shrek 2 is yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> obviously so much better than track one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> watch it in my opinion like shrek one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> just inches strike is an 8.5 and shrek </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is a nine point two in my head trick two </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> sorry two there's a nine point five and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> shrek one is uh eight point five sorry </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> honestly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> every single character they oh two it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not even worth watching every single </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> character they introduce in shrek 2 is a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> banger character true they all like help </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the story so much and then they they </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> build on the the one-off characters in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> shrek 1 that you thought were a joke </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah they bring them back they're like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> hold up hold up you know there's a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> reason why the wharf is cross-dressing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> let's find out let's just see </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> gingerbread man in pinocchio also uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> they use uh the soundtrack uh in very </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> intelligent ways you know they do they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> do the soundtrack's banging yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that's true </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the condition of i need a hero was yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> [Music] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> standalone movie was terrible </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but there's a reason why he was so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> lovable it's also amazing to think like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> how many [ __ ] high-profile actors are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in shrek 2. honestly isn't it isn't the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> very godmother played by julie andrews i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> think so i think yeah if you're if you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> want your career made you're in shrek </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> too yeah every coincidence that every </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> single shrek 2 actor is a goddess </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> antonio banderas was the cat right yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> exactly right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> why did mike myers do another like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] yeah yeah austin powers film </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> when he was in shrek yeah this is why i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> even tried yeah why why why joey </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> the best minecraft shrek 100 because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> mike myers has like two good films and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> uh it's shrek </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> shrek </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> wayne's world is overrated track one and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> two is only good role i agree i'll agree </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> wayne's world is over right now yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> okay uh but let's talk about the the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> quentin tarantino choice you put yes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> kill bill i i think volume one really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> okay i like volume really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> i i actually won number one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i know volume is great volume 2 is rated </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> higher and it's a crime we didn't get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> another one it's a legit crime we didn't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> get a volume 3. uh i just think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i think in the entire like filmography </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of queen tarantino </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> kill bill is just one that i just forget </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> see the thing for me is like pulp </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> fiction isn't even like my top five </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> quentin tarantino really yeah i think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> that like glorious bastards django is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> better um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> is better than pulp fiction and what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> else has he done that's bad what about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like jackie brown look look look </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> django would have been like one of his </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> best films if not for jamie foxx i feel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like jamie foxx was so [ __ ] dry do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you know who was originally casting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> smith will smith they got wilson's for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that movie </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> [Music] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah christoph waltz had to do the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] yeah yeah exactly everyone is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i think jimmy fox is great in that movie </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what do you remember after the big scene </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> in the middle uh i think i actually </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can't remember much that's that's the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> point </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because after that it's jamie foxx who </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> has to carry the film and he just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> doesn't well i think one of the actually </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one jamie foxx tries when the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> deck is samuel jackson what i was gonna </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> say because i was gonna say like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> actually like you know everyone focused </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on christoph waltz he did amazing and so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> did uh uh leonardo dicaprio yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but like samuel jackson is like probably </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> one of the my favorite things in that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> film he's he's so [ __ ] good he's good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> evil yeah he's good don't get me wrong </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> but it's not the best samuel jackson </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> role </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] role he does is amazing like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> samuel jackson kills it and everything </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah i get that but like i think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> his role in like jackie brown was 100 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> times better </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> i just i just think i had more fun </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> watching one like jackie brown and like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> even kill bill over django </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i i just i don't think pulp fiction was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> that good </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> how dare you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> wow yeah i think it was fine there was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> just like there was too many scenes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where i was actually bored during pulp </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fiction </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like i the scene when they're at the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> restaurant just talking it was i was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bored out of my mind what you mean the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> one at the end no no in the start and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the start </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not right not the diner the restaurant </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> where they're like uh were they doing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like milkshakes with john travolta oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> jack rabbits yeah i can't [ __ ] that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> seems [ __ ] great i just think john </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> travolta is like not a good actor i i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> think he's not good i mean i don't know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> if one of these mistakes though no john </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> is a badass no no okay john travolta is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> very much samuel jackson carries like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you it's so obvious because when samuel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> jackson isn't withdrawn to walter </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> johnsonville sucks okay in my opinion </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> john scenes were there without those two </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> together yeah well there weren't many </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> like one or two but like and he was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> terrible i think john travolta is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> terrible but john travolta is one of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> those actors where like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> i feel have you seen his recent movies </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no but that's because okay the reason </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> why recent john travolta movies he's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> clearly like has just been type casted </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as the bad guy because of pulp fiction </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> because before pulp fiction </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> john travolta just did all the grease </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> lightning movies right so he literally </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> went further he was in greece he </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> literally went from this like sing-songy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so suddenly playing as this like badass </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> gangster right and because of the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> success of pulp fiction all the movie </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> industry was like we need a bad guy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> who's also like kind of quirky and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> charming on the surface but is actually </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] up on the inside john travolta i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> mean like pulp fiction isn't my favorite </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> tarantino movie </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i mean i put it on his reservoir </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like i i still would put like i i really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> love glorious bastards yeah um would you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> saying glorious masters is better than </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> pulp fiction do you do you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'd say it's about the same </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> i think glorious bastards is good it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> better than pulp fiction but for </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> different reasons yeah i i do agree with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you where there are some parts of pulp </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> fiction that did drag but when like i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> feel like the highs of pulp fiction are </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> just they're like the best tarantino can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> do yeah uh kill bill is i feel like one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of his most i love different movies yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> kill build is clearly the movie where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> tarantino was like i like anime by the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> way yeah i love it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i really like anime i really like japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's so cool i just love it everything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> about the movie is just so fun i mean </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like yeah yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> is [ __ ] awesome </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i love the scene with uh uh what's the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> name kuriyama who did gogo hibari with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like the chain thing that's so good i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> love that i just love [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> when like um </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> goku kibara comes out like swinging the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> the that sucks and then turns around </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> she's like go go danny </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> that scene [ __ ] kills me every time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i mean i feel like on an aesthetic </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> level there's a few that are as iconic </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> as kill builds </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] and also uh the restaurant is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> still like open in tokyo yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like going there and like seeing it and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> be like [ __ ] yeah it's so cool when </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you go to that restaurant you're also </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like [ __ ] how did they make this happen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> it's definitely like a culturally </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> significant movie i mean i mean like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for the record all of quinton tarantino </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> movies are [ __ ] amazing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh i just feel like kill bill is like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the most different i feel like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> especially in terms of tarantino movies </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> volume two was felt me way more like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> tarantino movie either i dead ass don't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> even remember what happens in volume two </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> she [ __ ] kills bill joey </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> joey how do you spoil joey i can't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> believe it's spoiled kill bill it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> literally literally there in the title </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> i've re-watched the first one so many </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> times i've barely watched the second one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> i don't know why i don't know it's just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> like i've definitely seen kill bill </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> volume 2 a couple of times i just don't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> remember what happened other than the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> titular i mean i would say that the only </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> film i mean the only seeing out kill </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bill that really sticks out to my mind </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> is the one at the end of kill bill </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> volume one which is her against that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh lucy lou right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no not lucy liu the one with her against </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like the [ __ ] what the name of the uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gang that she fights </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> that's not the end the crazy 88 yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> that's like in the middle no that's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> right before the end right before the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> end is when she he she fights lucy liu </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah that's the ending yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah so the one so she fights the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> crazy 88 before she </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to me that is like the iconic scene of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the kill build </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> but i feel like overall i feel like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> second film was just a little bit better </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> um i felt like i have to rewatch it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> honestly yeah i have to i think so what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> why is this your favorite tarantino </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> movie then i don't know again i think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just how unique it is and how </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> stylized like this i don't you don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> really get a movie like it anymore i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> don't know yeah definitely not it's just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> such a good movie i feel i feel like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> this is the only successful live-action </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> anima adaptation you know what i mean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> where it's like this feels like it was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> based off of i know you had actual </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] anime in it yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> by production yeah yeah that's [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> badass yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> the whole law when they build it up yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah yeah oh my god it's just so [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everything about that film is just like </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_03> director having [ __ ] things it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> definitely the most like turn your brain </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> off type of time but it's the best kind </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> it's the best </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> because you don't need to turn your </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> brain off to appreciate this movement </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah but at the same time it's that it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> follows that kind of same style yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> where you don't have to think much but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> everything about this just has impact </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah absolutely right impact impacts i </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_05> holy [ __ ] this is actually like a a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> really good [ __ ] take on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> your life and and missing out on yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> especially the second half where it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> starts to get really serious i'm just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> like oh my god this is not the direction </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> i was expecting it to go so good yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like it shows that like when adam </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sandler wants to [ __ ] act he brings </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> his [ __ ] name i was like wow he </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> he can act </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> again this is like why watching uncut </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> gems is like all the [ __ ] parts of click </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are like not there right and just just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> great [ __ ] acting from adam sandler </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and like it's just it's amazing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i just feel like people forget that i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> think adam sandler actually made good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> films i i i like a lot like like i feel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like click was might might be his like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> last great film or last good film </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> because i remember he just like fell off </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> a cliff after a certain point but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> now he just makes he's openly admitted </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that he makes movies on um basically if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he can go to a vacation on the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> place because his production what a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> powerful thing because the movies that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> he makes his production companies yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> so he just picks places he can go on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> vacation </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i think there's a lot of good adam </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sandler movies that i really enjoy like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> uh has anyone seen anger management yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i've really really enjoyed something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> jack nicholson </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> oh my god that's such a good film that's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a great one like he has such a bad rep </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> but i [ __ ] these like his films </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> defined a lot of like the early 2000s </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> comedy i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> so [ __ ] stupid like in a bed bath </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> beyond he gets </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like he's like yeah he's like a security </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> guard bed bath and beyonce there's so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> many [ __ ] childish jokes like when he </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> farts on the guy and stuff and then fast </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> forwards in the room like that's just so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> dumb because like they actually hit so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> many good [ __ ] emotional notes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i wish they didn't [ __ ] sully with </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that [ __ ] but it's actually a good movie </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i love it it's so good although to be </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> fair the scene where he like smacks the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> boss in the face and then plays and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> there's like whoa i just had a massive </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> headache like that scene is still really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> funny yeah yeah there's some good moves </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i have never seen catch me if you can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you haven't no oh my god it's a movie </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it's so good it's a movie i've heard so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> many times i think it is the best lean </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> out of the capri film yeah that's all </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> i've heard from people and then there's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> tom hanks in it as well i mean i mean </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> tom hanks is just a [ __ ] delight yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean i i feel like it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> what do you think is when you think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> leonardo dicaprio what movie comes to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> your mind i i don't think i'll catch me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you can no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i think tom hanks for this one yeah i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't think of him for it but then also </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when i think of it it uses like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> everything that leonardo dicaprio </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> especially at that point in his life </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> actually what movie do you think of when </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you say leonardo dicaprio probably now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> wolf of wall street yeah i think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> now oh really i think it's shutter </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i feel like leonardo dicaprio has </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> evolved quite a lot during his time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> because he's been acting since like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> remember when he remember when he was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the titanic boy yeah right nobody knew </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> him for anything else but titanic but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like i feel like when he did this movie </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it like perfectly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> captured at that age what he was best at </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> doing was playing like the sexy young </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> guy yeah and he's so [ __ ] good in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this movie and i love it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> i could if you need to watch this movie </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> it's no no i do it's this is one of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> those movies that i've heard people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> talking about for years now yeah and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i've just never found and it's based on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> a true story i like the guy the guy the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> biopic and the guy is the guy who is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> actually based on has done like google </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> talks now and about how he i think he's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> done work he said he did like work for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the fbi afterwards </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i think he was in this movie or at least </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> he was a producer yeah because like i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> have i've purposely like not looked into </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this film because i feel like i just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> want to go into a blind yeah just watch </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it they got it's such a good story and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> although obviously it's dramatized it is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> based on a real event and it's so good </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> because like if i was to actually do a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> three by three with like my top favorite </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> movies of all time there would </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> definitely also be a tom hanks movie in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there oh dude my castaway would be like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> i i had only seen castaway recently and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it it was one of the few movies </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i only saw it recently right um but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was one of the few movies where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> despite how much hype had gone into it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i thought it was as good yeah it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> lived up to everything it's i thought it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> was an amazing [ __ ] film amazing if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can is more of a leonardo dicaprio </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> film than a tom hanks film i feel like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's half and half </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to me it's two big names yeah it's two </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> very big names and i feel like yeah it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it is leonardo dicaprio he he does do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really well in it and i feel like it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just him and tom hanks it's it's both of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> them in that film where with castaways </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> tom hanks and uh what's the other </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] massive tom tom hanks film that </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_00> know them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you can if you haven't seen it uh </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_05> anniversary this year yeah damn already </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah [ __ ] i just love this movie i can </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> want like as a from a young age to now </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like [ __ ] gene wilder is like such a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> goddamn good actor holy [ __ ] this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> movie's good i mean it's it's also [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> his granddad bro [ __ ] his granddad </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean it's a classic movie for a reason </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> right i mean um i've already mentioned </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the truman show as well which is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my favorite jim carrey movie as well why </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> are there so many </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like what are so many comedy actors like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that are just like actual just really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] good actors understand emotions </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> well to be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> like funny i think but jim carr is such </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> a [ __ ] good actor when he decides to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> act sorry i feel sorry for that man he </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> seems like he has a lot of problems yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah but i feel like comedy actors </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> normally do have that problem i really i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really want to re-watch the truman show </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> now because i want to because the whole </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the entire premise of the truman show is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that it's just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is it a twist can i spoil it i think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone knows what it is okay well you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't want the twisters you should know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what the twist is yeah so it follows the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> story of this guy whose entire life has </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just been broadcasted it's just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just his life is a reality they've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> made a world around this man yeah to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> make a tv show this was a black mirror </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> episode before black mirror was a thing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> basically yeah yeah this is basically </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just irl twitch before irl twitch was a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> thing and now it is a thing but like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> except that in the movie he doesn't want </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to be filmed yeah but i will twitch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> people like yeah let's do it okay so so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you you remember ludwig uh ludwig's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> subathon just imagine that from like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> birth but he didn't know yeah but he did </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um but that's the truman show and it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> just a [ __ ] amazing great movie i'd </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> love to see the truman show except where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> truman is just a horrible person because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> truman is this is a nice guy yeah what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> if truman did things that got him </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> canceled all the time you know would </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> people still watch the show with the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> raiders go down how would they fix the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> ratings if truman was going around just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> gets canceled yeah just getting canceled </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> they're like [ __ ] we gotta we gotta </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> interfere we're gonna we gotta really </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> um and then we joked about no country </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for old man yeah i [ __ ] love this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> film it's a great film it's just one of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> those films that's like yes i'm a movie </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> critic wow i think it's based on my list </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you could say that about me but i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> do think that no country forward man was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> the first film where i was like wait you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> can just like make things this ambiguous </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> i mean like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> it's also not easy as [ __ ] yeah i do </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like my very uh kind of open-ended </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> ambiguous films you know memento was one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> of them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know you don't really have a film </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> where you follow the main character </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> often that that acts behaves in this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> cold way yeah that you're also like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you're like come on tell me something </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah and they just don't tell you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> anything i just let you follow the other </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> film that's even remotely like that is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> maybe like american psycho maybe yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah but every single like you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> when you re-watch this movie so many </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> times and then you go and watch like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people watched it a lot yeah i've cause </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it used to be on channel four all the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] tv yeah i did didn't know so i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> used to watch it all the [ __ ] time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like 10 ad breaks in between yeah but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like you know you'd watch this movie and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> then you'd read about it yeah and you'd </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> be like oh that's what that was about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> and then you go back and go and watch it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah oh [ __ ] i was exactly the same with </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and i was debating when to put it on but </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> i was like no my three by three is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> already pretentious </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_05> directors i was like i don't want this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> to be more pretentious that's what i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> thinking as well there's so many things </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in no country for all men that i just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> love so much this day like the fact that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> he just decides sometimes to flip a coin </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> no i was i was to kill them yeah and he </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> went through with it like if it if he </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> genuinely went heads he wouldn't like it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> wouldn't kill them and it's like holy </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] this man is insane yeah like i i've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gone through this like recent phase of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> just like instead of watching movies </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> again i just rewatch clips from movies </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and for some reason like because i watch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> one another iconic clip gets recommended </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and like i remember just re-watching the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> gas station scene </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> holy [ __ ] what a good scene i think out </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> of like the entire history of movies in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> terms of like tension i can't think of a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> better scene than that i mean just such </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a good actor as well i can't remember </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the main man because he's done oh he did </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> he was the one of the villain in the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> bond movies yeah yeah yeah but he's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> terrifying yeah he's so good in this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> eyes man i know right yes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cold-blooded eyes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> every single </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> dialogue moment that he has with anyone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is just like oh my god it's [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> terrifying that's funny that's funny you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> say you go back and like watch movie </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> clips of like iconic movies because i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> have that exact thing with uh the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] court scene and there will be </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> blood </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_02> but i can't be [ __ ] again i've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> actually actually like there's there's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's been the phase now where because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i've been watching a lot of movie clips </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sometimes i just watch clips from movies </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i haven't seen yeah yeah and then i end </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> up just psychopath huh psychopath </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> no because like it gets recommended and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like it's a good clickbait title i'm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like damn that was a good scene and then </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i watched another clip and another clip </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and i feel like there's a lot of people </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> doing this now because i go to the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> comments section </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i go to the comment section and it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> just like i feel like it's the person </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's people who have gone through the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> exact same algorithm journey as me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because i remember going through the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> comment section and it's just i feel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like i've watched this entire movie now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> just through clips and i'm just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's just that's exactly what i did </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> those poor cinema directors yeah right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> pour their heart out to make a cohesive </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> story that's well paid and you </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_03> confused why this guy is asking this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> other guy to flip a coin it's still a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> great just it's still a great scene even </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> after the [ __ ] dialogue he asks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people is like the things he asks people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> are so creepy the thing that stands out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> to me in that film wasn't the dialogue </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but it's when he puts down the candy </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> wrapper yeah and it just like expands </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> for like a little bit too long and i've </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> never i've never been so tense hearing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just a candy wrapper expand i'm just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like what the [ __ ] man it's also the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> coolest weapon ever used in a movie yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> oh yeah oh [ __ ] gas canisters yeah so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] cool because you're like oh this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is badass but [ __ ] he's terrifying but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah yeah this is cool though really </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> scary i forgot tommy lee jones in that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> movie as well yeah he's the main um guy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> trying to get him right yeah yeah stuff </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> like the detective or police guy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> whatever the sheriff yeah the sheriff </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> that's right yeah so then of course last </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of all we've got uh ip man </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> one of the best if not the best martial </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> arts movie especially in the past yeah i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> can agree with that yeah there's a lot </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of i mean you know i'm sure a lot of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> people who are massive martial arts buff </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> would argue there's a lot of the earlier </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> films like some of the gently early </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> stuff some of jackie chan's earlier </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> stuff this happened to gently he just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> kind of disappeared she's kind of jetted </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so far as far as i know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> as far as the [ __ ] out so as far as i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know what happened with jet li is that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> after fearless which was the 2008 yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which which i thought was a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> amazing like he's supposed to be his </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> last that was supposed to be his last </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like epic right um martial arts film and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> uh it was kind of well received it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was it's like a very seven six out of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> ten film all right i thought it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really good i was it was actually like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think it's really underrated for a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gentleman i mean his his older stuff is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> just way better yeah i know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but in terms of modern stuff you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and that was supposed to be his last one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and then what ended up happening was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that the expendables were like money um </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so that was actually like that's right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so that was like that was like his last </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> action film and since then he kind of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> said that as far as i know he kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> quit doing uh big uh big martial arts </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> films yeah because i think it's just too </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> intense like it's a lot because you have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to remember those scenes like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> choreograph is that insane </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i just i just remember the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> expendables movie like yeah i was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> talk about the most like wanker-ish </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> movie it's like let's just get as many </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> big people yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> i actually watched it not too long ago </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> because you recommend yeah did you like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> it yeah it's really [ __ ] good i mean </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> i love gently it's got one of my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> favorite fight scenes there's any uh the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fighting the japanese and the karate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like ten of them and he's like back to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that scene i think it's like the best </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one of the best [ __ ] martial art </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> scenes of all time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> talking about clips you can rewatch on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> youtube rewatched that yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> okay to be fair all right yeah that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> fair enough you can watch kung fu fights </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> but like you can't watch that scene for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> no questions </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it's so good it's just like so the story </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> of it man is uh it's about when uh japan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is invading uh china um way back and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i think there's a there's a scene where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> uh but once they've invaded they're like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> oh well you know japanese karate or </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> something is the superior so bring your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> bring your chinese uh people to practice </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's literally what it is it's like if </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you win you get a bag of rice or </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> something yeah and he's like i'll take </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on ten of you and okay it's kind of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> cheesy but it is epic but it's so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] epic and they like snaps their </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> legs doing it it's insane i feel that i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> feel that that kind of cheesiness though </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in martial arts films is what makes a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> martial art yeah it totally is i feel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> like it set this that scene alone it set </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> the stakes perfectly where it's just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> like oh [ __ ] i'm ready to see him [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] up yeah and he just takes on ten </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> black belts </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that's not even like the end of the film </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> though it's like halfway through yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but unless it's but it's the best fight </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's the best fight of the franchise </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> right because i remember when uh because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the previous guy he fought like three </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> black belts and he's like [ __ ] i'll take </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on all of you and it's just it's just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> one of the few moments in film where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> you're just like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i'm ready for this man i i know this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> would never happen yeah i i don't care </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> how cheesy this is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> especially like when you're like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh would you so when i was like 16 when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i was watching all these movies i just i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> legitimately thought like martial arts </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like badass and i'm like dude this is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> epic but obviously now with all the you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> know the mma fighters that like fought </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> them and yeah now it's not so epic </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because you're like okay the mma </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> fighters should kill these guys but when </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> you're like 16 you think like oh [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> this is like the superior way of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> fighting yeah yeah like this is epic oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> my god like it's so cool you strengthen </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> your speed and now yeah it's so [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> cool right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but yeah no not so much </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but back then you're like oh my god this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is amazing yeah yeah there's a lot of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> martial like uh gently uh gently's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> earlier staff is amazing obviously </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> jackie chan's earlier cinema </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> cinemagraphy is amazing as well love </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> like drunken master and stuff like that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah such a good film </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um what are some really good what's that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i forgot what jetley's high street film </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> is called it's this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 1980s film it's really highly rated </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh is it fisted the dragon is it or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> enter the end of the dragon or something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> enter the dragons the bruce lee will oh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> no sorry it's the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> that's like his his like i think it has </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> like 100 percent of rotten tomatoes yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> i say fist of fury but i'm pretty sure </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> it's bruce lee that's pissed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with uh jetley is a really good one but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it depends if you like martial arts film </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> where they use like wires like some </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people don't like it when they do that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh it's kind of up to you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> right yeah yeah i kind of prefer it when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> they're just like beating the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> genre </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't i know it has a name it's like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> firework why why why </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's not really martial arts but it is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> martial arts yeah it's really good 2006. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> i really liked hiro which had uh donnie </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yen in it as well </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah anjali the story's so [ __ ] cool </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah i i think that story i feel like i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> haven't really sat down and watched like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot of jet li films his stuff is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> actually like really [ __ ] good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because daddy and donald uh hasn't have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> oh another one i think it's called uh it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> might be called war or like warrior or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> something it's like uh it's about like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> the three kingdoms or something in china </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> way back oh yeah like sangokshi warrior </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah what is it called i think it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> called warrior might be called what just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> warrior </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's such a good fight </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah jetta is the main character and uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like this uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about how like a general uh got like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't want to spoil it but you should </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> watch it it's really fun </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> really really [ __ ] good and i feel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like um because i i didn't want to put </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> another martial arts film on uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my three by three but i feel like one of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the few things southeast asians can be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> proud about are our [ __ ] martial arts </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> films because you know like the raid </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah pretty pretty much the only thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of thai culture that's ever been like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> popularized outside you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um but yeah like i like i was you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really happy to see like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the wrong light is this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> martial art films you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> you think of like you know it man it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> more like very clean the raid's really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] good raids </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> indonesian right yeah it's indonesia but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> directed by a welsh guy oh really it's a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wash guy who directs oh [ __ ] right yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it's that the raid one or raid two i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> think because i know you've donated raid </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> to raid </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who directed right one and two can you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> check real quick i swear that's another </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> thing i've heard of that i've never seen </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> the raid </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the raid one is like such a good premise </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah just get to the top of an </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> apartment building yeah that's it it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's it's basically just a fighting game </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's basically just like double dragon </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah it's just double dragon just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> like the fighting's like the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> choreography is insane yeah gareth evans </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the most welsh name on it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> literally two welsh names got off the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> name </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fair enough it's like it's so bizarre </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's a welsh guy directing an </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> indonesian film oh yeah i do but it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> just like awesome like it's such a good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fight some cross-cultural pollination </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> look at us ty and while she here too </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but yeah i mean i yeah i [ __ ] love </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fighting uh martial arts movies yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> i've watched nearly all of gently's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> films i think i've watched most of them </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i couldn't watch some of the older ones </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because they were impossible to find </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> online right um and i've watched i think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> all of donnie yen's films pre-ap man </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> i haven't watched it man four i heard it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> was okay i've really liked it band four </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i actually it's my second favorite </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe i'll watch it tonight because uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because i feel like ip man four is just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> three was the worst yeah i feel like if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> man four was just it man two done better </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah because my problem with it man two </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> is that the villain is just so comical </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that i just couldn't take him seriously </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> let's characterize this character so the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> whole selling point to like a western </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> audience of uh ipman was just that it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the guy who trained bruce lee yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's literally the selling point of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that yeah fair enough but he's supposed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to be like a master or something yeah i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> don't know i i mean that is a cool like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> catch to be i mean that's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> again i don't know how how true it is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> but it's an interesting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> made-up story maybe if it is i don't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> know if it's real or not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's true it's a real character but the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> events are fictional yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that's normally how it goes yeah with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> martial arts people it's kind of hard to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> survive some of the [ __ ] yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but i mean like i'm sure they fought all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> those people but they probably died </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> halfway through yeah i mean i don't i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> don't think you did fight 10 black belts </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no no that's uh that's yeah probably uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> probably dramatized unless he's like a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] super saiyan but yeah there's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> another donnie yen film that's actually </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> really good where he's like a detective </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in a small town </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> uh i think in a village </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and it's really good because it's like a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> mystery of the martial arts and it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just yeah it's pretty good i've got what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's called again i've watched these </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> movies so long ago yeah it came after it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> man same with jackie chan as well some </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> of his best works are when he was young </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like [ __ ] police story </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> story is fantastic is that the scene </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> where he jumps on the wire yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah it is completely real what's it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> called what do you think about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> flashpoint might be flashpoint yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> i think it's flashpoint what's the po is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> it yellow the poster the yellow one is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> oh uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> oh wait uh we have the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> chinese name it's the one where he's a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> teacher right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe again i might have remembered it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> incorrectly because it's been so much </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> big brother i have to go back to the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thing and watch it i might be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> misremembering i feel like one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> underrated donnie yen film is i think is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> spx or something like that what's he </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what's the plot i i honestly i do not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> remember but i the only reason sps just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sounds like a law firm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> let me let me because what happened was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> that all right you're jack you're bruce </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> lee then you heard jackie chan and then </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> when jackie chan was getting older jet </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> li was making films yeah and then when </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> jetley was getting all that donnie yen </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> came in but i don't really know who it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is now who's like the main martial arts </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> guy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who is the main like face of martial </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> arts i don't even know him </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but he's supposed to retire yeah i think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he still is done again because he's in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the the new marvel film yeah but they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> also don't really utilize him much i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> mean he's the i mean he's the villain </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> isn't it i feel like i feel just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> martial films of kind of just like a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> little bit of a dying breed almost in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like especially in the west i feel like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> i'm sure like you know if you go to asia </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> and south east asia they're still making </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> well i mean the past well the past like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 20 years have all been from china like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right it manages from uh china right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah um and then donnie yen is in rogue </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one uh from star wars but again when i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was watching that movie and you could </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> see what donnie yen does yeah i'm kind </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of disappointed because you're like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> donnie ann is such a was so [ __ ] good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they barely use him he just swings a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] thing around yeah oh cool he's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> blind </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah a lot of people could have done </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what donaian did in that film and i feel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like why if you're getting donnie yen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and he did he doesn't really speak much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the film right because he i don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> think he can speak much english yeah so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> all i'm saying is there hasn't been a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> rush hour or two yet there hasn't been a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> modern rush hour with johnny yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> honestly [ __ ] yeah and i i i i ice cube </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> stupid </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [Music] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> movie industry we just gave you a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> million dollar idea donny in an ice cube </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> in rush hour </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> seven or whatever the next one is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> oh my god i was thinking about what's sp </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> spl what that's the plot of that movie </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> can you tell me the plot spl well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [Music] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah but i um there's one fight scene in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> spl in sbl which is like completely just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> improvised yeah okay is it in the street </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah it's in the street </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's such a [ __ ] good fight scene </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you and then because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the whole premise around this the whole </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> background around this fight scene is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that they train together these two these </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> two actors uh donnie yen and i'm not </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sure what the other person is but they </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> train together and because they were so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> familiar with each other's fighting </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> style they literally just improvised </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this fight scene with just so cool with </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just this basic okay here's what's meant </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> to happen but let's just try to kill </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> each other and then let's just get it on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> film </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah that's so cool it's such a good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> film as well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it prepares a police detective who's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> suffering from cancer and about to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> retire resorts to illegal means in order </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to capture ruthless tribes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> all i remember was there was a police </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> detective in it i'm just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's that's like it's it's either like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> traditional like historical setting or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they're a police officer </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> of course like a neo-noir crime drama </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> um but i mean yeah like oh god how do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you like describe this three by three </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like how did you describe any how </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> did you describe any three by three </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> you could describe mine pretentious film </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> creature yeah pretentious pretentious </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> full </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> oh love guilty pleasure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> something with wood with p </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah p </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> y p because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> uh pretentious potential powerful </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh poop pouring yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> um but yeah i guess those are our three </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> by threes i hope you uh get to watch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> some interesting movies if you haven't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> seen some of these uh yeah please go and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> watch all the movies i have some movie </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> recommendations that i will be watching </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i guess now yeah i've honestly come out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> with this with some movie </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> recommendations and this was actually </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> obviously i i always always got time we </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> know what we're doing after this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> remember </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sit down </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but no i mean like i it feels good to be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> able to talk about movies because i feel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like i don't get to talk about movies a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> lot even though like i've i kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> realized whenever i talk about movies </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i've seen a lot of movies and i feel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like you guys have seen a lot of movies </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as well and we even like off camera we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't really talk about movies in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> general i think i think it just has to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> do with the fact that we haven't really </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> had time to just sit down and watch </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> something i've not watched movies in a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> while yeah it's gotten i feel like i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't know i feel like people don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> watch as many movies anymore yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like if it's not on netflix then i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> probably haven't seen it but i'd say i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> watched like 90 of the films i've seen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in like between the ages of like um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> 18 and 14. yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i think that's usually like the period </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in your life i'm gonna watch a lot of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> movies when i discovered you could </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> google the movies and i was like holy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah i mean my dad used to collect like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> a shitload of dvds when like blockbuster </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> was still a thing so like i just watched </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> a lot of the movies with my dad yeah i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mean i i watch a lot less movies than i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> than i did before as well because now </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's just all been replaced by anime </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> right and uh a lot of anime movies </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> and youtube as well yeah but if you're </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> on youtube but i feel like if there's a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> big enough movie then i probably have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> seen it like i'm surprised no one put </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> any marvel movies here uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who's [ __ ] cares about marvel i mean i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> care about marvel i i'm just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> marvel's that one franchise where i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> just like hello i'm a normal yeah it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fun but it's not like i never like i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> never like [ __ ] dude that made me think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> something that made me like yeah if i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> gonna watch it if i'm gonna watch this i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> know i was like really [ __ ] invested </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> in infinity war end game i'll say that i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> didn't i didn't even watch those two </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> end game was good but again it wasn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like i thought it was amazing but it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wasn't like sent that maybe like when i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> left the cinema </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a week later i don't think about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> endgame well so i'm surprised no one put </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> john wick as well because i i thought i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was close </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> someone was going to put john wick on </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> john was just another one of those like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's fun turn your brains out no no no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> no no it's it's [ __ ] no oh no i'm not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> saying it's a bad movie yeah john rick </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> is probably like my favorite action </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> series it's it's like in in the west </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> they have uh john wick and in the east </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they have it man that's that's like </SPEAKER_06>
