<SPEAKER_03> too perfect in my impression I'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> disturbed </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> welcome to this episode of trash taste </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and today we're gonna be comparing our </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> musical tastes our trash taste in music </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> well good taste who knows maybe one of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> us says good taste in music I've said no </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> one watching this unfortunately we can't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> plead the fifth in trash taste episodes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> which I would love to do because I don't </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> really know how to describe music very </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> well okay I will establish that very </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> early on yeah see we've established that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> with Connor but uh I also have been </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] myself with the thought of this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> episode and especially when it came to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like picking my choices one it was super </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> difficult because I didn't know like I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> didn't know how to describe why I liked </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like the pics that I picked I just know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that they were important to me at a time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> in mind you gotta see why we like it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] I'm [ __ ] I'm [ __ ] well I guess </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like on what basis did you pick it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because it's like I guess gone was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> saying that like it was an important </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like important artist in your life right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah mine is also kind of based on that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but in a sense yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> okay actually first question how did you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> boys what what uh what what method did </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you use to like pick your artist I don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know I don't know songs sound good I put </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> down yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> do I remember the artist's name I'll put </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> it down yeah yeah because because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> actually like my biggest difficulty </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right is that I like a lot of songs but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know if I like a lot of artists </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know like I like like I like certain </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> songs from certain artists but like I I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> feel like I'm more like I get into </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> genres of music or like I get into like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a certain genre then more than I get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> into this one specific artist or this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one specific band and if I do it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> very very very rare I think I think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's like pretty normal it's like food </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> you know it's like I like french food I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> don't like all French food yeah so it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> like that's the way I see it but I do </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like all Mexican food it's pretty </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] good yeah so I guess we'll see </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that's kind of how I view it for me it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> was like for me it was like I'll you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> know I couldn't just like reach into The </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Nether and grab of a band because I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> trolled if I did I if I did that I'm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> sure there'd be like a million other </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> bands that I just completely forgot </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> about so I was like all right I'll split </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it into genres so I was like all right I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> like metal music </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] that didn't make it any easier I'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> like I'm like SpongeBob riding the my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> first my first four picks I'm like so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> confident like oh this one oh that one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay oh this one okay wait what else do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I listen to yes yeah I I literally went </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay so uh you know we had our first </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> four or five picks that was you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> easy came to our head and then like I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> went to my Spotify to try and see if I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> could narrow down anything else that I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> could like talk about or was important </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to me and the more I scrolled the more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just like what the [ __ ] is my music </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> taste what what is actually this like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> collection of songs that I've put </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> together that defines who I am I like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like I try to psychoanalyze this and I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like I don't know what the [ __ ] what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> this [ __ ] that's what I love about doing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> these three by three episodes is that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> more so than our audience trying to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> figure out what our tastes are we find </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> out what our own tastes are like sure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what do you want to change some of my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> picks but we'll go with it we'll go with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it well some of my picks were like I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> chose one band but it was more of just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like I wanted to pick one band just to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just just to talk about to talk about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> several bands that I wanted to put in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> this spot get those excuses out now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> going yeah yeah set them up set them up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> from that one time that I saved he loved </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> this song I I also loved it yeah I don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know I guess I guess it's been it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> now that I think about it I have like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> such a different relationship to music </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> than I do to like other forms of media </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know like I have like really games </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I could talk about forever about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like why I really [ __ ] like this game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> same thing with movies same thing with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> anime obviously but but like with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> music's always been this one Enigma for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> me because music's just been this one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thing where I like certain things I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't know why I like it I just like it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> it's because most people when they </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> listen to music yeah I just like it no </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> explanation </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I think it's just because like most </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> people when they listen to music don't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> think that deeply about what they're </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> listening to like there wasn't a guy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> that like runs into the room and it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like explain what you're listening to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> right now </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the drugs are good yeah yeah when </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> someone's like what's your tasting music </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you can just like be like ah metal you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> know yeah yeah and then it was like okay </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> that's it right yeah like when people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> ask me what my taste in music is I'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just like oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> [Music] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yes I like salt I like everything like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like I like songs I hate I hate being </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> that guy who just goes I like about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> everything </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just like the generic answer but I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> really literally don't know how to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> answer that question aside from you I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like a bit of everything should I should </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we stop giving excuses to ourselves this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> is this is it oh we're gonna do trash </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> box again bringing back trash per </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> tradition yes all right so I guess I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> don't want Joey to go first I don't want </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> to go first either because I don't want </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't want to follow Joe </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> my goal for this uh episode is to not be </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> that pretentious music now we need you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to be that protective I don't want to be </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> that prediction because because you need </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to like counter right so me and Connor </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_05> about silly pop in general okay okay I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> don't know I don't think I know the rest </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> uh this is uh parcels </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> awesome yeah so they're kind of not well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> known but it's very similar Vibes to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Daft Punk plus this is a breakbot over </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there you know breakbot you don't know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know breakbot yeah I know their song </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_03> song oh that's that's breakbot that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> break box okay the rest of their songs </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are amazing okay I've listened to some </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> of their music I like their songs </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] slap yeah I don't know if I know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> them you know that you you've definitely </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> heard them no you know the meme song </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> probably </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> oh okay yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> now have you ever listened to that song </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> without it being bass boosted I don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really know that song okay so I mean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> there's not much the band I listen to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the most it's definitely like these five </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> are the ones I listen to right now yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right I love the weekend yeah so you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> also dropped the new album and I I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] love that album that's a great </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> album I guess who do I want to talk </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> about first who should I talk about who </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> do you got me um that's I guess you've </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> talked about who's the parcels yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> let's talk about Parcels because I don't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> think so they're a band right now I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> believe okay okay this is going to be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hard to talk about because I don't know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a lot about a lot of these people all I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> know is that I play their music an awful </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> lot okay I think they're a band that is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> based in Germany I don't think they are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> German okay they live in Germany and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they do kind of like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> it's very like Funk but also oh how do I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> describe music to people I only know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> peeps because like the guy the guy in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that can I can literally see Connor's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> like brain cells committing suicide as </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> he's like trying to process because I'm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> not gonna lie like I looked at this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> picture of parcels and the guy at the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> back in the middle looks like George </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Harrison yeah he's weird right yeah they </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> look like beetles if they were around </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> today I don't know how to explain it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> it's like they don't I don't know uh </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Apostles are an Australian electoral pop </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> oh they're awesome Aussies oh okay okay </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> a lot of the things you can see like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> influence of like if you look Daft Punk </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in the middle and you kind of like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> little parts of death punk they've </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> experimented in yeah that's probably </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what I like because it's like I think my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> favorite uh Daft Punk album is like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> discovery which I've put there yeah but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> I don't think there's many songs in that </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> point I don't like right even the first </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> album is probably the one I don't like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> the most because it's very like more </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> experimental as opposed to the other </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> stuff they did yeah it's almost like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> rudimentary for sure and a lot of some </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of the songs in the first album I cannot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> remember the name of the first album the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one with the am on the front of it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> literally I think it might just be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> called yeah I mean I feel like I only </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> started listening to Daft Punk after </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like was it the homework album yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> homework was the first one where I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> properly got into Daft Punk as well and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think that's why most people got into </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Darth Park like yeah the homework or </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Discovery Well I think it was like was I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> think the first big hit was around the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> world wasn't it yeah yeah that was that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> was like what put them on the map which </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> is the most repetitive song in existence </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> because a lot of these are artists that </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> I find that I have no idea who they are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah it's like YouTube recommends me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah you know who I'm surprised is not </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> on your 3x3 joji Josie I don't listen to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> joji that much every time I go to your </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> house you're playing joji that is true </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> that is true I've played a lot of I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> think I had phases of joji like I like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> joji a lot you know like I like joji a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> lot but that just sounds like a man face </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I love joji's music but there's only </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> like four songs that I actually listen </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to the rest of the album I don't really </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like I think at least for the first five </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> I've listened to like everything from </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Tame Impala weekend Daft Punk breakbot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah uh Parcels I've listened to like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> everything and like so the parcels deaf </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> pumpkin brake ball I can just put on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> their albums yeah yeah any any song and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll have a good time and I'm like this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is great like if I'm in a car those are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the three I'm playing so this is all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like recent tastes then or as within the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> past five years unfortunately my my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> tastes haven't really changed much in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the past six years it's kind of like I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have phases where I go into something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> else but it always comes back to that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> type of music what did you listen to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when you were a kid yeah this is a good </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> question well right in the bottom uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> bottom right is Biffy clutter Jeffy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Clara no idea no idea I don't know but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that album cover is cool right yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> is a Scottish Rock Band yeah okay um and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> uh they've done they've done </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> usually </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> supported for Foo Fighters a few times </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> oh okay so like if you like Foo Fighters </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah and you want a more Scottish </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> version of Foo Fighters I might be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> butchering and doing an absolute </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> disservice to Biffy Clara but I like Foo </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Fighters a lot and the way I found them </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> is that a lot of my friends in school </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> really liked Foo Fighters and were when </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> we were growing up let's see some stuff </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> they like and then I got into Biffy </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> Clara from that and I went to watch them </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> live that was the first concert I ever </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> went to a beefy Clara concert yeah it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> was amazing I loved it so much and uh I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> don't know I would say uh this is a good </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> album to listen to they had the really </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> famous one that came out before this I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can't remember the name of it it's got </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> like two big colors on the front of it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> got the name of it today's do they </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> singing like a Scottish accent as well </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah so that's what I love about them </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> you know how sometimes a lot of bands </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> where they're like from Scotland but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they just sound American somehow yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah but it's like actually like that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> looking for is only Revolution that's it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> only Evolution first album was homework </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah homework was homework oh [ __ ] I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> thought am came forward so it was that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> first album </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> no no no no Random Access it's probably </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like an EP or something yeah it might </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> have been yeah yeah oh my bad then yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's that's what that's what I want </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> more bands to do though because like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> one thing I like seeing in the accent of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the country that they're from you should </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah I think you'd quite like because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that's what I love about life that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> what I love about like Proclaimers right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> because like when they've seen the 500 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Mile song they couldn't sound any more </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] Scottish than that song right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah I find it so weird when I like hear </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> an artist right and you hear you hear </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> them sing right and then you hear them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> speak and there is like such a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> dissonance between how they sing and how </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> they speak I remember one of the first </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> time I heard Adele speak right and it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> like the most northern accent </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> you're British because like she doesn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sound like anything like that when she </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> sings you know it's only for good reason </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> could you imagine an Adele song in the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> accent that she speaks in like like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's no way she would have blown up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> because no one would have been able to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> understand through the rain </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the Deep </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> because like because like I had I had no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> idea she was uh she was British until </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> until I heard her speak and she was and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> then I was like oh this is the most </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> northern person I've ever heard speak in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> my life and I feel a lot of Australian </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> artists are like that too like Sia for </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> example is like the most Australian </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> sandwich </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but when she sings everyone thinks </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> damn we like lose our accents for </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> Summers I don't know why yeah like we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> can't like I I find it hard to I guess </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> do an accent but it's not hard for some </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> reason it's less hard to sing an accent </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know it's yeah it's weird right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's I find it easier to sing in an </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> American accent than I do speak in an </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> American accent I don't understand at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> all how it works I know how accents were </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know how it works when you sing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> though it's a different register I think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's that's why when I hear an accent </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in a song I it immediately like just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sticks out to me I guess because you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> always hear like the neutral American </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> accent with like a lot of songs so when </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you hear an accent that is just anything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's not like the stereotypical </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> neutral American accent it immediately </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just sticks out my mind so yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah that's what that's what I want more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> artists to do though because like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> otherwise like everyone's just going to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> sound the [ __ ] same right and it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like if if there's the best way to make </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you as an artist Stand Out is to just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> sound different like just just sing in a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> different accent because then </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> immediately you'll be like you'll listen </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to a Biffy Clara song you'll be like oh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they sound Scottish must be a beefy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> clarison yeah I mean they're very very </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Scottish when you hear them right it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> fun could you imagine if Biffy Clyro </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like obviously I don't know if tomorrow </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right but you said they kind of sound </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> similar to Foo Fighters oh well I'd say </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> it's kind of in the same vein it's uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> like kind of feeling of the way they say </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so would you say that if perchance the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> beefy Clara lead singer </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like Dave Grohl then it would sound like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Foo Fighters or no no I don't know it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> weird because the songs are so Scottish </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> if you listen to them you'll I think you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> might like them they kind of seem like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> your kind of band actually do you like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you love Foo Fighters right yeah I love </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> food Fighters yeah I think you'll </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> probably like that I like Foo Fighters </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> as well then you'll probably like them </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> as well if you like Scottish kind of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> take on it again I I must be offending </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like big massive massive fans is the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> only way that I know because I don't </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> understand how to talk about music like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> a normal human being yeah so there's any </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> way I can imagine explaining it uh but </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> also it was like the only the first </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> album like I ever bought out of like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like physical I think I only ever bought </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> like three albums in my life right right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and I think this was the first one oh I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't think now I think about I don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> think I've ever bought an album I love </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> this so much I remember I loaded it onto </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> my PC oh no I put it on my Xbox yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah and you could play the albums on </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Xbox while playing another game I would </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> open up that [ __ ] menu the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> big one </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> the volume was just dreadfully like not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> managed correctly so I was playing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Modern Warfare 2 and just don't know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> what you're feeling like that it was </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_04> that's how my music is decided I'll have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the algorithm Gods decided if so yes and </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_02> if it's a disservice to call it weebie </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> music it's kind of like it is </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_02> nah no I do sometimes I just sometimes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> someone who doesn't even listen to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> lyrics I feel something missing without </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> vocal traffic </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> other picks that we can talk by the way </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> uh the other one I want to talk about I </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> love the weekend and this is a weird one </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because I for very long very very long </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> time just kind of felt indifferent </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> towards the weekend I felt like it was </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that artist that just always got like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> number ones but like yeah you know it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> kind of like whatever but then like the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> last album came out and I was like okay </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> no no this is all fire this is all like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> really [ __ ] good okay I think he's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> actually like insane and then I went </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> back and listened to the other stuff I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> appreciated it way more now yeah seeing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> how far he's grown and how much his </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> albums have like just improved yeah no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm deaf I was definitely I was like oh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> this is just like another generic pop </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> guy yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> exactly exactly and because like when I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> listen to House of balloons which is his </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> first album I was like oh this is like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's good but it's like nothing special </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then after hours came out with like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> blinding lights Like That album I was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like okay okay I see you I see it and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> then the new album was like all right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> solidified you're pretty good dude this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this album it's been like out for like I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't know like two months at this point </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I've literally just listened to that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> album non-stop I think it's so good I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> think the weekend actually is right now </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the most streamed artist on Spotify it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> wouldn't be number one right now like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this album has so many bangers that like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> it's it's so fun talking about this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> album to people because everyone I've </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> spoke to has a different favorite song </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah it's not like other albums where </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like okay Everyone likes uh X song </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the most and it's very predictable it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like everyone is just telling me other </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> songs they like the most I'm like oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah that one is a banger that's that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> the best kind of artist though right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> where it's like it's like you can't pick </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a top like I would think it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> really difficult for someone like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> weekend to make like a greatest hits </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> album yeah because it's like which songs </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> do we not put in that album right sure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's because every song is great also I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> love that like I wasn't paying attention </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to lyrics but then I started actually </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> paying attention to the lyrics of this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> current album I'm like [ __ ] man this is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really [ __ ] sad yeah what's going on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> with this man he's like yeah I've got to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> see woman and she's [ __ ] another man </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm so sad that she's [ __ ] another </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> man it's like what what he's like I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> loved her and then she stepped on my </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> heart and I'm like whoa while in the 80s </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like Funk basically placed in the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> background but it's so good though it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> so good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh my God it's like I want to marry a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> bush we're best friends </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> how often do you listen to like Muse uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> lyrics in never never literally so what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> made you listen to the lyrics in this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> song so many times after the point I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> started like just he would say stuff and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like hold up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> rewind that rewind that hold up what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what I'm like Jesus Christ </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> oh my God </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> his therapist you know we're just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> hearing yeah exactly and Bo Burnham you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> know Bo Burnham was one of those things </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where you kind of have to listen to the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> lyrics to enjoy the music and it really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> made me see that like okay because to me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> comedy music before was like just uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] Lonely Island yeah yeah like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> weird uh the younger thing but not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really yeah yeah I mean it's it was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> parody music yeah where they were kind </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> of for me it would like they would take </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a song or like an established like genre </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of music and just kind of like parody </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> um on like a surface level if that makes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> sense and Tim mentioned is obviously </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> very everyone always loved it yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but like even that the music I wasn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like super into but I don't know when I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what I said I've watched Bo Burnham </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> specials like uh all of them like at </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> least four plus times now and I just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> love it to death yeah and I really like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the songs they're really funny but also </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really good some of them are like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> absolute bangers yeah yeah um I love the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one at the end of uh make happy you've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> got the one where it is but it's when </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he's talking talking about burritos and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> put in the hand of the Pringle can I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> remember </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [Music] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's so good though because it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like it starts off as a joke and then it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> turns into this whole you know the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> struggle of being a Creator and what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people expect things from you how do you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> struggle with that you know and as uh as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> somebody who creates stuff it was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh [ __ ] whoa this is [ __ ] wow this is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> a weird yeah did you ever like get into </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Lonely Island though back in there I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> loved Lonely Island yeah I was when I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was like 14 I thought this [ __ ] was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Peak comedy and music I was like I was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like oh my God he threw it on the ground </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> oh my dude oh my God he put a dick in a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> box like what the [ __ ] this song he's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> talking about it yeah yeah damn man this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> one's about three sons </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> you know because I was a kid and I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> thought she was hilarious like yeah I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just had sex I thought that was like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> peak comedy for me it was like I'm on a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> bus and he just had T-Pain in there for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> no [ __ ] reason it was that and like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> boss yeah I like a boss those were like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> the most viewed [ __ ] videos on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> YouTube yeah yeah yeah and they were </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like I I literally I remember because I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> have this weird memory of me playing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Black Ops one and just playing Lonely </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Island songs on repeat while I'm playing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I literally did nothing but listen </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to the Lord I think everyone was like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that but to me it was like Bo Burnham is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like it kind of took the best of like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> comedy and then added it with like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> amazing funny uh stand up with amazing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> lyrics and great and I love the song </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like one minute long it's the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] Jeff Bezos song from inside I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] love that one you've got to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> listen to it because I've only seen </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> inside but like obviously it's one of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the few artists where I did listen to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the songs because he is like I guess I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> don't know how you'd categorize or put </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like how do you categorize these kind of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> songs but it's like it's like comedy </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> songs but it also like it he's his songs </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> also make you think yeah like the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> message kind of like sticks with you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's funny and deep </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> is it is it too deep for you I don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know but uh it's the Evangelion of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Comedy music </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> shut the [ __ ] up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm kidding I'm kidding yeah I know I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> want to put it on because I wanted to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> talk about it and I thought that it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really interesting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know there's a lot of artists I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> could have put on um like I could have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> put a I love pendulum uh I almost put </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> pendulum I went to watch pendulum live </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and it was probably like the greatest </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> subject experience ever I nearly died </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like four times being stamped on to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> death but I must must have been like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> audio crack man dude it was insane so I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> went to go and watch Penny time it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in like a warehouse like this concrete </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Warehouse yeah yeah and it was just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> some kind of like Satanic ritual and not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like because there was just this thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was so tall yeah yeah so you just see </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> this massive like hunk of concrete and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> then just depends on just going hard on </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah yeah yeah holy [ __ ] when I remember </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> when tarantula came on that was insane </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone went insane it was just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've never been in such a like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> intense atmosphere it was so funny I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't normally like going to concerts </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but that one was really fun because I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> knew the lyrics as well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> memory because listen I've heard that </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> many lyrics to pendulum songs I mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> every color uh it was very easy everyone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> remembers the opening to Witchcraft yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah that's the one song everyone would </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just start singing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've been I've been listening to the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> pendulum since I was like [ __ ] 12. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and I would listen to them they were </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> pretty inescapable back when yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> blood sugar yeah yeah I remember </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> nightmares as well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Prodigy what am I talking about yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah it was like pendulum and Prodigy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that's a [ __ ] massive yeah like they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> were inescapable at a point where like I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> remember like they came out as like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> in the age where I just started going </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> clubbing and like you'd hear a pendulum </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> song and a prodigy song at least once in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> every [ __ ] so good man that's so good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I I'd say like pendulum was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> definitely like my early inspiration </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> before I found like I started really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> getting into like Daft Punk right yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> obviously Interstellar uh is amazing and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> all the music videos just go so goddamn </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> well with the songs and not the movie </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> The Owl yeah not the soundtrack to the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> movie but it's amazing and then you got </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> uh Andy yeah so this is just like City </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> pop this is the I can't stop loneliness </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> song have you heard that one yeah I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] love that song I can't stop the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> loneliness </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> I love I love silly pop um obviously I </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> don't know how to encapsulate all of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> silly pop I could just put plastic love </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and call it paper you know I feel like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> City pop is definitely blown up in the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> past what four or five years it's gone </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> crazy even the weekend on his new album </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> samples a lot of City Pops oh yeah and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's so goddamn good it's like silly pop </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> with like the vocals of a god </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um it's just amazing it's so good and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah I mean I absolutely adore City pop </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> it makes me nostalgic for that time that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> I lived in Japan in the 80s and yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> straight out the window yeah definitely </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> and was in the bubble period it's a good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> time good time wasn't literally plastic </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> love that literally like kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> reinvigorated this city pop Trend that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like I think so because you want to hear </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> silly pop occasionally but I don't think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> anyone the movement hadn't really taken </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> off I think plastic love is what really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> got people into thinking about listening </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to other songs it's like because I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> definitely heard City pop songs before </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> this right but never enough to make me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> be like is this a genre yeah yeah I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> don't know what this is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> just like such a mystery as to why it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> was that song that bought like this I've </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> seen like documentaries on YouTube about </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> like why did plastic love blow up and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] and it's like because oh and I'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just like because it's a good song yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean like nothing more also like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> YouTube algorithm just works in [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> mysterious ways exactly yeah I mean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> there's two ways I get recommended songs </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's memes or YouTube algorithm yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> honestly memes is like a really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> underrated way to discover new music </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because a lot of memes is so good a lot </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> of meme songs are actually like good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> songs yeah you don't you forget that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they're good songs because you've just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> heard it bass boosted so many times </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe I'm yours is ironically like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> [ __ ] amazing song and it's so [ __ ] </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> stupid that I can't listen to the song </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> without thinking of ladies and gentlemen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we got it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> done it's awful ruined my life no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> because I remember when I heard first </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> heard that song again he got recommended </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to me on YouTube and I was just like oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's the meme song and I was away for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> like the bass boost to come in and then </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it just it like it was just the a song </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I remember thinking damn why did </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they bass boost this [ __ ] Masterpiece </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> man it's like taking the Mona Lisa and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> like [ __ ] spitting on it you know I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> honestly like crab dance song yeah it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> a good song and uh the Shooting Star </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> song remember that one oh that was a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> good song </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_03> well that's my uh initial trash tasting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> music thank God that up before we move </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on obviously uh obviously you talked </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about a lot of your music that you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> into now but like what I'm curious what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you listen to as a kid like do you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> remember or did you just not watch any </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of them like as early as you can </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> remember yeah Foo Fighters uh uh that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was a big one Buffy Clyro </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh pendulum Prodigy then I had that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> weird phase where I was like yeah Calvin </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Harris is really good I was actually </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like this close enough Calvin Harris </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but like I would be lying if I'd like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> didn't go through a phase where I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> listened to a [ __ ] ton of Calvin Harris </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm not immune to [ __ ] taste right there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was a point where I listened to a lot a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> lot of Calvin Harris did you listen a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> lot of David Guetta as well oh God yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I did you know you know when you listen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> to that uh Swedish House airplanes in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the night sky song yeah like how about I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> just want all music that sounds exactly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like this yeah like IPS you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when I have like no no [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> personality of my own I would just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> listen to what the charts told me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like this song I love that new Calvin </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Harris song you know I I felt like I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> almost like listen to that music just so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I could have I could keep up with all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> people who are talking to keep up with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> because I didn't want to get bullied for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> liking like [ __ ] Scottish bands that </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> no one talking about what's wrong with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> that well you know it was a lot of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> social pressure yeah like me listening </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to Calvin Harris was the equivalent of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> me watching football matches so like I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> could have something to talk about he's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like oh yeah you see her that's true </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah you see the latest football </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> match oh yeah the new captain have a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> song came out that was pretty good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> wasn't it but like I feel like I never </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really had a defined music taste because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I was kind of you know as well back then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I had to uh find a means to get a hold </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of it yeah and that often was a big </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> limiting factor in what I could discover </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I did the opposite I was like oh I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> listened to that recent Calvin Harris </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> song [ __ ] [ __ ] in it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> I've never had it well you have good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> taste music you have good taste as well </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> I didn't even like think that I was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I didn't even listen to it I'm just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> giving you a hard time </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> all right what should we get on with the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> next pick all right you want to pick it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> or should I you can go for a man a meal </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> gone it doesn't really matter </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it matters to me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I see a t oh it's me there you go you're </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> saved I guess okay thank you thank God </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Joey can carry the podcast </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I finished talking about it okay so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um so how I tried to pick this I tried </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> to pick this I tried to pick music and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> artists and songs that really defined </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> every stage of my life so this might be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a little bit random we're gonna see </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Peppa Pig the full album </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> music </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> spider so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's on it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> all right Ashley put it up Ashley put it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> up go on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I I this this [ __ ] will not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> leave my record yes yes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> okay okay so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um so I guess I'll go through it from </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> right from left to right sorry you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> all these I don't know the one I don't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> know this one you don't know that one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's that's the uh that's one of the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> two Japanese ones on their job I know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> three Japanese ones so uh top left is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Muse </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah yeah yeah we got music we've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> got muser and then we have bradio and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then we have the Kooks or is it no it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just Kooks right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> um we have the killers we have Michael </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Jackson MJ we have MJ come on uh we have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Zuta Mayo uh we have Daft Punk Arctic </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Monkeys and obviously the uh I don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> know why I thought that was Ben </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Stiller's not it's not like that bad </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I was like damn Ben still God all right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> all right so where do you want to start </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> off </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you like them that much okay so the okay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> so the reason I put the Kooks there </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right all Kooks like is that the Kooks </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> or is it just Cooks I'm obviously a bad </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fact is it okay that's that's what I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thought this is specifically inside in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the Inside Out the album because it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one of the few albums I actually have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> listened to all of the way </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um and the reason I put the goose in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there is because they are originally a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> band from Brighton right and you've got </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> to represent that home no no no exactly </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> but like I did not know this yeah I did </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not know this for the longest time right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but listening to their music and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> listening to this album especially </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> before I found out they were from </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Brighton I was just like [ __ ] this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> literally epitomizes the Brighton Vibe </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and like what it is like being a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> teenager growing up in Brighton right it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> literally like epitomizes the vibe of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like going to like this random [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> beach party or just going to a random </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> house party in England sometimes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know trying to pick up chicks or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> just you know just heavily been drinking </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> or whatever right right like if I had to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> pick a show for example a TV show that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> epitomized British Teenage life it is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the in-betweeners right if you've seen </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the in-betweeners I've not seen a more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> accurate representation of what it is to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> be like growing up uh growing up at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about like college age which college age </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is kind of like high school age yeah and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to me the Kooks is if you listen to this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> album it is growing up in Brighton </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> College age so about 16 to about 16 to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> 18 years old </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um and that's why it's on there uh I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> feel like I only know one song I think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> there are like two big songs on there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> there's like naive and like yeah so nice </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's really like perfect I'm just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> really like drawn out yeah like every </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> every word I think and I think it's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> she moves in her own way </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> [Laughter] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that one is like burned into my hair it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> is all the time in the UK that was that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was the song that like introduced me to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the Kooks but like I feel like those are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like the two most like naive and she </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> moves in her own way because like I like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the two most poppy songs in their album </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because definitely their later albums </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they got like what they like way go way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like way on the poppy side of things </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like they were kind of like kind of like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> uh Maroon 5 in that sense like you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you compare like early Maroon 5 albums </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> uh to like the latest Maroon 5 albums </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and it's just like okay this is night </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and day yeah this is night in there this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is like okay there was a point where I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> like Maroon 5 and then there's this like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Billboard 100 maroon 5. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you don't like sugar </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> no no sugar but I will stick up for like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not even Maroon 5 I I think Adam Maroon </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 5 was actually pretty damn good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um but yeah I mean like I don't really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know what else to say about the Kooks </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's that's why the Kooks is on there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you want to have a good band there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah it's it's a good man it's a good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Indie band okay so a lot of these uh so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a lot of these a lot of bands I wanted </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to put on were of course Indie bands </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> especially a lot of Indie bands from </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> England I guess because I did I did go </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> through I think the the period of life </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in my life where I went where I listened </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to the most music is probably in like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> between high school and University where </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I listen to a lot of [ __ ] Indie bands </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> um and a lot of that was because I was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> actually in a band myself I don't I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> don't know if were you yeah I don't know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> if I've ever talked about this no you've </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> never we've never talked about it I've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> never mentioned </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> you've mentioned that you used to play </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> guitar like a little bit this feels like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> something you should mention more yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> this feels like a personality trait I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> feel betrayed that you haven't mentioned </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this yeah I mean um I guess like okay so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I guess I gotta get into this story then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay let's okay let's let's let's start </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> right in the beginning next you're gonna </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> say that you were a member of the Kooks </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's a platinum selling artist yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah so I guess the reason I wanted to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> learn how to play a guitar in the first </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> place is my first choice on that it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Muse </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> um I remember the first time hearing </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> plug-in baby and just hearing that riff </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and like just don't like something just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> clicked in my mind and I was just like I </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> need to be able to play this </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I need to be able to play This and like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I remember before like my um my mom had </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> always tried to get me to learn guitar </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because she's just like you know people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> play guitar I look cool you know my mom </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thinks it's cool and I'm just like she </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> she set me for like guitar lessons as a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kid and I never really took them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> seriously right I was just like I'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> doing this because my mom wants me to do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it right I I can play [ __ ] Oasis </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Wonderwall whatever the [ __ ] you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> which I would argue is the only song you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> need to know yeah the only song you need </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> to know okay I was just like whatever </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I only we only owned a acoustic </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> guitar at the time yeah and then I went </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> I remember I went into Secondary School </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> which is like just I guess just before </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> high school age in in the UK or is it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> high school age I don't know Secondary </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> School yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um and I remember the first time hearing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> plug-in baby and I was just like why did </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they never teach us how to play this in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] guitar lessons what the [ __ ] I I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know how to play a barcode uh a bar </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> chord sorry yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> um I'd like like what do I need to do to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> learn how to play this and so the first </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thing I did was I uh did your acoustic </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah I ditched my acoustic I signed up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for guitar lessons uh in my in my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> secondary school and I was like mother I </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> would like an electric guitar </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> did she get you on huh did she get you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> one uh she I remember we we got like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a [ __ ] cheap ass electric guitar </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that was like Basics no not even Amazon </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Basics I got one lap that was like on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like a car boot sale or something like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that which which was what which was a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> trick yeah yeah that did a trick so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> um so I can't remember what my first </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> guitar was it was it was it was a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> guitar it was one where I had to like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> replace all of the [ __ ] strings on </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the guitar because all of the strings </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> were like rusted already uh didn't like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> at that point I didn't even know how to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like properly tune or uh or like change </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the strings of a guitar so like my </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> teacher at the time had to uh teach me </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> how to do it but uh yeah I mean um </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> that's when I that's like that's when I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> first properly got into learning how to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> play the guitar </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um and uh and at that point as the point </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where I was building up my skill level </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to uh you know be able to play plug-in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> baby which eventually I did yeah and uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then actually now that I think about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it once I learn how to play plug-in baby </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I that my drive to like improve my skill </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> level just kind of just stopped so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> average people I I I I'm like never need </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> to play it again you know when I like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know when you've reached the goal </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you set for yourself and I just never </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> found a next goal to set for myself so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like for me it was just like play guitar </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to play plug-in baby I can do it now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> mother and I can stop playing the guitar </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> now dispose of this I always wanted to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> play Guitar Hero more than one of the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> play guitar yeah so uh yeah and then and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then so then in that time uh one of my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> friends he he wanted to start a band and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like you know why not I've got </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> nothing better to do at this time you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know I'm uh I can play the guitar I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> might as well use it for some first day </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> lessons do you know plugging me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> um and so yeah I mean I joined because I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> wasn't doing really doing anything with </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the guitar aside from trying to learn </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> how to play plug plug-in baby so I'm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just like man maybe I'll just join the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> guitar maybe I'll just join a band for </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> fun yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> um and I mean I don't think we were the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> greatest band but yeah did you ever play </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah we played like a bunch of gigs </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> actually I got like what yeah yeah I've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like I think the biggest crowd we played </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> in from in was kind of like 500 to a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> thousand people what what okay okay what </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> oh my God how have you never told the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> story Okay so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay so I remember when we were trying </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> to think of a band name I I think we </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> have like a [ __ ] stupid Bad Name </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they're always stupid okay our band name </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we we like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we like try to like brainstorm a bunch </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> of [ __ ] band names and like nothing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just seemed to click because nothing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everything sounded either like too metal </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or you know too campy or whatever uh and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then we just went on we just went with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the name nine and a half pounds </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because uh because the month before my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mate uh one of the lead singer went on a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> diet and he lost nine and a half pounds </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and that was like we we were just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know what we don't know what we're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> gonna call our bands let's just use this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as just the name until we think of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> actual name yeah the band and then that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> just and then that was just like that's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> amazing as with a lot of names you know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> uh you you just sticks right you pick a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> filler name and you just like can't be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> asked to change it now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so you would just like play any song </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what kind of songs did you play um so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm used that just means no I mean uh we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> write our own songs </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um so we'd go uh so my mate had uh we uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> we went to the drummer's house because </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> uh my the our drum you always gather at </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> the drama you always gather at the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> drama's house because you can bring your </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] guitar you can bring your you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> know you can bring your you can bring </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> your bass or whatever to someone's house </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can't you can't transport a drum kit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah you know what I mean so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um at first we went to the drama's house </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to practice and then and write songs and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> eventually we had like this really like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> this really like [ __ ] old music </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> studio that that a friend of a friend of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> a friends yeah Dad owned you know you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> know that kind of new kind of thing and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> you walk in it's like a back alley and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the [ __ ] door hinges like like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> broken in like 10 million times or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> something and you're like I might get </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> stabbed here but they have a drum kit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> and a recording studio yeah so whatever </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> let's just it's amazing and I remember </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> the biggest uh the biggest gig we played </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> was like we signed up to what was the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> equivalent of like a battle of the bands </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> you had an anime Arc yeah so so okay so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like this is just this is just back no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no part of the reason why I got so into </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Beck and why beg was one of my like my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> favorite you say this when you're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> talking about Ben yeah I think I did </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> mention it I must have mentioned I would </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> remember if you were like yeah by the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> way I was in a battle of the bands and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> performance I think I would remember the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> name nine and a half pounds okay okay so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> we were just a band for fun we weren't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> taking this seriously </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um but like we we met we met like a lot </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of bands who were like [ __ ] amazing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that came out of our school because like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I guess part of the other reason why we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> formed the band was because we are I the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> school I went to was a performing art </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> school so a lot of people there were </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> doing were doing Performing Arts whether </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was theater or music or something so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there were like some people in my school </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in like my classmates who were taking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like music really really seriously right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we were just like whatever I'm learning </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to so I I'll just play I'll just play in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the band because whatever that seems </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a cool way to spend my time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um and so I remember for this battle of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the bands we literally had to like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> audition to get into this battle of mans </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right and it was like it was a pretty </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> big deal at the time because this gig </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was pretty famous for like a lot of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> students and there was like there was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sometimes there would even be people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from music labels who would attend like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> events like this yeah so we weren't like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we weren't expecting anything to come </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> out of this we were just like you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what they're holding auditions at our </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> school and we could sign up so we're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just like what have we got to lose we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> didn't really we we didn't really expect </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> anything because we didn't really think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that we were that good of bands right uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so we obviously we obviously auditioned </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> um and it was literally like the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> X Factor kind of thing kind of deal </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right because the big Golden Buzzer in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> the middle yeah yeah because literally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we uh because because our school was a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> performing art so we had like a theater </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> set up right and the theater we had like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a drum kit in the middle and we had </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there were judges on there oh wow and we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> had to uh we had to play two songs right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I read to play two songs in front of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> judges and I remember God plays plugin </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> baby yeah and the Crowd Goes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> outside </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone gets up on that okay yeah and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then uh I remember we were like we were </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> hearing some of our [ __ ] some of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> other bands that were playing before us </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah and we were just like [ __ ] my life </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we have to follow these guys </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> follow these guys what the [ __ ] yeah and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so and so I remember thinking we're not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> going to get on because there were a lot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of other bands that were [ __ ] better </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> than us I'm gonna say that yeah but so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we went on uh we just we just played our </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> songs you know the the judges you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wave us off whatever we didn't expect </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> much and so we didn't get into the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Battle of the Bands we actually became </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a backup choice just in case just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just in case </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh and so we went on with our lives and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then we get a call like a week before </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the event </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they were just like uh so one of the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one of the bands has dropped out and we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> got an extra space in this battle of the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bands concerts </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um do you wanna do you want to come on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and we're like what the [ __ ] this this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is literally Carol on Tuesday like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> that's exactly what happened in Carolina </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and so we were just like I mean yes but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how the [ __ ] can we prepare in a week </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah for this battle of the bands which </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is which is like other bands have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> prepared for for like a good month or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> two yeah you know like like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> playing with a band is [ __ ] more much </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> more difficult than you imagined it if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you've never played in the band before </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> uh because you're in a live setting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right and a lot of things can go wrong </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you need to be on the same </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wavelength as your other band members </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we've had I've played plenty of gigs and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> some gigs are better than others </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sometimes you make mistakes and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sometimes you know you you're not in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sync with the rest of the band and you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> need you know you need to be tight you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> need like the performance needs to be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> tight so you need a lot of practice so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> uh we said yes but we didn't really we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> didn't really have time to practice the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> songs that we wanted to practice </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um but there was like well there was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like one joke song that we had practiced </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh we had practice before because we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> didn't really have any gigs coming up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it was I just had sex while no no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's it was an indie rock version of Hit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Me Baby One More Time by Britney Spears </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> awesome it was it was it was Hit Me Baby </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> One More Time by Britney Spears oh yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and and we were just like well we don't </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> really have time to practice some of our </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> more complicated song so let's just put </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that in the set whatever whatever right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um and I remember we had the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> conversation before of um we always </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> wanted the experience of like having the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> audience you know I having the audience </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> sing part of the song yeah like like a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> lot of bands together yeah of course and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> uh and I remember we were having this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> discussion of you know the perfect point </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> of this song would be uh what's what's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the line </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um how does it take me baby one time go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> again </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I think he's thinking about the chorus </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> right yeah yeah uh Me Baby One More Time </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> no no here it is is when the the line </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> goes my loneliness is killing me yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> and uh yeah and we're all saying that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> would be an awesome point for like the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> audience like chime in but like we were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> just to do the end to do the and die </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> because that would be that would be like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> an awesome feeling yeah of course but we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> were just like no we're not gonna do it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because like what's more embarrassing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> than like stuff because then stopping a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> song letting the audience sing and and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no one sings like we did not have the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] ball stuff right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> um and so I remember </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I remember we we go to the battle of the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> bands and it's like the biggest audience </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so far normally we're used to performing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> for like 50 to 100 people so this was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like which is which is still </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> up but like this was like about 500 </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> people it was that like Punk was it was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that like Concord 2 which uh if you know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> in uh if if you know brights and Congo </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> too it's actually one like one of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> biggest venues that's not like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Brighton that's like that's not the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bright the main Brighton venue it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a lot of big Indie bands go there that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cool </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um and so uh we go on stage and we're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just like guys we're not going to take </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> them seriously a lot of these bands are </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] amazing we're just gonna have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fun we're just so anime we're just we're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just going to have fun right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um and I remember so we go on stage we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> play the set and this is this is me like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> playing on pure adrenaline so we're so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we're not practiced at all we're not as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> tight as we want to be in terms of our </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> performance but I seeing like for some </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> reason just like playing in front of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like the biggest crowd kind of like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hyped us up and I can't really explain </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the feeling but it just like something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that day just clicked you know you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know some days where you're just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like in the zone like that day for some </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> reason all of us were just in the zone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we were like our Peak Performance right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah and then I I remember we uh we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> decided because because we're gonna meme </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it up we decided we were going to end it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on hit me uh on Hit Me Baby One More </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Time yeah uh the rest of it was just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> going to be our original songs and we're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> going to end it on that because we're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just like we don't care whatever yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the audience is probably not gonna like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it because it's [ __ ] Britney Spears </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but we're just gonna have fun with it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um and then I remember when we start </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> playing the song </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> somehow the audience just like erupts </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right the audience because like this is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not the type of audience that would </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> listen to [ __ ] Britney Spears yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah they're here for like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Arctic Monkeys they're here for [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> block party you know like the Clarkson's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or some [ __ ] like that and and I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> remember playing this song right and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> obviously we had agreed that we weren't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> going to stop the music with the and die </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah right but you saw we saw the energy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> in the crowd right we had no choice and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and we were like it was it was such a it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was one of the most surreal moments in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> my life right where we had this we had </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this performance where we were just all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like in this we were in flow you know we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> were just in in like we were like Kuroko </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Basket in the zone and I remember I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> remember the moment was coming up right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I looked over I looked over to the drama </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's so out of it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> because I remember I was just I was like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I want to do this but we have we we </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> agreed that we wouldn't and I remember I </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> remember thinking I want to do this and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember looking at the drummer and he </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> had like the same look as I did I looked </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> over the basis and the bass is just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> oh my God and then and then and he </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> nodded at me and then uh and then I I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> looked over to the singer and in the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> corner he sees me on the corner of my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> eye uh at the corner of his eye and I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then he nods back and I'm just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay it's going to happen and so and so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he goes my loneliness is killing me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> silence </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and uh and like the [ __ ] entire like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Concert Hall just like [ __ ] they </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> complete the line and it's just like I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> can't explain that [ __ ] feeling it it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> is it's better than sex it is like it is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> like the biggest orgasm I've had in my </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> life like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> poor Sydney </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because because it was I I don't know it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was it was kind of like a Disney moment </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for me because like somehow everything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just [ __ ] came together and then we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just we continued the song and it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the best like the best reaction that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we've ever got from a crowd </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um so the battle of the bands was done </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> by votes and There Were Ten bands there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we came in third oh [ __ ] did you get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> anything any fries we didn't get any </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> fries but that one we didn't get the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> biggest orgasm of his life yeah that was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that was the peak of my of music career </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that was that was the peak of my music </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> career it all went down I mean that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> pretty ridiculous considering this what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> how many [ __ ] hundreds of bands that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> have probably never experienced that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> true and that from that downward he uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> relinquished the name Grant and became </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gaunt </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> Ed right to use the name </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah I can't use the name anymore yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> that's great how the [ __ ] have you never </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> brought this I've never brought this up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't I just I swear I've said I've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> been in a band before and no one's ever </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just everyone's been in the band before </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> oh yeah I've been in a band for like 10 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> seconds until I realized it's a horrible </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> idea </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah I don't know that I mean yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's why I really liked back because I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> looked at back and I'm just like [ __ ] I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> get that that's my life so you were like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> actually good at guitar </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like competent at Guitar I mean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you played in front of people that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> pretty good yeah I mean I played in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> front of people but I mean that's right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> my mind work that's pretty good so we're </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> starting a band called Ten and a half </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> pounds soon </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> guys like unlocked memories in me like I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> heard the [ __ ] Zelda thing when you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> were like I I remember I tried to learn </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> guitar well I've tried but I think my </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> parents nudged me towards it right I </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> just remember being in in someone's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> house playing guitar trying to do </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Twinkle Twinkle Little Star right and I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> just was like no I don't get this and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> then he was like he gave me this device </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> that was a tuner but I didn't know what </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> it did be like you got to do it until it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> goes green the light yeah I was like why </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it all sounds the same it all sounds </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> very similar it's just one beep to one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> another and my parents bought this tuna </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for me and I'm just even at that time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and I was like Hey I was like oh my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> parents just wasted their money I'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> never gonna get good at this </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> so I'd never never learn guitar and then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> I remember I went to learn drums which </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> seemed pretty fitting for me because I'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know you just need a sense of Rhythm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> which is great I have a great hand-eye </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> coordination unfortunately no rhythm so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> that that was the Crux of that one and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that was over with and I never really </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> learned drums I went for like a year and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> I never really learned anything really </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> they're trying to meet they try to teach </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> me how to read the sheet music oh that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> where I was like no yeah I don't want to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> do this it's like jazz drumming methods </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah I I think I I stopped learning </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at the point when sheet music started to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> become like a thing of my lessons I'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> just like I don't like this anymore </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it used to be fun when we were just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> talking about beeps and boobs now you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> brought reading into this yeah that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where I draw the line yeah because like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I like like I think we said this last </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> time where I go by I go by feeling like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and that's what I went when I wrote like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> protagonist because I don't understand a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> single thing about [ __ ] music theory </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you know I know which chords sound nice </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> in my head and sometimes I have like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> nice like like beat or rhythm in my head </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm just like let's try to play this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> out of guitar I I do not know what [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you literally you even K on like 100 </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_01> right I didn't have any confidence in it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> but the first song I'm not even kidding </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the first song that we had to learn is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the only one I ever bothered learning </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah yeah we never did anything this </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_03> I remember like why did you do it I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> don't know I have like very Vivid </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> memories of me actually seriously trying </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to learn how to sing yeah [ __ ] </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> All-Star before it was a meme right </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> right when this came when this became a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> huge meme I was like this is like I had </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like Nam flashbacks like just like oh my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> God oh my God this is the sound </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> every time we go to karaoke of course </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> All-Star comes up yeah like at least </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> four or five times throughout the night </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and every time it's just kind of singing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like a dumb voice I want you to actually </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> like be </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> seriously if I seriously try and sing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah I feel vulnerable </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> thank you very much now that you've said </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> that you have to do that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was my first book oh my God it's been </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like four hours yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um so I mean like news is one of the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> only bands I've also seen live radio </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> they had such amazing hair yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Michael Michael Jackson is running for </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> his money on his [ __ ] afro like this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is like the early days of Brady as </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> well bradio like his afro like like now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> is like [ __ ] massive [ __ ] it's huge </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> so yeah I mean I've also seen Brady </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> alive as well I mean like the reason I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> put bradio up there is because uh I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> discovered bradio with Sydney during </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a really tough and time time in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like our lives when like I was living in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> London working for the BBC and like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> every every day was like every day was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like depressing [ __ ] of course you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> especially with like the computer I had </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but for some reason for some reason no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> matter how down my day was I put on a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bradio song and and I am instantly happy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like for just like that five minutes or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> three minutes whatever I could just feel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> glad and happy for a second is it bad I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> can't remember which songs they've done </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> which anime they did Desperado they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> liked it that's still like they thought </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it was down yeah I didn't want to say </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because I didn't want to look an [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> put your hands up but that song does go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> hard yeah I mean like it was so hard it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> was it was not only that song but I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> remember what really saw me on bradio </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> course it was a banger everyone heard </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the death parade for opening and they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> knew it was a banger but it was actually </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> their music video right because if if </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> four Dudes having fun with the green </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> screen and it's just it's like got such </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this it's got such a charm to it right </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_00> have like I have a funny story or not a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> funny story because like I remember when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I saw them live uh it was in Thailand </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right and like I I went to Thailand no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's that's the thing right that's so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was when I was living in Thailand </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right and it was so [ __ ] random </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I'd gone my entire life being a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> massive Muse fan living in England you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know and just never getting the chance </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to [ __ ] see them at all because they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they never performed uh when I was in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> England and so like the first time in my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> life that I actually got to see them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> perform was it in Bangkok Thailand like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> what what the [ __ ] right so I remember </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> like I remember thinking this is this is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> this real this is so surreal that I'm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> going to be able to see Muse in Thailand </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah out of all the places in the world </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> I could see Muse so I remember going to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this concert where um dragging Sydney </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> along because because of course even </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> though she wasn't as big of a muse fan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as I was I needed someone to go with me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah and so I remember like this was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the highlight of my month because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like [ __ ] me man I get I get to see </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Muse I get to [ __ ] see Muse and I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> remember I remember going to go to the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> concert and I remember going to um </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> go to the stage and just like eagerly </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> excited for them to come on and I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> remember the first band that came on was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a band called The ruse the ruse okay </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> okay so that's that's r-u-s-e right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right so I forgot that they needed a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> supporting band yeah right of course </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like it's so my first thought was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> have we just gone to the wrong [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> concert was was it is this a Muse </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> concert </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like like what is this like the Thai </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> knockoff of the Muse what's going on and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> then there's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and I'm like okay maybe they're just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> gonna play one song and then they play </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the second song I'm like okay maybe </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe they're gonna play two songs and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then Muse is gonna come on they play </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> five songs </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm off to the fourth song I'm just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have I made a terrible mistake and we've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> just come and we've just come to come to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> Bangkok Thailand to see the ruse </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> did they end up coming on but they did </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> okay </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but like like I was just like I just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> remember thinking uh I at first I was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like you know maybe it's a sporting band </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and then like four songs later I really </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> hope I didn't just spend all this money </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> to see a [ __ ] knockoff News man Your </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> Juice by the rules they do that on </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> purpose they have the ruse supporting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> the Muse </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> they must have chosen them on purpose </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right there's no there's no [ __ ] way </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah you could be a supporting honest </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> Ginger name yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> no reason why just do it yeah don't copy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> my homework too hard </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I would be bricking it if I got there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they're like welcome the ruse might </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> check the chicken right now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> literally like because like I literally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when I literally had to go outside just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to check that uh the main poster said </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Muse like I was coming in to see Muse </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> before I go outside and it's like yes it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is Muse go back in still the ruse I was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like maybe they made a mistake out front </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on the maybe they got the letters wrong </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean I've seen enough knockoff things </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in Southeast Asia to be like maybe they </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> just pretended to be Muse this entire </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> time the Thai version </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um but yeah I saw them live and they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> were absolutely absolutely incredible I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm shocked you put the killers on here </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> do you like more than the one song Do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you like more than Mr Brightside yes yes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I I I like Ruby Ruby Ruby Chiefs oh yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah That's how little I know about the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> killers yeah oh this sounds so simple </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah to be honest I only know Mr </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Brightside do they have any other songs </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah they have Mr Brightside uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> apparently their latest album's really </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> good </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> last year I think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> [Applause] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um because I think like The Killers was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> my university life right my University </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah I I was actually like already into </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the killers before like Mr Brightside </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> came to like take over the UK scene you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> were fans before they were popular well </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> kind of but like they also really just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> exploded onto the UK scene uh with </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> somebody told me </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> um that was like that was like the first </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> song that really exploded like I was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> already into indie rock at the time and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for the longest time I thought they were </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a British rock band everyone does yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah yeah because they're like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Mormon Americans though yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah so like for the longest time I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thought that they were a British rock </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> band the same way as like Arctic Monkeys </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> were </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um and you know and a lot of other </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> British Indie bands yeah because they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> came out in that time but uh yeah they I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> didn't know they were from America but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uh they were like the one Indie band </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that I listened to still throughout </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> University because the reason I stopped </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> listening listening to a lot of Indie </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> music is because my band broke up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because we all went to University right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um but I mean I listened to the killers </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know which album is which songs </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I know I listened to a lot of see </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm I'm drawing a [ __ ] blank right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> now yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um I just know I've listened to a lot of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> killers uh and the reason it's on here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is not only because I listen to them a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> lot uh in University but it's also the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> first band that uh me and City bonded </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> over oh so so okay so uh uh so Sydney </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> likes to quote a lot of songs to like a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> lot of people that she hung out with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right and apparently she told me that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the only time someone had completed a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> song lyric that she had quoted instead </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of just being like Cindy what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you talking about was uh when she quoted </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The Killers to me via text and she was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> she just randomly said ah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> somebody told me no somebody told me I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> got soul and I'd reply back </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> oh man </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] she was like oh my God you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> the one God's like what the absolute </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> irony [ __ ] me on this side this is this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is I'm drawing a [ __ ] black right now </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not a soldier is that the line is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that this is like this is like me trying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to Remember lyrics right because I'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just like I'm just like I'm not a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> soldier or something like that this is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> okay okay like I said I don't listen to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> lyrics like I just I just know I just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> managed to quote back that on yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's that's the one line he managed to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> call about yeah that's that's the one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> line I managed to quote back and uh and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> she was like well you're a Killer's fan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you're the one you are the one you you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> are the first person took a very big </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> gamble replying with that you're gonna </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> look like a [ __ ] idiot yeah like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> what's wrong with God he said he's not a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> soldier or something bizarre yeah but uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah so The Killers holds a very you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know a very very deep place in my heart </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not not only because I listen to The </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Killers and I am reminded of you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> University life but also because it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> part of the reason that I met and bonded </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with my partner that I'm with now so and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I also saw them live in Bangkok Thailand </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> as well it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> so weird </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> this is the construction supporting act </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> the fillers we saw the Drillers uh yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean I remember like the first I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> remember seeing them live and the first </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> song that they played was Mr Brightside </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and obviously Mr Brightside even started </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> strong is the song that everyone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone knows right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um and I remember it was such a surreal </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> experience just hearing a song that I'd </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> listened to so much in my childhood </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right and I it was almost like it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all it was almost like a weird out of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> out of [ __ ] body experience right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where I I had had this song that would </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that meant so much to me when at one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> point in my life and I saw them now at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the age of like 25 26 or something like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that like way later </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um and it just like a wave of just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was so surreal because at what it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like a wave of like memories and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Nostalgia but also like me living in the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> moment like it's it's so weird to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> describe because just hearing them live </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and hearing like it was like my life had </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like built up to this one moment you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know I I don't know because yeah because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because I'd never seen a band that I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> loved so much as a kid </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um later in life until that one moment </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so it was just it was just such an </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> incredible moment for me I will never </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> forget hearing Mr Brightside For the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> First Time Life </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um and then we have uh Michael Jackson </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> okay so I mean I also like vanilla so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay so the reason that Michael Jackson </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is on there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um is because so as a kid I went through </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a phase where I was you spoke about this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> right yeah I think you have really I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> feel like I've this is weirdly familiar </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> God talking about on the podcast yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah so I don't know if I have talked </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> about it on the podcast but as a kid I </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> went through this massive phase where I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was obsessed with Michael Jackson like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like I I was I was awake I don't know if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've said it in private to you guys or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> on the podcast but like yeah I went </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> through a phase when I was like just an </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> obsessive Michael Jackson kid like uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I think everyone's going through their </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> faces now the target audience yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> [Music] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> or that phase but you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> regardless of what his image was you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> know or what happens later in life there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> were you know his music [ __ ] slaps </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and of course it's like yes it's vanilla </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but it's it's a classic for a reason I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] love the song uh pretty young </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> thing but it's so hard it's so hard to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> listen to that song </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> because of the lyrical content you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah you know how when like they're like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> separate the art from the artist I do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> but sometimes it's really [ __ ] hard </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> too yeah that that song definitely </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> didn't mean that's one of those songs </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm like why why this song is so good </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> but why do they have to be ruined I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> literally cannot listen to that song </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> without being like it's just great oh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah oh and then you remember what it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> was about oh oh MJ I feel like but like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> so many songs are amazing yeah yeah MJ's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> just one of those like artists that I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> feel you could be at any party or like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> any convention like with with any amount </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> of people that can have completely </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> different personalities on everything </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the moment a Michael Jackson song comes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> on everyone is unanimously like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah it sounds amazing yeah I mean like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I I think we talked about this before </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but like I don't think we'll ever see </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> someone that had the reach or was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> as famous as Michael Jackson was by </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> standing yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> he's not going to Michael Jackson was </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because my dad actually introduced me to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Michael Jackson I remember he bought </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> like a VHS of like the top 25 hits of I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> think it was like holy [ __ ] anniversary </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I wish I had like a deep story of every </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> single pick I don't know this is the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> reason I had the pigs because I was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know how to talk about the music </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just going to talk about something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like Slumdog Millionaires yeah every </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> single answer has like a goddamn 10 part </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> back like flashback this is insane yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so like so like it's it's one of the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> weirdest experiences where like you go </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to like the countryside and [ __ ] [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bum Thailand or something like they they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't they like they've never </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> experienced internet there they barely </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> have electricity there you know you go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to the [ __ ] Chinese side and like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> even going in the middle of nowhere </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> somehow there will be this one farmer </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who will have this like old beaten up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> cassette tape of like Michael Jackson </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Thrills yeah and and like they wouldn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> they will not know a single word of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> English right and they're like oh you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you grew up in England you're not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Michael Jackson you know you know you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> might </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how has Michael Jackson have how does </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Michael Jackson have this reach oh he's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the king of Pop right yeah yeah yeah so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> so like it's like it's still like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> thinking about it it still blows my mind </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just how famous one person is I think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Thriller even to this day is the most </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> sold album ever I think so yeah like I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have any idea yeah which is like stupid </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it sounds right it's like it's like by </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> stupid I mean like the difference </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> between Thriller and everything else is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> like stupid like it's insane yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> because like you know you could go to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the bomb [ __ ] middle of nowhere in Japan </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah and there'll be some like decrepit </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> 70 year old 80 year old lady you know </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_06> someone one person got this famous to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like so many cultures and so many </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> countries that obviously had nothing to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> do with the us or just like even listen </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to that kind of music in the first place </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and uh and and I mean yeah I mean </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Thriller is like I know putting like </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_05> of it's one of the most legendary albums </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and he's one of the most legendary </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> artists for a reason yeah and uh </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_03> could moonwalk at one point at one point </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> too yeah could you actually yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> genuinely generally yeah did you figure </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> out by yourself or no no I watch YouTube </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_06> only until like years later when YouTube </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> existed and YouTube videos existed then </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I realized that's this is not I this is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> not how you do the moon boy I was doing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it wrong with this walking backwards </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah walking backwards the entire time </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_06> no I tried to do like the you know the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> leg like pop thing that he does oh yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> oh I tried to do that I tried to do that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm almost dislocated my knees I was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like how so Jerry became a pensioner I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> was like oh is that why he shouts ow </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> because it just [ __ ] hurts all right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah and uh this Japanese artist yeah so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] me hold on just frothing over my </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Michael Jackson Just slurping off so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you can add that to the uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> compilation of gank tries to drink like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a human being </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> so I guess uh this this is with demaio </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but uh this is more of like where I put </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> her in just because I feel like she's a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> genre of music that I have just recently </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> gotten into yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um and as with everything in my life </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> somehow everything always comes back to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uh domestic girlfriend oh for [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was born at this moment </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as it always does right so how I so I'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> not sure what this genre of music is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> because it's not really just J-pop it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like it's more of like okay so how </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I would describe it you know do you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> do you guys know what utaities are yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of course yeah so your Titans are like I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> believe uh singers or musicians who </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> mostly originated from nikonico starting </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> who started off doing a lot of like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Hatsune Miku songs and stuff like covers </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah stuff like that so a lot of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot of these musicians Who Came From </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The Scene ended up just like I guess </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> graduating and just made you know start </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> started making their own songs with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> their own original artists </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um and there's this I I don't know what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the genre is but there's a lot of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> artists in this genre that I got </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> introduced to by the domestic girlfriend </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> opening because if okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a friend is a very divisive show I know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I know that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um the opening [ __ ] slap yeah the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> opening is amazing the opening is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] amazing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I I'm not gonna even be able to attempt </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> to say it's hard it's not it's not even </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> a catchy song it is just a banger </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah yeah and uh so I that's how I </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> discovered that artist Minami </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> um and you know Spotify recommendations </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> usually recommendations so I I I got </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> really really into Minami and her songs </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> from the domestic girlfriend opening and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that kind of introduced me to this world </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of artists like Zuta Mayo Eve </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um who else is [ __ ] uh yoroshika I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> think yeah yeah yeah yeah so how I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> describe them is like they they are </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> anime music that don't have an anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that they play to you know what I mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah again like I've listened to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this I don't didn't know their name yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but like if you go to my YouTube you can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> see that I've listened to this person a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> lot yeah it's just like that genre of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> like I'm making the anime in my head </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah yeah so like like a lot of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> these artists that I listen to now have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> now been picked up for like anime </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> openings right yes so I remember like I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> got into I got into Zita Maya and then I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> got into Eve </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um and then I remember listening to the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Jujutsu Christ Alone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> opening when that came out and I for the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> first time in my life I'm just like oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my God I know this band because I've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> never heard this song before but like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they have such a distinct style that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've had that I had that moment where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just like I've been following them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> since they were underground [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> absolutely I read the Manga yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> I know this song yeah it is the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> equivalent of the I've read this when </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the manga wasn't big right because you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know because there are so many artists </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in this field that have now been picked </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> up for an anime opening or ending and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and like there is this there's this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> feeling of like yes you have music slaps </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm [ __ ] proud of you I'm validated </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> for being a fan I was like that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like before they became the psycho </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> parcel opening the Tokyo Ghoul opening I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> was like I knew them before us oh really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> also I'm a little sad because now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone knows Eve as oh it's the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> jujuices </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's so much more than that listen to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the rest of their [ __ ] songs </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um so yeah I mean like this is I guess </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that's the kind of music I listen to the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> most now that's like really that's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> my weeb kind of it's really big in Japan </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right now especially </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they're like yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I didn't know you're a big Daft Punk fan </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um I was a big Daft Punk fan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um during like the discovery album </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> actually and like I'm think I'm thinking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> back and a lot of my favorite songs or a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> lot of my favorite music have visuals to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> accompany them like do you guys do you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> guys okay when you guys listen to a song </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> do you guys like do you guys imagine </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like a music video in your head or </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> anything like that sometimes yeah it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> depends on the song for me yeah yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> okay that's like what I'm doing yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like for me like if if I can't I can't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> connect to a song unless I can imagine </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> some kind of story or some kind of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> visuals to accompany that song and I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> feel like I have such a random song I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have such a random music taste because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to me like I don't really listen to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> lyrics but if a song emotes an emotion </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or a visual image in my head then that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when I get really emotionally connected </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to a song right and to me that how I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> discovered Daft Punk was I discovered it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> through Interstellar 5555 right which </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was a [ __ ] amazing movie and it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> also one of it's also one of the albums </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I have listened to all the way through </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> based purely from that movie yeah and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from then on from watching that movie </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and seeing the story that they crafted </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> from that movie every Daft Punk song I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> listen to I have such cool visuals in my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> head that that's why I became like such </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> a massive Daft Punk fan how did that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> even happen that anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> uh was it literally just the guy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> listened to it and was like holy [ __ ] I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> gotta make it I gotta make an anime to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> go with this I think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> exactly but I think matsumotodeiji was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a fan of Daft Punk yeah and then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they just like worked something out and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> then because it's it's so good I guess I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> would like to know I would like to know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like uh what kind of what kind of like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] what do I have to do to get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Matsumoto deji to make a music yeah how </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> did that connection happen you know I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> don't know because this was before Anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> was even close to Big you know this is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> this was like underground as [ __ ] so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah do you have a do you have a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> favorite song from the album </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mine always changes quite often from </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's still hard uh from Daft Punk it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> probably harder better faster stronger </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> that's good um yeah that's good I mean </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> for me for me it's like I know it's the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> vanilla Pig but like one more time will </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> always be one more time's amazing one </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> more time one more time will Digital </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Love Digital Love is [ __ ] incredible </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um and like I think the reason I picked </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> harder better faster stronger was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> because I remember when I first started </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> getting to amvs and everyone everyone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> tried to make Linkin Park amvs I did </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> nothing but just make the phone KMPS </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that was that was me man that was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if the person the rest of YouTube went </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> through the rest of [ __ ] YouTube went </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> through a Linkin Park phase I was here </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> just like it was like the entire </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Discovery Channel in anime form aside </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from like not even the movie but just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> like in Naruto clips and then when you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> heard the the Kanye West remix yeah you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> know just like oh my God I think that's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> that I heard that before I heard the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> original Daft Punk well I discovered </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Kanye through that song huh I was like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what who's that song who's this guy </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> rapping over a Daft Punk song and then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's so good like At first I hated that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> song because I'm just like why would you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ruin holiday </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> [Music] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> he's gonna get big </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> this guy's gonna do stuff yeah I think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> he's gonna be quite normal and Arctic </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Monkeys obviously British State </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> obviously I mean I again I mean I've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> already talked about my Indie phase I've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kind of just it wasn't just arced </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> monkeys it was like everyone born around </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> our generation-ish British loves article </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> okay because if I would have to say if I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> would have to say what my what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> influences I took when uh when I was in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> my band right it was bands like Arctic </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Monkeys uh The klaxons Strokes uh who </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> else was like big at the time razor </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> lights </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> um also like Red Hot Chili Peppers and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Foo Fighters as well just like just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> any any in Australia around that time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> White Stripes was massive oh White </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Stripes as well yes I love the White </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Stripes so yeah I mean that that that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> slot is just there for just for just mid </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 2000s </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then I got the pillows well I I put </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> the pillows there because I did go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> through a phase where there was a lot of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> anime music on my playlist dude we've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all been there come on yeah and I I feel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> like it was the anime man at one point </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah yeah yeah yeah and good old times </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but like back then I didn't like I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> didn't look up the bands behind the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> anime music it was it was just Anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> music you know what I mean my Apple </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thing was TV size bracket </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> a lot of one minute 30 songs yeah and I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> remember fuliculi was like the first </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> entire OST that I've like I took I took </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this entire OST because every song in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the fulicury OST because it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> basically just the pillows album right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah it was just an album of the pillows </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was the first time where I took an </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> entire anime OST and put it on my MP3 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> player which wasn't even an iPod uh it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was like this like an actual like MP3 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah yeah this it was it was like a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> knockoff cheap ass like Chinese MP3 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> player that I can't even remember the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> brands uh because it doesn't exist yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it probably doesn't exist anymore uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> because I couldn't afford a proper iPod </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or proper like branded MP3 player I I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> had one that was like kind of like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> shaped like a like a long pill it was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like a blue pill yes and then you could </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> put like an orc sport on it it was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> a tiny tiny screen and the name of the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> song would like scroll across yeah good </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> times yeah kids will never understand </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> and and I mean like the pillow is kind </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of it is again kind of just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Japanese but also has had like I was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> this close to putting the pillows on </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> mine but I didn't yeah and and like I I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> again like the reason I really loved uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that soundtrack is because flcl is kind </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> of just like an AMV but yeah just just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just in just six episodes six season </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Goods </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> it's good but nowhere near us it's not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as good as I've never watched it has it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> has its moments you've got to watch the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> first one what's it like to me like 90 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> of why I love furikuli so much was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because of the pillows oh yeah um and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> the visuals were kind of it was kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like watching Interstellar 5555 again </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> well so if you like the music you'll </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like the anime oh yeah what if you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> not into the music and you're like oh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's going to be hard to not be into the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> music yeah yeah I mean it kind of It </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kind of sets the tone yeah of the entire </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> show that makes sense there's a reason </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> why it's like one of the most like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> famous anime yeah people never shut up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> about fully cooly yeah why it's so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> amazing yeah but like it's it's it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like it's it's like moments like this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> where I was afraid whenever people were </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> just like yo well let's pass your score </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> let's see what your music taste is and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just like [ __ ] man what how am I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> going to explain yeah like TV size </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> narrow to opening like what is that what </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> is that yeah but at least it was like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> you know like hard you know custom Trail </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> like J-Rock right like I was listening </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> to like Lucky Star opening people I was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like that's even harder to explain it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> like yeah past the Orcs I'm like I don't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> think you want the Orcs man like I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> definitely Listen to Too Much Hannah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Montana at one point </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> more than I care to admit yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know she's not obsessed with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Hannah Montana that's good when I was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> like 13 I was like obsessed with Hannah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Montana I don't know why so much so that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> one of the first books I ever read was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Miley Cyrus's autobiography are you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> serious I'm not kidding I'm not kidding </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I wish that was a joke I wish that's no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> strings for a hardcore Miley Cyrus fan </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for some reason I was obsessed with the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Disney Channel when I was like 12 or 13. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that makes sense I think I was sold on </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the dream that you can do whatever you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> wanted to do yeah yeah I realized that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> no it's not how it works and they still </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> have Miley turned out right uh yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know why I just liked it and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> also I like the music for some reason I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> think weird it's weird how when you're </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 12 and 13 you just [ __ ] idiot I was I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> was more obsessed with Hilary Duff </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah like more than I don't know isn't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it weird how you just have those phases </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah Miley didn't really click for me </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Hillary I was like yeah I can get behind </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know why I feel like everyone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> has that one thing that they've they've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like they've shoved down in their </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> subconsciously depression they're like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I'd never like this if you say if you </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> yeah I was obsessed with that he loves </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> all of those that era band oh yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> really well I mean I could have put like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> nine just 70s hard rock bands as well if </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> I wanted to because I I love a lot of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> their music but a lot at the same time I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have no idea what any of the Bands look </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> like like you know that's what they look </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like they all look like like Black </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Sabbath I know what Ozzy Osbourne looks </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like now yeah I don't know what he </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> looked like he can't he looks so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> different back then yeah Ozzy Osborne </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> actually look like a human yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's 80 year old Japanese </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> is uh aged strangely yeah when I saw him </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> live it was uh it was weird Aussie is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like you know those those time lapses of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like this chicken nugget has been in the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> closet for 70 years and hasn't aged but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it has and it that's how I feel I don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know why is that a fat comparison </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> that's how I feel it's like it shouldn't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> be alive but it looks worryingly well it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah it's like Aussie now kind of looks </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like if someone took Ozzy Osbourne </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> deflated him and then re-inflated him </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> again he's the one who's done like it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> looks like someone took Ozzy Osbourne </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and just like he left him in water for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> too long </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah like isn't he done like an inord </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like an insane amount of drugs or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> something oh yeah I mean I mean the most </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> he should have died ages ago normally </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> but uh he's some I mean that's why he </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> can barely talk now it's like when I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> went to go see Black Sabbath live it was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> like the the like you know the the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> original lineup I'm actually still </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> performing yeah I mean this was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> maybe five six years ago and it was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> labeled their last tour all right so I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> was like oh of course I have to go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's impressive that he he's still </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> able to perform yeah well that's the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> thing it's like he came like from like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when they all came onto stage and like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the music starts playing and you just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> see this guy just like hobbling across </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the stage right and I'm like oh that's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> him there he is and he just goes up to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the mic and he's like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> normal for Birmingham </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah I don't know what you said man but </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> God you you sounded good and he's like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> oh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I think you'll know it General's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> gathered and he's just started singing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> normally I was like why can you not why </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> can you sing this is completely fine but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you can't talk you haven't lived in the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> UK test I can understand him like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> perfectly I'm not I'm not even joking I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> could understand what he was saying I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> don't know what it is man yeah the UK is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> weird it sucks it gives you like uh like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> it's it's like the hard mode of English </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like once once you're trained in it then </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> you could you could like distinguish any </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> accident no difficulties understanding </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> English accents yeah yeah because I just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> grew up around really strange ones but I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> guess like Black Sabbath like so Led </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Zeppelin for me is like kind of just all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of like the British like 70s like hard </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> rock man so like Black Sabbath can fit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in there like deep purple can fit in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there because like that's just like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> music my dad just grew up with and he </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> was like here do you know Rolling Stones </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I was like and I was two years old </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> and I was like what is a music and then </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> he just played Rolling Stones and I was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> like okay okay I can get behind this and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> then I think the first band I like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> really connected to was Led Zeppelin </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> um yeah like I [ __ ] love okay I'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> getting I'm not like an idiot and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> they're gonna do Stairway to him yes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> they are the ones </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Stairway to Heaven rock and roll Black </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Dog uh Immigrant Song Immigrant Song </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> um you know that song </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah the Viking song yeah that's them I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> often living in Japan you'll meet like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> say you're just me talking to Japanese </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> people whatever and they'll be like oh I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> love I love British music I'll be like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh okay I'm thinking like [ __ ] watch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> area they're gonna talk to because I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> don't know any of them yeah it's always </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like Black Sabbath Led Zeppelin and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> they'll be like they'll ask me what's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> your favorite song I'll be like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> [Applause] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> basically uh like Jimmy Page who's the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> guitarist for Led Zeppelin he's the one </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> who basically influenced me to start </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> guitar right yeah so like I watched one </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> concert from Led Zeppelin and I was like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> that is the coolest [ __ ] human alive </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like just like him just shredding on </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> guitar I was like I want what he has I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> want that can I do that is it a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> coincidence they're all posing very </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> similarly and like they just happen to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> all have the same looking posts I just I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah I mean that's just like we are a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> band we are a band we're doing pretty </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> well yeah we are a band </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um yeah so I guess like yeah so Led </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Zeppelin's just like like just my love </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for like 70s rock so like Black Sabbath </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Deep Purple Rolling Stones because it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> been really hard for you to decide it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> really hard because you're you're music </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> knowledge is vast yeah yeah and I feel </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like you have an appreciation of music </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah Way Beyond anything me and can't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> have yeah like me and Connor's like a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> music puddle yours is like a music ocean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> you know basically </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um and then I guess like kind of in the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> same vein but I had to like put it uh </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> differently as Pink Floyd in the middle </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah yeah like I think I went to a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> concert of Pink Floyd's well technically </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> just Roger Waters um and he and he </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> performed that uh Pink Floyd has this </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> album called the wall yeah which is like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> considered like one of the greatest like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> concept albums Jerry has explained the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> wall to me in great details yeah I like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> how you said they made this album called </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> the wall like it's not like one of the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> most favorite I don't know because like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> because people always think like oh yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they made Dark Side of the Moon it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> so Roger Waters was the guy who like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> mostly wrote the wall but like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> entire band like did it as well but like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he went on like a tour all around the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> world to perform the wall </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um and so I got tickets to it like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> miraculously from a friend of mine and I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> was like oh my God my dream's gonna </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] come true like I get to see one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> of my favorite bands but like it wasn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a concert it was a [ __ ] stage show </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> right so like again the whole concept of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the wall is like guy creates a wall </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that's like not physical and then he </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like breaks it down while I get over his </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> musical uh and uh emotional bearers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> right super oversimplifying the element </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> right thank you that's what I mean </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> speedrun but what's amazing what was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> amazing about that concert is that as </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> they are playing the songs throughout </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the album they're literally physically </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> building a wall on stage oh that's cool </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> with like it like not obviously not made </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> out of Breeze like like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> big like Styrofoam so like off to every </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> song the band members actually like go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> off the stage and like Place bricks on </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the wall that's cool and then in the in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> the second heart and then in the first </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> half of the album he finishes building </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the wall and then it just goes into like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uh an Intel is funded by Donald Trump </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah definitely he was like I want it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> taller </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> half </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> wall is built right but they build it in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> front of the band so as the concert is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> going on you can see less and less </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> that's so cool and then the second half </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> of the album starts the entire stage </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> spins around that's how we're looking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and so now you're looking from inside </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> the wall and then because that's the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> theme of the second half of the album </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and then at one point and at the end </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they spin the stage round it was it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> all just on this like giant like lazy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> susan-esque like just rotating the whole </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> thing right um and then like second the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> second to last song on the album the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> main protagonist of the album he breaks </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> down the wall and they literally like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> blow this [ __ ] up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and just the pieces just go flying into </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> the crowd and then the album just ends </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and like I've never like cried during a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> concert but that was the first time I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was like CR like it was one of those </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Concepts where it's like you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> normally like say if you go see Muse or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like pendulum right yeah you're [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> like standing up you're like grooving </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> your singing along you're like [ __ ] yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you know like that kind of thing that </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> was the first ever concert I went to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> where I was just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my ass firmly planted on the seat and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> just staring right and just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> listening and like taking it in because </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like I wish I could have that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I wish I could know it was crazy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was like one of the like I've been a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> lot of concerts in my life but that was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> like one of the most like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I like ethereal is like the only way I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> can describe it it's just so like oh my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> God it's so much as someone who doesn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> understand a lot of like the deeper </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> appeal of music like what it what makes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> the wall such an amazing album because </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like to me the war was just like the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> album you say if you want to impress a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> dad you know like like you you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> male friend's dad or something and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you're like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> easy [ __ ] brownies I love ipas </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> um okay so I did like a whole </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> dissertation on the wall I did like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fork so I took like music as like a a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> major right in high school because I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wanted to like pursue it in uni </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> obviously I didn't end up pursuing it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> your dads were like no no you're Asian </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> Jerry yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> right now and uh like one of like I I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> did I studied like musicology which is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> Just Like Music analysis basically yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> and they were like and like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> year-long dissertation was take an album </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and just like write a dissertation about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like write an album like write an album </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> review basically I wrote like this like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 40 page like dissertation on the wall </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and like what's like the most insane </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thing about the wall is like not just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the fact that like the story is cohesive </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and like all the songs flow together </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like there was no pauses between any of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the songs as it follows from one song to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> another like the entire album is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> connected to just one big song but the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> most amazing like mind-blowing thing is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the fact that the album literally </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> repeats and that's cool right right so </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the end the ending of The Last Song </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> Fades into the the beginning of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> first song that's pretty cool and like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that just like completely like and and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's not just like a stylistic thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like they did that on purpose to show </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that like what this main character is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> going through is it never ending cycle </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> right right and it's just no it's just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> constantly repeating over and over as </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> well with uh with The Eagle right yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so like uh the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> wall was I I'd say it was like the first </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> album to like incorporate that style and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a lot of obviously like Tyler and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a lot of artists took that yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um but yeah I mean like you know I've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> always said that like you can make like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> a concept heavy album right and like try </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and tell a story but if the music sucks </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> then the music's new song </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> right it's like you could you could have </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the most like deep ass like message </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> about like you know whatever the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you're trying to sing about but if the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> song doesn't stick with you then it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like there's no point yeah the wall </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> though is like every song's a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Banger so even if you listen to it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> individually it's like oh it's a great </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] song yeah it's still [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> slaps and then on top of that it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> oh it's deep as well and profound and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's lyrics it's like what more right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um you know and like what the one thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> though that annoys the [ __ ] out of me is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the fact that Another Brick in the Wall </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> is from this album and it's like Pink </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Floyd's most well-known song yeah right </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> just because and then like it's a bulb </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but so many people just listen to it out </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> of context they don't know what it means </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because they don't know what it means </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because like if you actually yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because in the context of the album it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> a really [ __ ] depressing song yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but it's just like played in an upbeat </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> and it's like it's like a great song </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> right it's like I'm not gonna fault them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> for that but um yeah I don't know and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> like all their albums just like that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they've never had a bad album it might </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> um so there's that I know you love </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Radiohead In awful lot I love Radiohead </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> uh as as does God yeah I do as well it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> was Bond over radio yeah I mean like I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> had to like pick between Muse and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Radiohead and I was just like uh Muse </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just slightly edges it out there's any </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Radiohead songs that I've heard that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I've been like I love this song do you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> have you listened to creep I don't like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> creeper the best song you guys always </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> sing it well I mean this is like this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> it's it's like the song because it's the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> least depressing radio yeah I don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really like the depressing song yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that's the weekend see because at least </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's gonna not be right here </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah that's because I started listening </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to the lyrics I'm not gonna do that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> again </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um I don't know like I think for me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Radiohead I what I appreciate the most </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> about Radiohead is that they started off </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> as just like another 90s like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> alternative rock band and then the one </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> day they were just like no I don't think </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I will I don't think I'll be another a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 90s alternative rock band I'm gonna try </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> something else and then Okay computer </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> came out and it was like one of the most </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like [ __ ] like revolutionary 90s like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> rock bands ever and then like bands like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Muse </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> listen to that and was like we can do </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> that too yeah yeah exactly and like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> Coldplay as well was like heavily </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> influenced by Radiohead and like all </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> these like big old alternative rock </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> bands that went a little experimental </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah I mean I mean I feel like Radiohead </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> All the OG in that sense and yeah you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know they are they are [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> incredible and the only reason I put </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Muse above them was because like I think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I discovered them both at around the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> same time yeah yeah yeah and I like but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like there's so many nights where I just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like conquer and just listen to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Radiohead yeah and I don't know it's to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> me if if I'm like having an existential </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> crisis I put on Radiohead man because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> there's nothing that just like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> encapsulates that mood rather than just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> like a Radiohead song like sometimes I'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just like you know what I just want to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> stay home and just like feel depressed </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I wish I could feel this strongly about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> music I do I remember I was at a place </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that was like classical music being </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> played and uh there's this guy uh I was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was enjoying it I thought it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> amazing I was like these guys are so </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> talented yeah and there's a guy who's uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the front and uh I could see him </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> because it was kind of like you know </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> circle like semicircle you can see him </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> uh he was like tearing up how good this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> was yeah I remember thinking like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> how did he do that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> how did he do that how does this mean so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> much to him or how did it make him feel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this way because I don't understand I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like this sound a lot and I really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> appreciated the Artistry and everything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and I'm just like [ __ ] man I wish I was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just able to get what that guy had like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> emotional about from the from the music </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it like really made him emotional I can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> I can easily yeah I can't get that I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> think there's only I think this is true </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] up I think there's only two </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> artists in my three by three that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> haven't made me cry yeah yeah I don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know is that weird that I can't I I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> don't think it's starting to think it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> weird I wish I could get that like so to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> me to me I have a different problem </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because I like I said I never know like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the deeper meaning behind the music but </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like I've I've cried to so many songs I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> have no idea what they're about because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they just make me feel things </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> these things like I don't listen I don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know what the lyrics mean I'm just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> damn man this I think like have you ever </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just like sat down and just listened to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> music yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> and likes but but I guess but I guess </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> you're listening to like dolphin [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah it's not like Digital Love isn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> necessarily going to make you cry no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah you're right I don't know right I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> guess just maybe the music I listen to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> the way I consume it yeah maybe I don't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> know but I don't think it's weird I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> think there's a lot of people because I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't struggle to I you know when I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> watch TV or anything it's like super </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> easy you cry all the time but there are </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> people who like struggle to cry watching </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> movies that's true right so I guess it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> the same thing so it's not like I'm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> sitting there like dude come on tears </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm not bad doing that it's just like I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> don't I don't get what this guy's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> getting I don't understand why I you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> know maybe it's I don't know maybe maybe </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> maybe as I'm mature I might yeah I mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like to me like music is it's gonna </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> sound so philosophical now it's kind of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like a language you know they're like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they're absolutely I don't speak it is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> like I feel like there is something </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> being communicated through the language </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> of music and like I don't even </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> understand the words behind the music </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I feel you know there are times when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I think I feel or the language behind it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and like the emotion that is being </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> portrayed with the music that's true I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mean if animals are anything to go by </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know dancing is a language singing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is a language somehow they don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> understand I imagine what they're saying </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> but it does something and it that's how </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> they decided they yeah it's just like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> pulls out like just some kind of like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Primal yeah I think so I think we have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> an inclination to feeling towards it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like I don't know what makes like I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> don't know what makes good music like I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I I don't know what makes good music </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like literally I think what makes good </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> music is just if it makes you feel a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> certain way I watched like musical memes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like memes that only people who like or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> are really into music would get and I'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like I feel like this is funny I just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> didn't I just couldn't understand why it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was fun right but like when somebody </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> plays like C minor or something like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> that I'll be like what but yeah that was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> kind of funny that's a bit of a deep cut </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> something along those lines </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um and then I guess like tool is like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> probably the one band that made me love </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> metal again right um because like do I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know any of the songs </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the name sounds extremely familiar I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> mean there yeah because Joey just talked </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> about it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> can I talk about them all the time but </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like I think like I think what like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> speaking of like Primal Instinct I think </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> like tall does the best job of like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> pulling out like that Primal Instinct in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> people Oh I thought you're talking about </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> bam there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> I was like Primal this thing that's what </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm not that bad there's a vehicle </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Primal scream which is good but no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> problem </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um yeah I don't know like tool is like I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> don't think they necessarily have like a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> hit song or anything they kind of like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> one of those just like cult bands I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> guess maybe like the pot yeah sober the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> part Prison Sex there's a lot of like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> good songs but like I think what makes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it like I think what makes tool amazing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and what I fell in love with tall is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that like especially like this is a band </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that like you need to listen to the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> lyrics okay because it's like like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but but what I love about tool is that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> their music just in general is so </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> [ __ ] good that you'll still enjoy </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yourself without listening to the lyrics </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> at all okay so like um Manny James </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Keenan who's this guy in the middle he's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the lead singer </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> um in his in like tall stage shows and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like concerts normally the lead singer </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> is in the front right but me and it for </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> some reason is behind a curtain in the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> back like you can't even see him half </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the time in concerts and that's because </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> he treats his voice as just another </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> instrument and if you want to listen in </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> closely on what he's saying then you can </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> if you don't want to you don't have to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> there's the rest of the band to listen </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to and I think that's like so [ __ ] </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> cool because it's like again it goes </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> back to that whole thing of like you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> might have like some deep ass message </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> behind your music but if your music </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> sucks then No One's Gonna [ __ ] listen </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to it right sure and like tall is like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> we can make Banger songs and we can make </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> profound lyrics that makes sense and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's like that's and like I don't know </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's just like musicians it's like I I </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> Inspire to be that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um and yeah like I don't know like like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> tool is one of those metal bands that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like even non-metal fans love like I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think every person I've shown tall who </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is like not necessarily in the middle </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> music is like yeah this [ __ ] slot oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so like I'd recommend if you don't like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> metal listen at all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> um and then oh God I guess we'll go to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> doctor Dooms </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I knew that I knew that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> um so MF Doom yeah uh as as Connor said </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is your favorite rapper's favorite </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> rapper I've seen that YouTube video yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've heard so much about this person but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I've never listened to the music yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah so basically like uh Tyler the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Creator and like you know [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> literally every like rapper everyone </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> loves and has gotten big has been </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> somehow inspired by mf2 just because </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> he's like and he's like the hip-hop fans </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> hip-hop if that makes sense yeah like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because like I I feel like before MF </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> Doom the only like hip-hop I ever really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> listened to Growing Up was like Eminem </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but that's because Eminem back then was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like [ __ ] inescapable like yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> during like Eminem Show era Eminem like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Eminem was everywhere right like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um so like I feel back then I didn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really like Take hip-hop seriously or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like rapping seriously other than Eminem </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um but then I listen to MF Doom and I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was like okay hold on this might </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> actually this might this might actually </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> be good this might be some good music </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> um again another artist you need to like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> listen to the lyrics uh so yeah I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> remember I remember that I don't know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who broke it down Vox did a video </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was like this is amazing I just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't I don't know yeah yeah I don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know I don't think I could ever Garner </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> this by myself yeah yeah if you come </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> close to garnering this by myself it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like when they tell you like why the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> piano is a this specific piano is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> amazing I'm like I'm sure it is it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> certainly looks the part but I don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah I don't know yeah no it makes sense </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it makes sense I mean it's just like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> good music in general </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um again I'm having a hard time </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> explaining why this is good to people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> who aren't on the same way any any </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hardcore music fans here can appreciate </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> your your take </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> yes if uh if we were more hardcore into </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> music how would you explain it then I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> because I am curious </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> um okay so break it down for me </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> focusing on 100 break it down okay so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> tool for example </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> um is like like just this this sound and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like their singing style and the way </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> they structure songs is like it just has </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like a flow to it like one song could </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have like seven or rate different parts </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that sound like seven or eight different </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> songs but somehow they can stitch that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] up together and make it sound so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> cohesive and like together to the point </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where like you can listen through a 15 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> minute tour song and it'll sound like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> two minutes yeah I was gonna ask how </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> long is a typical Tool song they're not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> actually two like I mean they obviously </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> have like long songs as well but I think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like average tall songs maybe like five </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> six minutes it's quite long which I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> guess it's long but I mean like if you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> compare it to like say I don't know a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> tangerine dream song like like it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a standard Tangerine Dream song is like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 20 minutes that's a good name yeah so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I've never heard of them but that's a </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_06> Wi-Fi hip-hop girl wishes they were </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> tangible </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um but yeah uh I don't know it's just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like really good like Tangerine Dream I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> would say is like perfect background </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> music of just like if you're at like you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> know and like if you have like friends </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> over and you're just like you just want </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to like hang out or you're like you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you have your [ __ ] like I don't know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fiance's parents over right and you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> don't want to sound you don't want to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> look weird by like putting on like tall </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> in the background you know Tangerine </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Dream is like the music to go right </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> because it's just like it's just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> relaxing it's inoffensive it's just I'll </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> check it out yeah and like they've got a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> like a lot of good stuff they did a lot </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> of like uh movie soundtracks oh really </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah there was this uh what was the Tom </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Cruise movie that they did the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> soundtrack to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um they did a lot of soundtracks though </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> um and like game soundtracks as well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that they're done yeah yeah so uh what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kind of games </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I I wish I could do they've done they've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> done 400 albums I don't [ __ ] remember </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Risky Business yeah they did the Risky </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Business soundtrack oh wow which is like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> probably one of their best albums </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um yeah they just they're literally just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> three German dudes who uh play a lot of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like relaxing music </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> um and then I guess Nick Drake is this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> guy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> so Nick Drake is like he so he's like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> kind of he plays folk music okay as if </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> you couldn't tell from this picture uh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> but he uh he basically it's really hard </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> to describe him so he he basically he </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> killed himself very early in his career </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> okay um I think he was like 23 24. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um but he made this one album called </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> pink moon yeah and it's like it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> literally just him and a guitar yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's it and it's like super low-fi </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's just it's just him just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> singing Just One Guitar occasionally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> maybe like a piano right but like it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so like it's one of like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> look like when it comes to like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> depression like as a theme in music yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a lot of artists have done it yeah from </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like all sorts of different angles in my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> opinion pink moon is probably the most </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] hard-hitting and like real album </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when it comes to like depression and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> exploring what makes you say that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> it's because like it's not only just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like the tone of his singing and just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the fact that it's just him and a guitar </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah but it's again it's like lyrics </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> obviously yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> um he has this one song called </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> um uh I think it's called Black Dog </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> um and it inspired a book called black </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> dog or it's like depression is like a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> black dog it just like keeps coming back </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and like that's from the song that he </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> wrote </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> um but it's like I don't know it's like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's beautiful but it's like haunting </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's like really really [ __ ] haunting </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and like every time I play this album </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> like there's just like a couple of songs </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that I just hit where I'm just like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> break down crying I guess because you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know the you know what how yeah real the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> stuff when someone's in that state of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> mind you know sometimes it's like you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sometimes you can't always express </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yourself or communicate that emotion </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> without having a medium like music or </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> some something like that like what I can </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> say is that like Nick Drake is music but </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> what it's certainly not is entertainment </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right it is oh yes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it is just like it is music in its </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> purest artistic form yeah where it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like you don't put on a Nick Drake album </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> to [ __ ] jam out you put on a Nick </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Drake album to like self-reflect and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like you know just kind of take it in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah and like you know kind of learn </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> from it right because like he was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he was super depressed like I'm talking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like mega mega mega depressed from a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> child yeah and like I mean I believe </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that yeah and uh you know and like it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> led him to take his own life even though </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> he was like extremely [ __ ] talented </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he probably had a bright future ahead of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> him if he kept going but yeah depression </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> very hard to deal with yeah so then he </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just kind of like gained a cult status </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because of that and my sister actually </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like put me on to Nick Drake </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> um because I guess she was in like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> stage in her life where she kind of was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like yeah and I was like I I feel like I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> found him in like the perfect time and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> again like this is not an honest I would </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> recommend to people who want bangers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> well I like I feel like that type of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> music or that type of media definitely </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> has a place because especially like when </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you are in a dark place sometimes you're </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> not looking for like happy music or like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> things to cheer you up but like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> listening to I guess someone who has </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> been in that same emotional status or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> maybe finding someone who you feel is in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that same emotional state as you yes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's like a comfort knowing that at </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> least you're not like the only one who's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> feeling like this now and and when I was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> in that like moment in my life as well </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> and listening to Nick Drake I think this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> album cheered me up more than any [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> album yeah it's weird because when I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really depressed and really sad </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> listening to depressing music cheers me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> up yeah like it's it's it's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> listening to happy music just makes me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> more depressed yeah because I'm just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like how does how like why are they </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> happy and I'm not how dare this beat </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like be this like upbeat like happy how </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> dare these people be happy yeah you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> listen to depressing songs and I'm just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> like [ __ ] man I'm not I'm not alone I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> not the only one I'm not exactly yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah exactly yeah like that's the thing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> it's like I feel listening to happy </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> music while depressed just does the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> opposite effect because it makes you go </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> how come they're happy but I'm not yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah you know I can't relate to this </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> happy mood right now because that's not </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> where I am right now I'm in this [ __ ] </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> dark depressing like somber moment and I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> need something that can like you know </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> complement that feeling yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> um so that's why I love Nick Drake </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> um and then yeah I talked about him </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> after him American football uh so </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> they're pretty much I think they're a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> recent like addition to like my favorite </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> bands but uh they made me fall in love </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with this genre of music called Midwest </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> emo </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what what there is a genre of music </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> called Midwest emo you know people say </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> genres out loud and I just think you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just lying </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like I just like like you know like at </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> this point like I feel like music most </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> of all like people just make up genres </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> oh yeah of course it's like it's it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> music most of all yeah of course of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> course they do they're just like it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> not Punk it's it's just some derivative </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of punk we don't want to be the same as </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> those punk bands so so what's so good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> about them man okay so it's emo country </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> no Midwest Midwest emo Midwest emo how </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> did you define Midwest Midwest uh it is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> emo made by bands who have lived in the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> midwest America so what is the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> difference between Midwest emo and emo </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> okay so in terms of sounds </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm sure there is but I wouldn't be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> aware of it uh so Midwest emo is like so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> basically these guys founded the genre </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um and like the Indie scene for the past </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> like 20 years has been just filled with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Midwest emo bands </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> um yeah yeah they're like they're like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> there's a lot of bands who have gotten </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> big off like band camp and like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> SoundCloud and like Spotify and stuff </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> right that are in this genre </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> um and it's like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> how do I explain Midwest it's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like indie rock and math rock with </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> folk music </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> oh my God that's why I don't understand </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> this is problem because like every time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> I I excuse people who really know music </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> you start saying things to me I'm like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you're just lying you're just lying like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> why isn't that on on iTunes that thing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> am I stupid like it is on iTunes it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> probably is now but like to me it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are we categorizing music too much I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> mean I guess but that's because I feel </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> music just in general has expanded to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah so far that like it's just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> like it's kind of a shame to just throw </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it all away it's just rock oh that's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> true I guess maybe this is just my own </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> inability to understand it and so I'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> just like why yeah well I mean you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's the same thing with like electronic </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> music right like we have Electronica you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> have house you have trance you have yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> I guess so where whereas like someone </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> who doesn't like music will be like it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just all electronica </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the beeps and the boots it's just the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> beeps and the boobs all right so thank </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you so Midwest Nemo is like it's as the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> name suggests a lot of the lyrical </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> themes are very depressing </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> um but it's not like folk music like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> strictly it's not like a Nick Drake it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like there's there's a band behind it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> usually a lot of songs can be upbeat but </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> usually the lyrical contents are very </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> depressing hence the emo so that makes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the emo when it's depressing yeah okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's kind of like it's kind of like emo </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> this is going to sound really bad it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Midwest emo is like is like Nick Drake </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> if you are privileged </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [Laughter] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> so many layers right now it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Midwest demo is like it's coming from </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> bands who like have lived in like the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Midwest in small towns where like it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> not like they're born into like poverty </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or like just kind of [ __ ] yeah it's just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like they kind of just like lived in a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> town that's in the middle of nowhere in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the midwest not a whole lot to do except </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> get sad about [ __ ] okay because they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't you know because they have like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> usual from like Minnesota yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> it is like Suburban emo that's the only </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> way I just made that up it is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> is it is I just made a new genre of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> music it is emo rock yeah with mixes of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> folk music for people who live in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Suburban Midwest areas I think I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> understand yeah yeah apparently yes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> apparent Parable Paramore kind of took </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> Midwest emo sound and put a little bit </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> more of like a punk Twist on it yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> right so they're a little more like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> upbeat right but they're still like you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know the lyrical contexts are like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Paramore songs are still very much like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know like I'm feeling depressed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> because this girl doesn't like me and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> she left me and you know it's like my my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> town has nothing my friends have all </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> moved away that kind of stuff yeah yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's like so American football is that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> um through American football I found </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> like I like so you know how Spotify has </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that like Spotify yeah Midwest email was </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> number two for me last year </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> um </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> and like American Football was like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> big reason for that wow because I just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> listened to a lot of American football </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like not just American football there's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a lot of other like Midwest emo and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I basically just found this like large </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> pool of Midwest emo bands and they're </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> all [ __ ] amazing what appeals to you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> about Midwest emo yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's such a random like it is right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> such a random genre of music it's um I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't know for one like the music is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just good like it sounds good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um it's like performed well like uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because it's like got blends of math </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Rock which is like very like technical </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Rock and like technical guitar okay okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just love that sound in general like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Japan does a lot of really good math </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Rock like Japan Japan has its own like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> branch of matter called Japanese math </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Rock and like Japan is like really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] good at just like you know like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> like okay okay like Dean does for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> instance right like the you know like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> the opening to Psychopaths the first one </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah yeah that's math oh where it's like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> very technical guitar and it's just like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> very like Whaley fair enough um but </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Midwest emo kind of takes a lot of that </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> style of just like technical guitar </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which just as a guitarist I can </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> appreciate for one Batman like like one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thing I always want to know is like how </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> much do you appreciate music in like a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> technical sense or like a theory sense </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> where oh obviously you're like way more </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> musical training musically trained then </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> say I am </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> um so like how much does that play into </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> your taste in music or your appreciation </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> of Music in general I mean you know if I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> hear something I'm just like oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what did you just do there then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> obviously I'm gonna like poke my ears up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> right but like I'm not gonna fall in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> love with a band just because they're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> technical right because again at the end </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> of the day if your music isn't good then </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's not good right and you know I've </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> listened to a lot of like Midwest emo </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and like even like metal like technical </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> metal bands and stuff like that where </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like yeah you're technical you are </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> skilled yeah but the music isn't really </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> for me right right right </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> um yeah and then I guess finally is the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> only Japanese guy is Maya de June uh he </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> basically that name sounds familiar yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he wrote music for like Clan Adkins </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> basically every key so basically what </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> makes might adjourn is this because you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> got into the gacha recently </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> what makes my dig my talking idle is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> just again the fact that this man can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> single-handedly write a story write </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> characters and just write all the music </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for it just single-handedly like it must </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> be an advantage there that you can like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> you know the characters and the story </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> better than anyone right you can craft </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> the whole what but like I don't know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> like of course I like you know I I look </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> up to this guy just for like his ability </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to like tell a story because like Clan </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> ad and like Aaron Canon and Angel Beats </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> are like you know great stories right </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> um but like I think the one thing that </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> makes my like I appreciate my attitude </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> is just how [ __ ] musically talented </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> he is yeah because not only can he write </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like somber like piano tracks that have </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> no lyrics at all like the entirety of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the clan out soundtrack yeah make me cry </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> like a [ __ ] yeah I cried but he can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> write [ __ ] bangers as well like you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> know any of the angel Beats songs like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> absolute [ __ ] like girls dead monster </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> that like that fictional band he created </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in Angel Beats every song is a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Banger I'm like you can write bangers </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and you can make me cry like impressive </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I didn't know that like how do you do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that I didn't know that and so like you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> were talking about the gotcha game I got </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> into it so key recently released a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gotcha game called Heaven Burns Red </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> which is the first fully miter June </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> produced game in 15 years </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> um and so he wrote the story is it a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> visual novel uh it's a it's yeah it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of like it's very dialogue </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> intensive because okay yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> um </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but it's also like a it's like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> turn-based RPG kind of thing as well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> okay of course it has gotcha so of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> course music yeah so he wrote the story </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> he wrote the character designs he came </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> up with the character designs he came up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with a scenario and he wrote all the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> music forward [ __ ] yeah that's why he </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hasn't been doing anime recently hasn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> it exactly all this time you know I got </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> you I mean it's also because he's been </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like extremely sick yeah as well oh man </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> like the whole like you know the whole </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> theme in like Angel Beats about like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> whole thing that's just based off his </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> own life oh Jesus yeah right because he </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> has like a chronic like heart uh like he </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> goes disease or something he's done so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> much I mean he wrote I'm pretty sure I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> don't know if this is true but I think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> he wrote Angel Beats in the hospital bed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> seriously yeah while he was admitted to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> hospital he wrote Angels what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what a [ __ ] bam and it's just yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and he's just like he's a Banff like and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the fact that like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> again like this man doesn't miss not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> like he don't miss like every even in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the new game like the story is great the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> characters are great and the music </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] slaps so I guess I guess </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everything else just lifts your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> enjoyment of the music more right and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like and I feel like you know you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> know we were saying earlier that like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> fully cooly as well like pillows I was I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> was very close to putting pillows </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because that's just like pinches it out </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> for you yeah I think mightogen just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> pinches it out for me because like as </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> much as I love the fully cooly </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> soundtrack the first soundtrack that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> made me fall in love with anime </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> soundtracks was clana because like again </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> as a Pianist myself listening to like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> piano music that makes me [ __ ] break </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> down crying like don't perform it and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> it's like I can't even I can't even like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> learn to play these songs without crying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> right right and it's like that's that's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> wholesome and that's like really hard to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> do as someone who like you know because </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> there's someone who writes music I </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> strive to do that to people right and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the fact that this guy can do it over </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> and over and over again with like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> everything he also writes is like how do </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> you do that why can women have all that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Talent okay it's not fair I'm just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> saying man key would not be where they </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> are without this guy sometimes you see </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> someone and you're like hey you're a bit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> too tired well this is unfair and it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> good looking like yeah yeah as if I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> couldn't like like give me something to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> hate like God obviously didn't love all </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> humans equally he made you he made my </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> energy rate on my origin it's not fair </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's not fair I I wish I had a sliver of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> the talent this guy has yeah damn but uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah I guess that's my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know man I I feel a little bit </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> uh pushed back because I was like I need </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a somehow top guard living an anime </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> backstory you can't you can't I couldn't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> top it so I was like the Slumdog </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> Millionaire we're just we're just living </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in God's life this is we're not we're </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> not I can't story is I will forever live </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> in that shadow that's why I have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> mentioned before I've been in the band </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> just like the same way everyone's been </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> in the band yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> getting like six bands but I never had a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> cool story like I just I just I thought </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> when I said I was in a band everyone had </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> the similar experience I don't know no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you're wrong what happened what normally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> happens when you're in a band then do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> you not kind of like you pretend yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah you go to the drummer's house you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> play a couple of cover songs that's it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and then you're like all right cool </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> see you never again yeah that happens </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> all the time Smash Mouth once yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> what's the point of forming a band if </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're not gonna play gigs how are you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> gonna play a gig how are you gonna </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> arrange that yeah we're [ __ ] dumb as </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_02> a gig </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so [ __ ] easy and Brighton there's so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> many oh yeah in Brighton yeah yeah in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Sydney it's pretty [ __ ] difficult </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_04> going to sing Smash Mouth </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_05> didn't take that I can't even top you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when it comes to like band names either </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because like that band name is just like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] like the best band name I was in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was resting [ __ ] face </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but that's just because the lead singer </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> had a resting [ __ ] face it's always </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like that it's like uh it's called I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> always like it yeah </SPEAKER_04>
