<SPEAKER_03> it's that much of a concern well yeah i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> feel like i think i feel like you've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> seen you hear about people dying i feel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like you have more chance of getting hit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> in like by a car in the airport than you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> do from getting so i feel like we should </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> ban cars before we sydney airport </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that place is a [ __ ] mess it feels </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like the dumbest superpower anyone could </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hope for yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just like that one guy in like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mayhew academy who has quirks against </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like every anti-venom and he's only </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> useful in australia like everywhere and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> else in the world he's just useless he's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like born in the uk he's like what [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i can't use this at </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> though it just takes all [ __ ] long </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> time yeah exactly yeah yeah i mean you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> can like you can build up some </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> resistances to like some venoms i don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> know how much you can build up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> resistance because i don't know if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> there's been any studies of like anyone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who's like tried to build up enough </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> resistance like take on like a back </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> black cobra or something like that yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um but i don't think you'd need to yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like alcohol isn't it you just get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> more used to it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but it's it's like that's uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the more you get bitten the more </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> resistant </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i assume if there is like uh something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> makes i don't know like there's those </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> ants or something that like make you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really in pain maybe if you just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what aunt specific like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like like the bullet what if you got </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> bitten by one every single day surely </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> after a while is you wouldn't phase you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> after like ten years maybe she wants to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> try this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> well no because like i'm experimenting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> well we want to be bitten by [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> every day for the next day isn't there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that tribe that is like revolved around </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> putting a glove of bullet hands on your </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm pretty sure it's like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thing that they do during ceremonies </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like to initiate like a kid into ch </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> adulthood </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah yeah but like from what i can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> understand like the people in the tribe </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are more resistant to that venom than </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> other people who have tried it oh yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> obviously yeah so i mean i don't know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> why they like who who decided that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> who decided that they would do that as a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ceremony you know what let's just get a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bunch of [ __ ] answers thing you yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you're a man now i want to hear like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the council meeting of like when they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> decided that they were like all right so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so jim's just turned 18 you know he's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he's been he's ready to bear children </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he's ready to be a dad um yeah but we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> need like a ceremonious thing some guy's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> maybe just share a beer with him it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like yeah that's kind of like what if we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> though </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hear me out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> put his hands </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> into a fire ant nest </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> genius i probably gets it i'm i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> understand why i mean you know i'm not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> here to be like wow </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the only difference is that we just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> agree you talk about like astrology yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah i'm joking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you're like oh i'm gonna get married </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> tomorrow apparently yeah oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i thought i thought i was just like i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't think angry is a star no no no you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> could be angry right from the start </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i gotta put the [ __ ] snake glove on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah like i you know they probably </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> thought that it had some meaning and it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and it probably carries some value of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> course like i'm sure right here's the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thing we know that like jumping in a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> cold </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> bath or something is good for you yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we know that because of science like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> showers but before if there was no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> science backing this up and you were </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like connor jump in the math for some </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> for health reasons i'm like [ __ ] off i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not jumping on a cold back why would i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> jump in a cold bear i'm not doing that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it's stupid i mean why would that help </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> me i wouldn't do it even if i knew those </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> whole threesomes but like it's like you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know now that there is right and so i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can understand why maybe these people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> have this notion that like i'm sure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there might even be health benefits to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> getting bitten by our heads i don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe there is we haven't we just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> haven't researched it there's so many </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> things that haven't been researched we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't know i don't i don't think this is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> worth researching personally what if i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> told you that like if you like you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh inflated your uh your big toe once a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> year would help with curing alzheimer's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're probably like well [ __ ] i'm not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> gonna do that but thanks </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know what i mean there's so many </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> things that can help ex disease or help </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> stop things right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm just not going to do that well like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when they're like that one paper came </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> out that one time that was like research </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> suggests eating no more than five french </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> fries at a time to lower the risk of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cancer it's like let's be honest i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> never gonna eat less than five french </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> fries that's just impractical i'm just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> not gonna </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i think like at the end of the day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> people just don't care </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like if they couldn't convince smokers </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to stop smoking by like actual </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> scientific research that proved that it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> heavily increases your chance to get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cancer the more you smoke you know if if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they couldn't convince humanity to stop </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> smoking after that then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then what would like five french fries </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> five like eating less than five french </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> fries because like the moment you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like oh yeah you should probably stop </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> smoking because you know it could give </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you every type of lung cancer or you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know just cancer in general there's just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a cool life i think that's it but as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> humans like we're so [ __ ] at uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> recognizing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> long-term effects and by long-term in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like more than like a week yeah like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> something in fact we just don't think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it'll affect us yeah because it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh it's a week away anything could </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> happen </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> tomorrow we just we just ignore the fact </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that bad stuff can happen to us by doing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it yeah but yet isn't it so weird that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's such like a a disposition </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> between people who are like that where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they're like oh it's happening in like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> three days from now that's basically </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> never going to happen to people who you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> know say believe in things like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> astrology where they're like oh in 73 in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> years and four days time i'm going to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> get hit by a car well [ __ ] i better stop </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> preparing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you know like those kinds of like space </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like systems right like you know not to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like you know not to throw anyone's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> belief system under the bus you can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> believe whatever the [ __ ] you want right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but like that was one thing i always had </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> trouble </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know coming to terms with with that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> kind of stuff right where it's like it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so up in the air that it really and it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not backed up by science in any way as </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of right now that it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know how why would you even think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about something like that whereas like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> with smoking for example it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> well yeah um </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i had like seven of my [ __ ] grant you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know friends granddads died because of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> lung cancer probably due to smoking so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you should you know if that doesn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> convince you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i mean i guess i guess it comes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> down to the point where like it's it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like even now science </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as sad as it is science in the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> in this day and age isn't always like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the determining factor over whether </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people listen to uh listen to what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> science says or not because nowadays </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's because science is the government </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> dude and you don't want to trust the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> government well i think science the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> problem is with science and you know the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this age of like misinformation and just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not knowing what one is one is a lot of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> misinformation out there not knowing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which sources to trust and number two </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> science has just got so advanced that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the normal person isn't going to be able </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to follow along with what science says </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because the logic is so past what a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> normal person would be able to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> understand that you might as well be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> talking about god or [ __ ] or [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> stars in the sky because like you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how am i gonna understand what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> scientists are researching when it comes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to like making mini black holes in the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cern like institute or whatever like and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they're like [ __ ] firing protons at </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> each other like yeah the [ __ ] do i know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> about that yeah you know you know what i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> mean that's that's so fuc they're so far </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> beyond my knowledge of understanding </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just sounds like science fiction it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> literally sounds like science fiction </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> unfortunately we're a sucker for a good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> answer and an easy solution yeah so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> especially when like you know the top </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> researchers and scientists in the world </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> are like you know when explaining like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how does gravity work and they're just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like we don't know then they're like ha </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i told you must be jesus yeah you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like just like because we hate it when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we don't know something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like no matter how significant or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> insignificant it is and so when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> immediately when we're thrown into that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of situation humans are just very </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> good to being like well it's magic </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> must be magic a lot of times we just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> garner towards what feels right or what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we want to believe you know it's like we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like to believe that we're all like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> unbiased robots who only go with pure </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> facts and logic but a lot of the times </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we are very biased towards our beliefs </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and it takes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i guess i guess it takes a lot more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> effort to unbelieve and unlearn </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> something than it is to just you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> than it is to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> learn something fresh or just like build </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> up your beliefs fresh well i'm sure that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> happens in like between scientists as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> well right like as much as you think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> scientists are just like purely like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> facts and logic based only no emotion </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> thrown into whatsoever i'm sure you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's been instances where like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> scientist or you know let's say like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> physicist like comes up and be like all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right i've got this new theory yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about how the universe was created what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> do you think here's here's a bunch of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> theoretical things that you know we've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> been researching all that kind of stuff </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm sure there's been a couple of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> scientists who are like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> no yeah that sounds dumb as [ __ ] because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't like you yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that happens a lot right and you know a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> lot of scientists are also religious a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> lot of them you know because there's a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> lot of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we don't know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a lot of things and also science isn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> um having concrete answers it's about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> attempting and trying everything and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then proving that there's no other way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah it could be anything else right i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think that's the problem is that a lot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of people have this rigid view of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> science is like it can only be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> science is a hundred percent right all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the time and it's not we're just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> eliminating things that we know for sure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it isn't yeah yeah and so a lot of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> time when theories are uh presented or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hypotheses or whatever you know we have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so so many examples of history being </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> incorrect and yeah we fix it when we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> realize it and the problem is is that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a lot of the time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that kind of gets galvanized into being </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like all right well look science is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wrong sometimes i get it wrong and it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like no we never science is never ever </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> presented to know everything it's we're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> building the most it's the most accurate </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> representation that we have at this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> current time we're building up a library </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> of what we think i think i think like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> tim mentioned said it the best way he </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> said like science adjusts its views </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> based on what's observed yeah and faith </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is the denial of observation so that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> belief can be preserved yeah and i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like that's pretty much it because it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like science as you said like science </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> changes all the [ __ ] time because we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't know everything in the world right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so it's like so we have to kind of make </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> compromises for what we now know which </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> could completely change what you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like say like 500 years ago when people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> legitimately believed that like the sun </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> rotates around the earth and not the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> other way around and then when they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> discovered that they were like well [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> all these sites what have all these </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> science has been doing for the past 500 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> years wasting our time the problem is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that we're really bad as like humans of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> understanding </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> stuff we don't know yeah uh you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because if you'd have back then it would </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> make total sense that we the sun </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> revolves around ours because it looks </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like it does and yeah we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> don't have any other way of even </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> remotely comprehending that it couldn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> revolve around us </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but once you find out it's like oh well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of course of course of course we revolve </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> around it yeah that makes so much sense </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah so it's really easy to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> believe in the the thing that you your </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> makes sense that makes most like logical </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> sense in your brain because like yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like i said like i said before like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> science now has got to a point where a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> lot of the more advanced concepts uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where the normal person is not going to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> be able to comprehend and so at that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> point you're going to have your just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> putting your faith in a person of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> authority that their understanding is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> good enough that they can you know take </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what these studies say and present that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in a manner which you can understand but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at the end of the day you're still </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> putting a trust your trust into </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> something that you don't fully </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> understand yourself </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which uh i mean getting back to the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> getting back to like the habits and the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> things you uh believed even if you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> science is like disproved there like do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you guys have like any like wives tales </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or like anything that any habits that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was formed from basically at a childhood </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> age where like your parents said </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> something oh yeah and you like you you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> did it as a kid because you your mum or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> dad said so dude dude i have a japanese </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> grandma they are nothing but wife </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like okay so like to this day like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> whenever i get ill right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i eat a [ __ ] ton of oranges right like i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> eat like a pack of oranges oranges </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and like because because when i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> young um my mom said oh vitamin c is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> good for the immune system uh when it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> comfortable i don't know where that came </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from i'm pretty sure there is some </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> science back to it but like i think i've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> read into it once and yes vitamin c does </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> improve the immune system but that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like one i believe okay this is this is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all my memory so you know feel please </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fact check this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it also might have just been god's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> health it might it might have just been </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my my household but one i believe that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like prevent illness so it like boosts </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> your immune system so it's more a more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> healthy immune system and two there's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> only so much </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> vitamin c intake you can uh you can you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can do to really have a big effect on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> your immune system so but like that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> doesn't matter in my mind because in my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mind i'm like i've been conditioned to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think i am ill i need to eat a [ __ ] ton </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> of oranges to in take this vitamin c </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to have these [ __ ] basically just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like a pavlovian i think yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> right right it's like it coughs once </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> where are the oranges </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that's so weird because in my house it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> was if you were starting to get sick or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you were sick my mom and my granddad my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> grandma especially my grandma would make </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> me eat a shitload of ginger and spring </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> onion </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i don't know why </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um it just it just seems like a healthy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> alternative but yeah it's just one of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> those things where it has that taste to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it that you're like this has to be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> helpful </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't know why but this has to be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> because it's causation </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's because it tastes like medicine </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah like it tastes like medicine before </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> even like being put in a dish you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah another one i had a lot was uh like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> if i got like a cut on like my knee or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> something yeah uh then you'd uh my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> grandma would tell me to put wasabi on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it what what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's a very famous japanese one though </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot of a lot of uh what that's a very </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> famous where did that come from i don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> know maybe it's because like you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> when you put like an antiseptic on right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and it starts to sting yeah but that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> means it's like killing the bacteria </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> right so someone probably thought well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> wasabi does that regularly is that where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the stinging kind of thing i think the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> singing is part of killing bacteria i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think she's like no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i don't know if that's even a lifestyle </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> either but like i did i did like when i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> was little like you know i i was running </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> around in the park and then i [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> slid and scratched my knee and you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it was fine until i got home and my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> grandma grandmother was like oh [ __ ] we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> gotta patch you up dog so then she went </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> into the kitchen and i was like uh the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bandages are over here she's like no no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no i got this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> pulls out a [ __ ] chewable wasabi and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> grandmother what are you doing oh no no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no no no and she's like all right just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just hold still </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] pulls you know squirt someone to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a finger and just starts like rubbing my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> knee oh and uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that [ __ ] hurts </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no [ __ ] like a lot and uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i wouldn't exactly say it worked um if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> anything it just added an extra step of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh now it hurts and i have to shower </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it burns now and it burns my my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> regular skin that's not affected by the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cut </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah so that was the moment i was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> grandma you should probably like you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> read up on like some you know basic </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> first aid i'm just wondering where that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> started from because like i can imagine </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's something similar to like putting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> salt on a wound right which is you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's uh it sterilizes the wounds uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as well as it could as well as it could </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> do does it i thought it was just painful </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> no it does i think we google this i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> don't know by the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> way somewhat anti-bacterial okay yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but if i pissed on your leg it'd be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> somewhat hand-tied back to you the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> problem is that this is the problem when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you when when these things get some form </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of like it's like yeah you're one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> percent right one percent right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> right i heard right i heard right i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> better add that to my five-minute daily </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> life </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah is is salt uh like a like a kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like an anticipated supposedly it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> creates conditions that make it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> difficult for bacteria to grow </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> supposedly written by the same person </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you did that because you want to like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> be painful like you would torture </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> someone what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> what do you mean well you think it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like people in the painting that's why </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> we say salt on the wound because it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like all right let's say i [ __ ] you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> over to put salt in the wound i'll do it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> to [ __ ] someone over it it is painful </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> but i'm pretty sure where do they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> originate from salt on the wound can you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> google this i'm pretty sure it's not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> meant it's not medical already it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's to add more pain to it i mean i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think it came from like salt is like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> preserver right so it kind of makes it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hard for bacteria to grow it preserves </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the wound </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is complete [ __ ] you're making </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> this up now okay actually i don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> where i know this from [ __ ] the idiom </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> means what you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> [Music] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is is it so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> does putting salt in a wound make it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> worse at all does it do anything doesn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> make it hurt more yeah i know that i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i know that more but it's also like you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> know it makes it difficult with bacteria </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because it does that yeah it makes it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> difficult it's so vague though that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like there's a different scene of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> treatment and something yeah just put </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> some antiseptic on it sure if i cut my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> leg off it'd be harder for me to walk </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like i'm you know it's put some just put </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> some salt </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that's why like you wash wounds with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like saline solution as well yeah you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> don't do it with salt </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah but sailing solution is salt water </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah it's salt water that's if you don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> put like you're not putting on those </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the [ __ ] rocks rubbing it in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> there we're done </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that's not what i said </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the saying isn't put saline on them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> if i'm like lost in the wilderness or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> something and i'm like fight like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] miles away from </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> some rocks yeah just just like just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and just like just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> sprinkle it on sprinkle japan japan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> though is full of so many of those kinds </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> of idioms taking medical advice from </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> idioms oh no no no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but like there's a lot of like idioms </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like that especially in japan where it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like you know one of them that my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> grandma used to tell me all the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> time was like don't whistle at night </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because snakes will come yeah and it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wasn't until a couple years later i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> found out snakes are deaf so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah and then i started whistling like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] during the night time you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know so it's like where do they come </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from i don't know it's like uh yeah like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i said step on the crack break your </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> break your mother's back why okay i i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and as a kid i even i i was when i'd </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> heard this i was like no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that doesn't make any sense how fragile </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> is my mother's dark i was like i've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> stepped on many cracks </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> intentionally after hearing this to test </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the theory out um would am i a bad </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> person probably if you go home you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> most like riding on the ground oh no no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everyone has collectively stepped on a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> crack at some point isn't the earth just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> one big crack that's it's just it's all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one big tectonic plate also what old </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> japan is a crown also what defines as a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> crack like if i were to step on an ass </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> crack would i still break my mother's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> back off </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm pretty sure </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> for a second </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> how how amazing how this uh you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> scientific fact actually just rhymes as </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well yeah wow </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> also uh but other stuff that i don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> really believe in anything like that and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> even as a kid i remember that whenever i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> heard these i was like no that doesn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sound right why what like a cat crossing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> under an uh going under a ladder oh yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> or a black cat crossing your path is bad </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i think that's more like superstition </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> though that's a superstition yeah that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> what is this is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> chugging a bunch of oranges not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> superstition </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i guess sorry it is they're all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> superstitions i don't know if wait what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> is it what's the difference </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> what's the difference between a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> superstition in an idiom </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> say um uh well idioms are more to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> explain like it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like an example uh raining cats and dogs </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but oh yeah so yeah all of these okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> replace eating with soups yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> these are all superstitions so you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i i guess it's superstitious of you to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> consume a bunch of oranges in the hope </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that it will cure your illness right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that's superstitious i feel like there's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> no other word you have no no because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cause it's purely based on like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> hearsay and information you've heard and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> stuff yeah but but i feel like this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah it's so superstitious though right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's what it originates from it's all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> underneath that right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's come from like someone's experience </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that has been passed down superstition </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> feels more like supernatural right where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know like uh like opening up your </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> umbrella ins indoors is good it's bad </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> luck i don't know where that came from </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but like at least like i don't do that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> anyway because why would you do that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah yeah you're opening indoors oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like what if you're in like an umbrella </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> store and you want to test it out right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah they have umbrella stores </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah in japan you never get to open it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> though do you yeah you know what yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i mean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm cracking that bad boy okay i cracked </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that bad boy that's you know come on i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> found my own house and then every </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> middle-aged woman in that store looked </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> at me like superstition </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> in japan though a lot of people do do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> they really yeah a lot of people do i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> feel like in asia the culture around </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> superstition is like very very prevalent </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because everything everything is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> superstitious </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it has some kind of merit to it well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> because everything like you know because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the whole belief system is very like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> spiritual based right so i think a lot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> of superstitions are more widely </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> believed there's like a i'd say a scale </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> of like yeah stepping on a crack or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> break your mind yeah yeah that's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's the lower end of body yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah whereas maybe i've heard this from </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> many people the vitamin c thing yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah which i i don't know if there's any </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> merit i don't know if it does i don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know it's just like there is some like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really really basic logic around it that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're like i can kind of see that it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like saying like it's like i have this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> theory that drinking water </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> will help me feel better and it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're right but i feel like you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> vastly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like over simple it's kind of like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> same thing with say you you like your </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> experience with like manuka honey right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm just like yeah that is superstitious </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm just like is there any science </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> behind that but like when i had when i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> had covered i was like [ __ ] spooning </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> these this manuka honey like nobody's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> business it actually like helped my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> throat </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it felt it felt a lot better </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what's it called what's called uh the uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> placebo yeah that's like a placebo it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> could be which is like i'd argue is a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> branch of the superstitious tree because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's different </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> placebo is the documented effect that it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> actually has an effect yes yes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> your your brain is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> making up for some form of [ __ ] thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that you think placebo is so interesting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because it's like it hasn't been like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> properly studied and a lot of scientists </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> reckon and like a lot of psychologists </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> reckon there is like something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> legitimate there but we just don't know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what it is because we we don't we don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know the [ __ ] because it's like we don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> know if it's actually a thing that works </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or if it's just coincidence yeah like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> what the placebo effect is that it does </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> work we just don't know how yeah we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't we don't know how talking about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like the whole um remember the uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> life flashing before your eyes thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah yeah and how i was telling you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> guys recently there was an article that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> said they were scanning someone's brain </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on on a table we're just collecting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> scans we didn't talk about this podcast </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the taxi i remember this oh yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the superstitious we mentioned that in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the episode before i knew that but joey </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> didn't go on it for too long so i was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like i won't say anything anyway </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the guy was getting a scan a brain scan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know he's having a regular scanned </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> brain checking what's going on the brain </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh what's going on there and during this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> generic scan that they were doing the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> guy died of a heart attack and whilst </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they were scanning him </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> while he was dying i assume they try to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> help him actually they're just leaving </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like now hold on let's just get him oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> this date is hold on hold on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> um they did find out that apparently </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right before he died it was the part of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> his brain that was responsible for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> memories was like firing like crazy yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which would although not proven because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's only one instance it would back up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the theory that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> your life </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> before your eyes at least all these </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> memories start flashing right yeah which </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is makes which is one of those things </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> where it's like okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i guess that makes sense because a lot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of people have said that it's happened </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and yeah although there's no way to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> solidly prove it but that's that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> until then it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not superstitious we only have yeah we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> only have testimonies from people who </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have been like near-death experiences </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah right right like you know and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we have some kind of not 100 proof but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> some evidence to indicate that the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> theory holds more well yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's uh we can kill people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> right now basically like right before </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> they just like plug them out they just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> feel like quick get on the cat's game </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> right now edge more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> where they literally edged their life </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> you're not gonna let this guarantee no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just like talking about it just reminded </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> me about uh the time where i kind of got </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> an ulcer i believe and so like have you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you've had a mouth also before right so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how do you deal with it i put like ulcer </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> cream on it okay what do what if you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> don't have ulcer cream like what did i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just don't try not to touch it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> toothpaste toothpaste i thought </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> toothpaste works is that a suggestion </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> okay so like as a kid my mom was just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like oh just gargle salt water or like i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> believe </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> sorry sorry sorry sorry sorry damn it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> sorry i was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i was i was legitimately right about to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> say when you said i was like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how do we go from saltwater to diesel we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have a million </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i would either like gargle </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> salt water or mouthwash and then one day </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> my ulcer was like so bad </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that uh the salt water wasn't doing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anything right yeah so like as like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> teenager i'm just like what if uh what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if uh instead of just doing salt water </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which is basically just diluted salt </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what if i just go straight to the sauce </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and there's just [ __ ] pour salt on it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> uh that i swear to god that's uh so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's what i did i i i just i just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> got some like salt and just poured it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all all over this ulcer and it's [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's standing like nobody's [ __ ] bro </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it sounds like it's not like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hell </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like burnt over in my mouth but then it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of numbs the wounds and i remember </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> waking up the next day and it was a lot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> less painful it started healing straight </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> away now i don't know if there's any </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> science behind this i have googled it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and i know like some other people do it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as well but there's no like i don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if there's any back science behind it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but like after that i started putting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> salt on my ulcer whenever i get a mouth </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> water and it seemed to like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it seemed to heal it i'm sure there is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like some kind of science behind it but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like i feel that's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> probably the more extreme method of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> things like you basically just napalmed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> your mouth yeah the science says you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> completely wrong yeah yeah it could be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> good so i remember one could also just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> be a coincidence </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah one day connor just come into the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> office and complaining about a mouth </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ulcer and i was like i have the perfect </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> solution just walks into the kitchen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just pour a bunch of salt on it it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's easy i do it all the time do it all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the time i remember coming in him coming </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> in like the next day or something and he </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was like gone why did you you literally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just convinced me to pour salt in a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wound that's all you've done didn't help </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> any it didn't i remember it didn't help </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at all really just like it stopped the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> pain for like two hours </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> in exchange for like one burst of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> immense pain yeah but like it didn't do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anything you basically just pre-ordered </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i think that gaunt would have healed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> naturally without the soul and i think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he just poured saul and happens to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> remember that it then went away </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> basically just didn't like ulcer </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hardcore </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> illnesses that go away yeah right like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know obviously in very serious </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> illnesses the pseudoscience is uh very </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> harmful yeah and very [ __ ] up that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people try and sell solutions that are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like you know they'll be like just take </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> our herbs and your cancer will go away </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah like that's [ __ ] up yeah you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> even telling people yes but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i think the reason why with generic </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> illnesses so many superstitions come </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about is because they go anyway on their </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> own and if you're doing [ __ ] and it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> happens to go away you're probably your </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mind is aha i was sick one time and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i i i played with my poop for 20 minutes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in my hands like play-doh and it went </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> away the next day and it's like well no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> now i've got three other illnesses yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you can do things </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> anything yeah do it every single time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you get sick with a generic illness that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> will go away anyway after 48 hours yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then you'll remember that you did </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that thing and then it went away yeah so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this probably happened with like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> vitamin c you probably maybe have a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> little bit of placebo effect as well and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then boom it goes away and you're like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well it must be vitamin c because every </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> time i take vitamin c my cold goes as if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you did nothing your vitamin c </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wouldn't go away but it it's not how it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> works it would go away anyway but i want </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like an experiment of like especially </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with the vitamin c thing of like catch a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cold one time do the vitamin c thing and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then catch a cold a second time and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't do the vitamin c thing which one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you'll see you need to do this like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hundred times to get any data worth </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> considering well there's plenty of sick </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people today </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you'd need the same person over and over </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah even then it wouldn't matter </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> because we could just like view the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> immune system anyway with the things </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that we do we're gonna dedicate my whole </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> life to see if oranges work during the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> flow </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> turns out we don't know yeah science </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> sucks because science is boring as [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it takes a long time and people don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like that yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> unfortunately maybe we can make it they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> want results now yeah of course it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like yeah maybe we can we can go to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> another planet in 200 years it's like oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] i'm not going to be around for that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> so yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's the problem back back to humans </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> are just so incapable of like really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> caring about things that happen in like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the far future and like overwhelming </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that's the reason why we're so [ __ ] with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's not gonna affect me tomorrow so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that's [ __ ] whatever yeah i mean like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i mean we've talked about something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> similar before where like talking about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just imagining five years in the future </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or like where you're going to be five </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> years or ten years in the future can you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> imagine what 2027 is going to be like no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah because everyone thought in 2012 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that 2022 was like yeah flying cars i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> couldn't imagine being 30 and here i am </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for 31. like how the [ __ ] did that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> happen you know i basically did i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> basically dead </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i think same with that exercise right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like i can't i i know exercise is good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> for me yeah and i like it when i do it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah but i just can't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i can't visualize the benefits to my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> life exactly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's why it's so hard to maintain yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's why it's so hard to keep it up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> even though i feel amazing when i do it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i normally have so much energy i feel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> great i know and i can feel the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> immediate tangible benefits yeah but for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> some reason i just can't convince myself </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_00> when i'm 70 maybe i'll be a lot better </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> off for it if i just put in the work now </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_02> you want to gain weight fast oh look get </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_00> the fact that maybe one binge drinking </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_01> speaking of human sucking i uh i saw </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> this recent thing okay uh that uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what a segway i mean because i i looked </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> at this and i thought oh my god humans </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> suck but there was an article that came </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> out uh not too long ago i'll just write </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yahoo who by who's the article first uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's a lot of different articles that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> came out uh all over the place but uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'll just read the i'll just read the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> title of this article because it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> explains everything go for it lonely ape </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> has just launched a dating app for nft </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> collectors a dating app a dating app </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> somebody has developed a dating app </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> specifically for nft bros </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to date nft hoes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't i i think the problem with this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> is is that everything there is or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> but let's now let's i'm going to take a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> second okay what do you reckon the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> demographic of people who have nfts are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay okay jojo esque dating app it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gonna work no no no no no let's look at </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> this positively okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so what you're saying is we're going to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> be removing people with nft profiles </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> from our dating pool </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i think i think that's the positive </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right surely surely </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but that means that we're just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> forcing these kinds of people to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> reproduce </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> should not be allowed to reproduce no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm not saying that but you know </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_02> their cryptocurrency value and the nft </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> collection </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> if i had a dollar for every time i saw </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> an article about something to do with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> nfts that i despised i wouldn't need to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> buy anything everywhere i was like why </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> didn't you probably own it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i've not seen a single good thing with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> an article it's never like nft owners </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> pledge to uh stop global warming to save </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the world and it's like no it's like nft </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> owners pledge to have a yacht club where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> they all wank each other off or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something that's all it ever is it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the uh the nft restaurant thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's are you just making uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are you just trying to make some kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> tangible effect that you own an nft it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> there's some reason there's some reason </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wait so so explain what this restaurant </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you need to own an nft to go into the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> restaurant yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's it that's it that's it that's it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like so you just like you just go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> up to the bounce and you'll be like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's getting to the point where it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> just like classism with extra steps now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> actually it's not even any extra steps </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we've hated on fts like so many times i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i just yeah it sucks it sucks yeah i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> just i just saw that going on i'm like i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i legitimately thought it was an onion </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> article at first because yeah it sounds </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like one yeah i realized oh the sad </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> reality that's a real thing even if they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know they could turn around and when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people back onto nfts which i don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> think they can </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i i just can't see them </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> winning the public faith back in it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> again now yeah since everyone has just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> seen how much of a mess it's been i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't you know and whatever you think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about the technology or whatever you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think about what it can be done with it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you have to recognize that the the nft </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like this kind of landscape that it had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> has become right now yeah such a mess </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ripe with scams [ __ ] up [ __ ] money </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> laundering just every kind of awful </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thing you can imagine yeah it has had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> such a bad public wrap that it would not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> only need to come up with something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> revolutionary that is actually good it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> would then have to win people back over </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> by fixing its image which i don't think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it can because the internet doesn't want </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to to make it more regulated it doesn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> want to make it more it also just they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like how free it is yeah it also just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> seems like that community doesn't really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> care about it either no they do they do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> do they yeah because they push it on to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone and everything well then how </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> come they're not how come they're not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> trying to do anything to better their </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> image and instead make these [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> dating apps and restaurants it's a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> free-for-all right now every company and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> every person is trying to grab a part of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like it's a gold rush right everyone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> wants that bit of it yeah so the reason </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> why everyone is shoving it down </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everyone's throat is because they they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> have investments they want to make sure </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> they don't lose their money okay onto </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the next sucker who comes in too late </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah and it's like it's it's also so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> weird did you see the clip where it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like think i think jimmy fallon like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> presenting his nft with paris hilton </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> huh oh of course yeah yeah it's it's uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is it a meme at least or is it like no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> no no it is serious okay so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i believe i believe it's jimmy fallon </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but uh jimmy fallon and paris hilton uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> well paris hilton was on the jimmy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fallon show and they started talking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about nfts and how paris hilton </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> convinced jimmy fallon to buy a broad </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> ape nft what a nice scenario </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's so it was so weird because it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like i've never seen a clip of two </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people more out of touch </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with like the wider world so they they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like like so jimmy finally brings out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> his like he's like bored but it's bought </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> april that's the name yeah yeah he </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> brings out yeah the monkeys yeah he </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> brings out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and he goes isn't this beautiful look at </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this it's amazing and like you can hear </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the audience clapping i've seen this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> image i thought it was a meme really no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> no no it is a real image on the picture </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah and i've i've never heard such a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> applause where it was so obvious that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there was a big light saying applause </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> please because you could tell the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> audience had no idea what the [ __ ] they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> were talking about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> another massive problem with the whole </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> nft landscape right is that it benefits </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the people who have big platforms right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> if you have a big platform it's free </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> money for you that's why people are </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> doing this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the moment something is advertised to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you as you should buy it is the moment </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's too late for you anything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know the moment that consumers are </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> seeing big names promoting it it's too </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> late to make money yeah some people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> might make money the majority of people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> are not going to make money no and the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> majority of people are going to lose </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> money and the people who get money are </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people like jimmy fallon people like uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people already range </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people who have the platform the power </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to push people towards their investment </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's it's a glorified pyramid scheme in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> many ways right because it's like how do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you get your money by getting more </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people into it yeah right it's it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that's how it works and that's why </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're seeing like when i tweet anything </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or men or or mentioned in anything nft </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it doesn't matter what the comment is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> these these verified nft accounts like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everything with the with the phrase nft </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in it yeah they don't i could be saying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> nfts suck and they can gargle on my nuts </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and and someone who supports nft will </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like that comment just because they've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> googled nft and they like everything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> because they're trying to get followers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they're trying to get engagement so then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> they can push it more and have more </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> biggest fear of influence what if they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> just like gargling or nuts they might </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> call themselves they probably probably </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> do yeah they do yes please </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i hate it i hate it so much because it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> obviously a scam like the moment that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you are being </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> advertised to about buying an investment </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> is the moment that you've you've already </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you can't make money and i think that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> what's so [ __ ] disappointing as well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> especially with you know as you said </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like big influences right like getting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in on it like [ __ ] you know when i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when i saw that like eminem bought like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> an nft of just what looks like a monkey </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> version of himself i was like why would </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you do that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because never before every childhood </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you have a big sphere of influence it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> just free money exactly and in their </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> eyes it's low risk public image because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're not asking your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you don't have to it's not like you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> begging your followers for money but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what you're doing is making them pay for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> something yeah that makes your thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> more valuable it's heavy incentivizing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> right and and you can claim </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> just that you it's just an investment </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like buying a stock it's not like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> buying a house it's not like buying a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> stock it's different right there's rules </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> around buying for reasons right yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> even though </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> sometimes the rules are a bit [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah still </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i mean like passionately about this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and i i hate the system so much well i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like the the only thing i have to add to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is like do you think this negative </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> image is purely you know it's purely </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> based on like the western circle and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just like our perception of the internet </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> definitely because because like i've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> heard like of like nfts have a very very </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> different perception in like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> japanese circles and uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and you know the japanese especially the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> art communities as well because they see </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from what i've read at least they've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they they have a much more positive view </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of nfts and they see it as like an </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> opportunity to of course give uh you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know ownership to artists and stuff like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that which is a lot you know given the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cultures i understand why maybe japanese </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people would be more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> more accepting of this idea because it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like for japanese people and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> japanese artists it's a lot bigger </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> problem than it is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm awful giving rights to artists and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> whatnot but you know i feel there are </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> other ways that you can do it if the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> systems were you know properly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> implemented not to mention that in japan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like you know the the whole copyright </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> laws in japan especially are just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on the next level of outdated yeah right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like it's so like i think if anything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the reason why japanese are gonna yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> of course of course the japanese are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gonna look at nfts and things like oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> this is perfect like this this gets </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> around everything that we've believed in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and done in like a really cool way that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> supports artists like more more ways to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> copyright [ __ ] yeah [ __ ] yeah bring it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> in yeah yes please that requires the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> good faith of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all parties involved though yeah like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everyone has to be using it correctly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah and the problem is is that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> they're not english we're definitely not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you know and there is there's some very </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> valid reasons to to own nfts or bitcoin </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or any any of these currencies right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like if you live in a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you're like a russian person right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> now and all your money was in the ruble </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah you're [ __ ] yeah like your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> money's gone yeah you just don't you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't own much money anymore if you had </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that all in a bitcoin wallet yeah you'd </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> still be very wealthy right so that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> makes more that in those scenarios it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> makes a lot of sense problem is it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> kind of replicated </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what the fine art world was before </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to like the big private investors right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was basically fine art it was this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> glorified </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> money </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> money laundering and money </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> transactioning thing right yeah and now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in the west people figured out huh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you can make a lot of money and money </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that you can hide very easily </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> by doing this nft [ __ ] and so it's kind </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of turned into more of a democratized </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fine art </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah [ __ ] for people right like uh like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the whole uh you've watched like tenant </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> did you watch tennant yeah i watched </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> tenants you know like the art that was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> held in the um </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> in the airports because it couldn't be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> text that's actually real thing i know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's a real thing was that a major </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> part of tenant that was a big uh plot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> point and tenant is where they steal the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the they steal the artwork and all the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> valuable stuff from the airport uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> holding uh the tax haven in the airport </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> clearly this movie really made an </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> impression on god </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i just remember things going backwards </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like that's like things looking cool </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that's like the first time in like media </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that i can recall that has like told </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> people that these things exist yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> people didn't know these existed before </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> um you know it's just was that a massive </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> part of tenon i feel like i would have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> remembered that which scene which which </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> scene was this in was this in the first </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> scene i don't remember that i'm never </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> gonna know the full [ __ ] playlist of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> ten and i don't know what [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> happened i just like they had a big </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> there was a big plot point about them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> doing a heist </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the first half of the movie </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was there oh my [ __ ] the only thing i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> know is that the one's been wrong </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he basically did oh my god </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when he dies like his life doesn't flash </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> before his eyes just 10 at the movies </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i remember them being in an airport but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't remember them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> pulling another one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> why were they in the airport </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> why they're in an </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> airport </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe uh they were getting a flight or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something no they were investigating the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they were this is a complete [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> tangerine because they were going into </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they were investigating the phenomena </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right that uh that you know the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> phenomena where time moves backwards or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> something that's that's all i remember </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ish i can't remember they're stealing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> something they're just holding because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and in the holding places they normally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have art because you can't we could </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> basically buy and sell in this area </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because it doesn't yeah yeah it's not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> under any jurisdiction yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> taxpayer right so you can no i i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> remember there being pain i remember the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> paintings there i just don't know i just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't remember that being like a massive </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> part of the plot point but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was just like it was like i brought </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it up because it was like the first time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it had been addressed or like brought up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in like uh prominent media yeah um well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> these things exist yeah well they've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> existed for like a very very long time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's not just like fine arts but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like and like it's not just paintings </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> any valuable thing like after stuff in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the british museum </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah that's normally the place where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they come from you know like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the point was is that it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i just think with the way that nfts are </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> structured right now it's just this is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this was obviously going to happen yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was it's just been ripe with scams </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like half this [ __ ] is awful like yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's some legitimate uses the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> technology seems somewhat promising </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right now the fact that it uses more </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> than like most countries the entire like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bitcoin network uses more electricity </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> than countries </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is very concerning yes um </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and that there are more you know they're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> making new coins they're making new ways </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that are much more efficient and stuff </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah we get it but it's not there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right now yeah it's not it's not doing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that right now it's not working right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> now in a way that works for the world do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you think it will never work out yeah it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> definitely will at some point obviously </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the idea of having </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a way that you can 100 own something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> digitally is going to be very convenient </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> at some point yes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> [Music] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> right now it just doesn't the way that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's being used is like a joke no i mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like it's weird it's weird seeing how </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fast they just came from like basically </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> nowhere to everyone talking about them i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> mean crypto because it's been just so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like it's just been shoved down every </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> once in a while </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah it was literally last year where i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> had not heard of the word nft until like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> may or april and then i couldn't stop </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hearing it i was like i remember being </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like i mean i only found out what it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like a couple i'm on the [ __ ] podcast </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> podcast yeah yeah i'm i'm so envious of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because i i think i just like yeah i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just avoided all that [ __ ] i don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> follow anyone who is now there's the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> metaverse that's coming along </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> well have you seen that these companies </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> are buying like space in like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> metaverse they're buying like plots of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> land in the metaphase yeah yeah i've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> seen that yeah so they're why they're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> buying digital land yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> dude that's like i mean i feel like it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is just that's some sci-fi territory i i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> feel like the past year uh has opened up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> basically the age of like the digital </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> gold rush is this what it must have felt </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like to see like the dot-com bubble i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> think i think i think so that's that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's must have been what it felt like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> where you see millions of [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> dollars being invested in the dumbest </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] yeah yeah in like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> fuckingkittens.com or something like i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> don't [ __ ] know and now kittens.com </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> is worth millions yeah right i don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know if this is true but you're in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> metaverse right they don't have legs </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have you seen that no they don't have uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> they only have two like torsos this is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> very much similar with me with nfts i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> know nothing about the metaphors so do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> do you know why sort art online by </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> facebook yeah yeah that's all i know do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you want to take a guess why they only </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> have torsos in this world why is it for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people who perhaps are in wheelchairs </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and stuff like that or it's a very noble </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> thought yeah unfortunately it's not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> maybe inclusive </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you can fetch this actually but to my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> understanding it was to stop people like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> doing like implying sexual acts and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> stuff and doing things </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> from what i understand from what i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> understand that is the reason why i mean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it is like i read somewhere that like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> foot fetishes are like i think the most </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> common fetish in like like the world </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what's going to do with facebook </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because of the legs but it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> digital feet it's like yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i was just master chief i was like are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you going with this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> features </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> them sims feet though </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> delicious why didn't they just delete </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the feet then if they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just have no one for you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> everyone just looks like kirby you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> just stubs and knobs apparently it's a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> technical issue like the cameras can't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> capture the whole body mm-hmm [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't think is there anything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mentioned about sexual stuff </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> can you google sexual mark zuckerberg </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> metaverse no legs </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so apparently uh as well there's like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you have like your own bubble you can't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> come into your space </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but to me it's weird right because i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> don't know if i'm just like stupid but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it just looks like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> really [ __ ] vr chat that's what i saw </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and i was like so is this like a game </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that facebook is developing or just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> looks like vr chat but just less fun and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> uh like vr chat has really good games in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it have you seen this no there's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> games in vr chat and it's nuts i was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> playing super monkey ball the other day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh wow in vrc yeah vr chat how were you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not sick i don't know i guess and there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was also like i could sing playing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> regular </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like a tron game where you throw discs </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they bounce around you'll dodge it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that's pretty cool i hit the other </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> person it just seems like a vr game in a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> vr game yeah so it is and there's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's a whole cooking game right in a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> vr game and it's like free it's like why </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the [ __ ] would anyone want how does vr </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> chat work i never because i've never </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> played vr chat but is it is it like kind </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> of like an open source kind of thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where people can create </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> their own their own games and their own </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> spaces and stuff like that oh okay it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all user generated okay that's why it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so [ __ ] good it's like yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because you'll be in a lobby and yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> does it is it annoying that you get in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the lobby and there's like 10 year olds </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> screaming yeah that's annoying and i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think mark zuckerberg is trying to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> address that by making it like age uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> only like i don't know over a certain </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> age allowed to join yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but vr is still really good like it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's genuinely good so okay so so going </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> back to the whole like buying digital </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> plots of land on on meta okay right like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> how does that work </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like what i don't know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the question of why well if you own </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> digital land it's it's like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> metaverse is being marketed as this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> place that is kind of like just a new </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> virtual reality world that everyone's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> going to go to right so you can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> literally live like a second life or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> even like you know your online media </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> life </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in this virtual place that's called the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> metaverse so what are companies doing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> they're literally buying plots of land </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in this virtual land for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> treating it like they're blind they're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> buying real lands that exists in the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> real world </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> this is just lane this is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> legitimately scary you want to hit like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the most depressing thing ever please </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> investors are playing paying millions </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for virtual land in the metaverse </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and um apparently uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> uh a company recently dropped 2.5 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> million dollars on a patch of land in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> decentral land one of the most popular </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> metaverse worlds and the prices have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gone up 400 to 500 percent in the past </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> few months how much land are we talking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like how many digital how many digital </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> square meters are we talking i don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fully understand it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> another person uh spent 4.3 million on a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> parcel of virtual land </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh my god um i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> oh my god is this what happens when you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just have too much money yes i think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> this is what i think what's happening is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that a lot of companies with a lot of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> money are like let's just throw </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> something into it all right if it fails </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it doesn't matter if it if it goes up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> tenfold big money right yeah i think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's what's going on and i think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people in companies are hearing whispers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> of it and i think i i also imagine as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> well that facebook is doing a really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> good job at convincing these companies </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh yeah that that this is going to be a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> big deal yeah when i feel like anyone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who is in the tech space </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> looks at metaverse and is like i just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't see how this can become a thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's like good yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> because how the [ __ ] are you going to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> convince everyone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to get a virtual headset do you know how </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> annoying they are to i'm i love my tech </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and i gotta admit virtual reality </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> headsets are a pain in the [ __ ] ass </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah absolutely well it comes with the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> uh assumption that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> virtual reality headsets will be at one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> point more streamlined than they already </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> um which they really really need to be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because like the barrier of entry for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> our virtual headset is like [ __ ] done </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> great obviously yeah that is facebook </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah and that that is probably the most </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> user-friendly headset yeah but it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> still like it's not perfect it's not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> perfect </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you don't want to have a business [ __ ] i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> do not want to have a business meeting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> without a [ __ ] headset on it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> honey where's my headset i need to get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> into business one of the main pictures </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of like the metaverse like you could </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> have a a meeting with your co-workers </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have you had a virtual reality headset </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on for more than two hours no it is i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> have it's awful it's it gets </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> sweaty it's like it's bulky the only </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> reason why i haven't done a stream on my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> oculus is because i can't wear that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thing for more than 20 minutes without </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> feeling sick </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that's what it also it also depends on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the game yeah because i remember like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> remember hearing about these rumors that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people get motion sickness from wearing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> headsets yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> superstitions </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> superstitions now i'm just [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're not sick and i'm just like they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> must just be weak-minded i ain't like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that i remember like the first time i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> got like my uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> valve index uh one of the first games i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bought was like uh pavlov i think right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it was like the it's like the basically </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a virtual reality cs go okay yeah and i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> remember </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> walking in that for like 10 seconds and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i just got immediate [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> motion sickness like like my brain </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> searched through like my the entire </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> history of humanity to like see if there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was any any kind of experience that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> could like help regulate what i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> going through and it was just like yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> nope i don't know what's going on right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> now you're just gonna you're just gonna </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> feel sick right now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like the thing is i get motion sickness </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> even if it's like not a very like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> movement intensive game like i get i get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sick after like 20 minutes of beat sable </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah and like you you're not even </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] moving in that game yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i'm i'm totally fine in the motion </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> sickness part yeah i've only had one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> one game that's given me motion sickness </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah or like my emotions like make me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> feel like oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah it was like this ninja game santiro </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> or something yeah like you jump around </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's pretty sick but like you you jump </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> in the air yeah really [ __ ] high yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you can change direction in the air </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> again in any direction oh so you can </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> imagine it's like jump up fly back and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's it's yeah i'm getting sick just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hearing it um but it's good um but i the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> thing that i have difficulty with is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> these headsets are not light yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they're uh they are uncomfortable to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> wear </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah yeah yeah the index i love the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> index amazing great piece of hardware it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is heavy and also the wires can suck my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> dick i hate the wires yeah um what i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like about the oculus there's no wires </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah like the thing the thing is that i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> can't play a virtual or i haven't been </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> able to play a virtual reality game more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> than a few hours before either like my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> head gets tired or i just want to chill </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> out and i just want to like because like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i start sweating a lot because you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wearing i swear yeah yeah you you start </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i mean like you were basically wearing a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sink on your head </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's not comfortable at all and like i i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't think i don't know if this is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> just like booming me talking but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i i can't see it being a real substitute </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for just face-to-face interactions to me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> at least no it won't i mean like you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know again like in order for the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> metaverse thing to really pop off it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> needs to be like vi headsets need to be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> common enough in every household as much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> as like say a computer is today right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and i just don't see it happening for a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> while the oculus just isn't it isn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> quite there and it's also expensive </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i think the oculus is 300 bucks yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah and yeah that's that's uh that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's steep for a lot of people yeah um </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i think you know if you look at the the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the progress we've made in the past what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 10 years when did the htc revive come </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> out that was the first big one wasn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the first big yeah what was that when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> did the htc vive get released nationally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you can even look htc what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i thought it was the oculus rift was the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> first like real </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> big one that's the first one i heard was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that like the one that was with steam </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yes that was that's the oculus rift that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was like the the og oculus rift that was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> before facebook facebook with the mouse </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah htc vive was unveiled in march </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> 2015. okay what about the oculus rift </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the original yeah the original oculus </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> rift was along with the roller coasters </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah i thought the the htc vive was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> the first time vr headsets became like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> somewhat vulnerable like a thing like to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> play games like seriously </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> watch 2016. oh okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> know i could be totally wrong i don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you could google what the first vr heads </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i think it's fair to say at least to my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> memory at least </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that i think the htc vive was the first </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> headset that came out that like made </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gaming seem like it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> made sense yeah on that on a it wasn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just a gimmick it was like you could </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> actually play games like super hot was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> amazing uh some of the demos are really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> good and there were games coming out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> here and there that were pretty good as </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> well yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no you know i think we thought there was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> going to be a big boom </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it there really hasn't been it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> just many games in the past seven years </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just because the money isn't there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> right now because it's so hard </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's so many barriers of entry um for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> buying like a vr game so like the only </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> big game i can think of is half-life </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um that's that's the only like game </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where i look at this vr game and it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like stands up as like a game game you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know it's like a lot of games that i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> play on on vr it seems like a tech demo </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> with like it seems like a glorified tech </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> demo but like half-life actually feels </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a game and that's because you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> valve like invested in it and i don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even like i can't believe they made </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> profit on it at all like because i feel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like that was more of just them flexing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to be like guys we still made games </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> remember remember remember we made games </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we were a [ __ ] real [ __ ] amazing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uh game developer back in the day we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> could still do it we could still be good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we still got a video i played a lot of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> games on the vr and super hot is still </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> probably the best yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's the game that i get when people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> come to my house and i'm like you want </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to try out yeah super hot is the game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah try this yeah because it's so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> good yeah it's so good super hot and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> beat saber which is the best vr </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> experience i've probably had yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> so far it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i understand because like setting up the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> valve index is like it's the best </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> headset right if you want performance </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah gaming </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but my god but like i i i think the k </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> one it is set that thing up and you need </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> a space big enough yeah which is another </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> reason why it like in japan is like not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> popular at all no yeah i think my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> problem with vr gaming that i've had so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> far is that it turns gaming </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uh for like for me gaming is like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> passive activity but vr gaming is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> definitely an active activity for me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where i you know you feel physically </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> involved it doesn't feel like i like it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no i i do like that as well but like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when you have like a [ __ ] eight-hour </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 10-hour gaming session i don't want to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that that's like there's only so long i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> can have yeah i can do something active </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right for that period of time like to me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> a lot of games are a passive activity </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where you sit down on the couch or sit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at your pc you just like chill there i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> think it also depends on like the the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> demographic as well right like because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm sure like you know the average 10 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> year old has a lot more [ __ ] energy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to move around for eight to ten hours </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah yeah versus like you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> someone who's in like their 40s when i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> played a gorilla tag </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah it's just all like 10 year olds </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah it's all 10 year olds well like you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know i think back to like when i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> well i think back to when i was 10 and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> the [ __ ] uh you remember the i toy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the camera on ps2 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like when that [ __ ] came out and you had </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to like physically move around and [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like you know that like as a 10 year old </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that's like [ __ ] yeah i could do this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for hours if you got me an eye toy now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'd probably be like an hour and a half </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and i'm done yeah without that to me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that was always like a gimmick you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like that that one time you go to like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> your cousin's house and they pull out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the ddr map and you're like oh okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we're having a ddr virtual boy yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah right right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> matt that like barely registered yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like yeah you got a [ __ ] stamp </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> after like one like like one use or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> something it's a shame because i think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that like vr gaming </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> is some of the most </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fun and rewarding gaming </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there there's no incentive for people to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> develop games for it like it's hard and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> also it's like you know when you're a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kid and you i don't know if you've ever </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> had them uh i don't know what they're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> called in australia but in the uk the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> brand calls like uh scale electrics it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like the you know those cars you have to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> lay out that track yeah and then you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have the oh hot wheels all right maybe </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> kind of like hot wheels you lay out the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> track and then you have those things </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that like you turn the buttons and they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> around the [ __ ] thing what are they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> called and what's the generic name for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> them i think you're right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like that that's what vr feels like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it needs to get to the point where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> current gaming is where it feels like oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> did you put on the headset you're good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to go yeah right now it's like i have to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> turn on the two base stations i have to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> make sure all the cables are plugged in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh i gotta install this update oh the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> tracking's off i gotta fix the tracking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like it's such a it's like going </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> back to that feeling as a kid where you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> set up that that track you set it all up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just for that like 30 minutes of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> enjoyment yeah and then you got to put </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it all away yeah so like and until it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> gets to the point where it doesn't feel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a slog to set up it's not that it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> active i think i think it's it's it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a pain in the ass to set up and i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> know it is i've got mine set up now to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the point where it's as painless as </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> possible and it's still a pain in the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> air yeah like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that five minutes of me turning </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> everything on and doing it all it's just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a little bit annoying for my my lazy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gamer brain to want to do well because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you're so used to just the the turn on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> immediately start yeah right right yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that makes sense yeah uh it's called </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> skeleton uh that's the brand of yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah yeah is there a generic name </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> for that kind of product or i think it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just motorized cars yeah just like that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah you know how like as a kid i think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we had a really dodgy one and it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> just a whole event setting it up yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah it took so long yeah but like you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> as i remember as a kid you had way more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> patience you know right like not not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> even as a kid but as a teenager as well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you know like you know i like you know i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> tell people about the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh the [ __ ] efforts i had to go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> through to even just [ __ ] watch anime </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or play some visual novels and you have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to you have to like download like seven </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> million zip files </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> three tutorials about how to like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> install this game </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i think back to that now i'm just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> man imagine like imagine trying to do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that now we can just press one button on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> steam to like play play a lot of these </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like japanese underground games and all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that well even like console games right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like you had to like go into the bin to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> look for the cartridge of the game and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> then you had to [ __ ] put it in oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's not working pull it out blow on it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> a little bit put it back in turn it on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wait for it to load now you just [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> turn on your switch and the download </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> game is right there yeah but like i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> thought i mean i buy my games cartridge </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah oh really yeah i actually give them </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to my like other people when i'm done </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> with them oh okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but like a big thing that i've kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like felt recently is that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like i've kind of like thought what is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> the direction that gaming is going to go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right what because i've uh i've recently </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> procured myself a playstation 5. i know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all right hello guys i know i know oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're the lucky few yeah the lucky few </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and the reason i did that was entirely </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because i was like i'm not gonna i don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> need a ps5 yet i don't need a ps5 and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> horizon uh forbidden west came out and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> horizon zero dawn is like one of my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> favorite games of all time so i'm like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> all right this kind of deserved the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> special treatment i'll try and go out my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> way to get a ps5 in order to play this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> game yeah and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the game looks [ __ ] amazing it looks </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] fantastic right um but is it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is it that different from playing it on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> a ps4 i wouldn't really say so you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i i i feel like hyper realism in video </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> games has almost reached the limit to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the point where it's like yeah we can't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> get any better graphics don't look that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> much different yeah yeah um like eight </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> years ago yeah they don't they they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> can't get any better than this like i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> remember jumping from like i remember </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the first time i got my n64 and i played </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> super mario 64. and like my mind [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> blew yeah it was like i was like like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> running around in 3d after </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> after 2d mario or all this time like i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> could not comprehend yeah i was such an </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> experience </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like up is forward </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what how does that work </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and and now i'm just like i think there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> are extra pixels that i'm that my eye is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> seeing right now right i feel like you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> have like a 12k like tv like yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i feel like it's a bit smoother because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there are slightly more frames but it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> only it suddenly isn't like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> mind-blown kind of experience that i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> felt before but that's what i'm saying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like that that's why i feel like we've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> almost reached that limit when it comes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to like amazing graphically how games </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can be and that's why i feel like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> especially the indie scene for the past </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like 10 years has been more focused on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> making these more like stylized games </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like pixel games and stuff like that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like you know what i want back i want </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cell shading in games back </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can we have that back has it ever left </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i think it's like it used to be in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> forefront i feel of like all the main </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> line games or like the main streams </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the way it was i think so i think for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like certain demographics like you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like when like wind waker came out for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> example everyone [ __ ] hated it at </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> first until they played and they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> realized how amazing it was yeah i i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> remember when everyone when wind waker </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> came out and there was so much </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> discussions in like magazines to be like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is a step down </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like this is a graphical step that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what the trend was right it was realism </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> really yeah it wasn't real and then and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then when we started getting used to the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cell shader [ __ ] like with um what's it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> uh lollipop chainsaw is like another </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> game series that's like very cell shaded </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> very stylized right yeah people were </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> also like oh man this game looks </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> too [ __ ] weird like it's it's it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> pretty enough and then people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> immediately when they played the game </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they found out oh you know what this is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> pretty but just on a different caliber </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> of pretty yeah i mean like i would say </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like wind waker has aged the best </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> visually in terms like i i i would argue </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like pretty much every zelda game yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you know i mean i think it looks better </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> than pokemon and the best thing yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> exactly and the best thing is those </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> kinds of styles a lot of the times are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ageless yeah like like a cuphead yeah oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah exactly or like you know like wind </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> waker looks just as good in even in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> today's standards because it's so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> stylized whereas if you go back to like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know uh ocarina of time right you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you're like you're like oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> not as pretty as my 12 year old my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> background i thought it was a fugly game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah it's not a pretty so if you have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the context you know the setting and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> stuff it makes sense of course you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people who say like you know with all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> those n64 games who are like no no it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> looks just as good today or obviously </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they're just operating off nostalgia </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah right but like anyone can look at </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> mario 64 and go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] me that's an ugly game yeah you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know yeah it just think mario's foot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> looks kind of good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you see compared to like ocarina well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah like if you look at something like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> goldeneye goldeneye looks awful oh that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> looks beautiful </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you know and ocarina of time i think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it looks awful i don't know mario 64 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like i i don't know why i think it looks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> okay it i don't think it aged as bad as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you might think i think you you should </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> probably take like a closer look i have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i have i have because i was bouncing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> looks like [ __ ] okay i'll give you that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> bowser looks like [ __ ] the peach in the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> opening scene i'm just like ah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> what is that that is true actually </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because when i when i think of mario 64 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> for some reason i go to mario sunshine </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah because that was like i guess my my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> childhood marriage yeah yeah i remember </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and mary sunshine has aged a lot better </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> visually visually than mario 64 million </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> times better yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah because uh with yeah i feel like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that generation of games like um </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i wouldn't say ps1 because like i look </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> back at like metal gear solid one and i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i look back at like pixels talking to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> each other like snake's face does he </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> doesn't have detail it's like one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> triangle it's just a triangle and i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> remember thinking how the [ __ ] did i get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> invested in these cut scenes of the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> snake going articon and it's just like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> pixel going </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know but like i i feel like the ps2 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gamecube era was kind of when we started </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really getting to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> getting to the point where i couldn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> see that much of a big jump in graphical </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fidelity yeah yeah and then afterwards i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> did see a difference with ps3 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ps3 to me is when it kind of like peaked </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know where you know what last of us </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> originally came out on the ps3 right and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i was just like i to me like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> original last of us </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like pretty much every game looks about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the same as last year yes you know even </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> though i could tell they look </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> graphically better they're not that much </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> graphically better that i think my god </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is a [ __ ] mind-blowing amount of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> improvement yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he looks pretty bad though </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that's because the wii had like very </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> limited hardware where are we in um </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> isn't it 480p the wii u i think i think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so it has a native resolution of 40. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah and it's just upscale yeah it looks </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> rough when you go back and play it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're like oh because i remember as a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kid when super smash brothers melee no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> uh brawl came out yeah remember i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thought dude this is like the pinnacle </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i thought i thought that was a twilight </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> princess yeah insane yeah and i looked </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> back like a like a year ago and i was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like what the [ __ ] it looked like that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the entire time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i think because i'm i'm remembering the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> rendered cutscenes for that game yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah the cut scenes look amazing yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> because they're coming because of course </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> they're [ __ ] yeah but i think with in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the case with that generation of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> consoles like the wii i think it depends </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on the game as well because like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> twilight princess still looks great even </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> though that's a wii game that's it i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think it still looks great i haven't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> liked it but the competitor i think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> every single footage i've seen try </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> princess of late has been the uh hd </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> remix </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but if you look at it comparatively like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a lot of these like hd remasters i don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really see the point of calling them hd </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> remasters because if you put them side </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> by side they're really unless you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a [ __ ] you know pixel snob like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're not gonna see like you know when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> uh final fantasy 10 remastered came out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right like the hd remaster yeah i played </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it and i was like how does this look any </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> different to the ps2 version oh it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like did you just did you see the uh the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> gta </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> uh three remastered no that was a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> disaster really it was like the game </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> load worse </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> did you all see this i didn't see this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it was like a massive controversy no i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> didn't say this at all they like took </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> off the original grand theft auto and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you couldn't buy it right the original </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> third one yeah and they were like you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have to buy the remake they they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> reversed it a little bit i can't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> remember exactly what they did </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but they released this remake and it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> looked worse than the original it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like they just turned like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> smoothness option on like everything had </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just been smooth right right people just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> looked even weirder in the cut scenes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and all of it looked have you not seen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the oh okay let me quickly grab a few </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> images and show you i'm going to type in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh grandpa auto </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> gta 3 remaster </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um images images </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> comparison </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> comparison okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah so like look at this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is the original and this is the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> remastered </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that's gross that's just uncanny yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's also yeah um there's so many </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where like it doesn't look </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like that much better yeah yeah it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i i i'd say the original has more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> character to it yeah yeah a lot of the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cut scenes the characters just look </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> worse yeah it was really weird i just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> don't understand but that's the thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with like again that's the thing with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like hd remasters right like when they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> did this theory master of wind waker i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this legitimately looks no different it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> still looks just as good it does look a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bit crisper yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it's very minute though i would say </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> right like like you know compared to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like final fantasy vii and final fantasy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> vii remake right like you know yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> exactly like you know that's that's a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> big that's a big jump yeah it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> jumping it's a different remake and a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> rematch right right it's true well yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they just kind of like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> upped the contrast and smoothed it all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> out and made it probably just higher </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah higher higher resolution but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like it's like a style it's so stylized </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah that like in terms of like actual </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> graphical updates or upgrades it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's not something to write home about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah if you look at the images it just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> looks like the edges are smoother yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like rtx has been turned on well you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know you're not going to see that big of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> a difference when you're playing the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> game it wouldn't make a difference </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> experience play in the game not at all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i mean i guess that's talking about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like the graphical differences as well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but in terms like gameplay differences i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> feel like the gaming industry as a whole </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> has just like optimized pretty much like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 90 of everything they can that can be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> optimized and you know every so often we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> get something like uh breath of the wild </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that completely changes the way you look </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at like an open world for example yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and now every open world game has a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> glider for some reason even if it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> doesn't need it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i feel like the technology is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> less so focused on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> making the things very uh high graphics </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> or making the textures more advanced </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like i think right now a lot of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> technology from what i understand is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> focused on like um like the the lighting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and stuff right so yeah making it so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when you put a character in a world that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you can add all of the effects naturally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so instead of having a beam of light and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you programming like the light is here </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you program the room and then you have a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bunch of options to like turn on the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i've got the name of the lighting thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is it's like it's like lighting where it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> uses like the calculations like figure </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> out what would happen if like a ball </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> went in the way yeah reflection stuff i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> think that's where a lot of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> advancements are being made not so much </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in like the individual </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um like assets makeup because yeah the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> models that we have of characters in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> games are very very high quality oh they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> are yeah and they have been for a while </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah the only thing that's left is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> making how the models interact with the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> world </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> more realistic if they want that or you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know whatever they want to do and so now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's about making the machines that can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> do these animations or do these things </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> built in and do them smoother from what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i understand i could be totally wrong </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> someone might correct that that's what i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> want to know right it's like what's the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> once we've perfected that hypothetically </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> what's the next step well that's why i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> do look to vr because i do remember the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> first time i tried beat saber and the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> first time i tried superhot i did get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that same kind of feeling that i got </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> playing super mario 64 for the first </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> time which is just like your brain has </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> never experienced something like this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> before and it's just [ __ ] pure </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cocaine it was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like the first time i played super vr </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was like it's like one of the funnest </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> gaming experiences i've ever had yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like period absolutely but like that was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that was an hour or so or however long </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it took me to play super bowl there's no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> big games in vr actually yeah they're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> all really good like one to three hours </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where's the next mark where's the mario </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> vr game dude </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i want to mario vr game where i am mario </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it means that movement is limited </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> movement yeah you if you let like mario </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kart vr was mario kart v yeah yeah it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> could be i think there are racing games </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> in vr well they did it in uh they did it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in mario land so why can't they do it in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> an oculus that was not very good though </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that wasn't very good but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know what i mean right like if we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> get like a mario kart vr </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i think right now like movement is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> really hard yeah and when movement is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> realistic it's not good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that's not what you want right but also </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> if you add unrealistic movement to your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> character it becomes really hard to make </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it feel real like that game i mentioned </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where you jump around yeah you don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> jump around you just point the stick and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> press jump because you can't do that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> movement there's no i can't i can't jump </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> in my [ __ ] room like an engine right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i wish i could you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i want to be on the sidelines watching </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that yeah i wish i could i will never </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> get bored of like the random [ __ ] every </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like random clips like that sometimes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> get recommended on my youtube of like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> grandma's trying vr for the first time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and like them doing like the balance </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> beam game or something just like jumping </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> head first into a wall jumping </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> [Laughter] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or like the grandma who like oh i think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was a grandma or grandpa who did like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the the climbing one and uh they like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> slowly fell </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like they fell into like a table or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i know there's some places you can do it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's like an activity </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the vr headsets that the cables go up to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the roof yeah and it's like a treadmill </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you're standing yeah yeah yeah yeah like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> an omni directional oh yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah you can't have a gun and then you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like run around </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i know if there's one place in shinjuku </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i think you can do that really yeah with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the treadmills </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i know there's a few in america yeah it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> looks really cool it looks really nice </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really i like to try that out yeah like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> imagine it's one where it's like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> trampoline that gives you like feedback </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> based on how much pressure you put on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the trampoline or something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kind of thing yeah because like i feel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like you're in gravity and the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> trampoline gets stiffer yeah yeah and if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like less you know you're on like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> swan planet like yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that'd be cool i don't know how you do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that because like i've heard like one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> technique that people use to combat </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> motion sickness in vr games right is to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> literally drinking uh vitamin c </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> eating a [ __ ] ton of oranges eating a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] heart pouring some salt </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in their wounds </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but uh also actually just like walking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like walking in the spot you know like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like just literally just literally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're like just moving your legs to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> make it feel like you're walking and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's just weird that that just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that is enough streak your brain into </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> thinking oh okay this is this is real </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> walking now i can understand this right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i've never done that before i should try </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it i should try that i don't know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i mean like it's it's vr right now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at the very new stages i'm very </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> interested to see </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how and like if if gaming gets to a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> point where this kind of does become </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> mainstream and we get some like actual </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> aaa games with vr games because yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it seems like a very overpriced piece of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> tech for a lot of tech demos </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah that's a shame because i really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like it i really want it to evolve </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but i think it's going to be where i i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> think it would be really sick and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mainstream for like another 10 years at </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> least i'm just waiting man i want sword </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> online </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm going to be jamming in vr when it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> out man oh yeah yeah i want to be that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that dad that is like in like doing his </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> pc stuff all the time playing games i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm going to be that dad of course of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> course we're going to be the generation </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when we're retired we're like oh finally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i can get started on that back catalog </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> of games right yeah aren't we getting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> close to the year that sword arsenal </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> line was set now as well 2025 i think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah something like that i mean it could </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> be done just like i don't know how i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> remember just like just hook a wire up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> to your like pc or something that like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> electrocutes you if you die in the game </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like you actually just like gives you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like a like like a shock </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it gives you a lethal voltage if you die </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in the game like we could just do we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> could probably do it now we just don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because we're scared of what we could </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> create i'm sure there's something we're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> scared of in advancements in technology </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> 2022 so this year oh this year actually </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> is this year let's go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i i actually read i think they're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> releasing like someone's releasing an </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> mmo the first vr mmo </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> oh my god it's real it's real it's real </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> we can barely make good mmos </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> now i hope i get selected as a beater </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you are a better chance </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but yeah i hate to date the video but uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i just want to talk about this one thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> uh that i saw on twitter this morning </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> right uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> [Music] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> old news by the time so probably all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> news by the time this comes out but i </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_01> what i'm not even joking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he has joined face clan as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> faze snoop </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> okay okay what do you think about okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> okay i might be out of touch here yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what is a face client well like i know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> face clan but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't know facetime what are face clan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like like what is a phase called what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's um you know it's a it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> originally a youtuber organization and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> now it's an esports organization right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah and then so so they always had it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> was back in the day when cod started </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah that's how it started i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> followed it then but like they've seemed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just gone out of that little bubble i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> don't know what phase is anymore i don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know either are they just like a like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> youtube house </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no it's like a brand and you know if you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> if you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> anointed interface anointed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> united interface you get uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you do genuinely get a lot of success </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah it's a very powerful brand </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah with younger audiences normally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot of people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> our age watch facebook are they still 15 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> 16 yeah are they still an esports </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> organization or yeah they do everything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's kind of like a brand you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> there's okay that's kind of what that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that's it's like an agency yeah so it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from what i understand it's more of an </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> agency right but but all of the esports </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> brands </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are all kind of going that way right now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because they realize that relying only </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on esports is not the best for business </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah because you can you know if your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> team competes only four times six times </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a year that's you you have to you can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> only monetize the sponsors and then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> those events yeah whereas if you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're an entertainer you can monetize </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> every time they upload or do something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i mean now it just seems like a lot of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> esports organizations are just streamer </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> organizations because that's that's what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i feel would like with phase phase clan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> now i'm just like are they still the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> esports organization or the uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> entertainment i always thought it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like amazing i always thought it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like you know kind of like uh factioned </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> off whereas like these like we have a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bunch of face clan members who are like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the esports players who don't go on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> twitch or youtube or anything yeah and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then we have the youtubers and then we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have the twitch streamers and then you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> know well a lot of the time as well they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they want to get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the the best players in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> a game or a genre because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> normally the best players at any game if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they stream they will have an audience </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> not necessarily always but they've a lot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> better chance of getting an audience </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right right you know yeah you can kind </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> of help them and coach them through it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> well they're definitely going to get a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bigger audience now now that snoop doo </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> double g has joined i don't know for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> some reason when i heard that i'm just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like that doesn't sound surprising to me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't know why i don't know why i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just like does some interesting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm sure the deal is very good for snoop </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh yeah i'm sure it's an extremely good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> deal i'm sure he needs the money </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> well to me has the same energy of uh do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you remember like back when you know uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when e3 happened and you'd see like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> these press conferences and then like at </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> every like e3 presentation they'd be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they'd have this like run one random </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> celebrity come on to promote their games </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like i don't know like [ __ ] drake </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> promoting madden or something you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what i mean yeah that it has the same </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> energy as that for me it does yeah where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you just get like this random </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> whether this random celebrity to promote </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> your brand or to your game </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um and it wouldn't make any sense but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you know i just it makes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it it makes sense because it's so it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> such meme worthy that people are going </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to talk about it anyway oh yeah of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> course and sleep dog has done plenty of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] oh yeah yeah yeah i mean he's so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> amazingly in touch with like internet </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> audiences and just meme culture that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like he's it's just like a win for him </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just i don't know there's something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> weird about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this is something weird about when he's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> always we have to call him face snoop </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> now he's always posting on instagram and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> stuff and all that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and he like like doxed his uber driver </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or something what he like doxxed his </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like delivery or door dash person yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because they didn't like deliver the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> food right he like showed a picture in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> their first name </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to all of his followers oh my god </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because he was shown the interaction </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that he i think super dog was upset that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they didn't deliver the food and i think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> snoop was trying to tell him where to go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all right because obviously snoop lives </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> gated community right it's probably a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> bit harder to give it to him yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and he was like complaining on his </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> twitter and showed the face and name of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the person and this guy got like a lot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> of hate i think jesus poor guy poor guy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't know just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for me it's like really fascinating just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> watching these like very </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> traditional celebrities and like music </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> artists and whatnot like kind of really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> dig their heels into things like twitch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and youtube and stuff like that you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like when i found out like you know </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> really regularly i remember they wanted </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to perform their song but they couldn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> for copyright reasons yeah yeah that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that sounds like it sounds like the age </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of the internet yeah right copyright </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> laws are broken yeah no like i remember </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like when uh </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_00> yeah when like gordon ramsay replied to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> xqc or something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about the cooking thing that that was so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> surreal </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't think that's called i'm pretty </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sure that's just someone managing his </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> account but i think gordon has very good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> people in charge i don't know because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gordon's pretty active on like tick tock </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right he's pretty active on like social </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> media platforms </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that he's he's he's keeping up with it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i think gordon has a very good team </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> zoomers </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like teaching him and telling him what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> to do because like in this in one of his </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> videos he just kept talking about uncle </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> roger and i was like you obviously have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> someone who's like keeping you in touch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and telling you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> well obviously yeah we've talked about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how whoever they've hired for like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kitchen nightmares um titles on youtube </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> right yeah like top ten times the food </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> was busting yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like that was like an actual youtube </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> title like what is happening </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and it worked it worked it got so many </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] views yeah it's like a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> decade old show now or something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the people running </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> his accounts are like on top of their </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] oh yeah i i i don't even want to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know how much the kitchen nightmares </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> youtube account makes cause i've noticed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> as well the youtube kitchen nightmares </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> account </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> literally just repost the same clips </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with different titles and different </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> montages all the time really they'll be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> chopped ten times the burger was good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then i'll then next we'll be like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> top ten times the food was good and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> they'll just reuse the same clips yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah so they just keep making different </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> lists and then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> timeline there i always got time i would </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> even if i've seen this clip like 10 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> million times before all right how </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> awesome is it actually i gotta find out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> nightmares </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> oh my god and i think another one was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like when the food wasn't busted top ten </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> times the food wasn't busting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> right kitchen nightmares gets </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on average or uh fluctuates from </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> anywhere between </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> 30 to 70 million views a month holy [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's probably in the range of like uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it could be anywhere from like a hundred </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to two hundred grand a month well yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> knowing how well food channels do yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's probably two hundred thousand two </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> hundred </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> dollars yeah which is what which makes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> me wonder why don't more reality tv </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> shows post as many [ __ ] clips as they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> possibly can well because a lot of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> production team are out of touch or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe some copyright issues </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> probably a mixture of things also </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> probably a lack of faith that they'll do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> well yeah yeah you know kids nightmares </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> brand is still very strong </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like what what show were you thinking of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> specifically like pretty much any </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> reality tv show i feel like big brother </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like 90 day fiance yeah you know like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> any basically anything made by tlc </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like [ __ ] the bachelor like [ __ ] like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that like i feel like reality tv in like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> especially reality tv was meant to be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> watched in a group well tlc uploads </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> clips </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> all the time that's why they're so they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> do so well because they upload all the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> clippable moments that's that's how 90 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> day fiance got big to begin with right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it's because the clips went viral i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> would like i i wonder if it would do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> even better on like if they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not only uploaded whole episodes but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like uploaded a whole episode uploaded </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> clips uploaded like [ __ ] montages </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like with the kitchen nightmare things </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_01> this kind of content is just infinitely </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> recyclable because it's content that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're gonna [ __ ] watch whenever you </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_00> obsession or yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> coffee animal i like smelling butt holes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> thank you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was it like what was that show like my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> weird my session </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> gets me every time i'm just like there's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no way someone actually does that and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and like gross the one thing that makes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> me cringe the most for some reason is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it was this one british woman who eats </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> concrete </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh yeah yeah yeah and it wasn't the fact </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that she was just better than british </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> food </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that is a british delicacy right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> developing a strong jawline with that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> one yeah yeah you told me they were like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> why do legos have do not eat warnings </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and british food doesn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [Music] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> validate that's true no it was just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the noise that it made when she was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> crunching oh she was crunchy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i can hear she have any </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you know that feeling where you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> accidentally get sand in your mouth and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't know it's just the worst problem </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [Music] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> feeling alone that feeling i understand </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> anakin for that one for that one moment </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where you accidentally get sand in your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> mouth and you just spend the next five </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> minutes just like oh there's just a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> weird crunch in there yeah i can't get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> rid of it i think maybe the reason why </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a lot of like you know shows like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that reality tv shows don't post clips </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and full episodes i think it's because a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> lot of they're like this is just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> speculation but i'm guessing a lot of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the producers and the production </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> team and the people behind the actual </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> show still have some level of faith that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people still watch tv like they used to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> back in the day and so they're like well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean we're still getting numbers maybe </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> not as big as you know back in the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oughts but you know people still </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> watching tv i also imagine that maybe if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you're producing a lot of shows i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> imagine there has been a lot of shows </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that just lost because they didn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> archive them properly or they didn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah they didn't they don't have the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> files or they they have them they just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't know what which one's which i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> imagine there's a lot of that going on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> probably </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> copyright you know like maybe the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> production team made it and then sold it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to a network and maybe the network </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> doesn't have the rights and the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> production team doesn't uh maybe they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> also don't have the rights for them and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm sure they didn't build those </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> contracts you know with the clause of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like oh you know if these go on youtube </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then we hold all right sure they do now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot of networks pretty dear but i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> don't i don't yeah but like a show from </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the 2000s probably not </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_03> like with like every single genre right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it doesn't matter yeah i remember when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> netflix is like an occupation this is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> probably a reality show </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you watched that one no no there's a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> glass one there's a glass blowing like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because there is like competition i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> watched like the full series i don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> know why did i have like the reality tv </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like interviews it was like masterchef </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with glasgow oh my god and they had like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the archetypes of the glass-blowing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> judges they were like the you know like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the gordon ramsay the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the nice one the mean one i can't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> believe he just said that about my face </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> [Music] </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_00> everything like that yeah but like you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have now 30 minutes to make your your </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> glass it is literally like a master chef </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but replaced with glass blood oh my god </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it wasn't that bad because it got blown </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> away yeah blown away </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> blown away how many seasons have you got </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> let me see </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> oh yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i remember when like netflix was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> just [ __ ] out like five </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> documentaries a day and now they've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> they're like shutting out five different </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> reality tv shows today </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i've got a season two and no game no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> life didn't like what the [ __ ] i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> surprised that like every single </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> death in the us hasn't had a docu series </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at this rate like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everything has been covered at this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> point yeah honestly i just don't it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> crazy like i watched one the other day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> about like some uh grandma who uh was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> killing people in her house and i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> how are they finding this stuff who's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> finding this this is insane why was this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not televised earlier i feel like i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> should know about this grandma are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> killing people this feels like a yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like a tv show plot yeah this happened </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> on tv would be like unrealistic </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> obviously you don't watch enough true </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> crime documentaries or true crime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> podcasts or channels </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the obsession sometimes you're watching </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> true crime you're like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and then you just get this moment of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like your your consciousness going don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you think it's weird that you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> watching stories about people being </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> murdered and they're just shoving </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cameras in their face and interrogating </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people to tell tell us how they felt 20 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> years ago when their family member died </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like do you not get that when you watch </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it yeah definitely i feel like i get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> these moments i'll watch a full series i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> won't get it every now and then i'll </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just watch a series and it's always with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the family interviews where it kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> makes me think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what why are they just making these </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> family members just like [ __ ] talk </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about their [ __ ] and cry on camera </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh like they're like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i loved him and stuff and it's like it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> genuine right and i feel like these </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> these poor people who like yeah didn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ever want to talk about this again have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just been shoved with it because they're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> probably when someone was like here's 10 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> grand talk about your dead cousin yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and how they were close to you and how </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was suspicious that that one guy who </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> never got caught was you know that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> brutal myrtle that you saw in front of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> your eyes recall that yeah word for word </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's just the same formula as well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i don't know it feels like we've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> turned it into a sort of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> location like yeah we've glorified </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> murder and stuff and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah that's scary i feel like like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> because sydney i've talked about this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> before but sydney listens to a lot a lot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of like true crime videos true crime </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> podcast whenever like she's doing her </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> makeup and stuff like that and like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> every so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and then david trapped sally in her </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> basement for two weeks and brutally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> her before </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> her </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but before i get to the next point i'd </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like to bring up my sponsor for today's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> video nordvpn and i'm just like brah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what is this right now okay like i i get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it like you know like the you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i don't know if these guys like i don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> even know if an expo i know rainbow has </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sponsors and stuff like certainly i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> understand like yeah i get it but it you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have to admit it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is it's so jarring when i just hear </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> about this this like i love channels by </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the way i love your guys's videos </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but there's but there's right and wrong </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> places to put it i don't know it's so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wet i don't think there's ever like uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> unfortunately the topic i think just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> doesn't lend one yeah it just doesn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> land well but like there's there's been </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> weird transitions i mean we've done very </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> many weird transitions in i'm sure in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> our careers with like just transitioning </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to a uh sponsor that we've had for this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> video </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the berserk thing one time right we were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> talking about the passing of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh oh yeah and because the way that we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> recorded it uh there was an ad break </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that was put right in the middle of us </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> talking about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something that we looked over um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but there's yeah it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> not any like true crime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> true crime youtubers they're i don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know i don't think there is a right way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to transition from some of the stuff </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> they talk about to an advertiser yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> every time i hear it it's just like it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> just takes me out for a second it's just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like we've i don't know in a way i i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's totally fine and i don't think it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like bad i'm not condemning it no i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not condemning it i like i like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> content yeah but like you have to admit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> sometimes you're watching it and you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like it is strange how we've turned this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> into like it's it's like the common </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> common day watch mojo yeah we've turned </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in like that we've turned murders into </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what we we like top tens used to fill </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> whereas top 10 used to fill that i'll </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> just put anything on kind of thing yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> just like murder and horrible acts just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> let it fill the void somehow </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like there's a there's like channels i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> surprised watching mojo hasn't gone into </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that yeah there's top 10 like girls </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> who've been trapped in dungeons </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's probably something i know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's people who do their makeup and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> talk about true crime that's a call yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah yeah i've seen that a lot yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> which is also a strange evolution but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> impressive it's like get ready with me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> while i talk about this it's horrible </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like cool </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like next level mukbang right but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they're just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they're doing makeup and they're talking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about true questions i want to see a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> mukbang where they talk about true crime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as they're like just demolishing your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> pilot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i bet you're saying this i bet it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> already exists </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't give nicaragua avocado any more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> ideas man don't don't come on nick is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> publishing a live true crime whatever </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> he's doing his body is through [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> crime that's the true crime documentary </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's true crime what he's doing is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this digestive system jesus christ yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean again like i i watch a lot of it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i consume a lot of it but i do just get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> those moments where i'm like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah the reality hits right yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it is weird especially where like i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> thought about it the other day and i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like i don't know anyone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> in my immediate circle or relatives or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> anything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where somebody has had like something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> really horrible happen to them or a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> murderer i don't know do you know anyone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a cousin who knows someone who's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> been murdered or something like that no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> not when it comes to murder and like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this this true crime stuff almost kind </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> of like normalizes it in your mind i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> feel like that this is a normal thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that happens i don't think in fact it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> isn't normal no and i think it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> normalizes it it just desensitizes you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to it yeah well i mean it makes you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think that it is a normal thing that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> happens really i've never heard of like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i've never listened to true crime and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thought it was a normal thing that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> happened like you watch it these are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> real people like yeah yeah these people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> these interviews this could be your this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> could be your cousin this could be your </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> mom like this i think i think it's the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> gravity at which they address that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> particular topic where it's like they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they say like oh yeah so uh tim got </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> murdered like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the same tone as like yeah so i met </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> up with bob the other day you know yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like i think yeah i think the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gravity of the situation is often lost </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah in in the content because there's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so much content like that yeah yeah the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> content is king and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah and i'm not saying that i want to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sit there and feel traumatized every </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> single time i watch something about true </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> crime i just think it's kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> interesting and worth talking about the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fact that we don't consume it and we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> empathize </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> necessarily always yeah i mean it is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> entertainment in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in a sense right it is entertainment we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> do we don't watch it to really how can i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> say it's really s </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we don't we don't watch it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to not sympathize but we don't watch it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> people don't watch these kinds of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> documentaries and cry at the end of it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> right is what you know like they don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> they're not like oh my god i feel so sad </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for these like families start we watch </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> out of morbid curiosities yeah like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> there's there's a sense of morbidness to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it where we want to know the gross </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> details did curiosity go though that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the question that's the question well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that's when you start getting into the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> weird [ __ ] right yeah yeah and uh that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the part where it's like oh okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah to the point where it's like oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> true you liking true crime documentaries </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> is nothing compared to like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> some of the weirdest stuff you're into </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sometimes i wonder like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i think i'm consuming this content wrong </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> because i've watched some things where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it'll be like a documentary and it'll be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like oh yeah like a kid got like beat up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> by his parents and no one helped him and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then the kid died and it's like i have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to like stop for the day yeah i'm like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have to like take a yes i have to like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just step back and be like [ __ ] yeah i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can't do anything but then people will </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> watch like tons of these and i'm like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm wondering like what are they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> experiencing that's different from me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah like that that makes it so that i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> walk away from this just feeling drained </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and exhausted yeah and they're like oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> next one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> one thing i found really just want to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> know like yeah one thing i found really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> interesting is that japan doesn't have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> any programming like that no they don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they don't i've noticed that yeah and i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> think it's because it's taboo yeah it is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it is taboo to like bring it back up and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> talk about it and especially like you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know i can't imagine a [ __ ] tv </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> program being like knock knock knock hey </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> your son got murdered 10 years ago talk </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> about it like you know like they want to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> respect the families right yeah it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like not saying that you know all of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> these like two true crime documentary </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> makers have no respect on the families </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or whatever but it is scarily like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it is it feels invasive at times yes it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> does </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it feels very </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> intimate yeah and it's scary that no one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> who watches that kind of programming </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> second guesses </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that invasiveness but also i understand </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> maybe if somebody was your family was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> murdered i can also understand the the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> opposite where being able to talk about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it and express your faith </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can help you get like grieve and help </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you kind of get the story out there and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you feel like i've told my case i've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> told people what it is and i'm sure both </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> sides yeah and i'm sure you know the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ones who think that oh if i just talk </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about it on camera and get it off my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> chest and let people hear it it would </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> make me feel better they're the ones </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that turn into documentaries that's why </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i kind of get worried with these sorry </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i've interrupted like three times in a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> row now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the final time i promise i promise </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> unprofessional i know i remember what i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> said like most of the time i had like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> point and it was gone and i was like oh </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> connor let god [ __ ] you speak </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you know that's another thing addressed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> him i think a few of them here and there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is like this is where i i start to get a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bit weirded out with true crimes when </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> there's the true crime investigators </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> online that go around and then start you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know pushing buttons and sending emails </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and asking people questions who don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> want to talk about it it's like i think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> people have it right board warriors </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> keyboard investigation detectives what </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_03> i needed i don't feel confident saying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> about it i need to go and check </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> what it was on netflix there's one where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this guy was basically like like in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> charge because the police weren't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> helping that much but the police have to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> go through you know systems and right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they don't always do the best job </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> obviously they have to go through the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> procedure this guy kind of like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of steamrolled in and was like i'll </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> help you family i'll be the detective </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it was kind of weird watching this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> documentary what was the family like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they were like oh yes they liked it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they were in a vulnerable spot you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this guy was selling them the thing that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i can help you know that's not cool but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but i think the guy genuinely believed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he could help i don't think he was a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> scam or anything because there was no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> money involved he was like i will help </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you but it just felt kind of weird okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i was about safe like he was like i'll </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> help you solve the game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he was like an internet guy who's just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> really into true crime and he was going </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about being like i will solve this i'll </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> help you do it okay [ __ ] i need to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> figure out what this is i've i have a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> such a vivid image of this guy i don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> know do you do you think that's morally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> correct to do or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it might have been um i don't know it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> really depends on the situation because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was this guy deluded or did this guy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> actually help out i don't know what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> grounds i guess what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what uh from what has described what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> grounds did he have to uh come to a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> family and was like i can solve this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> crime did he want the clout </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right so the next time he's on a true </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> crime </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so uh you might have heard of this case </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that was me it's from tiger king 2 oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's this guy who was like oh yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm i'm definitely certain that uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> carol basking killed it yeah i'll help </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the family and stuff i'm just weird it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was just like this guy's clearly just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> inserting himself yeah in the situation </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he just wants to be part of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> storyline it's just like it was just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like i just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i don't know just leave it up to the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> professionals yeah like to me i think i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> get too invested in true crime stories </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is why i've never fully like been </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> into true crime uh because like i i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> would hear some of the stuff that sydney </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> listens to or something and sometimes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> they like actually play like the 9-1-1 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> call that is made about this crime and i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> hear this [ __ ] and i'm like i'm just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like fresh out of the shower ready for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> my day or something and i got like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like like a kid [ __ ] crying on the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> phone telling like the police that her </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> mother's been murdered or something i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like and then you immediately feel dirty </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm just like sydney i want to cry now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> can we not listen to what she's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> [Laughter] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> how far have you guys gone with like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> your morbid curiosities right because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the internet is a wonderful but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sometimes a terrifying place where you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can see anything you want to see yes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right um and i know a lot of people a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> lot of kids went through a phase where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they they stumbled upon like the darker </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> sides of the internet right like you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know because i'm not even gonna pretend </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to sugarcoat the fact that like yeah you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know at one point when i was in high </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> school someone was like do you know of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> this thing called tor and i was like no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what's that and so i downloaded it and i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was like oh it's a gateway to the dark </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> web </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you know i spent an afternoon one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> afternoon on tour you know going through </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the dark web just to see how [ __ ] up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it was and uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can confirm that's a [ __ ] up [ __ ] on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> there yeah cause like for me like i like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i didn't do anything like no no no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i didn't enjoy it joey incriminates </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> himself i didn't do anything i just i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> saw a lot of things that i probably </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> shouldn't have seen right yeah like like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> even to me like my baseline i could not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> go on like if i see a live league thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm clicking off that video no no i just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i just like i've never had that kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> part of myself where i was morbidly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> curious enough to see something that i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> probably would regret i can live the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> rest of my life not seeing this i've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> seen the worst things on twitter </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah that's i'll be honest </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> with you the most [ __ ] up videos i've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> ever seen have been on twitter actually </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's true some </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really [ __ ] up things and i'm i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> thought you were just like being </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> facetious there i thought i thought </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i thought you were just like oh i had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this tweet i saw the other day like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> friends like like people who i i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> followed and i knew they'd like retweet </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and be like oh this is horrible it's a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> video of like some people getting shot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and stuff yeah yeah yeah i've seen that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] why are you sharing this yeah i've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i've actually seen that as well i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> thought you would be physicians to be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like i saw this tweet the other day and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> said that demons better than jesus </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> oh my god </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> [Music] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i definitely saw the most haunting stuff </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> being shared on twitter yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> twitter is very slow to get rid of this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> stuff yeah yeah it's nearly as good as </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> other platforms </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and uh yeah all the [ __ ] [ __ ] there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> man i yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah yeah i've never been on net </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i've never been on the dark web i don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really have an interest i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> don't weirdly enough like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the stuff i saw on the dark web just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like just based on like what you see as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> an image or whatever is not as [ __ ] up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as some of the stuff you'd see on like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> reddit the second page of google i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just i'm kidding </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no one talks about kidding yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no it's just like i think it's just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i think the thing that's like [ __ ] up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about the dark web from my experience on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> going on it is just like there's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> conceptually a lot of [ __ ] up things </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah like when you read into it it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like oh how about you people buying </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> drugs </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's like ninety percent that's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the people selling an ftc </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know there's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but like you know there's like a lot of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> other stuff you'd look into and it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like oh where it's like okay i probably </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> didn't want to know that that was an </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> operation that is currently functioning </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right now it's somewhere out there in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the world you know levels are [ __ ] up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> whereas like you go live link in twitter </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like you're immediately exposed to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> something that's like oh that's oh i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> shouldn't have seen like i didn't want </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to see a guy's head explode on live leak </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> but i just did yeah well it's just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's one of the few times that a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> video like that or a picture has like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like gone through the cracks you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's just like it's never not been </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> haunting for me in like every way shape </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from like i remember every [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] up thing i see because i see it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> once and i'm just like that is now like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] ingrained in my mind and that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> would be a point where i'm in the shower </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i have like a [ __ ] flashback to that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> video i'm like my day is just infinitely </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> worse and i'm just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but there's a part of me there where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like i know this is reality and i know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the internet is filtered so yeah it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is more friendly but like there's a part </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of me where i'm just like i don't want </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to be desensitized to this thing you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> know because i know i i've met some </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people who are just like you think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's baby [ __ ] i've seen the real [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i've seen the [ __ ] up [ __ ] i've seen </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the snuff film why and i'm just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to me like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i like being sensitive to this stuff </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right because this [ __ ] is it grounds me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah this [ __ ] grounds you and like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> true crime stuff as well like to me at </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> least like to me i don't want to be too </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> desensitive to the group to the true </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> in case this happens in my real life and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i know someone that has that has </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> happened </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that it happens to you i don't i don't </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_01> some person comes up to you and says </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like oh well that's that's some [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] i've seen the more [ __ ] up stuff </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm like that's not a brag </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> and you won't know which one it is until </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you click the link yeah yeah and uh in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the 2010s that was a game people like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> kids used to play you know like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> remember some of my [ __ ] high school </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> friends or like you know in a skype call </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> back in the day was like you want to do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a little bit of red 5050 as if they're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> inviting me to like a minecraft server </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you know like it's like yeah yeah it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just casual gaming you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and uh you know poor naive me the first </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> time around uh i was like no what's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> reddit 50 50. biggest mistake in my life </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_03> don't wanna i don't wanna i don't wanna </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> talk to you guys ever again for letting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> me sit through that because i was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> horrible </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and uh yeah and then it became a big </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> thing on [ __ ] youtube yeah which is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> why i feel sorry for like like the one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> of the worst jobs i could imagine is the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people who work for moderate rate of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> feed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> nice [ __ ] stuff right yeah yeah you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> have to have to have to go through every </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> video that's been flagged oh yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> in facebook </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there was a video i saw of like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> something it's not it was a vice versa </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah yeah yeah like like one of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> these people who had been interviewed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> they had to like go through that job </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> seems like the worst job on earth it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just like completely desensitized like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just hearing them talk they're just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> apparently yeah obviously you'd have to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like go through a bunch of uh really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> horrific views and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really uh [ __ ] up really right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> opinions i think i think yeah apparently </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a lot of them would like get really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> desensitized and become like really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] up the more they do this job i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> think i think it was that vice </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> documentary where like the girl said </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that like oh yeah once you apply for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this position you just like immediately </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like get therapy yeah like it just comes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> with the package it comes with the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> package yeah that there is a therapist </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like maybe on slime maybe online i don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know but like a terrifying thought i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> know there's a job out there that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> immediately requires you to have therapy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah we're kind of like you they need </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the like they're they're the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> real heroes oh yeah there needs to be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> someone out there that makes the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> internet safer for people like us that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't want to see that on our timeline </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> otherwise you know what's the difference </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> between the normal web and the dark web </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> at that point right like yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> exactly just exactly the same thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> exactly right i just hope they're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> getting treated [ __ ] fairly and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> treated well and getting paid well i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hope this is a [ __ ] horrible job i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> hope they get the best [ __ ] therapist </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's a that's a sad thing right my god </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> if they don't have the best [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> therapists on the planet like jesus </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> christ it's not worth </SPEAKER_02>
