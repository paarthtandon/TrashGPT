<SPEAKER_00> you've done a lot this past week </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but i took like a nice little like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> three-day break yeah and then for some </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> reason like do you ever go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> do you ever do you guys ever feel like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you get off the grind for just one or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> two days you just forget how to work </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i come back home and i'm like all right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and then i just sit on my desk like oh i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i get more motivated to get back in the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> grind i'm like i'm like doubly charged </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> oh no i get that sometimes as well but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like if it's especially after like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> long because you know we've been on the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> grind for quite a while now because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> we're you know preparing for the tour </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah you know which i guess by the time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> this episode has gone up we should have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> finished by now yeah i think but as of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> us right now we're still preparing for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the tour so we have to make a crapload </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of episodes for you guys um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's been you know really busy month </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then suddenly because of connor's </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> got a week off and i'm just i remember </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the first day i was like what do i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i i it's isn't it sad i've almost </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> forgotten </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how to take a day off yeah because i i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> told myself okay i'm gonna take a day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> off yeah in reality i did not take a day </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> off yeah i just worked less because like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what happened is uh since since we've </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_02> episode one stream then another two </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> episodes another day um and then connor </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> connor yeah that's three i guess </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> basically </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i think i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i mean technically technically a stream </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is an episode because that goes into the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> afternoon you know okay four episodes so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i counted those four episodes </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> schedule or throws off like this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> momentum that you have i don't know it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really weird for me do you have like a </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_01> okay first time it's almost like it's a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> real job </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_00> just waking up and being like oh [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i've got stuff i need to do and uh it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's it's weird this this has been a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> very weird time for me guys and i'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> transitioning and i'm transitioning i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> remember when i was just like one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> channel is like more than too much one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> channel is too much and now it's just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> about placing your efforts in the right </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_02> working on the things that you need to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> be working on yeah yeah exactly yeah i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't know it's also just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i i find it easier to work on things i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> passionate on so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> when i'm passionate when i'm passionate </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> then i find it hard to concentrate on </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_02> i cycled across hokkaido with chris </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> um </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> seven hundred and fifty kilometers or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> something whoa nice </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> over five hundred miles and how much uh </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_02> three hundred and sixteen thousand </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> dollars nice </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and deficiency foundation oh yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] incredible i mean two things </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that shocked me when i saw that tweet </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> about when you guys finished one was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> obviously the amount of money </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> which is crazy yeah two the fact that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> chris survived yeah yeah yeah yeah well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> so you know obviously spoiler alert </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> chris is going to come on the podcast </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> again so i'll i'll talk about it mainly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> from like i suppose my perspective and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the stuff that i was dealing with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> because right i'll let chris talk about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the other stuff oh how he dealt with his </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mother i mean you know chris's credit on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> the on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> later days chris is doing better than me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i was really yeah i mean i was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> powering through the first few days i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was doing great chris was having a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> miserable time yeah yeah and then you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a lot of the time with cycling and stuff </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like you learned you learn a lot of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> things when you do it days in a row like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i feel like the shin nami kaido we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> didn't actually learn anything about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cycling no of course not because you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just do it and you're done and like you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> could you can you could cycle for a day </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> with a [ __ ] bike and not know like cause </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all of our seats and everything was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> completely well we learned how not to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cycle yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> her number one comment on the on our </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> cycling special was like you guys know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like your seat was too we didn't know no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we did we did we know nothing about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we're not cyclists yeah and you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like so like to put it into perspective </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like the shin nami kaido uh the thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that we did was like 75k yeah but we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> might as well have done it on a tricycle </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah yeah it was literally a clown </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> bike </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah and like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i think on average we were doing 100 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> plus kilometer days </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like every single day and there's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one day we did like 65 but even then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the weather conditions changed the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> cycling right right because you guys are </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> up in the mountains and you know i feel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> oh yeah it changes all the time right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then i got this [ __ ] backpack on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> my back so i i i you know when i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> quit because the reason why this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> happened i'm sure we'll talk about this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> even more again when chris comes on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> chris was you know lamenting to me about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how he wants to get fit and stuff and i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was like bet let's actually do something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like let's let's do something like let's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> do something crazy yeah uh and i was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like i really want to go to hokkaido </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> again because why the [ __ ] that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i just love hokkaido honestly i think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's my favorite favorite yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's awesome </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i i wanted to do something that would be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> pretty tough yeah so i thought that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cycle again like on a map i think about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this i'm like 500 miles like easy i can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> do that because like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cycling is tough but ultimately </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you just wake up early it's not that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hard </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> [Music] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> wait wait wait wait wait wait no no i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't know what i'm saying is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> if you want to do site like cycling </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cycling like you want to get places and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like actually do it good yeah you you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't have to wake up that early so what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you're saying is secret to winning tour </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> de france isn't about training </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> there is like you can cycle and you can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> cycle at a pace that pretty much uses </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you don't go out of breath you don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really use your muscles that much it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> kind of like your natural rhythm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> resources </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah you just your natural pace that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> comfortable for you on like a flat road </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that will get you to your place if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you've set a reasonable distance like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i was going to ask like were the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> majority of the roads flat </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> well i mean i'm sure there were some </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> inclines yeah i mean sometimes you get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> lucky and it'd be flat but then i mean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like i'm talking like because my only </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> other point of reference is the shimon </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> amikaida right yeah i mean there was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> some brutal hills i mean like you've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you've driven on the roads in japan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right yeah sometimes the roads just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't end yeah yeah and they go up like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> there was the worst one we had a few </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> really bad ones but the worst one was it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was um seven kilometers just uphill </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can imagine yeah how long that took </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and then it was like seven kilometers </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> downhill which is like [ __ ] epic and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> then you're like this is the best thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ever yeah because it just does it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> literally just doesn't stop right but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's crazy because like that kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like elevation it's like we've started </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at the ocean and as you're you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> climbing up at some points you can see </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the ocean and you are crazy high up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right right i think it was like uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was like 500 meter </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> incline yeah yeah which is just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> crazy yeah you can just like bike up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that i don't know i learned a lot i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> learned that your bike seat height </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> matters a lot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i had mine um so because you have to oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> dude as well another thing that i i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> guess that would be fun to talk about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> dude trying to get your bike </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like transport it yeah is a nightmare </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really well because how do you how do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you oh yeah because i guess you get bike </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on a plane </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> is it just over-sized luggage it's in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like the special luggage okay so you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> just like go up to the counter and but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you have to pack your bag which is a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> nightmare yeah you have to pack the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> bicycle um like so chris i was lazy and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i bought a bag that you just take the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> front wheel off it's super [ __ ] easy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> comes off and then you strap everything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> in place right and i think to get on the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> plane a a recommended deflating the tire </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so it doesn't pop yeah yeah yeah i don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> think it'll actually like pop though but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i i just did it anyway yeah yeah and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> then you will shove it in a bag i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> vastly overestimating this it took like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> an hour to do this and you get oil </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everywhere it's so [ __ ] i hate this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then you just check it in and then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the whole time on the plane you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> panicking because you're like this is a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> carbon fiber bike it's going to break </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's like everything's going to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] go wrong right it's [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> terrible and even then like going back </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> before that it's like all right i don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i don't own anything to cycle um do you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> want anything to cycle well not since </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the schumann army kaido but we bought </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like the shittest shittiest amazon </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> basics yeah yeah yeah yeah that was just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how cheap can we go to sleep </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> because it's because it's still padding </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> on my ass </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> aren't the exercise bikes like really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> well padded i mean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> they are but like you know if you're on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that thing for like an hour or two which </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i usually am yeah then like after a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> while you're just like [ __ ] man my look </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i've got no meat on my ass all right so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> after a while it just like goes directly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to my bones and i'm just like my pelvis </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> is screaming because you have to get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> used to that yeah of course </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're also like dummy thick back there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah i think it makes it worse </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> though </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> music </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> what okay so like this is because we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> again i mentioned offhandedly to chris </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> so like i guess i'll go through the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> timeline oh yeah this is interesting i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't know if it isn't whatever i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mentioned to crystal like let's do this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i want to do this why the [ __ ] not yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and i thought like chris would say no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because you know when you have a crazy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> idea and you're like it's crazy if i say </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it to someone and they say no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> immediately yeah because then you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like okay i guess it is crazy but if you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> say a crazy idea to someone they're like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're like oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe it's not that insane right maybe </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we can like do this yeah and so i was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like you get a video i'll live stream </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the whole thing </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> four modems uh live broadcasting tool </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and now it's got a pc fan how the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> do i power all this i had a really big </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> battery it turns out that really big </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> battery can't go on the plane to go to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wakana so then i have to call up the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hotel and i'm like hey can i ship some </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> stuff to your hotel right and they were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like yeah all good so that was all okay </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_03> have all these problems so i had to lay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everything out in the bag like with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> velcro so it's all evenly distributed so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that it's not just weighing me down and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> killing my back yeah yeah yeah perfect </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> done so then i'm like all right i need a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bike </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [Music] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm telling you man one of the hardest </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> things on earth is trying to figure out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a good bike yeah online it is like when </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you look online it's like what is good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bike and it's literally like i bought </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> this tour de france bike for fifteen </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thousand dollars it's pretty good but if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're a more budget option we've got a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 9k bike here for amateurs and it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what the [ __ ] is any of this like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> literally every time i try and buy a new </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> camera yeah it's like cyclists are so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like insular with their like suggestions </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and stuff yeah yeah yeah you know these </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> sunglasses they kind of deflected the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> micro wind uh you know in like a 0.3 you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> know and the uv with the 0.3 speaking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> english it was just like i just didn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> understand anything yeah about cycling </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah and there's a guy called josh in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> japan who was really great and he helped </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> me out and he basically he cycles a ton </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in japan he just gave me all the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> suggestions told me to what pence to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bought i bought new cycling pants that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> had like uh straps straps that went over </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they were they were awesome they were </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> great i like didn't chafe at all it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> great they stayed up all the king was a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> pain in the ass because i have to tip my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> shirt off every time i want to pee </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> again it was so expensive because i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bought like a pretty good bike right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah i bought a bike it was called </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cannondale synapse 3l it's like a 4 000 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bike all right yeah i was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> government if you're listening i'm never </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> riding it ever outside of this one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> charity event um so it's a tax write-off </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> please please but yeah so it was just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a month of crazy prep and getting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everything ready yeah yeah just hoping </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like how do you test this like i can't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> go to wakana in the middle of nowhere in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> hokkaido and test if this works yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> exactly so like i'm [ __ ] myself yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and i'm in like in basically like sudo </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> russia in japan you're in the middle of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> nowhere and like just day one you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like you turn everything on and you just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hope it works and yeah some things broke </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right away and you're like [ __ ] like our </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> tires we didn't like inflate them </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> properly and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um stuff wasn't working and i had to um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so another thing is that it was for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> charity yeah and i wanted there to be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> text to speech on my speaker for all the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> donations coming through so i thought </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that would be fun yeah incentivize </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people and also i'm gonna be cycling </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like all day like nine hours but i have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> something to keep your mind occupied </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah my mind like numb yeah and um so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like turns out that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> uh the charity service i was using </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> tiltify </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just doesn't let you do text-to-speech </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in any way really there's no way you can </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> do text-to-speech with it uh through </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like stream labs yeah yeah yeah um </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> stream elements anything it doesn't work </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and uh so shout out to stream elements </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and my uh one of my mods i just asked </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> someone's like hey could you make </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> something you should program something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that will read text-to-speech so both of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> them made things so stream elements just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> made a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> plug-in just for this charity event wow </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so that i could have charity donations </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> come out on the speaker right in like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> three days shout out to them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so many people helped like yeah like my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mod who's just uh rode who's awesome who </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> manages our subreddit as well he made </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a live tracking thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i saw that yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but i i i can't really use this in day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like normal streams i don't want </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone to know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [Music] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yourself it's literally like doxing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> where i am like yeah yeah yeah in real </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> time yeah right um make sure you don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> accidentally show that next year </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> but it's sick though right because it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like i thought like okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> again like another issue is like how </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> how do you make nine hours of cycling </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> engaging yeah because like that shit's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> boring like i i wouldn't watch it yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's like okay so you have you have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> the narrative of the the charity and the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> challenge right and and the journey </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's one but that's that's not really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like like you if you if you missed day </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> one you maybe you don't care about that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as much yeah it's like so i was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> okay i really want to have some kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like progress bar or tracker on the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> screen yeah uh and i just you know three </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> weeks before the event i asked my mods i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was like hey can you can we try and make </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> something and yeah they made it it took </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was like pulling hair testing this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> app it was like every night they were </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like we tested again and i just sat </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there for an hour and they were like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> type this on android editor and i was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like dude </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's broken it doesn't work </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like hours and hours hours yeah took so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> long but then you get this cool result </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where you get this progress bar that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> tells you how far i am from the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> destination a little monkey on the map a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> little animation that was a custom app </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that was made yeah yeah it was a custom </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> app called find my monkey that they made </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wow um it was like literally like every </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> morning before the cycle i would zoom in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on where i was put start zoom out go to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where we're going to finish put end yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it would just do like a geographical </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> straight line yeah which wasn't like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> perfect because sunday's people would be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like wow what an easy day we have 60 but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then the root was like this yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah so it was actually like 120 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and we're like wow he's moving so slowly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but luckily we had like a speedometer as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> well right which was using gps to show </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how fast i was going which is also fun </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> because then chat was like oh my god </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he's moving at like 50 kilometers an </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hour on this downhill everyone's getting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hyped yeah it was just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> trying to like gamify it and trying to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> make it like engaging i think that it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> worked yeah people already liked it like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> views were crazy for me yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> exactly i saw you peek to like 30 000 at </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> the end yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> 41 or something like that i've never had </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that many viewers ever on a live stream </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah and that's nice that's [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> insane yeah it was it was crazy it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> uh it's hard though because cycling with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the backpack on it was like it was a lot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then also trying to like be fun for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> nine hours cycling is hard yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah for sure um that was hot that was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hardest part i felt like some days i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> wasn't engaging enough </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at that point i think there's enough </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> elements within the stream that you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> didn't need to be engaged no one's gonna </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> blame you for that yeah yeah dude i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> think for the first like four or five </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> days i was killing it with the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> engagement i thought i was like just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> talking non-stop even though cycling </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah um except for like uphills i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like all right chat just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but even that was fun because like i i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> think i think it all worked really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> nicely where we had enough elements in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it um where everyone kind of came </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> together </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and when like uphill sections happened </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that were really long everyone was just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of like in cheering mode and that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was really fun </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was just everything worked like i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> very lucky that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we never had a signal outage more than </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like 20 30 minutes right and even then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> most of them were like one minute right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right yeah yeah yeah so yeah it worked i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't know it's i think it's a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> miracle that all worked out yeah i don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know the battery lasted every single day </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> my i had a 50 000 milliamp battery and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it only </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> died on the very very last day after 10 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> hours of streaming damn with four things </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> plugged into it god damn okay and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it would last like another hour on like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> residual charges right right so that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like crazy yeah i'm i i'm yeah it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> nuts i didn't even talk about how like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> how the cycling actually was just the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> prep and doing it was hard yeah that was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> hard yeah because like like i saw how </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> many things you had going on in like irl </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> stream setup and everything like that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and i was just like is this custom made </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> or is this like all that was like custom </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah god damn gg so like how much </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> time did this play like take like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> planning to like execution </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like a month or so we had about a month </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> between when i pitched the idea and when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we did it and even then like we were </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> changing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the route kind of like whilst we were </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> cycling as well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like because google maps </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just like there was if you cycle in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> tokyo there's pre-existing cycle routes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah that can tell you where to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> cycle but in wakanda and stuff like that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> no one cycles there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> we didn't see people no one's there well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no one's there period </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like after we left wakana we just didn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> see people for like four days yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there was nothing yeah and um </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so much prep so much and like i was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> trying to do work and do other streams </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> whilst also trying to manage everything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and also i didn't really promote it that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> much right i was kind of like yeah it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> happening and in hindsight i should have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> promoted it way more because i'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is like eight days i should have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> promoted this yeah yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> exactly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but i was also terrified that if i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> promoted it too much and then the first </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> day and the first day just had no signal </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right because i i genuinely thought like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the first day of cycling i would just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> have no signal for half the day right i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kept telling the viewers as we were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> leaving work and i'm like listen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> if there's no signal for like two hours </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm so sorry it's probably going to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> happen just just deal with it yeah and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was like terrifying because you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like man </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it really [ __ ] sucks to have your </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> first day of in a big event yeah just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not work and the technical issues how do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you convince people to then just you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> know stick around yeah if they don't if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> they don't invest themselves in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> first day a lot of people are going to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fall off yeah yeah yeah yeah because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what happened is it was kind of like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like that in viewership right right the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> first day was crazy we had like 27 000 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> viewers right i don't even know why </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like the people were going crazy like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think all our energies were really high </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as well because the first day yeah chris </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was chris was really really funny the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> first day and was energetic slowly went </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [Applause] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> down same with me to be honest i mean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> for the first five days i was killing it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then i started really slowing down </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right um and yeah and so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i've got the questions </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> how was your how was the experience well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that was it this was tough preparation </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> for the hardest part like getting all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the the widgets and stuff to work </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but like that's why i did like two days </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> before i did a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> test stream in tokyo yeah where i did a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 60k cycle across tokyo but obviously </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's not really like the same because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> tokyo is like perfect internet yeah like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> there's never worry that it would cut </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> out because like tokyo has like it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like mcdonald's everything irl streams </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> just work it because it works so well in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> tokyo you really have to be like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> in like a weird basement or some kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> room that's made of aluminium foil yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> exactly i said aluminium ew </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no no no you said it right you said it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right you said it right connor </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> wasn't a mistake in that i don't know i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was gonna say aluminum </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> aluminium it's aluminum </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> he's been indoctrinated </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uh yeah i'm sure there'll be like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really big video out i don't know if i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gonna do one or two parts or whatever </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah but like it was it was a lot of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> prep it was so i wish i could show the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> prep because the prep was crazy and like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> shout out to my uh my uh uh mods and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> slash programmers </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who uh worked </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really [ __ ] hard on making the farmer </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> monkey app i think that was the coolest </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> part for me yeah yeah i think watching i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mean you just had a custom map </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was i thought it was [ __ ] sick </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that you could just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> see like the map it was zooming in and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> out gradually showing you where i was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and yeah like kind of go i just thought </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> they were sick and a progress bar like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> progress but that's so [ __ ] cool when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i watch the tour de france i'm like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> where are they i don't [ __ ] where's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the progress ball </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> dude tell me the tell me that give me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the progress bar man that's what i need </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> what's that like actual current speed on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> a gps yeah give me like i want like look </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like make it like a game yeah make it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like i'm just i won't watch tour de </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> france unless there's a hud </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i i had like a heads-up display right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like if two of the friends had chat </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm i'm watching that yeah you know what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i mean two of the friends needs this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> dude i like you know what i want like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the hearts </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's so [ __ ] weird because um because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i i've also been streaming more often </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> than past months i'm trying to try to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> dabble in more often i'm kind of getting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> used to it right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but then like a few days ago i had to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like stream like a let's play yeah and i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was like great this this can be easy all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right i've been doing let's plays for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this past month yeah and everything like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that yeah and just like but it was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> an offline let's play so no chat just an </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> og offline let's yeah and i i tried i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> tried like i thought it was going to be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> easy because i was like i've been </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> streaming like i've been streaming games </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> streaming different things like almost </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like every day for like the past month </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> whatever this is going to be easy i turn </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on the game </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and i like subconsciously look towards </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where the chat is i see no interaction </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is everything better and i just i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> actually had to like scrap the video </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because i was like i i don't know how </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i actually don't know how to like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> commentate or like be entertaining </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you know what's so weird though i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> actually find it easier when there's no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> chat no no no no because i because early </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in my channel i did let's plays yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that weren't on stream right so like i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> because i'm used to that from early on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in my channel because i was a one point </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a let's player yeah i just find it so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> much easier when there's no chat for me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> for me chat i i'd be i might be thinking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about like uh you know something you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know like okay i'm gonna say like this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> joke here yeah like you know explain </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this or whatever yeah but while i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> doing that on stream because i'm so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> engrossed in looking at chat i all the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> jokes just fly out of my head so i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> become such a boring let's play on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> stream i just read out the funniest </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thing chat says and i just say say as if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's my joke </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> so that normally works really yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> to me like i i think my big issue is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that when i don't have when i'm not live </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> streaming and when am i just trying to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> record like an offline video second </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> channel video whatever um i like think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about what i say too much yeah so i try </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i try to like script it in my head you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> know what i mean whereas if i have you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> generally yeah yeah yeah i turn into </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like giggup right whereas if chat's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there i'm forced to say what's the first </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> thing that comes to my mind right i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't i can't like second-guess myself </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> so i just haven't forced like constantly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> talk i'm like a firm believer that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as a streamer your chat should be on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> screen i just think it always should be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> on screen oh yeah of course i just think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that like that's the whole live element </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right show them like it doesn't have to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> be like crazy not like nico nico where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like flying across the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> screen yeah just put in the little </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> corner like all right imagine if you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> could like i think it's stupid that the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> olympics don't let people like stream it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah imagine if you had like twitch chat </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with the olympics i think that would be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> awesome i think we've said this before </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on trash taste but like that's why like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i really really wanted all this stuff on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on the screen yeah the cycling things </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm like cycling is like inherently </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know it's not that you know it's not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that exciting yeah like it's just not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like if i was just cycling pov across </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> japan it's like right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cool yeah nice like walking the same </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like give me something like give me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah give me some stuff to get invested </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> true gamer you're just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're turning irl into a game well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that's kind of what i wanted it to be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like i kind of wanted it to be where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> anyone could hop in and kind of get a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> feel for what where we're at yeah you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have to ask oh how far in are we it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we're 80 of the way there yeah oh uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we're we're eating lunch and we're 47 of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the way there oh the days you started </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with five you know what i mean like yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> a lot of the questions people are going </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to ask uh in the chat and stuff like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that just get that out of the way </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's never any questions about how </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we're doing how's it you know it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you can everything is visually explained </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and and it doesn't impose i think it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> adds to it because it's not like there's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> much i need to show yeah literally just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh yeah me gay and like i i had like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> a fail proof for like everything um </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> except a spare bike which i nearly broke </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> of course you do of course like my brand </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> every new bike </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i was smart though i got insurance on my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bike okay that's good that's good that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> good that's good we learned from </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ourselves the insurance was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> percent of the bikes [ __ ] cost but it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> covered everything it was like if the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bike literally come bust or get stolen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah they'll replace it it's monkey </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> proof yeah literally like no matter what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i do to it it is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> they'll they'll no questions asked yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah and it's great for me because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> if i was live streaming i broke it i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it's proof </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right here bro </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> oh yeah i nearly broke it on the second </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> day it's not good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was that when you fell over or yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i was pointing to something in the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> distance holding on with my left hand </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and i went over a big rock right thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like wobbled yeah and i just went right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> into the yeah the pavement and it was a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really big like it's not maybe like this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> big of sidewalk from the road </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> pavement for british people um and i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just like jumped into the bush i didn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> want to land on the sidewalk oh yeah i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was like that's just gonna hurt yeah but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i didn't also want my bike to get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wrecked so i i just didn't in the second </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i was like i just can't decide i'll just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> jump </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but i i was also excited </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> my first time ever using them i had the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> clip in yeah yeah yeah which are awesome </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> by the way it makes cycling like way </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> easier and also you have to think less </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you have to worry where your legs are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah like a like a steam engine just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> keep you just keep pushing you don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the machine yeah i mean like i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sure to work with chris is on but he's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> just like slipping and [ __ ] yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like it's just it's good but also it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> bad for situations like that yeah but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> luckily uh if you jump hard enough </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you'll get out of the clips </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and i think i did and they've made a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> good clip it was completely by accident </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and luckily there's no cars on the road </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right at that point uh i mean we're in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the middle of nowhere yeah yeah but yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it was it was you have to be pretty </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> unlucky to get hit by a car </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on a road that's practically empty that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> would be tough that would be tough i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> mean there was that that was an aspect </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that was really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> uh you get used to pretty fast but it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was very anxious the first time where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you cycle on the road oh yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and tunnels especially yeah tunnels of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the sky used to it tunnels is terrifying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> cause the echo in a tunnel when you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> cycling in it is terrifying right right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because the car comes in or here in the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> background </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like fifteen thousand echoes coming </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> right that's terrifying you and you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's coming from behind you and you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like oh no oh no please please don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't hear me don't you please please </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't have your lights on yeah he's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like please see me please see me please </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and you're literally just hoping you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> just don't die yeah that's it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hoping it's not like because i saw like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the one one of the clips where that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> massive truck yeah almost clipped you or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that was that was unnecessarily scary </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> because it was literally a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a country road with so much room and no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one no one was on these roads yeah and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he went so close to me and i thought why </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> why just being addicted like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was enough room </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> probably in europe it's probably the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> normal amount of room yeah but i was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just like come on man it wasn't like it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was like a busy road like i don't know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that that was probably not as close as </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> some other ones but other times we were </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> on a road and i chose to be on the road </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when you're cycling for ages going on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the the pavement the sidewalk it's bumpy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and up and down and [ __ ] paved and it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just not good and after a while you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just like i just want a cycle i do not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> want to have to think or get my ass hurt </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or stop or slow down you just want to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> keep you just want to have the exercise </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bike experience yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right and you go so much faster on the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> road yeah and it's like whatever i don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> give a [ __ ] about the cars even when i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> driving i don't give a [ __ ] if i have to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just like wait a second to get around </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the cyclist it's a road bike let me go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on the road yeah also my favorite part </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is when i saw other japanese cyclists </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and we just nodded each other that was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fun </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the mutual you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> now every other cyclist that was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> also wearing serious gear would not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> always </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was like a mutual respect you'd wave </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> especially when like i don't know like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you uh you were coming down like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you were going up a big hill and after </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah they knew and you're like oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> no he's like oh he ain't normally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> one of us </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah just like one night we had to drive </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> back um </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [Music] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we did drive down the biggest incline we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> did right and in the car we were like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> this is stupid i can't believe we cycled </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> up this yeah it's like ten we're like on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this road for like 10 minutes driving </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> down we're like this we cycled up this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is insane yeah because like day one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the first incline we're like oh dying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> we're like we can't do this this is too </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> much and by like day seven you're just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like all right let's get used to all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> right 5k incline let's do it let's just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> go you just get used to it it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like it's just a different </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sensation you don't like it doesn't hurt </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> nearly as much yeah just kind of like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it just uses a different part of you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's really interesting i i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i really want to keep cycling more i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> feel really fit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> if you don't feel fit after this i don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> know what's going on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because like your heart rate is like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> literally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just elevated all day long like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're just purely exercising like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> seven eight hours a day yeah that's it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for eight days no breaks it's probably </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> terrible if you actually want to build </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> muscle and actually do it healthfully uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but yeah it's great to lose body fat if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you want to lose weight it's great but i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wouldn't recommend it it's just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's i mean it's pretty like yeah it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like not eating for three days yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's awful because like you know you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> burning like i don't know i think most </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> days you were burning like five four </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thousand calories a day </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so it's like oh it's on top of your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> daily like 2 000 yeah yeah yeah yeah so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're just like there's no possible way </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you can eat 8 000 calories a day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like unless you're like actually trying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> your hardest yeah yeah yeah i just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> didn't want to eat i don't stop cycling </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't want to [ __ ] eat yeah it's i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mean like it's i mean i think it's a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> great way to lose weight if you want to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> do that i mean i don't think i lost that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> much weight because i was also i was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> drinking a lot of beer </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> well that made the beer worth it though </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> right that was that's the sweet that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> how you're putting back the 8 000 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> calories just like like 10 pints of beer </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah well i i mean i ate i ate as much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> as i could </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> at every point but yeah there's even </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> then it's like you just </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_02> it's a lot every day yeah yeah you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> pretty much didn't get to do anything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for like eight days well i mean like was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there anywhere you'd want to go back to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and oh yeah like nobody bet 2 was cool </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> oh no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it's a really famous onsen town yeah ah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and that was really cool </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> because a lot of the towns you went to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just had nothing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just nothing in there yeah i think it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> was three days we didn't see anything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i feel like anything north of like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sub-par is pretty much just like i know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i was really sick oh other than our </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> psychologist </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i was very small like there were some </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> places that only had </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like one hotel within like a uh you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a 80 kilometer radius yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah like um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh i'm sure </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> chris can tell the story about this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> racist hotel staff but there's already </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> clips of it and stuff not racist i don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know [ __ ] or maybe just a horrible </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> person </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [Music] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's the difficulty being in traffic </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> especially in like the country in japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> are you being racist or are you just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but like there was like you know uh the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> first night there was like no hotels in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this area just none right it was just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> only like one hostel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and it just like didn't make sense for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> us to go in hostel when we had to charge </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> charge everything yeah yeah it'd be up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so early and we were going to get there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> so late and stuff so it was just it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just tough </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really tough i don't know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> how you would would you would you do it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> again </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like some something like that cycle not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hokkaido again right hokkaido is way </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> harder than anywhere else in japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> somewhere a little more like with a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> little more civilization i'd love to do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it uh i mean crystal's also chris </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> already already was like maybe we should </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> do another one sometime soon </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i mean i don't mind </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i i the idea was like maybe kyushu </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or something right that makes more sense </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right because it's the whole island yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah it's a lot hillier though yeah but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> then apparently chris was telling me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's a there's another way this is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the west or east side that's not as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hilly or whatever i don't mind same </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> famous last words yeah it's like i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> fine i know a way i know i'm with hills </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was like way more successful than i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thought yeah i thought it wasn't gonna </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> be i thought the viewership on my twitch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was not gonna be as good as it was yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> um i thought cause it was like i thought </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i wouldn't like watch it if i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> just watched someone cycle i don't know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i mean i feel like irl content on twitch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> she's just doing really really well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> right now definitely </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> uh because no one else can come to japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that's why so that's the only that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> literally the only way that people would </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just create their knees it's great you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> can just show off a [ __ ] combination </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> chat think irl stuff should always be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like an event not i don't know how you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> could be uh like i don't know how rob </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> does it uh robert i don't know how rob </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> does he streams like five days a week </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i don't know how those like how have you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not run out of places to go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i don't know how he does it i i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> would be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sick of going outside yeah i would just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> touching too much </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm like can i can i not touch grass </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i think it's great to have irl stream </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> events i think as one-offs they're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really good and i think twitch right now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or streaming in general like irl is a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really big uh like trend right yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> there's always been a thing but i think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> right now it's particularly popular than </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> anything yeah definitely um when it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> done well yeah so if you want to try it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> try it it just sucks because the barrier </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of entry to irl streaming is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> very very high well yeah um also cycling </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> on top of it if you want to get into </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like the amount of cycling that you did </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like you don't need to buy all the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that i bought like you could get a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bike and do the same thing it would just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> be harder oh yeah like this bike wasn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> would you have a good time though doing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> your bra </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this bike was my bike was nutty i've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> never had gears that changed like that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like i've never had a bike where you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just tap it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> boom change gear </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> immediately no questions asked the bike </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is like bra i got you doesn't matter </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what hell you're on anything boom tap it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you want to go two hold it down twice as </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> long it's insane i've never had </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> so now that you've had the cycling </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> experience what do you think makes a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> good bike </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> what would you recommend now that you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> a cycling expert </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> now that you're uh you know that you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the traveler </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like this bike and this bike was nuts </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like i i don't understand how people can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like review bikes for a living i'm just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like what are you what are you looking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for like i feel like every bike is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> slightly i feel like you can say that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with any niche though yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i wanted a bike that was good for the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> lazy man because mine had a thing so you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> got you you got the apple of bikes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> kinda i kind of got like the like yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like the full so i bought my bike purely </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> on the reason that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it had um the headlights and the rear </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> light like built into the bike right and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then you just charge this battery pack </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> on the the frame and then it's just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> controlled by an app no you just turn </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the lights on or if it gets dark they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> automatically turn on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> easy and i was like cool that sounds </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> good because i hate turning on these </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> lights i always forget to send them off </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and i just i'm i understand that this is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> such a lazy reason to get it but i just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wanted to do it turns out it became a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> pain at one point because when i had no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> internet i couldn't turn my lights on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's no there's no way to turn them </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and on really felt like that moment </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where boomers are like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> why do you why are you gonna put </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> technology and everything we did we we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> had lights that work just fine without </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> these [ __ ] apps </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> why do you need smart </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> truly felt at balls point where it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like ah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this sucks this is so dumb why does that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> why is there not a way for this this is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> an oversight </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> there's no way for me to turn it on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> without the app yeah this is [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> dumb yeah when when the when the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> inevitable rogue ai you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> starts taking over humanity yeah we're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gonna look back at this point and be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like why can't we turn on the lights </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> without our [ __ ] smart tap so you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gonna pay like 10 10 bezos bucks today </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> play a subscription service yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i did i i i oh my god so i bought this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bike so i said four thousand dollars but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i think it's normally four thousand </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> dollars i don't know what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> happened but yeah um i went to the store </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and i because i already knew what bike i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> wanted </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and they had it in the store because i i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i didn't understand how how you buy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> bikes really i just thought although </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'll just have the bike in the store </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah turns out like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like if the store's small they don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have your bike they have to order it for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you which can take months yeah so i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like chris i was like you by the way you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can't just like wait you should go now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah so he waited like two weeks </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> before and couldn't get the same bike as </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> me but he wanted the same bike as me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right um so he couldn't get that one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because he </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_00> put a button to turn it on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like this isn't expensive </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we're going real minimalistic with our </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> design an expensive bike and this the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> lights are a pain in the [ __ ] ass to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> turn on yeah they put all these like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bits and bobs on a bike but they were </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like switch for the light switch no no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> we don't need a switch i also like you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> know i might the seat on the bike you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know i assume if i'm the super most </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> serious cyclist on earth it's great </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just not comfortable it is tiny </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's tiny is there air is there does is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there any bike that actually has a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> comfortable seat for road bikes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> generally they're not yeah they're not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they're like really small and they're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> meant to you know because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cyclists are like all right get used to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it that's kind of what it is you just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have to you literally just have to </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_01> hardwired to the bike cannot be removed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> seat so i have no choice but to use the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> seat right that's how they rope you into </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so i have to buy like this padded suit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but i really wanted this bike right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because it was perfect for what i wanted </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was like an endurance bike and the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> wheels were a bit thicker than normal </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> road bikes and it was it was good god he </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> did buy the apple of bikes he did </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] no accessories no customization </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah everything is included yeah yeah i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> imagine like trying to fix this bike is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a pain </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> um </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like that particular comfortable you </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_02> register with the police as you do in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> japan oh yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because it's like it's like it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> considered a vehicle registration in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> japan yeah yeah and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah that's why getting rid of a bike as </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> well is [ __ ] pain in the air </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i want to get rid of this you can't just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like yeah but if you if you were to for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> whatever reason it's the biggest pain in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the ass i remember when i got rid of my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> bike it was like a whole like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like three week process just like call </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> them up and be like i want to get rid of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> this bike and then you have to do all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this paperwork to like unregister the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bike and then you have to get rid of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bike which costs you know well luckily i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think this bike's nice enough where i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> could probably just sell it oh yeah i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't think i will i mean i love this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bike this bike's awesome yeah i really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> want to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you know eventually cycle around like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> europe or something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> well now that you've invested this much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> money into it it would be a shame if you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> didn't use it again i mean i you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i've been cycling to the before this i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was cycling to the studio a lot and i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> loved it i think it's dude </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> after cycling on this bike it's like oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how cycling is supposed to feel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cycling in the shin amikaido and cycling </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right you're doing these uphills it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> feels like the bike is just like not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> doing anything yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> square wheels it's just like you pedal </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and it feels like nothing's happening </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> well that's that's why </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot of the times we just ended up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> walking up the hills yeah because it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> felt like less effort you know i think i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was actually moving </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> faster because like the energy the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> energy you're putting into each pedal </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like wasn't translating is like yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> what you kind of wanted yeah whereas </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like with this bike like it was just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like every like rotation you put into it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> felt like it went </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> directly into pushing you because it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> such a nice bike and it's so good and it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> was crazy like up hills man i've never </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> had anything like that it felt like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you're slowly walking up a hill right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because the on the lowest lowest gear it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> was basically like walking up a hill </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's crazy it's such a good bike we're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is this is now the connor cyclist </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> arc we have now entered everyone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i just can't believe that i thought the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> shin namicato was hard like that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's like maybe maybe we just nerfed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ourselves we should do it again and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i'll just be like all right guys boys i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> finished three hours </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> [Music] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> this bike is nutty i just it's i didn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> realize how </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> good these road bikes obviously if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're a better cyclist you'll you'll </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> still like you know you'll be able to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> use it more of course like i never did </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just because i couldn't be bothered um </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because it was just pain in the ass you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know where you can go right on the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bottom handlebars and be more wind yes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> resistant i never wanted to go that fast </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and i know so it was horrible for the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> camera angle yeah so i'll just be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> pointing at the ground so i never ever </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> did that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um so i wasn't really using the bike for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like full potential if you will i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sure cyclists are like cringy potential </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you know what i mean because like it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> super saiyan body </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like the weather conditions bro i i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> thought rain was the worst turns out no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> wind is the worst all right wind wind is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> number one can [ __ ] off when you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> playing well that's literally why like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> professional cyclists in the olympics </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> they have like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> they literally have a [ __ ] team you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know it's it's it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> uh the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> wind is like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it can make downhills feel like flats if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's strong enough </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's crazy you'll be going on the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> flat and you'll be you you'll have to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> put the same amount of energy as going </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> up a hill just to keep going yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because the wind will be so crazy i it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i just was like [ __ ] this like if if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> this was this every day i would i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> couldn't do it yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we got so lucky that one or two days </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> were perfect we had rain some days which </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> is miserable because your feet get like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> trench foot yeah and you're just soaked </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just should have had someone just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like tank the wind for you like a like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> an olympics i was following chris a lot </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> of the time because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> he he did a good job with that yeah he </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> did it because chris i don't know why </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it was good i mean when there was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> certain days where i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> felt like i could just keep cycling till </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the end of time right we did like 120k </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one day which is the longest day and at </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the end of it i just felt like yeah i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> could do another 50 another 60. i felt </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> totally like good to go nice i don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know why some days you just feel it and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> other days you're like holy [ __ ] 10k is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> so hard yeah um i don't know it's i feel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like that's true with exercise in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> general though you know yeah it sucks </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because when you do something like this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> those days where you would normally wake </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> up and be like no how how i would do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> exercise today yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's not gonna happen because you you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> know those days where you when you turn </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to the gym and you just you just you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> just [ __ ] yes everything the walk to the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> gym you're just like oh you're you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> leaving you know you know this day is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> gonna suck yeah start running on the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> treadmill after two minutes you're like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] i can't yeah you you can't even do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> your like normal reps like everything's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] it's just like that but like in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cycling form and you're like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like i wouldn't even be tired but my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> muscles like my leg muscles would be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just so [ __ ] that i just couldn't get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> them to pedal the speed i wanted them to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> go to right whereas other days it would </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> be just easy like i could just maintain </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a crazy pace all day don't know why </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and yeah it was it was awesome like it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just kind of depended on a lot of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> factors i don't know why like i i'm like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> some days i would like like the day </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> after sapporo i had drank in sapporo so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> much beer like i had like six or seven </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> pints of beer </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because i was like i'm in sapporo baby i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gotta </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then that was like my best cycling </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> day the day after i just i'd killed it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like i just i was on fire fueled by </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sapporo class really clearly like either </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the the sapporo beer has got </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> something in it right like i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i was a machine i drank every day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's probably why you didn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah probably i mean it's because every </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> day i had like two beers after it's all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right i don't have a beer </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you want it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that was rough yeah that empowered me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah and yeah i was good but uh yeah i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> definitely recommend uh doing something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> crazy congratulations you want to do it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you want to do it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't know i mean i want to do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> something crazy yeah i mean i think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's it's weird because this year has </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just been a crazy crazy year just in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> general we've already done some pretty </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> good crazy things it's not even [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> over yet i'm gonna do it next time you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> wanna i'll be down oh no like did you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> actually i would actually be down like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> six seven days yeah i guess because you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you've got you've got me to tell you all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> the everything they're doing yeah right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i've done i've found out how to exactly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> everything exactly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah no but like i i mean you know if i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> want to [ __ ] get because you know i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> do want to get into shape um and so you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know why </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> would i you know what what better excuse </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> than to do for you know a charity or an </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> event i don't think it's a good way to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> get like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> super fit there's like way better ways </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to do it yeah but you just want to get a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kick start yeah i think it's well like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know it's just to say that you did </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it as well oh yeah it's a cool [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> story to tell it's cool yeah but i feel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like it's especially if you want to get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> fit you know it's i'm sure like there's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so many better there are better ways of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> course there are better ways to min max </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it but at the end of the day if you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> not having fun or if you're not doing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this you don't have to know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the motivation there's going to be more </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> efficient ways to do it yes but if you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't want to do it you're not going to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> do it you know it's kind of it's kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like it's it's very similar to i guess </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> learning a language and everything like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that is like what i've realized is that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> there is always a more efficient way to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> learn japanese or learn another language </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but at the end of the day the most </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> important thing is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> having fun </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no joke no jokes it [ __ ] is okay look </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if like we've like clowned on duolingo </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so much but if you if duolingo gets you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> up and gets you doing a language </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> exercise every day that's way [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> better than other methods that are way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> more efficient absolutely um yeah i mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> sometimes the stars align right and yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everything just kind of works out yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and uh you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> set a challenge </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it kind of just hits every box you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> want yeah you know like for me it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> started out as me just wanted to do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> something stupid yeah and then i was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like oh i get personal fitness i get to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> make some content i get to cycle with my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> friends and then i get to also raise </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> money for a great cause and yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hopefully i get to entertain a bunch of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people throughout it so i think you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you sometimes you just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know you're like this is gonna be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> tough this is not gonna be easy and it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gonna it's gonna be a nuisance to my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> life because you know like i couldn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really do much after the day was over </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah people would text me but i would </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just i couldn't [ __ ] reply i was just </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_00> get the shinkansen from hakodate to get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> here to film the base </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i literally finished it yesterday yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah it's crazy to think i was in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> hokkaido yesterday yeah and you just got </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the shoe you wanted you're in the code </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this morning yeah yeah yeah this morning </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this morning oh man yeah it's it's uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah and like the number one tip to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> cycling long distances is just wake up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> early but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm sure when chris comes on he'll tell </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you all about it we had so many </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> arguments about what time to wake up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> right we actually we like had on like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> four years because yeah because chris is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like the number one like i hate waking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> up in the morning post we had like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> shouting match at one point about this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> in like a restaurant we were we were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is like five we are so stressed out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right because you're cycling all day </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're pissed off yeah and and i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> getting i was getting really pissed off </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for chris was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> under the bridge afterwards like but we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> were like so pissed off what time did he </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> want to wake up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> he you know because he was arguing that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like uh if i wake up too early i'm i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know i won't get enough sleep and i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> won't be in condition to do anything and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just get over it just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> because just get good </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just don't be tired don't be tired i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> sure you can talk about it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> because we've done video shoots together </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right yeah and sometimes you do shoots </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with a lot of people yeah sometimes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for the for the the greater good of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> shoot you just have to sacrifice things </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah and i think chris cause chris </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> normally controls everything on his </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> videos yes he controls it so that he </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> doesn't have to wake up early right yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but for this it was like we're just not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gonna hit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the places because i i i was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> insistent on the fact that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i did not want to cycle in the dark yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i just thought that oh it looks like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] first it looks like [ __ ] and also </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just unnecessarily adding like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> dangerous elements to it for no reason </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah you have lights on your bike but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you can't see stuff as well you can't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> see the the rocks and the roads these </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> roads are [ __ ] yeah you can't see the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> potholes you can't see the cut the cars </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can't see you as well like i just i just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thought that it's you're just adding </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> unnecessary danger for no reason yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and we could just wake up an hour early </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah you know because originally we're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> waking up at like we were starting at </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like 9 30. and i just thought that's way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> too late yeah that's surprisingly late </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and so we eventually got it down to like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 8 8 30 after arguing a bunch and like ah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because i was on the other crazy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> spectrum where i was like listen if i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> have to get six hours of sleep five </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hours of sleep for a week of my life so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> be it like it's it's it's a week of my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> life i'll get over it i'll recover i'll </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just sleep extra yeah like obviously </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's not ideal but you just make </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sacrifices to make stuff happen yes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> uh but christian's like this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> content yeah but you know it was i i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> understand where he's coming from i know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you know i'm younger and i can it's way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> easier for me to i mean you're not that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> much young </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't know like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> six years younger i don't know like for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> me i waking up and losing a bit of like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for me five hours of sleep that's not a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> big issue if it's like it's a big issue </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm i'm i'm saying if if okay if we were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> doing this and i was like gone you have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to get five hours of sleep and we're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> doing it you wouldn't be happy about it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> but you'd probably be like all right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah okay so like i think the difference </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> between being 30 is that you just know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> what your body is capable of right you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> know you know some days where you think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> okay okay okay so yeah i'd say like i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> understood where he's coming from i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> wasn't trying to be a dick about it i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not even 30 and i can already feel that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no that's that's because you're almost </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> 30 joey that's almost </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that's i think that's the big tester </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where you've limit tested your body </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> enough to know what the limits are right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so i can do like five hours of sleep </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah and six thousand sleep but i know i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know if i do five to six hours of sleep </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm gonna have a write-off day it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's there's yes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's law of equal exchange i'm going </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the price is going to catch up to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> your body yeah and if i have a five hour </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> night the next night is a 12 hour yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah exactly exactly i understand that i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that sleep was definitely a necessity </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah um </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> my solution was just go to bed earlier </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> because chris was going to bed like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> midnight i was going to bed like 10. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah because i think chris got really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> unlucky a bunch of stuff i mean he'll </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> talk about it a bunch of stuff piled on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah emails and important things he had </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to do so he wasn't sleeping properly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which is also like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know it was i i just told everyone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm like don't don't bother don't you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't talk to me i'm not going to reply </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to anyone yes because i'm just like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> just i just don't want to worry about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> anything i just want to turn off i told </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the agency i was like hey </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just you can you can ask me do it do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> what you want but i'm not gonna i'm not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> gonna reply unless it's like gigger </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> urgent yeah um so yeah i went to bed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> every night like ten so waking up at six </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> is like oh that's nothing yeah that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> plenty yeah my mindset was we just go to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> bed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> eight hours of sleep yeah because a lot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of the times we all said bye and we're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like we would all have dinner and talk a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bit then we'd all go to bed like we'd </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> all head off at nine yeah so i was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> just go to bed you know yeah easy worst </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> case you don't get seven hours of sleep </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which is fine seven hours of sleep is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> also in the recommended amount that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> still pretty good you know yeah um so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that's what i always think but then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> obviously you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> everyone sleeps different as well yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is it um is that an old man thing now to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> really value your sleep i value my sleep </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't get me wrong i i normally i i am </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> hard on the seven eight hours necessary </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah but i i when it comes to like a an </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> outdoor shoot where we've all traveled </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and a lot of people and money and time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> has invested i'm completely of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> mindset of like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if i get two hours i get two hours </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that's what it is no because like i've i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> remember actually for for the drifting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> special yeah yeah actually was no sleep </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> for that like the road trip we got like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> no sleep yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the road trip was like five years </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i stayed in the hotel that we stayed in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in hakodate right i remember i was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> oh yeah the last time i was here </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we literally were there for four hours </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah we booked a hotel room just to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> sleep for four hours we got to that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> hotel at i think it was like 12 00 a.m </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no it was like one or two a.m </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and then we had to wake up at i think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> six inches yeah yeah yeah yeah we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> literally booked a hotel yeah for just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like four hours yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah we just did that because there was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a video shoot and we understood that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like to make these things happen we had </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to sacrifice sleep exactly obviously </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's a different i understand it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> completely different when you when it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> comes to the fact that i'm like okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> sacrifice sleep now exercise for eight </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> hours yes yes that's so i i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i i was content we were all content yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was we were both tired it's been five </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> days cycling we were pissed off but it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was you know we we understood that like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> immediately after you're like that's 400 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> bridges yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> me and chris piss each other off all the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> chris is just like eighty percent of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> chris is just angry at all times anyway </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> well you know uh well not angry </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> of shoots yes i was like this is both of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> our shoots so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you can't just be like this is what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we're doing yeah i'm like no i'm pushing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> back hard on it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm gonna be the i'm gonna be the one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who pushes back </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh you know because i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we we were slowly getting later and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> later and i was like if we start at 10 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we're [ __ ] yeah we're not gonna make </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it because also okay so to to preface </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how all this works it was eight days and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was like 95 kilometers 90 85 85. and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we were just about finishing before </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> sunset when we were doing 95 and 80. um </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because we were we were slow we were </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> taking our time we were stopping for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> lunch and we're doing stuff like that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and um originally the last day was gonna </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> be 160. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> damn and as we were getting closer to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that day this is when i was like dude </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we're gonna have to wake up at like 4 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a.m yeah and like i'm i just it's one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> day i'm chill to do it and we were like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> having arguments and stuff about it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because i'm not waking up before i am </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because yeah i'm not gonna be able to do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it i was like alright fine so we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> eventually came to the conclusion that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we had to like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> somehow spread out the distance in the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> remaining days so instead of doing like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> 80 100 160 we did 120 110 110 right um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and that was tough because then that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> turned what was going to be two normal </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> days and a really hard day into like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> just three hard days right right um </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> which was tough that was tough </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it's hard that was tough </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that was hard but you know you get used </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> to it i don't know it's hard but it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> really fun you sound like you know you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know when like marines go through their </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like their training where they like run </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] like 100 kilometers or something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a day i think you're just like you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you just got to learn to push past </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yourself </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's weird it's like yeah when they're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like it was tough i'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it's not the word you would describe you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> subscribe </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it's weird how quickly your body can </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> adapt to things oh of course i mean you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you have like you you know like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> we had like hard deadlines right like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you had to do this distance in the day </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah so it's kind of like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you gotta do it i mean your body and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> your mind is just incredibly flexible to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a point yeah yeah you know you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> capable of way more than you think you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> are oh yeah well i mean i mean like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> remember like the the crazy schedule </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that we had for like la miami and then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> australia in the span of like a week and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a half like when we were looking at that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> before it was happening we were like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's no [ __ ] where we're gonna be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but by the end of it we were like okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah that was tough but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean we still did it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> anything can be handled i never met prep </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> literally it's just all prep if you just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> prep properly for this this kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> stuff it's so easy yeah yeah definitely </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know and it's really amazing how um </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fast and how many days your body will </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of like even like by day four like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i said like hills became way easier like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i had not had any really really tough </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hills before i've been doing a lot of it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> on on tokyo which is really flat tokyo </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> doesn't have that many hills um and also </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the exercise bike you can put the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> resistance up but it's not the same yes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the resistance the resistance cannot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mimic going up a hill no it's just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> totally different because you don't feel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like you're going to fall off </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you never feel like you're going to fall </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> off the resistance right it's just going </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> to push back whereas the hill it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> if you don't like cycle properly you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just fall off your bike yeah um and you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know changing gear it's a whole </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thing and uh you know it's it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> impressive how even after like three </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> days it becomes so much easier if you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> just keep going yeah um and you get like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> rapid improvement if you do it every day </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah kind of i guess like learning </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like language right like anything like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> anything like if you wanted to get your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> muscles to be like to actually get like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> healthy and grow the muscles properly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then you take rest days yeah and i was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> definitely not eating enough protein i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> just don't know how i could eat that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> much protein </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> liquid protein i truly who needs protein </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> when you've got carbs i've tried to eat </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> protein but it's hard enough to eat like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> calories let alone like yeah the protein </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i should have taken protein powder with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> me or something yeah but i just i just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> couldn't just snort probably so much </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> there's always so much stuff yeah yeah i </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_01> it push the envelope what the [ __ ] i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> don't know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i don't know english like i don't know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like i wanted to do something crazy on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> twitch yeah i have like a big event and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i wanted to do something that was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you know that hadn't really been seen a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> lot on twitch i don't know i've done it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> before but i wanted to do it in like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> way that was really unique gamified yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i just i just wanted to make it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hype and um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i like pushing the boundaries of what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you can do on live streams and i think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> his stuff was like interesting i don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> know i'm like addicted to making stuff i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> guess </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're just you're addicted to content </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i think i think we're all addicted </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to content in one way shape or form </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i love playing games but i'm like man </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you know nobody in my head i'm like man </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> nobody nobody remembers that guy who </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just [ __ ] played games unless you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a markiplier you know what i mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> to be honest if i feel like if you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not addicted like if we weren't addicted </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to content i don't think we would have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> lasted this long </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah cause like that's at the end of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> day that's what it is like the people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who last longer than not are the ones </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who are like constantly just trying to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> push themselves to do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> bigger and better things people always </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> ask like um you know if worry that if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> we're gonna get burnt out or i'm gonna </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> burn out i'm just like well no i kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> get like sad when i'm not making stuff i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> really feel fulfilled and happy when i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> making stuff it's good stuff and it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> rewarding i i get burnt out if i just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> make stuff i always need a constant this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is the next big projects that you are </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> going to be doing and working towards </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and i notice i think that's the one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thing we all have in common where i know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what my big my next big project is and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm sure like you guys like we're we're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> constantly planning different things </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> both together and now individually as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> well yeah so it's it's it's it's weird </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and i guess that's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's it's great actually having you guys </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as friends because i see you doing this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm like [ __ ] now i got to get on my ass </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and do something exciting and do yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and and do something and do something it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> is it's just like it's just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> constantly having the next goal yeah to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> reach and then once you've reached that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> goal yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> once you've reached that goal then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> there's that new goal and then there's a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> new goal and you go and just keeps on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cycling but like the bros just keep you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on your toes you know yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it does it's like being spotted you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> he's just like come on come on you can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> benches </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one more one more one more you got this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you got this i'm obsessed with the idea </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of doing like some kayaking stream i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really want to do a kayaking show for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> kayaking yeah i just but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> do you know what's the one thing though </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you really have to be careful of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the kayaking stream if you fall off the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kayak oh yeah yeah it's ripperone's yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah your stream is [ __ ] yeah at </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> least with alice at least you're on land </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> on a bicycle there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there like i i was thinking about how </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you could maybe have so like i had to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because obviously when it was raining </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i had to kind of have something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> waterproof yeah uh it was like it worked </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but obviously it won't work if you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> submerge it yeah it's splash proof but i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i know that some people make these </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> plastic housings for the stuff i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wondered if you could make it kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> well i mean there's those like plastic </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> housings for like uh big cameras you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> know underwater </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> come out of it kind of somehow exactly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah so that would have to be the whole </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> thing basically </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as well yeah but the wire length would </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> have that that seems like a technique a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> lot of challenges but uh yeah you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> probably need to be 3d printed or some </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] like that probably probably but it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> could be i would want to do a kayaking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> stream kind of like maybe the same deal </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you do that distance i think you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> pretty hype sure just kayaking all day </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah same the honest thing is that it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> would be super [ __ ] boring kayaking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> if you unless you had like a really sick </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> lake </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you would need to have like a really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> interesting route yeah i feel like yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah but dude kayaking i think he's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fun as [ __ ] though it's awesome but i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know that like your feet get [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> after a while because you're just being </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like in the wet kayaking after a while </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah also just yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah maybe like a day thing i could do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it uh it could be pretty high i i kind </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of want to figure out how to do it um um </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe someday i'll figure out yeah i try </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to do more interesting irl stuff like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> had a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i had a a theory that you could set it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> up this way and i never ended up doing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it just because i was so tired every day </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i had so the way that the backpack works </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you can put like a mic into the back of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the camera </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you put a lap mic so i had this big </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> brain idea i was like wait </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> my cable's long enough where if you put </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the bag in the back of the car and then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> put a suction cup on the back of the car </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with a camera mount you could feed the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> camera that's in the bags in the car you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> could feed the camera with the wire onto </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> the suction cup behind you you're you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> wearing a lav mic and then you could be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have the car trail you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> really oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a third person camera and then you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> could have literally like a like a third </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> person view of you with the mic on you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it would be streaming how sick would </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that look </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i thought man that would be so cool to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> do that'd be like that'd be like if you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> had your regular streaming setup but it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was moving yeah kind of yeah it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> literally like marching like the problem </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is that like you'd have to do it in a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> place like if we would have done it we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> would have done it on the first few days </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you'd need like a road that was empty </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah to try it well so i actually want </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to [ __ ] around and set it all up it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> such a big hassle yeah maybe if i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> prepared more i could have done it but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it was a lot of crap but i thought it'd </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> be a sick idea </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or you've got something for next time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i could try it next time if i have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> more time if we have like a day where we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> don't have as much going on yeah but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like a lot of the time google maps </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wouldn't send you down the right route </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah probably not google that's so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> annoying that just didn't well like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> okay so here's the thing google maps </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> works perfectly i find in the city but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you go to a country that might not be as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> well developed or go to an area that is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know not as you know a bit more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> rural you know out and out of the city </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and google maps does not work as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> efficiently as you think it does at all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it would just like especially when you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> fix the cycling option yeah it would </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just like tell you to get off the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> highway not however like just a main </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> road yeah for like one minute to go via </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a round in a field and then join </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> back and it's like why for one minute </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like why would you why would you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think i'd want to do that i'll just stay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> because google's like we know you want </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the scenic route because it generally </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> wants you not to be on a main road which </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is good because sometimes it took us </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> down some really cool </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> routes yeah because we trusted it but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> other times it would take us down a road </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> maybe just gravel and we couldn't cycle </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> on it right because the bikes the roads </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i i remember i encountered this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> problem a lot in uh thailand yeah oh god </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yes because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because what what what i would do is you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> google maps you know works in thailand </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but what counts as a road on google maps </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> google maps can't tell you the quality </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> of the roads </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> google maps use like open maps and open </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> maps is from like i don't know like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> government i don't know yeah i don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know because like what happens is uh we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> we'd like when i was living in thailand </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> me and city would like have a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> destination sometimes it would be like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> an hour away or something like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> different town and goo and we'd be on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the highway with signs telling us </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to lead to this town or the city that we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wanted to go to and google was like no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> take take the exit off here and one time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we're like okay why is it telling us to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> take the exit off maybe there's maybe </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's a shortcut we don't know about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and then so we went from this very </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> well-lit road we take one exit off and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> google leads us to it's it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the definition of a road was pushed to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the limits okay what it led to was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not even like concrete it was just dirt </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> leading into a dark forest </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and there wasn't we couldn't even go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> back right because time in the country </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah first time yeah because it was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it was like it was on a mountain right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was on a mountain so we couldn't even </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you turn back so we we were forced to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like go into like this pitch black </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> forest and i was like i'm gonna get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> murdered this is this is literally the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> start of every horror movie i've seen in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my life you know you you follow google </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> maps you're like oh okay what's this uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> going a bit to the country this is where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the serial killers live man this is like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> texas chainsaw massacre all over again </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we had that though uh yesterday when me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and nabi went we were in shizuoka </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yesterday for a shoot and like we were </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> trying to go to this like you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because like for the most part it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> country sign shizuoka yeah and we're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like i want like a really like nice spot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to like shoot this part of the video </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and so we were like alright we'll put it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in google maps and then i was like okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> go down this road and i was like okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's fine we get to it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> first of all it's a one-way road in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> between two houses </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> barely can fit the car that we have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's not even the right way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and the google maps is like do it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> go there is no other way to go down to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> your destination go down this road right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> now and we had no choice because there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> was like cars backed up yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> literally no other road to get through </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> this part i'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> why are we going down so what you want </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> us to like break traffic laws to get to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> our destination thanks google </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's so annoying it's so annoying and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like and when you try and be like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> okay we can't go down this road can you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> try something else they're like okay how </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about you go around the block once </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and try it again </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i was like no girl </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't want to go down this road i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> think for all the information they take </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> from us to yeah maps accurate they at </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> least do a [ __ ] good job </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like it's like well it's because not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> enough people are living there further </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah there's no information to take </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you know for the the comfort of having a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> map that could tell me where to go i'd </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like to think that you know you taking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> everything about me and using that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> information to serve ads to me least you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> know at least i got a good map out of it </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> of the best concerts i've been to in my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> life yeah yeah i think it was the best </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> concert i i went to in my life i mean it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was there are some i think bands that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> work better in a live setting and i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think sega ross is one of those bands </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that i've experienced them now live and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i can't imagine experiencing them </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> anything but live yeah you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> absolutely because it's kind of like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> they have such a very </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> of unique style right because it's not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like it's not like your typical kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> songs kind of like rocky songs it's very </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't how would you describe it joe </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're the music guy i'm having trouble </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> finding words like i've i've always said </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> said to say uh like to people that like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cigarettes music is kind of like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like advanced </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> church hymns </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> do you know what i mean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like because it's like it's the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> feeling of like when you listen to a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> church him right yeah you don't have to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> be religious in any way but the sound </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the style of a church him is like oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is like i can understand why they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> play this kind of music in churches </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it's like it's very </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> transcendental it's very like yeah it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> religious you know but like it's very </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like pure and like transcendental and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> very like it gives you that feeling of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like oh you know this is very spiritual </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and cigarettes is like that but like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the alpha version of it yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> basically </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't i don't really know how to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> describe their songs i can just describe </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> what it means to me and it's every time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i hear a sega ross song it just like it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> makes me emotional it makes me feel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> things that i can't explain going to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> going to the going to this concert and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hearing their songs i was processing the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> experience for like a full like for the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> entire night after that you know you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know what i mean yeah i get that i get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the live show's so good yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what did i just watch yeah i remember </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> turning to joey and being like i'm still </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like processing what we what we just did </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like i didn't even know how to do it it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was definitely like it wasn't the kind </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of like shows where you're like in a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mosh pit and you're like freaking out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then afterwards you're like damn </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that was [ __ ] awesome that was so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hype hell yeah it was more like the ones </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where you just like you're sitting down </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> quietly after every song finishes you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> clapping and then the next one kicks in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you're just like engrossed it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a full body experience and like with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> some of their songs like oh my god like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> those like speakers that they had at in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this hall they were working overtime bro </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like you could feel this yeah just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> pulsating through your body and you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just sitting there like a 4d movie just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like yeah like just taking it all in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> because you don't know what else to do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah it's crazy oh my god it was it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so amazing i mean like could have been </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like indoctrinated or something because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that was just like how absorbed i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> into this experience you know it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just one of the most it was the most </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> incredible concert i've ever been to i i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> still i'm processing it to this day yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i do not know how to describe beeps and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> boops it was very nice </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you know it's lightning in the bottle </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> man you can't explain that no it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> just i get it i get it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you it's it's impossible to explain how </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a gig makes you feel yeah yeah i i made </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a second channel video like trying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to process it but like even then it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just kind of like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah the entire time i'm just like it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so hard to describe without you being </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there to experience it because there was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> one part i think one of the most </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> powerful parts in this like oh i think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was like what two and a half hour gig </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> or something it was it was quite a long </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like three hours almost three hour game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what made you want to make a video about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it if you couldn't really explain it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because i i don't know so like one of i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think the most amazing parts about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> cigarettes music is that like it they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> utilize silence silence to their </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> advantage </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to like create this like tension in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> their music so there was one part in the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in the concert where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in the middle of the song </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> they just stopped playing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they were just standing there in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> silence for about 30 to 40 seconds </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> but the thing is like a little fart in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the background no no dude i've never </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> heard that was probably what like it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> full capacity right and this place can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hold about eight thousand eight thousand </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people big hole right in order and i've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> never heard 8 000 people being that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> silent in my life there was not a single </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> person talking or making noise during </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> this like 30 40 seconds of silence and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it was the most intense moment i feel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like it was longer than 30 40 40 seconds </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> right because you you had i think i feel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like everyone had the same kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> experience where they stopped the song </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you're just like okay must be moving </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on to the next one yeah and then you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know when someone holds a silence for a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bit too long it starts to become </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uncomfortable so they held it past the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> point of uncomfort that you you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> discovered that it became it went from </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uncomfortable silence to comfortable </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> silence it was such a [ __ ] surreal </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> experience it was if i had to put into </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> words it was the loudest silence i'd </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> ever heard in my life yeah right i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> just like that's that's the best way i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> can describe this because it was one of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> those moments where you just like kind </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of forget to breathe and then once the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> music kicks in you're like oh yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's right now i know where i was sick </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and and and it's so cool as well because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they utilize these like lights in such </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cool ways so like during this silence </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's just this like kind of yellow </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> light that's just like pulsating </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> just silently </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's just going on and on and on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> they're not moving at all not a single </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> note and everyone's just sitting there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just like waiting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it was the it was the weirdest </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> feeling it was so cool i've never seen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> any band do that in a live setting and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm just like the the balls to be able </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to do that and everyone just immediately </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know exactly what's happening being like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> this wasn't like a mistake or anything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> this was just part of the show yeah so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> definitely ten out of ten would go again </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> oh [ __ ] you uh hell yeah ten ten hour </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] ten out of ten yeah easily and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i've been to like a lot of really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] cool concerts but like just this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was more like watching a stage show </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if anything it wasn't like going to go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> see a band it was like if you it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like kind of what you feel after you've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> seen like a life-changing movie mm-hmm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> what what's a life-changing movie for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you well i don't know like batman yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> being like god they're boring </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can never look at batman the same ever </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> again </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but like you know you know there's those </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> movies that just kind of like on a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> personal note that just like viscerally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> hit you to the point where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> after that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> your your standard of movies just change </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah you know so if like for me for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> example like the first i remember like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the first time i watched like pulp </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fiction you know like before that i was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like oh you know movies are cool and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everything and then afterwards there's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just like there's one of those movies </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where you just watch it and you're like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how do you go up from there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know and i and everyone has you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a movie or you know maybe some people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> haven't discovered that movie but like i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> feel for me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that cigarettes concert was that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but for concerts yeah okay so like i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> afraid to go to my next concert because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm like because like it might be just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> go to a really [ __ ] one yeah it might be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] great it might be a band i've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> always wanted to see but i know in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> back of my mind there's going to be that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> one little voice that's like you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's not as good as the serious concert </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you're going to be chasing that high for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> the rest of your life absolutely yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because i i know even because i was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> obviously out there at the concert as </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i i was i was there too i was there too </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> guys guys don't forget about me i was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there life-changing concert guys what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> can i say my life was also changed guys </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> okay do you think okay do you think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there are films that you experience and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you might you might watch right and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's a d there's a big difference </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> between </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> films that are basically made for the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> theater and films that can just be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> watched anywhere because i i feel like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> didn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> because i i didn't really understand the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> whole like cinematic experience and this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is gonna be sounding really cheesy but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the the first [ __ ] movie that made me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> feel that was [ __ ] your name man just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like [ __ ] i i know guys i know your </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> name your name never you'd never watched </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a movie for your name no no no no this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> could be improved in the cinema </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> what yes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i i had never seen a movie in theaters </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that just made me go wow that was that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> was going to [ __ ] up that table </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> for me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> for me that was a cure </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> when i saw when i saw akira in cinemas </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when they redid it for like i think it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was like the 20th anniversary of the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 25th what was this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this was like four or five years ago </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> none of you had ever watched a movie </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> before that and thought damn this would </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> be so good in the movie no no what the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> okay because i i kind of but the thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is i kind of my excuse for that was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> because my dad is a massive film buff he </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> put so much money into like the home </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> surround system still not going to be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's not going to be the same </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> for me i'm like this is good enough yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but but like for me i i've the cinema </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> has always been haha bigger screen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> louder sounds cool </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the way you view music is the way i view </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> films no because it's like your tv is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] all the colors and all the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is wrong it's not what they they wanted </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it to look like it it looks exactly the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> way supposed have you have you tried </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> watching some movies on your tv at home </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it looks like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh most films i watch i feel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you know when when one when i saw </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> anybody when i said </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> silent green they didn't know those </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know it's people when i talk when i talk </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about like when i talk about cinematic </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> experience i don't mean cool you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> this would this experience would be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> improved by watching in theaters because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ninety percent of the time okay yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> okay it wouldn't be you're implying okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no are you saying like your name was the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> first one of me you think i i have to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> watch this in the cinema where i'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> this can only be enjoyed in the cinema </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like to to me no no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to me to me it's something like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> something like your name and i feel like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what's the newest mummer her soda feel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> whether it's like it's like having a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> meal at a an ubereats or a restaurant </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like it's it's like always meant to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> be at the restaurant and yeah you can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have it there no not every film not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> everything i think i feel like 90 80 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> percent of films are just way better in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the cinema do i watch weathering with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you in cinema when it came out and then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i watched it again at home kind of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> same experience </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i can't say but like you know like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> quentin tarantino film like every one of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> those should be watched in the cinema </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> well i never watched paul fiction in the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cinema yeah i never noticed one of my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> favorites but like anyone that comes out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> now i'll try my best to watch them in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the cinema right like i i feel like most </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> films are just so much better in the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cinema because it's like it's like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> way that they they every single aspect </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of the the creation process was with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that screen and that that you know that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> size and the the colors and everything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was all that right that exact </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> specification is it's weird because like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you wouldn't change a you know like when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they reprint the manga it's not like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> different right it's on the it's printed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the way they want it to be printed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> exactly when you read it right but with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the tvs because they all have their own </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] settings and all their own color </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> settings i'm sure you've gone to your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> friend's house one time and thought who </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the [ __ ] did your tv settings it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the contrast is [ __ ] ridiculous okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> so whatever iteration is blowing maybe </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm that guy because i've never thought </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that they probably just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they probably just put it on [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> movie mode and thought that's it that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> for me wait wait wait wait wait wait </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wait hold on can people put it on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> anything but the default settings unless </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they have like a home cinema set because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i've never yes yes i've always just put </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it on default oh my gosh i've never </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> changed my default settings from my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> twitter oh the default is bad it's so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> some tvs right they like add frames okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> no no okay like that pisses me off okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's a different story </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he's doing this [ __ ] like all your tv </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that wasn't an issue before smart tvs </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that was i noticed that i was i was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> why the [ __ ] does this look off because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> we bought like everything was in 24 fps </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm like this looks too real </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like i just don't i don't subscribe </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> to them i'm like this this gay gamers </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have made a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> time i've ever seen the colors are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] too i don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i guarantee you your colors are [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on your tv and when you change them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you'll be like i'm an idiot but you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> don't know because you just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> watching it yeah but i also don't watch </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> movies that often yeah right if you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not watching movies </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i i i'm not even talking i'm not even </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> talking about movies i'm talking about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> any form of media really because like i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> remember your games your game call is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> probably wrong </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like your pc monitor i don't really yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you don't you don't care until you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then you're like god damn it like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> this game was more beautiful because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like you can get these devices that uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> point at the screen yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ghost of tsushima looked beautiful on my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> default setting tv </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it could have looked even more beautiful </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you can get these devices on your pc </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> right because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when you're editing thumbnails yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't you want to know that the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> thumbnail that you're editing is like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the right color because you might be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> editing it on your monitor which is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> wrong colors and you're sending this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thumbnail out and it has different </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> colors yeah but i'm okay because i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> guarantee the majority of other people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who look at that are probably also </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> looking at it so they're defaulting so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the idea is that if you have your </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> monitor on like uh the like most default </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> kind of the the flattest color profile </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um that you know when it gets to an </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> iphone when they change the brightness </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it goes to samsung they change the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> brightness that like you don't you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not like doubly skewing the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the messed upness to it if that makes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sense right you don't want it to be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] on both ends you want to be the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> correct thing on your end so when it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> goes to someone else's device that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's wrong that it doesn't look </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> completely messed up right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because i noticed that uh i used to used </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to have like one or two of my thumbnails </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really weird on some of my friends tv </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and i was like huh and it was because my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> colors on my monitor were like it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the manufacturer's default which is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> awful awful like i had an msi monitor i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't know how they messed up the colors </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> on this monitor so much it was so bad </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right so so bad and it was just like i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't know how to i was what's the right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> color i don't [ __ ] know so you just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> buy this device point it at the screen </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> tells you what to do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm gonna be real dog i've never done </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that in my life </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i've never once noticed but it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> having it's like having a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] pair of pants or something right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you just don't know it's [ __ ] until you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> get a good pair right a lot of the time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't know just like you don't know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's bad </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to me to me my life you don't know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're cycling on a ship bike until </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> someone points it out in the comments </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's just how it is it's like it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like yeah it'll do the job </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you know maybe you want to kind of get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it better i mean i i hope i can see </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> color just fine i think i can i've never </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't know that's red right that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> purple right yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's why we have like this set to like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know a certain color profile so that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it looks the same on every this device </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> this is why i'm not a cinematographer or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like i hate working </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> with like cameras because i just like my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> brain just like doesn't process it it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the same with filming right we filming </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this thing so that when it goes to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> everyone's [ __ ] up tvs that hopefully </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because we filmed it correctly it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> doesn't look as [ __ ] up on that tv </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right right no because what okay because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you'll notice on some screenshots </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from people say picture their tvs </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> sometimes trash tastes way lighter </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sometimes look way darker </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i've never noticed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm not gonna lie dog </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> dead ass it's little things never </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> noticed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> i just you know we just wanted to look </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> good i don't look at the details in my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> brain i'm like are we recording yes or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if it's yes good if it's no bad this is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like the opposite of beeps and boops you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> know yeah it really is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> bits and bobs if you make a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> movie it belongs on the big screen and i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> can't believe that it took your name and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> acura for you to watch them even going </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ah yes big screen good i don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> because like there's there are still </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you're telling me this you're telling me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> james [ __ ] cameron's avatar like was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> dog [ __ ] on a tv that movie was only </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> watchable on a cinema like experience </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> also it was pretty it was amazing it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> a movie </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> even a movie like that that was like mid </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's so so much better </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> because here's here's the thing right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> here's the thing yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm not i'm trying to find a way to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> describe this because you know watching </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> let's say og interviews of like steven </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> spielberg and you know hearing some </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> directors talk about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the art of filmmaking and you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cinema and everything they'd always talk </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about the magic of cinema this feeling </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm just like i'm like i'm like growing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> up i'm like what the [ __ ] are you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> talking about magic of cinema bro it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gonna be like a generation of people who </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> don't go to the cinema this is just a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> marketing point </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm like i'm like you're just trying to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> sell tickets just tell me you're trying </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to sell it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> because you're trying to tell me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yourself it's got too expensive like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> going to the cinema is expensive like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah it's like you know who the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wants to pay to go to all this [ __ ] all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the time yeah i could just watch it at </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> home for free </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what i'm saying is watching your name </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm just like oh i get it that's the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> magic of cinema yeah i get it now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because like i remember when your name </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> came out everyone was just like oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> silent voice is better southern voice is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> better and i'm just like well and you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know technically i think sun voice has </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is has a better plot you know and you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know better written characters but if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're gonna tell me which film i'd </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> rather watch </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in cinemas well silent voice is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> basically an extended tv program versus </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> your name which is i think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a story that was made to be displayed in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> theaters yes whereas silent voice i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think you you know the enjoyment </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> obviously will be increasing theaters </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but i don't think you're losing too much </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> by watching it on your tv or something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like that you know that's that's kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> what i mean that's kind of what i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> saying where there are some films that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> make you feel this magic of cinema and i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thought it was just marketing [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> there's a lot of films you feel like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yes this had to be experienced this way </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah and like us ever since then there's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> been like a few more films like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> especially like seeing the avengers in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cinemas as well that was that was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> something that i think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> lost loses his edge not being </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> experienced with everyone else at the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> same time in cinemas sorry joe you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you've missed the bojo you've missed the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> boat yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> not that i was going to catch that boat </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> anyway </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't know i think maybe it's just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> because i i you know i go to the cinema </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a lot and i enjoy it and i i really i i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> treasure that i experience a lot it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> means a lot to me see but like that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the thing it's like yeah for you that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cinemas for me that's live shows yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right it's like same same same idea just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> different executions because to me what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it sounds it's like you're to me it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like the same way i've been as being </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like just listen to the album why do you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> gotta go and see them live yeah exactly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like it's like it's like i would never </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like it's it's like of course 99 percent </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of music </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> sounds way better in a live setting yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> exactly yeah i must say like auto-tune </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> to [ __ ] and then yeah yeah but i don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> listen to that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah the majority of music or media is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> there's a there's a yes of course the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> best way that you can enjoy why why is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> why is things enhanced by it being live </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know whether it'd be like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> twitch or with like live shows as well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's because it's the communal communal </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> aspect feels like you're in on it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know you you hear about people talk </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about live shows and you know you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something you say is like oh you have to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> be there you have to be there yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it sounds cheesy but like you've </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like when i go to live shows i find it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so hard to verbalize the feeling and the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> experience i felt </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> within that live show versus </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> experiencing that same piece of media </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that same music that same show on a cd </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> or like or or something else </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> what sets it apart i mean i def i mean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> when it comes to like music stuff like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> feel definitely some genres just work </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> better in a cd setting obviously </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> compared to a live show or like they're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not noise that much </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well yeah i mean like i guarantee like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> lot of ambient music is probably gonna </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sound and feel the exact [ __ ] same </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right live or not but like but i think i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think when like musicianship is involved </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with like multiple people or even like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one person and just like the energy you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> feel in that room that you're like oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm experiencing this with everyone else </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i can see the magic being created </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on stage like in person you know it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the difference between like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't know uh [ __ ] seeing a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> painting on a wall versus actually </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> watching the artist paint that same </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> painting right like you'd much rather </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> see the process being done rather than </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just experiencing the result right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> every live show i've been to i'm sure </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can agree with this as well it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like yeah it's it's been way better live </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> seeing it live oh yeah especially like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> musicians and stuff like that especially </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> if they're good musicians like yeah a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> hundred percent maybe if maybe they're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like part of the brain that's like mob </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mentality right where it's like you just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you feed off the crowd and being a part </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of it yeah definitely being in that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> energy you feel like you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh my god i can feed off everyone else </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> getting hyped and i feel like it all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just builds yeah we're weird creatures </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't think lions get hyped about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> other lions </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> oh no man they seem to hype each other </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like yo without hunting the [ __ ] dude </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i mean they hunted but i don't know if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they're getting like they're feeding off </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> each other bro when they when they spot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that elk in the distance they're like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i think it's like a quirk of our </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> evolution </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> into the idea of being a part of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> something big well yeah it's the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> difference between you know a caveman </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> dancing around a fire on his own versus </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a caveman dancing around the fire with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> other cavemen well yeah it's like i if i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> miss a game a league of legends whatever </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> game or a football game which i don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> watch yeah you know i i'm never going to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> go back and watch the vod i don't know i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't know i'm like i want to i want to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> feel you want to be there be there live </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah know that everyone's losing their </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> collective [ __ ] when something crazy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> happens right that's part of the fun </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's why like yeah like as much as i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> love the live show experience and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> watching musicians do stuff live that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> why i very rarely unless it's like my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> favorite band i very rarely watch like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> live dvds or like live footage i hate </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> listening to live concerts and cds i i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> just yeah well it depends how they're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> recorded obviously if it's on a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> iphone then it's going to sound like dog </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] yeah yeah but like some some </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> professionally recorded like live albums </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and stuff like that they can sound </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really good but it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm only listening to that because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's the best that i have because i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wasn't there when it was actually yeah i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> don't know but if i was there when it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was recorded i'm not going to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> listen to it i actually think live </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> recordings okay okay here's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you've just unlocked like a memory i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> guess where if i have the choice to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> download a studio recorded song or a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> live recorded song where i can hear the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> audience reaction i always go for the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> live recording really yeah because i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> just like damn it just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> makes the music sound better and i don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> know why i agree it's like a different </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> energy yeah yeah yeah i just like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> idea that it's kind of like an art piece </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> where it's like you have designed the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> perfect thing that you think this is not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah can you perform it every perfect </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> every time or whatever yeah but maybe </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the roughness of performing it live adds </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> more character too oh yeah i think it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> does hearing you know not sometimes you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you hear like an offbeat note or like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cause something's slightly off tune or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> something like that you know like maybe </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a voice </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i feel like that adds to the music to me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> hearing the perfect studio version isn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> always like the best experience for me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah i've never thought about that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah when when i tried it like on my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> spotify playlist i try to put as many </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> live performances as i can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i hate them yeah i do i think as long as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like maybe with some exceptions like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> some live albums that are like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> exceptionally well recorded other than </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that i don't normally listen to live </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> versions because it's like i would </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> rather listen to this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> actually in person like i don't want to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> live vicariously through a crowd i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> listening through spotify no no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's not like it's not that i don't want </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> to be there of course i want to be there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but like if i if i if i have a choice if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i could cope i'd be like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if i close my eyes i could pretend i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> there okay i can pretend i'm there i say </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this knowing that like deaf punk had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that live album which was sick yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but that's because that was so well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> recorded that was right and it was also </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> completely different to anything else </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that was crazy but if it's the same song </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as the studio version i'd rather listen </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to the studio if i can have around the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> world without people chewing in the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> background i'll just take that one yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but the map </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> makes the song so much more the mashup </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> version is sick though yeah yeah because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's different yeah yeah the defunct </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> live album was okay that's an exception </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that's just mashups yeah it wasn't the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> same song yeah because if the contents </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the only time i would re uh i would </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> listen to a live album is if the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> contents is something that i can't get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> off any studio mm-hmm then it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then that's just like new music yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> right and so it's like hell yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kind of builds in and then the hype kind </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> of builds into it right because it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> built off of that but if it's the exact </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> same song i'd rather just go to their </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> concert see tim to me the crowd </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just by having a crowd there you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> adding like an extra light we should </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> have a crowd trash taste episode that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> would be interesting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> we need a live studio audience trash </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> takes is filmed in front of a live </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> studio audience </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> shout out to our live tour by the way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> let's see what the tour is going to be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> come come see we need to we need to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> start the tour we need to start every </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> tour with this is done </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah but like if we do another tour just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> every time we just got to start it off </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> with this this show is performing in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> front of a live audience </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'll do that i'll be the guy i'll just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> do it he should just slap bass </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i don't know it's it's weird how </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> just adding an audience to something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just makes it incredibly more hype for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> me it's it's like everything except for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> sitcoms i [ __ ] [ __ ] hate like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> worse the water </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i absolutely hate when sit come remember </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this when sitcom went through it like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's canned laughter phase and sometimes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it wasn't even canned laughter sometimes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there was an actual live studio audience </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i like to argue that's still happening </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is it in a lot of ways the best one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah that's not still gone going is it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is that i thought </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> big bang theory is still not gone i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> sure though they're still i'm sure </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> they're this is this are they still </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> making episodes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that's what i thought </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm sure there's still a bunch of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sitcoms we just don't know about that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> have canned laughter including so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> because now that's just like a staple of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> sitcoms now did frasier </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah frasier had it friends malcolm in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the middle no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> didn't have it oh really yeah yeah it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> didn't have it also wait what's the one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm thinking of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> uh two and a half minutes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> in the middle was amazing what's what's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the most popular sitcoms nowadays </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because you know i i look at sitcoms now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm like i never always </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> barely ever watch </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> brooklyn nine-nine that doesn't have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> canned laughter yeah yeah cause it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like because i i've i feel like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's very very popular yeah am i crazy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is that the most popular one i don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> know i'm not sure </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> all right most successful sitcoms what's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the most popular one most popular right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah because like i remember you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know back back in the day we'd have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> things like friends </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you know friends and um </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like frasier and other like super mega </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> popular super mega popular sitcoms like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that and you know not to say that it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> weren't funny but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i it seems like sitcoms now are going </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> through a phase where they've just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> removed the can laughter and i'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> thank [ __ ] thank god for that because i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> feel it was like such a rare occasion </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where adding canned laughter to a sitcom </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> actually enhanced the comedy like in my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> head i think the only two shows that i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thought were like genuinely watchable </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and funny at times that had canned </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> laughter was probably friends and i t </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> crowd </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like other than those two shows i'm just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just it's just like it's i don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> know it's mocking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> where it's like please laugh now you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know it's like i actually that's the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> reason i didn't like it crowd really it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was that one show everyone's like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this this is amazing it's so funny it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> really good i think it's really history </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i think it's one of the rare exceptions </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where it was like the comedy itself was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> actually so funny in a lot of episodes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where i could ignore the candle after </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right you know but like there's a lot of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> shows like say like big bang theory </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where it's like the jokes are like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> subpar at best and then the it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the canned laughter is like laugh now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where it's like it's instructing you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when to feel emotion and i'm like no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's not how comedy works well that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> just like the thing that i could not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> stand on my camera and why i couldn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> get into the i.t crowd is because what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> can laughter does is that it [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> messes up with the pacing of the comedy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or the show because people have to pause </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's literally say a joke pause for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> laughter right and and you basically </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> subconsciously telling people okay this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> is one to laugh right whereas when i see </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something funny and happening in real </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> life you don't [ __ ] pause for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> laughter well i'm not pausing every time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> okay well then what about like every </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like stand-up comedy show every star </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that's also a big reason why i've never </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> been like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you don't like stand-up content i'm not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a fan of stanford oh really yeah i love </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> stand-up comedy yeah i'd much rather </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> watch stand-up special over any sitcom </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> to be honest um because like for one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's not candle after it's yeah it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> real it is real laughter but there's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> also they still do that thing where like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot of their jokes are designed where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> they would say a punch line and then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they would pause to leave enough space </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for the crowd to hopefully laugh at the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> joke right and i feel in a lot of like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really good stand-up shows i mean i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not a [ __ ] stand-up spo uh you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> expert or whatever but like i've seen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> enough where like i've noticed a pattern </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> where a lot of the best comics they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> purposely make the joke flow to the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> point where that pause that they add </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> between a punch line and the next thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> they're going to say it enhances the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> comments yeah yeah and it's like and i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> feel like that's no different to how </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like shows like it crowd or friends did </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it where like the the joke is usually </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> structured around the pause </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but like there's a lot of shows like say </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> big bang theory it's just like it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> doesn't really work because of the flow </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of the conversation it just really seems </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> unnatural i have this weird relationship </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with stand-up comedy actually because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's it's been like this way my entire </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> life where you know with cam laughter </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and with you know being filmed in front </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> of a live cd audience if i feel like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they are telling a joke my subconscious </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> brain just goes you are playing a you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> laugh you lose challenge right now you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so you like the dry humor i oh well yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i [ __ ] love dry hair </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i am british i also like dry humor but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the iot crowds are my favorites yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah because yeah okay but then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> here's the question have you ever gone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to see stan will call me live i haven't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no i haven't yet it's good i i feel the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> one where it's like the live aspect </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> makes it a million times i can i can i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> can i can i can see that yeah because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> when you're in an audience then you kind </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> of want to laugh yeah i've never asked </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this are you guys musical guys do you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> guys like musicals i like musicals </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> enjoy i wouldn't say i'm a musical guy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm not like an iceberg but i like i've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> seen a lot of music yeah i've never been </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that guy who's like gone out of his way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to go see musicals but every time i have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i've just had like a brilliant time i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> don't really like musicals </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh i thought you were gonna lean on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> being like i love musicals let me talk </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> about it musicals you know what any </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> musicals </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> there's always that one because my my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> hands down that's enough my hands down </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> favor will always be rocky horror </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> pictures so you're gonna ask what are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you gonna say like les miserables </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that the only one you've watched no i've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> watched um </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> okay i haven't liked everything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i've watched that i've watched book of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> mormon yeah that's a great great musical </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> watch them on movies well that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> probably what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i hate musicals and movies as well i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sing i hate when they sing i don't want </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to see i want to see a story i want to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] hear them sing i think i think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> again the only musical movie that i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really enjoy was rocky i love plays i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> love watching plays live i hate watching </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people sing live like like i'm not in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like a concert setting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i actually like i i hate musical in film </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> forms you know i heard musicals i'm so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> when it's in stage form that's actually </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the only times i've ever liked it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i can appreciate how like how talented </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and how you know how much work goes into </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it yeah it's very demanding but i just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't really like it yeah i love plays </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah i think i think i know i i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> think i understand your hate for like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> musical or like musical numbers in too </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> many beats and boobs it just feels like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it like rips you out of the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like the flow right now i get that i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> think i think that you feel that way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> because for the most part the storyline </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> itself is like very serious and it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> told in like a cinematic yeah yeah and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> then all of a sudden it like cuts to a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> musical right yeah which is just like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> polar opposite but that's why i think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> rocky horror was such a great movie </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because that storyline does not take </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> itself seriously okay the entire time so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it feels </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> less jarring when it goes into a musical </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> number because the non-musical parts are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just as [ __ ] ridiculous </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so like but like that's another big </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> reason why i like i mean among many </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> reasons why i like the cats movie </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] sucked right yeah because like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for one it looks horrible but two it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a serious story right that just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> looks goofy yeah and so that goofiness </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is just enhanced when it goes into a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> musical number yeah which sucks because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you see cats like on a live stage </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's [ __ ] amazing it's it's such a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> great musical life </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like which is why i was so i mean which </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is one of the many reasons why i saw the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> trailer to the cat's movie and i'm just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like oh god why did you do this it's so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bad it's like it's like it's like seeing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the trailer to like the worst </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> live-action anime film you've ever seen </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah it was really really it was it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> feels horrible what about like films </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that have been turned into musicals have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you ever like experienced that i heard </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that back to the future one was okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it was a back to the future music </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there was a back to the future one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> apparently it's pretty good i saw the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> death note musical </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> damn that sounds fun </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i felt like i was on drugs while i was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> watching that show i'm like this is not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> a real thing i'm watching because it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> again going back to that whole like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> adding musical numbers in a very serious </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> storyline like you can't get more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> serious than a death note storyline </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right and then all of a sudden light </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just like busts into this musical number </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of how he's gonna kill every criminal in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the world i'm just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i knew you were a psychopath character </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but now you sound even more like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> actually </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you know i can actually kind of see it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yo yo you you you hear else theme you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know what the [ __ ] doo doo doo doo </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> doo and you think that's that's a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] fat beat you know you yeah but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like that okay i understand if you're in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> a musical setting you hear the else </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> theme and then it like busts into a trap </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> beep and then they just start dancing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> live on stage but that's not what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> happens </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> theme goes so hard are you kidding me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that that [ __ ] moment where the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> guitar kicks in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> bro that that was made for a musical man </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know what i'm saying you know what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm saying yeah it's it's uh it's a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> really fascinating i actually really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> want to go see more like anime like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> musicals just because it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> one of the most unique </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> entertainment </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cells at work one as well i remember </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that yeah there was a prince of tennis </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> one as well there was a free one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> uh they did a lot they have my hero </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> oh my name is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [Music] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> chocolate factory that was good it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really good musical numbers in it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the gene wilder one yeah that's what the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> musical number in it has numbers in it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like um oh oh yeah i guess i guess some </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> other has some other moments where it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of musically yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i wouldn't say it's traditional but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i think the reason why that worked </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is because the story is just so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ridiculous yeah that it just matches </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that world yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> death note you guys watched any like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> traditional plays live i was actually </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> going to say like i tell you what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this weird rabbit hole i've fallen down </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in recently </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh i've been watching like clips of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> rakugo </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh dakugo is fantastic yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> rakugo is like a traditional style of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> japanese storytelling it's it's stand-up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's original stand-up comedy yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's it's like they're not standing up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah they're literally like sitting down </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you take stand up right and you just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> restrict basically everything so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you're not allowed to like walk around </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you have to sit down in one tiny spot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and all you have as a prop is a fan and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that's it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and using just that they have to convey </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the story which isn't always funny </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sometimes it's like serious story </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's that's all you have to use to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like convey the story and so there is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> down comedy yes it's stand up comedy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this is a sit down comment yeah but the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> reason i got into it was because i've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> been i had to read like i kind of uh is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it akane banshee banashi </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which is like a new shonen jump a manga </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so that that got me really interested to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> be like okay yeah i know how they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> portray in manga and everything but how </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> does actually look in real life and i've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> never just like appreciated just this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's really is like an art form of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> storytelling because we've just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> such </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you see with like such </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> subtle changes in expressions and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mannerisms they like these rocket </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> performers are able to just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> absorb you into this story into this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> world with just like very subtle changes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in their face and just their mannerisms </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and i'm like this is [ __ ] incredible </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like i should not be this invested in a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> story where this guy's just sitting down </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> with playing around with the fan yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i don't know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's almost like it's weird it's almost </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like cause i've been to a rocco show </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> before because my grandma's really into </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it um and it was really weird because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like even if you don't fully comprehend </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like say the bot of the joke or the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> point of the story is that the intention </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of the book yeah the bot of the joke </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like you know like the the the joke </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> even if you don't comprehend like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> joke or the the meaning behind the story </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or whatever like it's still just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> enthralling to watch it especially if </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's a really good performer yeah yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> to just sit him sit there and it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he's just like writing a book in front </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of him yeah and you you can fully </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> envision everything he's saying and just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> get like engrossed being like so so what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> happened after that yeah it's it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when you go to like a [ __ ] family </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> reunion and you just have like that one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uncle who's just really good at </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> storytelling and it's like i might not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> even care half the time about what the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> actual story is but i just want to keep </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> listening of like that it kind of brings </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you back into that zone where you're a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> kid and your parents would like read you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like story time books or whatever and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're like oh well what happens next </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> what happens next you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i kind of like that same feeling but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> just as an adult and uh yeah i never </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> would have like got into it if not for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like anime and manga and it was just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like i'm surprised it was that one and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not raku shinjuku that got you into it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> okay cause like i i think uh i i watched </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> raku shinju and that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i felt more focused on the drama aspect </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah where this is more like okay let's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> take rakio and just shown shonen shonen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's shown in fire shonen fire i was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> trying to make a word out of it but it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like this this this actress who this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> performer who wants to be the best </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> racket performer of all time and you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know that should they have like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> power-ups </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [Music] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no they have like training arcs </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> in our basket </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can rotate this thing 360 degrees in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> 0.1 seconds </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> basically that's how the guests like i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can throw </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> hemorrhoids now he has to become a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> stand-up comedian like no he has to like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> slightly lift his butt on me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh my god it enhanced the story </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh my god yeah so that was like i would </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> love to see a raccoon performance live </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because if i got that engrossed watching </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a youtube video which is normally i hate </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> watching what live performances on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> youtube then i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i would wonder what it would be like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> being in that room and just hearing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> hearing the performer actually do it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's that's the kind of the same with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like kabuki or like normal you don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> always need to understand everything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah honestly i i i speak english </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and i watch shakespeare and i didn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know what was happening but i had an </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> amazing time yeah i i think that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> if you go to london you should watch try </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and look to see if there's a shakespeare </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> performance oh i want to watch a show </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> live i've never seen like a shakespeare </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> story live dude in the globe it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] awesome yeah uh unless you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> standing or a polls blocking your way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all right there's some seats that are </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sold as like a pole that's blocking your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> view </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because it's traditional </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because it's it's literally a replica </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because you just have to like kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] literally yeah you literally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have to just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the whole time wow sometimes some </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> traditions shouldn't be kept </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> tradition so the building burned down </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> right yeah they remade it one to one and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah if you want to stand in like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> pit you stand there like four hours </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> standing below the stage looking at the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> stage because that's how you get you get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the peasant experience you literally get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> the fastest except you're paying for it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah it's very cheap though down on the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> bottom yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah it's really really affordable these </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> things unless you want them like really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i thought to myself i've been in enough </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mosh pits while i'm standing up for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> hours at a time where i could probably </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> do that but like it's kind of like being </SPEAKER_03>
