<SPEAKER_01> (yelling) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Probably do a (yelling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> montage one day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, no, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - But like a fast cut, just like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (yelling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - At the beginning of every
fucking Trash Taste podcast. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Just one of us going. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (yelling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm waiting for the day that
someone just like samples, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> all of our audio and just makes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a low-fi beat out of it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do it.
- Do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (mellow music playing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Hello and welcome to Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The anime podcast, where
we talk about Japan, food </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> shitting and occasionally anime. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I am your host for today, Gigguk. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And with me, are the boys. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's our new tagline.
- As always. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Isn't it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I was just like, well, what is a tagline </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that could go well with Trash Taste? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that sounds about right.
(Gigguk laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like that's probably
(Gigguk laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> the most accurate.
(Gigguk laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - The anime podcast. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Anime podcast where it's 5% anime, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Gigguk] Exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - 95% everything else. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - But how are you guys doing?
- Good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> How are you boys doing?
- Good. Good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Doing all right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Since last week </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we spoke about Claymore
and I was like fuck it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll read Claymore. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And it was really good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You literally just finished it like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Gigguk] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Two minutes before we started recording. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But to be fair,
(laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> If you haven't read Claymore
and are thinking about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Don't worry about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You don't need to know anything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Manga's good until the halfway </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then it kind of just goes a bit shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, second half's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> definitely underwhelming.
- The *star's amazing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Gigguk] Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like a lot of
anime or manga do this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Where they build up like
this fucking amazing world </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that I think is too big of a scope. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then they just *let like fuck, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we need to finish this.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like within like 200 chapters.
- Mm. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - How do we do that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Gigguk] Yeah.
- Well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think for a lot of the times, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> at least with like Shonen Jump </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cause *claim was from Shonen Jump. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> A lot of the times the authors
don't really have a choice </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> as to how long it goes for. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right.
- I feel like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Shonen Jump goes through the same problem. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> As you know, a lot of American
TV shows where, you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you have some like rare, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like something like
Breaking Bad for example, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like a rarity where
a show just gets better, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it hits its peak and then it
stops, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But the problem which
- Then better call Saul </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> comes along. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But that's more like a spinoff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think Better Call Saul's
better than Breaking Bad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh. Okay. You're one of those. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think it's really fucking good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (mumbles)
- No. You're one of those. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're one of those. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think it's really
fucking good. I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I haven't seen either
one so I can't say. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay. Yeah, go on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> But yeah, the problem with a lot of it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like Shonen Jump Manga, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is that the most of the time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they either go on for too
short or they get dragged out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You either you're either like
a Bleach or you are something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that gets canceled early, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like most other Shonen Jump shows. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. That's the thing is right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Is that like with Shonen Jump, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> they have every month they have rankings. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And if you have even just
a slight dip in popularity, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then they're kind of just
like well time to wrap it up, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> boy oh. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> *And the author's like well,
I, I just, I just got started. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, it doesn't matter. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> You got to wrap it up.
- I- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I wonder if that's what
happened, but to be fair, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when I was reading this it's 150 chapters. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Around like the 80th
is, I was like, ah, yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this isn't going to end like great. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh*!
- It ended. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> which is better than most. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, you know, yeah.
It's better than like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> what happened to like Yuyu Hakusho right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like the last doctor's got
completely fucking gutted. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, you can tell
when an, when an author </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just like has to wrap things up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> in five chapters or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, yeah.
- It's just like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah. True, true. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Some, some, some stuff that
they've been building up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for like a hundred to 200
chapters just gets wrapped up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in 10 chapters and you're
like, what the fuck was this? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like, cool. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then there's like
the opposite of that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> with what's the Manga
cover Hunter Hunter called? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Togashi.
- Togashi. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Togashi. Yeah, he introduces
like the dark continent </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when he can't make one chapter. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And he's like, how about I
just expand the world tenfold. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I tweeted out about it the
other day, but I found out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the other day that in
the span that it took </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Togashi to release chap- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Volume 32 to 33, Assassination
Classroom started and ended. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing)
- Oh my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> So if you don't know, Hunter
Hunter has been on hiatus. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Not hiatus. Basically, we had a chapter </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like once every two years. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, it's definitely a hiatus. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah. We got a check </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> once or two years.
- H X H is short for hiatus </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and hiatus.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - What counts as a hiatus nowadays? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Is, is it like a Hunter Hunter hiatus </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> or Berserk Mura* hiatus. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean kind of the same thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean it's just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe it's just a very
slow release schedule, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - True, true, true. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But have you seen some of
Hunter Hunter's latest chapters? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Have you seen some of the
dark continent chapters? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I've read. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've seen like some of the later chapters </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and some of them are just
literally there are pages </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that it's just all texts. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> `There's like one character
and it's literally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I actually saw it on Twitter, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. It's just a full page of text. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And at this one, I'm just like Togashi, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you want to write a light novel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just write a light novel. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - This Manga * is just
somehow like writing a book </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> without realizing, I don't
know how you do that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, he's kind of releasing volumes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on the schedule of like
light novel volumes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Exactly. It's like, why, why </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> why are we pretending that
this is a Manga anymore? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - And like the drawings? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh my God. Like-
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Just hire
- I mean. It's like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Hire someone on deviant art man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Just do it already like.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What's going on?
- Well, wait. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> What I want to know is like
cause I don't think Togashi </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> uses assistance. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Maybe. Probably not. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Would spend a lot.
- Probably not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because if not you'd think-
- This is all assumptions, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - You'd think that he'd get
assistance to draw, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Meilyne] Wife. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - His wife? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, well yeah. His wife
is the author of Sailor. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Shit. So I guess.
- Almost dissed on his wife. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - We dissed one of the greatest
* Manga authors of all time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> All right, listen. Hunter Hunter. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If you haven't read or
seen it, just do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's amazing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But be prepared for I guess
- I just say </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - To never be felt complete.
- So here's the thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I haven't read Hunter Hunter at all, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Gigguk] Yeah.
- But I have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> all of the volumes up until this point. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Honestly, watch the anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The anime is so fucking good.
- Yeah. No- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - The anime's great. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's one of the few anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that I think is better than the manga. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And that's because-
- The 2011 version? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah The 2011 version.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because some of the later like arcs, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> especially the Chimera Ant arc </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Togashi's arc is really up and down. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because of, you know his
health complications. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That was going through but like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the anime is just consistent throughout. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So then when he doesn't
know, I would recommend him </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> because I'd recommend-
- Because I know so much about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the series, like of like
characters and like *yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (mumbles) you know.
- I know so many references </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but I've actually sat down a read a lot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh my God.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think I know enough
about Naruto to like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> to like lie
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my way through a conversation and be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) oh yeah, the leaf village? Crazy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I could probably lie my way
through a Fullmetal Alchemist </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> conversation.
- Yeah *(laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I have done many times. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Ah , man. That's just so sad bro. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean let's be real! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, I feel we've all done that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where like everyone around you is talking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about an anime and you kind
of just like, huh yeah. That. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> That thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - For like five years, I was an anime fan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who hadn't watched *Stephen galleon. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> People would be like, dude, it's Epic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, yeah dude. Get in the robot.* </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, my dad hates me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, dude. Love that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Love the part where the mechs* fight. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's just crazy.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just do that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I admittedly did that a
little bit with, with Bleach. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's when you're insecure, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. I did that for a while with Bleach </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> because I didn't, I
dropped it at the Eisenach. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So anything after that,
I had no fucking idea, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but people around me kept
reading it and they were like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah! You know, the whole
like wicked *mundo stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, yeah, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that thing. Yeah.
- Whack a mundo?* </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> That thing. Totally. *munjo.
- To be fair. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> To be fair, which is one of, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one of those anime or manga that you could </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you could feasibly lie your
way out of it and make it seem </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like you've seen it without having seen it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> after you've watched like
a further first few arcs, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then you kinda just kinda just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you kinda can just
bullshit your way through. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I too also want </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to see more bang kae*
- I feel like this thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> One Piece, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause One Piece is so long. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like the Simpsons, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Where everything that could ever happen </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> has probably happened.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So you could be like,
dude, my favorite episode </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is where like Homer Simpson
becomes a crack addict. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's probably an episode
on the Simpsons, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean You can probably do
that with One Piece right now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause you're the only
one who hasn't seen it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> So you can just randomly be like, yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I love that episode with
*Loofy and Chopper make out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I love the ep- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I love the part where the pirates </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> find another band of pirates
that are bad initially </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and then turn and are a
part of some military. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then they're like,
do let's just be good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Let's help Loofy out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah. The water seminar.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is that like a thing?
(mumbles) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - That probably happened.
- Probably. Something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - That was vague enough that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - If I keep it vague </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that could be about four
different arcs of One Piece. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yes. I know enough base
information about One Piece. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I still haven't read it yet. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Again, I downloaded some episodes,
some chapters on my phone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> but maybe, maybe one day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - So you're downloading a
lot of chapters now. I see. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> No, I have like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I have like 10 volumes
downloaded, which isn't much. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - How far into it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't fucking know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, because we're approaching what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Volume a hundred of One Piece. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - We were approaching chapter a thousand, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I think all the way which is
going to be a landmark and yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. Whoa.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - A thousand chapters. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's-
- Can you imagine? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Fucking a thousand. Every week. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> A thousand chapters. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I cannot fucking imagine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's a thousand
weeks at least minimum. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because what I-
- Has he married the author? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think so. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I think so.
- It's kind of interesting. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> because, yeah.
- Meyner* be the fact checker. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's kind of interesting
actually because Oda Eiichiro </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Oda Eiichiro </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like you can't be
married and make One Piece. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like it's, it's pick one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, it's so interesting
because like I feel not a whole- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - He is married.
- He is married. Okay, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> because like not a whole
lot about Oda is even known. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Because he's so rarely what
makes any like TV appearances </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> or like interview appearances. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause it's too busy fucking
writing a chapter a week, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - He's not just doing that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause Oda out of every
author is way more involved </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> in the anime production as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [*] Right, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Because normally-
- he helps produce, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, yeah. Normally a
lot of Amie productions </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people were just like,
okay, there's the author. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then the author just get sidelined </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they just continue doing that stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And maybe they'll watch
the anime, you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> But you know, Oda's been involved </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in a lot of the anime
production, which I did... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Where does he find the time to do this? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Ah, like as a sh-
this man is like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> a time management machine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - As a Shonen Jump author, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know how you can have a life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like most authors don't have a life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> outside of their magazine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, most of them
have health complications </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because of how much they work. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Not to mentioned that like I swear </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with every new chapter
odors, art is just evolving. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Like it's getting more, like some </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of the recent chapters
are so fucking detailed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Where it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> how do you draw this in a week? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. Exactly. Why
people like to piss on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> One Piece character designs </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because oh it looks good cartoonish. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Looks childish.
- They do look fucking weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They do look weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, but at least it's like so distinct </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to the point where you can look
at a character and be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> oh yeah that's a One Piece character. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Gigguk] Yeah.
- Yeah. True. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> You can say about Simpsons, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but you know what I mean like.
- Well, yeah! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Or Family Guy character.
- Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Maybe. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - But I would argue
that that's better than </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> a fucking generic Goss looking
character that could fit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> into any like, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> show of that caliber, right?
- I mean it's way- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Any one of Oda's character
designs is way more memorable </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> here's generic Isokai* </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> protagonist number 75
- That's true. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that looks like Kerato, just re-skinned*, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you know what I mean?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's, that's what I think. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think that's my biggest
problem with a lot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of light novel adaptations
is that you can tell lighten </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> of adaptations nowadays </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> by just by just the character design. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How they look </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - And just the art style as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. Because the character
designs haven't changed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from like 10 years ago.
- Yeah, I know, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like good-looking
boy with average proportions </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with a spiky hair, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> color it in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> A weird color? There you go.
- Exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like even a lot of
like the girls as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause I think one-
- Here's pink haired </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> character. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, like one of my favorites </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> One of my favorite female
characters to come out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of recent times is *my Sacra d Jima </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from Bonnie Gail senpai.*
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And like, I really liked all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of the cast there and all of
the characters, but my God </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they have such forgettable
character designs. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [*] Yeah.
- You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Compared to some of, some of
the characters times from say </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like *Mona Guthrie or something
like that, which you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it gets compared to, compared a lot to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I see the same charm, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but in terms of the memorability
of the character designs, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's just *bunny Girl's senpai just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> looks like the most generic. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Well, I mean, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that's why they had to-
- well to be honest, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's actually of the
reasons I just didn't watch it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's why they had to put
her in a bunny costume, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Gigguk] Exactly
(laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - To like differentiate between </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> all the other characters.
- Exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because there's a
lot of anime characters </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> just like silhouette or eyes, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You can just know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right. And like, you
know, I would argue again </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like that's one of the strong
suits about one piece, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Is that like, because the character </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> look so fucking wacky.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You can immediately tell </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's a One Piece character.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - And it's the way I
describe Oda is it's some, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like you're reading
a story with, from someone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> who has the imagination of a ten-year-old </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but the writing skills
of like Joe R R Martin </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or something like that,
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's so weird because you see a character </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like this cross-dressing
ballerina, for example. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And you're like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what is this wacky character?
- Number three?* </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Mr. Two*
- Mr Two* </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean Mr. Two.
- So yeah, Mr. Two. Mr Two.* </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What the fuck? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I always get the numbers mixed up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Mr. Two* bond clay summer </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Mr. Green eggs and ham.
(mumbles) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He's great. He's great.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I love that guy.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But yeah, you see his character design </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> for the first time and
you're just like this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm never going to give
a about this character </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then he ends up in later arcs </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bringing you to tears sometimes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And just like, how did this happen? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> How, how does he make,
how did Oda make me care </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about this person right now
that you can see on screen? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Anyone who hasn't watched One
Piece is probably looking at </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this being like what the fuck?
- Who is this clown? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Who is this literal clown?
(laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know what I mean?
(laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's your mon- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> your weekly jack off to One Piece </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> segment of the podcast.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - As we're going to do
every week now for example. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - We are we going to do
every week until you- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Until you start reading it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - If I read it, well this will become </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a fucking One Piece podcast. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, no. No it won't. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> No it won't. But it might
become more of a Manga podcast. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - My, my I'll spend like
20 hours reading a Manga. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> My review will be like,
yeah, it's all right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - So wait, so what would you
give out of 10, Claymore? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Six. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Six?
- Six? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - See I don't want to read </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> anyone else's reviews of Manga. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> At all.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't want to know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause I feel like right
now, because I don't- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - All right, I'm gonna head out. (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't touch anything with reviews. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in terms of Manga. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know what the popular opinion is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know if I should go to a thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think it's good or bad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just see something
I'm like, I'll read that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and make up my own choice. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Kind of like it there in my own bubble </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> of like,
- That's fair enough. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't give a shit
what anyone else thinks. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's weird. Right? Because
I feel like manga readers </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just exist in their own bubbles, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause when we talk about
the anime community </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> most people refer to it as like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the Anime and Manga community. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's we kind of, we're kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we're kind of assumed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that we're just synonymous
with each other, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But then there are times
when I just kind of realized </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I have no idea what's going on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in the Manga world sometimes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like there's this recent
airing Anime right now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> called a Horimia. That-
- The fuck is that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, exactly.
- Ah, so good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Exactly Mayline* just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like Evangelic
- [Mayeline] Favorite Manga </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The Manga's favorite Manga </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> according to Mayeline.
- The Manga is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> fucking awesome. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> When the anime is getting adapted. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> There was like so many </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Manga readers that would just
- They come out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - They just come out, just
come out and say, Oh my God, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is my favorite Manga. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I fucking love this Mongo. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And here I'm thinking
where where's is this rock </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you're all living on? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> What is this rock? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - This is the thing, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I say six out of 10 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I'm sure that they're like me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They're like, I forget about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> But when the animation out announced </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, yo, yo,
(laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's my fucking favorite.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I love that one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I read that ages ago. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I loved that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, because the thing is,
I had never heard of Horimia. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Before the anime got adopted
this winter season, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [*] Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was just like, it
must be a pretty, like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it must have like a cult
following or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So search it up and-
- Oh it has a cult following </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all right.
(laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it is following it is the 13th </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> most popular Manga of all
time on my anime list. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm just like, how have I never </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how have I never heard this name before? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Or how's no one discussed
this in my presence before? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I thought.
- Reading bad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, that's the thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's what I find so interesting about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the Manga wall is that even if
it's like universally praised </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and credited as being
this most amazing piece </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of work right in the Mongo wall, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just really surprising how few people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in the Anime community
actually know about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, I guaran-fucking-tee. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Not many people know
about like Oyasumi Punpun. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Even though I think it's like the second </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or third highest rated Mongo on Val*. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel like I feel like, I
dunno some like sane in Manga. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You, you have like the sane* in big four. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think you have like, Binland* saga </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Always the fucking big numbers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It is cause it's not
quite the medium for it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why, why why always the big one? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The small four! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What happened to the top?
(laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That, that describes things pretty well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We should rename it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (mumbles) like the giga four or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Gigic four. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It might be, might be three. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can't remember cause it's it's all. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Which ones are you referring to? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know the crowd that
always talk about Vinland Saga. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's either Vinland Saga,
Berserk or a fucking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Kamuy? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Fuck. Vagabond. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh Vagabond. Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think there's one more. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That is in that genre that everyone keeps. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Maybe Golden Kamuy? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, that's not Golden Kamuy, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but maybe it's just a big three. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Maybe, maybe I'm just imagining things. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But like, I feel like a lot
of sane in Manga gets talked </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> about as like these masterpieces,
you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But some like slice of
life, romance, manga </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like Horimia that is
apparently very popular. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Just don't get talked about
in the same sphere and- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, I would argue
that like even the big </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the big three scene, and I
guess we've coined it now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like *Bailey had told us about light. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It upsets me how few people
know about like Vagabond. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Really? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. I feel like a lot of
people know about Vagabond. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I know about Vagabond.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing)
(mumbling) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Damn it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I know it is a title that exists. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I know absolutely nothing about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> So vagabond essentially is
a it's a samurai Mongo*. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But I would, but it's done by the author </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> who did Slam Dunk. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh, that sounds cool.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So you know where somehow
not only managed to make one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> of the greatest sports Manga ever made </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but also one of the greatest
samurai Manger ever made. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Gigguk] Yeah.
- Mm. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - How many chapters is it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Still going?
(sighs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's still ongoing but it's- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's on hiatus. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know what it is about this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know, the, the brutal scene in Mongo </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> where they get up to
like 200 or 300 chapters </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and the author's like
aight, I'm a head out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'll take a break.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I think at least the Manga I've read. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It feels like they build up
like a really cool world. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And again, they just like,
it either gets too big </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they're just like, well
I've gotta reign this in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It just gets way too big </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and it ends with like so many
fucking things not explored. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, cause cause like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Going back to Hunter Hunter. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Like it got up to a point
where I'm just like, this is a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this is a comfortable place to end it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> This is a comfortable
place to like try it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, no, it definitely
could have ended it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then she introduces the dark continent </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which without spoiling the exact </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> details of it is
- Fuck outta here. No one's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> ever gonna see the end of it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - You have this, you have this world </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's a gushy buildup in Hunter Hunter. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it was like, how, how long was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like the run, whatever, the 148 episodes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, 148 episodes, right?
- Jesus. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right. And it ended to a point where you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> explored everything you needed
to explore about the world. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And he went on hiatus and
everyone was just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh you know, HunterxHunter </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> must be coming to an end.
- Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then he comes back and
he's just like, J K by the way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this is just one fifth of the world. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's...
(laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I hate it when they do
that, man, like don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> don't come here and
pull it out of your ass. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like a fucking like
parody iPhone presentation. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, but wait, there's more </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, wait, but no stop, stop. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> They shouldn't be as cool as the idea is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of like expanding the world. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's honestly one of the things </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That makes me roll my eyes, emotion. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've been reading manga
lately is when that like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but there's another continent or planet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm like, Oh, for fuck's sake </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> There is not going to be
another planet that is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> going to be satisfied.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's, that's exactly how
I felt when like, you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> in like dragon ball, when
they started expanding </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on like multi-verse and
shit I was like, bro </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I thought like I thought
like blowing up planets </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and like taking over the
universe was hard enough. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And now it's like, well, you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> there's like seven more
universes out there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that we can explore as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It gets my chub like softer
than hearing multi-verse </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or like expanding the
universe out of like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think the one thing I
hate the most is how like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't mind them like
introducing that kind of thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If they Actually follow through with it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah. But the problem
is they'll just drop it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> In like a chapter there'll
be like, Oh, by the way </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There's other worlds.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's like no there wasn't.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There was never, you never made this mango </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> with other worlds in mind. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You liar, you're adding this now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, that is true.
- Cause like okay back. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Sorry to bring it up again. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> For like the ninth time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But like what I was reading Claymore </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they just casually
mentioned that like there's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> two worlds having a
wall and then it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Never brought up again
and then it just ends. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And we never hear anything
about the other world. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's apparently having a war. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Whoa. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So everyone gets to go alone happy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But the whole reason
why this world exist is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because there was a war and
this is like a testing.* </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's really bullshit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I don't, I don't
like it when they do this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Especially when the
Manga is like, you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's been going on for a long time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it already feels like
it's stretching thin. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then they're like nother world, baby. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, no, no, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no, no, no.
- True, true, true. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because I think you said
if they build it up fine </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but when they just drop it, I hate it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, you sometimes see
these plot points in Manga. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's just like dropped. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And for some reason you just never </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> never hear about it again,
like aside from other worlds </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the biggest example I can
think of is the Gantz Manga. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I love that one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I was so dumb. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. Well I just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> remember when there were vampires in it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and that was a big plot point,
- Oh yeah, there was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then they just disappeared.
like the vampire gang. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just never heard about it again. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - There's a lot of stuff in Gantz. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So if you haven't read
Gantz, I guess you could. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's very long. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's written... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> The artwork is fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We spoke about it before,
but yeah, randomly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> halfway through, they introduced vampires </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> into a world that never had vampires </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and then they just never come up again. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Not going to lie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I barely remember
any of it because I think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> at that point I kind of
just like erase the front. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, this is so dumb. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't even want to
like put it's a memory. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just kind of, I
always offhand remember </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, sometimes you
just get flashbacks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You wake up at night sweating. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh God. There was vampires!
- You wake up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - You wake up and you just
like whatever happened </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to those vampires?
(laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where did they disappear to? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They were built up as like
the big fucking villains </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> or something.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And then they just, they
just went nowhere with it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. I guess that's the problem </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of when you're like
serializing a Mongo every week. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I wonder how much of it like
is actually planned before </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and how much it just feels
like it's falling apart. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Which is why the The more manga I read, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the more I respect to something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like one piece, which can
keep coherency this long. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And, and it just continually </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> getting more and more epic, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - And just continually
getting better and better. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But I mean like that's also
why I really value when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a Manga just has a good
ending, not even a Mongo </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but just any media in
anime, Mongo or light novels </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that just has an ending that
people are satisfied with. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't ask for much </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I do ask for a
satisfactory ending to a story. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm just the more
I've been reading Manga. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> My pet peeve is like where
it just starts to fall apart </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like in the last 40 50
chapters that's been really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's been happening a lot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Nothing ruins I feel like
an experience of going through </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> this entire long journey with
these characters that you fall </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in love within this
world that is interesting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to come to limp dick ending. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> You know what I mean?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Like there are like, I, I swear to God </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I can count the amount of
like satisfying endings </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> on like my hands in, in
that I've read in Mongo. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [*] Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because there is like most of the manga </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I love are still ongoing,
like classics, like Bezerk, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Vagabonds, Vinland Saga, for example. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then there are other
things like Slam Dunk. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Where you just feel, you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it just kind of, kind of just ended. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It had its, you know what, come on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> You can't say that that
final chapter of slam Dunk </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Don't spoil it for
me. I want to read it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay. Well essentially like
I'm not going to tell you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how the story goes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it's a lot to unpack,
but basically like slam dunk. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I really liked the final
chapter of slam dunk </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because it was kind of
like experimental almost </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because almost. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Another dimension, where
the basketball slam dunk. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, because really made that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like final chapter famous was the fact </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that almost the entirety </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of the final chapter has no dialogue. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. Oh, that's cool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's just like it, like
basically he was just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> let me just show you the story rather </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> than telling you the story. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't have the problem
with the final chapter. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I just felt like without
the wrap-up or I felt </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like they could have gone
further with the entire story. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I feel like he just kind of ran </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> out of ideas and just
kind of just ended it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But it's not that it wasn't
a great final chapter. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It was just that I, I
wanted to spend more time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> with these characters and I felt like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> there could have been
room to spend more time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - That was me with Hikaru No Go. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If we're talking about, if we're talking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> about absolute cuckold endings, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like Hikaru No Go.
- Oh my God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Hikaru No Go is a show. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> No, no, no, a go Manga. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's a-
- You know what a go is? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, a go. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, yeah, of course.
- Like a black and white. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - This is when the ghost teaches him. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah.
- The one where the ghost </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> teaches him.
- Doesn't end well? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It
(laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It just ends.
- Oh okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It just ends. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Say no more.
- You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It just ends in like a
really controversial way. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Ah, I see.
- Where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people were kind of just
like, wow, there must've been </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> some like strings behind
the scenes that were kind </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of just like, you're
going to end it this way </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> whether you like it or not, because it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> very, very unsatisfactory. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- That's sad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Nobody was happy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Are there any good endings
that you can think of, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> off the top of your heads?
Aside from Oyasumi Punpun.* </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Because I know you were about
to mention Oyasumi Punpun. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> That's the first thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I think when I think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> of the most genius ending,
it's Oyasmi Punpun. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I haven't read like many Manga. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Compared to Jerry, but I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm happy enough if it just
doesn't completely fuck itself. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. I honestly, is that
how it is that how it is to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> be a Manga fan? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like where you're just like, as long </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as it doesn't completely
fuck everything up, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll be okay.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. Even if it's like average. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm still satisfied with it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because like I just
recently finished watching </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> reading Beastars. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just the last volume
came out like a week ago. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Not the strongest ending in my opinion </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it wasn't a complete
shit show of an ending. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I was like, you know what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm satisfied. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like
- Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Could have been better </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it could have been
a lot worse as well, so. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is the ending of a Mongo that important? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cue v* salsa music
(laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel like if an
ending of a manga or even </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> an anime is good, that can
bring it up from like a, from </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like a decent show to
like a master piece level. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I agree. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, go on. Go on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, I mean the biggest
example I can think of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> is the clusterfuck that
was code yellow season two. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. And yet somehow the
like I will never forget it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because of how great the ending was. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Same with something like Cowboy
Bebop, for example, as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think the ending matters more in anime </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> than it does in Manga. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What do you think is the difference? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think the way you
- Length. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Length the way that you experienced it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember vastly the best
bits were Manga more than I do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I said, I, when I look back on Manga, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember it it's like an amalgamation </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of like the whole experience </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as opposed to episodes and like scenes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And also, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I just find that when I finish a Manga </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I'd rarely ever think about
the ending of any of them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just think about my favorite
moments throughout the Manga. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Really? I'm the complete opposite. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think about the ending. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I think with manga, I think
about like certain scenes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> whereas with anime, I think
about it kind of as a whole. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I think maybe it's
because I binge anime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I kind of experienced
the anime all at once. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Whereas with manga, a lot of
it, because it's rather long </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> for me, a couple of episodes, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I binge both. So I guess ending's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> always important to me.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Especially if I've felt like
I've spent like a lot of time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with these characters, like,
like it doesn't have to be a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it doesn't have to be
like an amazing ending </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but what I want is a satisfying ending. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> But if there's an ending
that is actually amazing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and sticks with me, then I'll
always remember that Mongo </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - This is true. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Because I read all of Vinland
Saga, which is amazing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Up to the point where it
was out like a few months ago. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And if I, if I never read it again </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'd probably be happy knowing
that I had a good story </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> up to where it, or up to where
I got to, which sounds weird </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because it literally was in
the middle of like a fight. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, you know what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I've read a lot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've read so much of this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> That I'm actually satisfied </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if I just stop reading
this manga, I'll be okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Like I'm fine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But I guess that's where the
double-edged sword in right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Is that the longer the
mung, it goes for the more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> greater of an ending you expect. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Almost, I guess. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sometimes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or sometimes you just,
cause sometimes you are </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you've read a manga for
so long that you kind </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of just want it to end. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You can (mumbles)
- I get it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You kind of just, cause
that was me with Narato. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That was me with Bleach,
you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Where they, they got to a
point when I was just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I am reading this purely because
I've invested so much time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it it's it's, it's
the league problem right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You're just like, I've
invested so much time in this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that I just need to, I
just need to play it out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - What would you say is the cap then? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Know? You just know it's
like a feeling, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like when I was reading Eyeshield, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I like when it goes to
like chapter, like 250 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, all right, let's wrap it up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But it had like another a hundred left. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right. Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I like this felt like
it went on long enough. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like it felt like they were
adding too many things like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and a lot of Manga had that where like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> what was once a gigantic threat earlier on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> even though they haven't changed much </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in power will suddenly be
like, they dispatch it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And like once one hit,
- Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There's so many stuff
like that where it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so this really cool enemy you introduce </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you start just one shotting later on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, what's the point of this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like you're just completely
ruining all the steaks over </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and over again. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I hate it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Well, so some reason, man,
some fucking action scenes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> are like nigh on impossible to figure out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what the fuck is going on in manga. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I'm, I'm, I'm looking
(laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at these panels and the shit going on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, I would need to
like get out my fucking pen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and draw along to like try </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and figure out what the
actual cartography is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like a bird's eye view and
you showing me like layout </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of what's happening.
- I mean, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I would have more chance having </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like a battlefield view </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and you showing me like
little fucking statues moving. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So fans trying to figure out* </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Before the anime, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - That was literally me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, what's going on? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> At manga? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, I will sit
there for a good, like 30 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> seconds staring at this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like yeah, I have no fucking idea. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's the problem I
have with like Jojolion. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause I was I'm reading it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like these stand pals,
like getting so fucking weird </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that I'm looking at something and I'm like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I guess the stand is doing its power </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I don't know what the fuck? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - What are you doing? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because then an action Manga. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I started like not really care about. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause half the time you can barely </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> tell what's actually happening. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And you're just like putting the dots. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There's something about
watching the fight unfold and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like the way it was meant
to in like a time way </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> with music and noise was
so much more satisfying. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I dunno. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause I feel like that is the problem </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> with a lot of anime fights period, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Is that they don't
actually feel like flights. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> They feel like just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they feel like impacts
intermittently with, with dialogue. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> In between.
- Basically. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Cause like no one know it,
you see some anime flights </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you think no one
actually fights like this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> No one throws </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> A punch, says a sentence
then throws a punch back. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That, that doesn't know how fights work. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Literally every Bucky fight.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What's a fight without
a dialogue? Come on gone.* </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because it's like,
that's why for example </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the fights in God of high
school really stood out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to me cause they actually felt
like a martial arts fight. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Let's say what you want about
the story or the whatever </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but the way the fights
were directed and frames </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and just choreographed, they
felt like actual fights. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It felt like it felt like
a Jackie Chan fight, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm cause that's what,
that's what immediately stood </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> out to me about that direction. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And that animation was that,
you know, sometimes you get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like the narrative episode
where you have like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you have like the basic
normal narrative fights. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then you have like this
one episode that is just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like this, the studio putting
all their budget and their </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a team on one fucking fight. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then that you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that that is the fight
that people will remember. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But most anime fights are just, I mean </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they are literally just
animated manga panels </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you can't tell what's going on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in a manga panel with
action most of the time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> So that's really what sets the good fights </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> from the bad fights. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Sometimes you need that dialogue, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> To help build it up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like a, it's like a good poem, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Sometimes you need the story
to make the worthwhile. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know what I mean?
- Yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think there's like a limit to how </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> much dialogue, like, you
know, that's one thing I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> didn't like about like a lot
of Narato fights is the fact </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that it's like, I don't
need a fucking flashback </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the middle of a punch. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't need that.
(mumbles) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. I like it when they're like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> internalizing their
thoughts on the battle. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> That's more interesting to me than fucking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, ah, you're strong. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's like, well obviously that's why </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> You're fucking fighting each other. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> My least favorite, like
anime fight trope is like the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the guy in the sidelines
explaining everything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> while it's happening. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - To be fair, that that's
either hit or miss. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause the only like one of the only </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah like, like it's, it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> either Speedwagon or it's shit basically. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Pretty much. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know how this
person is able to like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> explain every fucking
like physics movement </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as this guy's doing
fucking a one-inch punch. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Right?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like, it's like,
what is the timeframe? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> How is that happening? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then there's like,
Bucky, which just like you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you have an e-sports commentator just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like explaining every detail </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and technique and the fucking backstory. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I love that. That's
fucking great. I love it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's the thing like.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if it's like Jojo, Bucky, where it's, it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's gone to the point
where it's so unrealistic </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that it just becomes ridiculous. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I hate it when they try </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and make it as if it's
happening in real time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's like, don't kid yourself guys. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, isn't it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like you'd have to be like rap God </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> in order to like commentate over it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That fucking quickly as it's happening. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, sometimes you just
hear a piece of dialogue </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the time it takes us for
like one punch to get thrown. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> A punch is just like a millisecond. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Right. And they have this five
minute dialogue in the middle </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of their head in between this
punch getting thrown in just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like a multi page
like (mumbles)* right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's like, where's the punch? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Where's the impact? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (mumbles) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - No I'm just like, is
time dilation just a thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when anime characters
get punched or something? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like Einstein's rolling in
his grave right now when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when whenever a punch gets thrown man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. And also how many
fucking Manga are there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where like someone gets stabbed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then like the like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but you fell in my trap
and it's like, how many </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how many times have you practiced this? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Where you just been
like stabbed or punched? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And this was like part of your plan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, this is just like
too, it happens so often. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Or like sometimes they'll get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like a fatal wound and they'll
immediately like heal it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's like what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. But then again, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, that kind of goes
back into the whole thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> of like how ridiculous it is as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Right? Like, Bucky does
that so fucking often </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where it's like, you should be dead </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> after one punch, but you've
somehow managed to survive </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like 10 punches, a stab wound
and like three gunshots. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And you're still able
to like form a dialogue. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, I feel like Bucky
is just like one side </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> of the extreme where it's
so extreme that you can't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> take it seriously anymore. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean a lot of anime flights on that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I like anime trips, like anime </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is just normalized getting
punched and coughing up blood. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Whereas in real life, you're
internally hemorrhaging and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing)
(panting) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> You're probably gonna die. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> If you internally
hemorrhage, let's be honest. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - If you cough of blood, bro.
- You're dead. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing)
(mumbles) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - If you smash your head
through a concrete wall </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> which is apparently normal in anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then you've got a fucking
concussion, you know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Or, or just a splattered head. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No head probably.
- Exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I want a realistic </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like toe stubbing scene in anime </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing)
That's what I want. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's what I want to experience. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - What about? I mean, niche-y
Joe* could have done it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. Probably. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Toe stubbing is like the closest I get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to a real life anime scene. Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I want someone to just animate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> someone's stubbing their toe. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And that it's just like immediately </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a Jojo sight, like cough up blood </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (groaning) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm pretty sure like
Bubba, Bubba, Bubba, boy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> probably did something like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I dunno what it is
about stubbing your toe. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Like you stop your toe. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's one of the few injuries
you get where you do it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And you know, the pain is coming. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But for some reason there is a pain delay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> between you'd stubbing, your
toe and the immense pain. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You're about to feel
like if there was time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for a real life, anime flashback, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's in that delay.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It's in that pain delay map*. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Now, if you were an anime
character, you would realize </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that you can synchronize
your energy to counter the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> blow incoming. That's... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Come on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - You can stop the nervous system </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> from delivering it to your brain. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. That's that's the closest you get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> to a fucking anime injury or whatever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I wonder do you guys want to talk </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about Attack on Titan? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because Twitter's funny
right now, Twitter is funny. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean what is there to talk about? Like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I didn't realize </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> How much for the clown Fiesta Twitter is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about Attack on Titan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> How are, how is, how have people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> turned this into a thing to like dislike? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't understand like- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like I knew there was something wrong </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> When I woke up in the morning
and went on to Twitter. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Hashtag thank you Mapa was trending. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, what the fuck
are these clowns doing now? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like every time, every
time Attack on Titan airs, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you go on Twitter </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and something about tack
on Titan is trending. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - And the time of recording
is episode six came out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - And basically the most
recent thing that happened </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> was what was it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> People, people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on Twitter were just
attacking the staff members. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> They were-
- Why? What's wrong with them? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think what I've read
was some people were just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> harassing the director for one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of the music choices that was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that was made in one of the big scenes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it got so bad that he had
to deactivate his Twitter. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - He did? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - And a bunch of animators
as well are getting harassed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm literally watching this thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, this is amazing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Why are people getting angry? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, is there like what
was wrong with the song? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like I can't
(sighs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Who the fuck the knows? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Maybe it's like, I'm losing words </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> because it's so fucking dumb.
- Stupid. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm the-
You can't do that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> You don't deserve anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just saying right now, like you just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you just don't deserve that.
- You ain't a real anime fan, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> You're not a real anime
fan if you do that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What blows my mind is that like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> at the end of the day, a
lot of these people, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> We're just, we're just anime fans. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Why on earth? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Do you think you have the right to that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Just go to like the director level. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I fucking hate that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The fucking audacity.
- How dare you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - You try and make an anime.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And see how you, if you
can make a good light </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I want to do is like, I
just want to like kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cause I think one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> of the things I saw yesterday
was people were complaining </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about one of the Titans
being like really bad CGI </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or whatever </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. I'm watching this thing, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And the CGI is honestly
like barely noticeable. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's really like, not even remotely, like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I just want to like go off </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> to all those people
complaining about the CGI </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and like link them to any
scene from like Bizarre 2016. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. Like this is one,
the same people who've will </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> The clip. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Right. And then run it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> through Sony Vegas, call it 4k. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And re-upload it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And be like, this is a 4k fight scene guy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's my least favorite thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's it's absolutely absurd. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - 60 fps, 4K fight scene.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Which is like (mumbles)
- Let's go baby. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The descriptions like
I fixed this fight. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I made it better. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Dumbest fucking thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Don't do that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean I was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cause I tweeted out saying like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Attack on Titan B will
be carrying on in 2021. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Obviously not being a hundred
percent serious about that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm not, I'm not literally
sitting there being like my 2021 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> would be ruined if Attack
on Titan wasn't airing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like there's some, my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> The arguments that
arose in those comments. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I made like an Attack on Titan
tweet immediately muted it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was just like, I've done this
enough times before to know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that saying anything about
tackling Titan, whether positive </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> or negative, you just set up,
you just set up a minefield. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like, I, you know, I tweeted it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I came back four hours
later and then, you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as I'm, you know, cause
you refresh your Twitter </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you see the most recent reply. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it was something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about like Japanese whaling
laws that they were arguing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> about. And then I clicked on it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Excuse me.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I click on this thing
and it goes up like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 50 replies back and forth. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> These two people going at it
because one of them said that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like Ray zero season two
was going to be better. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And they somehow devolved
into like an attack on Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like, what
the fuck is happening? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do these people have
like anything else to do? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just, I just don't understand
how people can be angry </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about like a great thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like even if they're CGI in
it, that is barely noticeable. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What's wrong, it's getting
adapted and it looks good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> We're getting what we want. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, I do understand why
people are being so pathetic. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I feel like this is coming from </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the perspective of a lot of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> let's say more like entitled
manga readers, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause you can be disappointed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in some ways of an anime
adaptation, because there, there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there are some times when you read a manga </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you have an imagination </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about how this Mongo is going to play out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if it was animated and with something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like attack on Titan where the bar </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> by studio wits was set
so fucking high, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That you go to mapper </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which I still think mapper is
doing a fucking fantastic job. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We've had bangers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We've had fucking bangers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And what I will say is like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like the tiniest of nitpicks, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Where I would say that it's
gone from like a 10 out of 10 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> adaptation to like a nine
out of 10 adaptation. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And that, that that's, that's,
that's the thing, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's, it's, it's a very
slight step down from where it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's not bad by any step. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's just a very slight step down. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like the people taking that as </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if it went from like a 10 to a one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah, Exactly, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And the thing is it's a
nine hour 10 adaptation </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for 10 out of 10 material. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You're still getting a fucking banger. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't fucking get it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's not seven deadly
sins, season three. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I don't, I really do not
understand the problem here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And like, you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> these are the people who
were getting this nitpicky </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on Twitter and those
manga readers are just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the exact same kind of
people who are just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when their kids born, if
that kid fucks up anything </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they're like, well, it's ruined. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's fucked.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I, you know, my expectations were fucked. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's ruined, what can I say? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - What I-
- Well, they just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> this isn't like what was in the bottle. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They're basing it off their own life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> If, if the child fucks up,
they're like, well fuck it didn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> stick to the (mumbles)
- Looking at the ultrasound, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> they're seen the baby born. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, well, that's,
that's not, that's not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a good adaptation, is it?
(laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - So, you're saying to me
it's not gonna be six foot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Honestly. Just put it back in
- This isn't exactly the same. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's the go go
completely on a tangent. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's all I completely feel
about gender reveal parties. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't, I don't understand
the point of gender reveal. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've seen so many fucking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like absurd gender robot, gender reveal </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> party clips on like
tick-tok and stuff like that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where I'm just like, this
is just hilarious now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Did you see the one where
it's like, fuck what was it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It was like, there was like a, a balloon </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like a giant fucking balloon. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> You know like, you know, maybe like six- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - This is the weirdest fucking
tangent we've ever done. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, because what I was,
what I was thinking was like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - You took too long.
- Yeah, oh yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, was just gonna say,
like, there's just like a giant </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like six, seven foot balloon
that this guy carries. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And he's just like, all
right, I'm going to pop it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it just explodes
into this like colored </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like powder that just completely
fills up the backyard. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Cause what I'm thinking right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Is okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The point of gender
reveal party is to reveal </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the gender of the baby, right?
- Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And celebrate that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But like at which point do do,
does like agenda get revealed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and the father is just
like, Oh, it's, it's a girl. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, Karen, Karen, go
get the current hanger. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We're doing it again. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like what, what kind of, what kind </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of reaction do you expect the
father and the mother to have? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know what I mean?
- It's like what human? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Most normal people will be
like, whether it's a guy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or a girl do reaction's
going to be the same. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're gonna have a kid. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I just think that we
celebrate too many things. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think we have enough
things to celebrate. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> How hard is it to just say, it's a boy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> How hard is it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is like having the kids
birthday like not enough? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I think to me, I
legitimately don't understand </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like we have so many things to celebrate. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's fucking exhausting. Who
is planning all this shit? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Like who has this much free time? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Honestly, I barely can like
get Christmas plans together. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like my own birthday. Who has this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Is it the woman she's pregnant? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Shouldn't you be focused on that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I don't. I don't get it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I wonder if there's like
self fulfilling prophecy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of why some people working
in retail in America </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when a person comes in and being like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> give me all of your blue dye. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I need as much blue dye as possible. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And they're like, oh fuck.
One of these all right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But yeah, back to Attack on Titan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - That was such a weird transition. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That was a weird tangent. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Bottom line, stop complaining
about Attack on Titan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It's good. It's fine </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I just felt like, I
just feel like it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cause you know, I think
it's a of edge edge </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of people out there who are
just like, I don't want to admit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that Attack on Titan is
the best thing right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't want to give it
more clout than it deserves. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And you know, you see these
fucking God awful takes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on Twitter being like,
yeah, it was boring. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Dropped it right away. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's like, who cares? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Just let the people who are enjoying it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Fucking enjoy it.
- Well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's good.
- Yeah. It's like- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Stop shitting on it.
That's the thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, you can have you can have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> an opinion about it, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Like if you think it's shit, whatever. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Don't fucking harass
the animators over it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. It's same thing with like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when Game of Thrones is like around. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> People like, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> people just want to be that
person who's like, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't like game of Thrones. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. Whatever, it sucked.
- Cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh you happy about it?
Fuck. That's lame bro. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm not excited about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm not excited about anything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Bro, except my gender reveal, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> party.
- Fuck the system. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Everything I get excited for
is my baby's gender like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah. For some reason, you
know, I mean it does happen </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in other genres as well,
but for some reason </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> who are these I don't
even know the fucking @s </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of these creators that Tweet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> How are they finding this shit? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Why, why are they finding this shit? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just to fucking @ them and
tell them that it's shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right. As if like one of the
animes is going to be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh, thanks for your feedback. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We'll change it immediately. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> They go to the annual meeting
like yo guys, you see him? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> These people don't like it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> What the fuck? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. So like MiCasa276 on
Twitter said that we should </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we should just completely
change the episode. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It just changed studios. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like what director's going to be like RFM. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I've got you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, it kind of sucks that, you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the time where the Japanese industry </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and the Japanese staff members
are starting to, you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we want them to open up to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to open up more to the
international community. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> This is the they have to deal </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> with for some of like the
biggest profile adaptation. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I kinda want to just go there
and be like, don't open up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah
(laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's not worth it. Don't open up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Don't go to Twitter. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I do think You know, there's a
good amount of the people who </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> are probably sending hate, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> who probably don't want it to open up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause to them, I think it's,
you know, it's the same thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with like the idol and like kind of almost </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like the whole life fan
base a little bit where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they're like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we don't want all our people
to interact outside, ruin them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - We don't want the normies coming in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We don't want, we don't.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We don't want like the
American corporations </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> getting their fingers in our Japanese, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like anime, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There's a lot of people
who are like that, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - As if they're Japanese, themselves. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, they bought at the time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it does come from a place of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - non Japanese.
- Yeah, non Japanese. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - We like all-
I get it if they were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Japanese, but most, if not, all of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like in your video, when you did the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the anime studio tour and like
the guy who was the director </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of the studio, it was like,
Oh we have foreign fans? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. I like genuinely. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. So the CEO of CloverWorks
genuinely didn't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that they had fans. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, a lot of people don't know that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Can you blame them if
he goes on 20 (mumbles) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Give him time to kill himself. What? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I would be like, no,
they don't exist. Don't. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No. They don't honestly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Honestly like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's embarrassing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm just saying you do
to make you feel better. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, I suppose if you think about it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's the same wave. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It's the same mentality
of like, for example </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if we find out that Trash Taste has </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or something had Japanese
fans, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just like, Oh, there's
people in Japan who watch us. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> We have Russian fans? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We have a Russian dump
what's going on here? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I get emails every week. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, you guys know you
have like a Russian doll. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah. We get it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Its fine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Would you say that Attack
on Titan is carrying your 2021 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - So far. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. Dude, every episode I'm
getting fucking hyped for. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, she just, you
know, be appreciative </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> of the fact that we're even
getting Attack on Titan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Right? Like in the midst of a pandemic. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah I mean, the fact is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that Attack on Titan it's it
could be carrying any year </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I don't think
that anything can live up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to what Attack on Titan season
four is giving us right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I say this in the
midst of what I would- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - One of the strongest
seasons we've ever had. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I would argue that this is the front. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is a contender for one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> of the strongest seasons
in the history of anime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And that is a big statement. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But like it's so stacked </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in every single genre
and every single kind </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> of every single category
you can think of that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I can't think of a single person
who can't find at least two </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or three shows that there'll
be watching this season. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then on top of that, you
have the classic being made. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That is Attack on Titan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why would you, I, you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if I was an anime studio
and I found out when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Attack on Titan airing,
I'd be like, you know what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Just fucking hold on.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Don't don't let's wait
like on YouTube, you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you upload a video </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when like Shane Dawson
dropped a documentary. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, just don't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Just don't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's like movie
companies being like, wait </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Avengers in cinemas right now, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> pull back pull back, pull back. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Never release at the
same time as Avengers, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cause like, no one's going to watch it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like almost I would have been like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> just hold off because the
Attack on Titan going to carry </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like even if I only get
to watch it once a week </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's going to be in my
mind the whole week. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So like just hold off and give
me a banger of next season. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> But now they, all, everyone was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> let's all come out right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Let's let's all have all
our bangers right now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> In this one season. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Cause like the amount of like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we we've had a few seasons previously </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with some season twos here and there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but it seems like every season two </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or like sequel the season
is a fucking banger. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because like Beastars
is airing right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Right. Okay. So
- I do not know any </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No one is talking about it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause Attack on Titan
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> is the only thing that
anyone gives a shit about. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay. So we got Beastars two. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Which is gotta be amazing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We've got Promise Neverland.
We've got Promise Neverland. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Which no one is talking about. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - No one's talking about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Remember when promise Netherland
came out, it was massive. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it was the only one spoke about. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - We got Lock Horizon three, Quints two. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Quintessential Quintuplets two. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We got Dr. Stone two </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I sleep. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I sleep Attack on Titan season two. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I awoke.
- Awoke. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. Basically. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean like it's how can you not man? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like every episode is just
like a fucking roller coaster. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And like for a lot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> of people we can on this
for like five plus years. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This journey, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's it's and it's, and it's one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> of the few ones where it feels </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like it's run its natural course </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> actually it's actually coming to an end. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I said in a tweet that I feel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like this is like watching
a classic being made. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I have no doubts that if like, even </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> if he doesn't like completely
slammed dunk the ending, even </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if it's just an okay satisfying ending, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's going to go down. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - As long as it's not like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> the crummiest fucking ending imaginable. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Which I- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Wait for it. Multi-verse
predicted multi-verse. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I would like to think
not going to happen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I completely forgot Re Zero
two is airing this season. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Again, you just can't compete. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No one's talking about it.
- No one's talking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about anything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's so many bangers to season </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and like Attack on Titan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's just taking over. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like I'm sure. Because I remember </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was watching the last season </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of Breaking Bad as it
was airing, week by week. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm sure I watched other
TV shows during that time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I cannot tell you what
I've watched other than </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> than fucking Breaking Bad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, true true. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like it was like the highlight, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like it's what it takes up your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> your space and your hype for
like or for what's going to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's going to be 26 episodes,
Attack on Titan right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, it's going to be 14. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's 14? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. So right now,
from what I've heard, like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is me going off of whatever- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Speculation warning. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Manga, manga readers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So it's going to be 14
episodes, I think 14 or 15 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which doesn't take it up
to the end of the Manga. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause the end of the manga ends in April </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause I'm poor... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, I heard that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - April or May. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't remember, but it's confirmed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that the Manga is going to
be ending this late spring </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> summer kind of time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I thought they were trying
to do like a duel ending, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where it was going to be. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> They both were like
ending it the same itme. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like an anime originally. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, no, no, no.
- No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like it was gonna, he was probably gonna </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I thought he meant maybe he was gonna </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like tell them the studio, the end date. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - No. So what's so with the confirmed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> amount of episodes, that's out so far </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what people are thinking
is going to happen is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> either we're going to get
a season four part two. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Fuck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Or we are going to get a movie. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I would I'm speculating
it's going to be a movie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I think a movie is
(groaning) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> going to be more likely.

<SPEAKER_00> I'll hire them to get in the
seat behind me in the theater. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Just whispering in my ear. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - All I get to say is
like personal reasons. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I wish I hope it's
going to be a movie just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> so I can be the first one
to make a video on it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing)
(yelling) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm going to go to
the midnight screening. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm going to make a video </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and be like, yeah guys, it was epic. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Where-
- I would not do that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm kidding. I'm joking. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I wouldn't, I would
not ruin possibly one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of the greatest animes to go down </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> in history just for YouTube click. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> But I'd be like, Hey guys, I
think I know what happened. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I watched it all three times. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think I got the gist </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah we watched it together. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What the is this movie called? Dawn in- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay. We watched the
Made in Abyss movie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> We'd like, obviously there's no subtitles. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm pretty sure I
understood what happened. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm pretty happy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm pretty sure I got it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I got the gist. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Was like plot, plot,
questionable child, Paul plot. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then (mumbles)
(laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I was just like, Oh Kevin,

<SPEAKER_01> Cause Kevin was sitting right next to us. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Damn, this song is good, man. </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - As a man who understood

(laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So, forget this Attack on Titans lando. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like whatever we're going

<SPEAKER_02> The real classic that's coming </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> out the season is an anime called </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> X arm.
- X arm! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So I'm a, I'm a complete newb
now I have seen clips of it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But could you please explain </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to me what Xarm is and it's total ness. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It is hilarious.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It is an experience. I will say that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> So I think we have literally
got the mass effect </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Andromeda releases of anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - The Cyber Punk finish. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So this is, I didn't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Could have bugs and glitches. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's all I'm gonna say. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So it is a crunchy roll original </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right?
- Oh no. Oh no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And you know that crunchy roll up proud </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> of this because I have
not seen a single piece </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of promotional work about this at all. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I saw the trailer on YouTube
but I thought it was a joke. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And the show looks </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Worse than that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It looks, it looks worse than </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I hate to say to you about the trailer's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> probably the best part about the show </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the trailer isn't the trailer. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The trailer is the anime
(mumbles) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> But that probably makes it
makes it good, doesn't it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - But it's so bad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was crying and
laughter the first episode. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It is like I think the third
lowest anime on mal right now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> after one episode
- After one episode. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, but you're laughing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So I mean it's, it's
a that's that's what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's a masterpiece of trash basically. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's it's fucking.
it's no masterpiece. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It is a masterpiece. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the first time I watched
like Ghazi's wing, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. All like, you
know, Skelter heaven. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like a scale to
heaven, I was like, this is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm watching a masterpiece,
but on the opposite </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> end of the. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So, so to, to explain Xarm, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there's a control original
anime that is made </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> by a completely new studio </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> by a team who's never
worked in anime before. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - American? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No Japanese.
- Japanese team. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> But they've never worked in anime before. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And it shows, it shows,
(laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it shows that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They've never worked anime before. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it is a 3D anime </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that looks like it was
made by a five-year-old </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who just learned Blender. Like yesterday. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh no. Oh no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It makes Ruby look like
it makes Ruby season one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> look like an absolute master class. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was going to watch
it, but I just wanted to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> get like drunk enough just
to like fully enjoy it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It makes Bezerk 2016 looked like Akira. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- What? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's pretty bad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And what's worse is that like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I posted the clip of it on Twitter </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> but like there's a scene right
near the beginning, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Where the main character is
3D, but his brother is in 2D. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - What?
(laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - So you have this truly awful CG, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like blocky Minecraft character standing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> next to this 2D anime character. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And he literally in the
same scene, the same shot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And he literally looks </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> he literally looks green screened
on, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It looks like someone just learned </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it looked like someone
just had learned this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the Chrome Mickey's. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - He said to his boss. Like yo, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you heard of this thing
called a chroma key. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This is nuts.
- Exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Look </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - You can see it on screen right now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh my God. That's awful. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> That's like, that looks
like in the same scene. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> You know what that is, that looks like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you told me that was
what's that what's that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> game where everyone can have
their own avatars in the game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It looks like the like second life, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whatever it's called, yeah?
(laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it looks like if like, you know how </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like someone other people
have their own servers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and they like 2D things and
they have like the 3D models. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> That's what it looks like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know what that looks like? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That looks like someone
took like a regular anime </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and made like an MMD edit
of it. Know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I can see it. I can see it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Cause it is like that quality. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Actually, MMD is a better quality. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Mmd is a better anime. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's pretty damn good MMDs out there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Don't be hating on my MMD. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then like, if, if
that wasn't already bad </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there was just like some </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of the fight choreography
is just hilarious. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like this is one fight scene. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think like it's like
the last fight scene </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of the first episode where
there was just no music. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, they forgot
to put in the music. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's just like, like that, but
there's no music whatsoever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So it's just, I was watching
it and I was just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> there's something wrong
with my headphones? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like why is there no music playing? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I remember like in
the last part they run </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> out or something and it's
literally a guy who looks like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it looks like it's literally
looks like the characters are </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like being animated with a
steak or something like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There's literally no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like they're not moving
their limbs or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They just like rocking from side to side. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - So, are we talking about like that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like Queen Bee would put them to shame. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh, I wish this was
automated by Queen Bee. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It makes queen bee look </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like studio wit. It's fucking horrible. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing)
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But it's also just a really fun time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I had a lot of fun
watching the first episode. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, I want to get some drinks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and just enjoy it, you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, we need to its so funny. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - This would be like even
better if it had like kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a ghost stories dub. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So someone needs to dub Exxon
like crunchy roll, please. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Don't be ashamed of XR. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You are sitting on a golden duck here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just marketed correctly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And people will mean the out of us. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Give us the rights to dub Waldoboro. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We'll make an amazing dub of it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> You know What I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Can't wait to direct those sessions. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And like the opening song as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Just what?
(laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> That, the one that sounds like
some, some 41, it sounds like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it sounds like sum 41 cover band. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I heard that was the one that
used for the trailer, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah. That is just the anime </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Tried to send me it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And he's like, what the is this? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> What the? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What is this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like a high school band that
listened to too much green day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know what mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It does sound like a cover band. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That is perfect. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But so why is no one talking about that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know that you have attachment type </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of season four, but who gives a about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Greenlit? That like, I know, sorry. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Like who, who let that through
light quality assurance? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like who led that through
what qualities I'm saying? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like just normally
people who are like, yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is good to go. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Who, who dead watch that
first episode was like, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I wonder though, if someone
at like the production </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> team was like, I feel like
we're forgetting something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - QA. Oh shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know how sometimes when
like people like make shows </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but it's just one big
like tax fraud scheme. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, I shouldn't say
that you get in trouble. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's definitely a joke. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It's a joke. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh my God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But like, I wonder what the people working </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on it think of this, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause you know, sometime,
sometimes you work </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> on a project that you're proud
about, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> People want to get paid gone. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Right. Or the end of the
day, they're like, I mean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I got to just keep toning
up and doing what they ask. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right. That's what I imagine </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's happening. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just like to imagine that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like the animators came back
to the, like the producer </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and was like, yeah, the,
the, the models look great. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So like put some shading on it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> put a little more animation
on the producers light. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So it's coming out tomorrow. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I just want, I just want
to know, because you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in like in any like anime production </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> or any big project production,
you know, you have this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you have this screening nights, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Where you as a group, as the team </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you get to watch the final
product before it airs. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just want to hear the silence </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in that room when the credits roll </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and you just, you just,
what, what can you say? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Psych in Japan? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Always silent. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's what I see in America and the West. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> We have clapping, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Because like the thing that the entire </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like screen your room is just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like silently nodding their head. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Hell yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Every Japanese means just
waiting for the visa card. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Anyway, come on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I just want to be a man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm going to get a free meal
at the end of the screening </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and free drinks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So it doesn't matter
like that, that tuning </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> up to the screen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I turn up to the screening. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If I could </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Listen, man, like as
someone who's like, you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Donna document, you're
going to name a studio. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I completely see </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh, look at that flat. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It's hard. I get it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's hard. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But also come on. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It's hard but come on, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's hard. You know, we're not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we're not blaming the
probably staff at all. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm not blaming anyone for it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> If anything, I'd like to thank them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for giving us some like
quality entertainment. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Honestly, it is honestly quality. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I watched episode two
and it is also a banger. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Just coming out with a bang. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> The episode, man </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Exxon episode two is what
I'm looking forward to. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Are you guys watching
anything else this season </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or are you guys waiting
to see what gets hype? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And we'll get one to watch what the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> called one drag priority. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> That is one direct priority. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Weirdest fucking title,
but I watched the trailer </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on it because I heard so many people. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> A lot of people were asking me like, Hey </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have you seen the first episode? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This I was like, that doesn't
even sound like a real anime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> One direct wondering
party that sounds made up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But then I checked out the trailer. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, actually,
this kind of looks fire. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah. It's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's too early to tell
how it's going to go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I've watched the first episode </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about that is it's it's one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of those shows where I'm just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't even know what,
you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's, it's one of those weird </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I asked people, I was
like, what's it about? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And people just said, just watch it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It feels like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like an eco horror show
or something like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't like Sarah's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> on my or something or something like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just, I'm just throwing out words. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Like the keeps me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like a slight light
tatami galaxy vibe to it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> You know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like kind of just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like so strange that
it's hard to describe what I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> what I will say it, it feels
like, it feels like Madoka </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Magica directed by eco horror. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's it's really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - What the fuck you guys talking about? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So you can hire is the
director that may penguin drum. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> What else has he made? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> What else has he for hire made melee? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> What's that magical girl. One day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It doesn't matter. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It doesn't matter. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You don't, you've not
seen any of his work. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But he makes a lot of weird stuff </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's I watched the first episode </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it it's the, what I will say. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't really sport with it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I don't even
understand the first episode. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> But it's a story that
it presents the events </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of this world out of order. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Hmm. So you get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like racking my brain to figure </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> out how I can describe this show. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It's kind of presented. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Story-like like a boogie
pot Phantom kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's it's it is very
reminiscent of biggie. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Like if you have no context
of what you're talking about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it actually just sounds </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like you guys are talking about gibberish </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Alamo. You've watched come on away. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't fucking know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like a lot of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> when people are like,
dude, you gotta wash this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> animates. So </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It's kind of like on the same vein </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> as serial experiments
lane boogie, pop Phantom. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I, I feel like you just haven't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> You put those shows on
you're like, there's no way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you could enjoy this without
doing like four tabs of acid. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like a lot of shows are like that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Maybe with serial experiments lane </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I'd argue that like something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like boogie bull Phantom is, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Don't really concern myself. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah. I mean, it's something
where you have to be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in a very specific mood to enjoy it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because it's not
something you can just put </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on and just enjoy it as an insane </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> as like a coherent story or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But what I will say is out of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I put my season
on video, I watched every </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the first two episodes of
like every new anime and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> out of everything I
watched, it's the one where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I watched it didn't
know what was going on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Didn't fully understand it, but I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it stuck with me, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It, it, it really, it
was really the one where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I kept thinking about
it after it had ended </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> after I'd watched everything
else, I was just like, nah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know what it is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But I keep thinking
about wondering priority. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I dunno what it is exactly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about wondering priority
that makes me latch onto it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But there's something,
I feel something special </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> that I kind of, I kind
of got that same feeling. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The first time I watched </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like the first episode of
like fully coli, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, I dunno what the is happening. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like the student's forehead </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> little robot just came out of it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I can give you a play by play
of what happens in wander rig. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> So this girl there's
this like short hooded </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like she wears like a yellow hoodie girl. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The first scene is there a Cicada comes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> along and starts talking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to her and you're like,
okay, whatever cool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> She can talk to cicadas. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then she gets given an egg </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then she wonders
what to do with this egg. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then she's sitting on the toilet </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then toilet people starts talking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to her and she's like, yo, what the? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then the egg hatches. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And it turns out that it's
a go hatches out the egg. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think I'll just watch. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't want to spoil too
much, but that's what was fun. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, if, if it, you
know, if the weeks go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> on and everyone's still
like, yeah, it's a good show. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, I, from what I can
understand, by the first episode </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it deals with a lot of themes
of depression and suicide. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it seems like it's it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we get glimpses into our
backstory because you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we get glimpses into, is,
is this a dream world? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Or is this the imagining things? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Or what's kind of going </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on where we only get hints at everything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like, again, it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's kind of like a modern
spin on fully Callie, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause like fully call is kind
of the same where it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it kind of used as </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like absurd imagery to
present deeper meanings. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like I said </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's way too early to tell
what the show is going to be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about and how good it is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> But like I said, out of everything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I watch it stuck out to me the most. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's the one I thought about
the most, but I don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you wouldn't want to say
the weirdest enemy you've seen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I think you'd have to go through my lace </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> but I was pretty simple
that we did that last week </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or it was pretty some
on there that I liked. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Have you ever watched an anime or a show? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And you're just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what the did I just watch
that made zero sense to me? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Like kinda like, like not in like the vein </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of like, you know, this was kind of thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but like just genuinely the
storytelling was so like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> on the same lines as
the ending of Angelique </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> or like a, you know, like
a take on concrete or so. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. I mean the first
time I watched van galleon </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, I don't,
what the I was like, Oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's how they're going to end it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And like, you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> some people love finding
the deeper meaning in that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm just like, that was a bit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just gonna get on with my life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I just that's really concerned me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> But I, I don't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then like maybe a
video of my recommended </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Monkey bar activation. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Think I've like programmed
my brain to like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> just make my life easier. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So like when I want to just,
you know, stuff like that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but might drive some people mad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just like monkey forget monkey Buffon. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I just find it funny. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> How like, considering like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Previous episode </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you said like how you love to
challenge yourself every day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You definitely do not like to
challenge yourself on anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> but like more, what is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What is thinking about the end </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of Ethan galleon
challenging year in any way? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> How was that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Well, not necessarily in
a Vivo, but like, you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> something like, you
know, like a fully Coolio </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like a take on King Cree where it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there are deeper meanings behind </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> here's the thing where you watch it once </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and you can't get everything you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you can't enjoy from just
like watching it one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. But like, why
would that challenge you? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Is all in challenge as
in like, it makes you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You think about its themes more
and kind of challenges your </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I guess like perception of
how you like consume it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I guess it's hard to describe </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It. It, it challenged challenges. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> . It's like, I broke them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've watched those things where it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the deeper meaning
everything more often than not. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I realized that that
that's what they're doing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, Oh, okay, cool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I'll just, I'll let </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> go on Google and I'll be like,
what were they trying to say? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> But like, don't you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like? Cause I find </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like some enjoyment in kind of watching it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and trying to figure it out myself. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I got a good way to, it's
like unraveling a puzzle </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> by yourself and it's like
playing a puzzle game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Right. You're given
the pieces and you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're not told what the
right answer is, but it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> up to you and it's up to
you to unravel it yourself. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's more like, it's more
like you've given a bunch </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of pieces and as you're
playing around with the pieces </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you realize that it's a
puzzle that can't be solved. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This is like, I love map. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Right. Because there is a problem </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and it is always very clearly
defined as such, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's not logical with like yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> With stories and all that kind of stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It's I don't like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I have to figure out what
this guy was thinking about. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like sometimes I might
get a meaning that is not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> even remotely close to
what he was thinking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or the author was thinking when
they were writing the thing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> down. And to me, that
bothers me that I can just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wildly get the answer wrong
and I'll never be corrected. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But you assume that that
there's a right answer. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Well, what if he didn't know
there was a right answer </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And that's the problem is
that I don't like that when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> there's just like an
interpretation and it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you just make up what you want. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then it's like, then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> What? I would argue that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> The story can still
entertain you in that aspect </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whether it is the actual
correct answer or not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, think about it much, I guess. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> That's I just, I watch it and
I, I like whatever thoughts </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I have when I finish. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, all right, cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. That's what I'm going to leave with. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And most of the time, I
don't really care to try </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and find the meaning in it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And so I think, again </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I know this is like,
that's such monkey brain. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You can't appreciate </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Final, et cetera, et cetera. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But I'd say that's even more
normal at the end of the day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I just don't care. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think people like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Me who like actually like trying
to find the deeper meaning. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I think we're the minority. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah. I think I'm the
minority here because I talk </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> about the reason I value this so much is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> because there has been
time where like a piece </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> of media has literally affected
sometimes the way I think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or the way I view life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, because I know it
can have that effect. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I, you know, I try to search
it out whenever I can. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Whenever I find that there
might be even a glimpse </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that there might be a deeper
meaning I love going into it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> No, I just like, I like
everything to be efficient. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I like everything to be done. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Everything on a silver platter, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No, no, not at all. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I like it when things are
very clearly defined the rules </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like this is why, like,
I always, like I never </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ever did any artistic
subjects in school, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. I don't like how it's all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's all like a mess and
it's totally interpretation. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. I like how </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in math and physics and life,
the rules, they make sense. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And you can, you can like
take them in and you can like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> No, I get like, you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my math and physics were my favorite tool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Not fun when I'm like
reading a book or something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm doing this and I'm,
I'm just being presented </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> with a bunch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of nonsense that I'm after
to make sense of myself </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Argue then that if it's
a bunch of nonsense </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> without an interpretation,
then that's just a bad story </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Sometimes. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, sometimes you can make your own </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you can make your own thoughts </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> up from what I was being presented to you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I want you to just kind of like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cool. Alright, nice. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I came up with what I think happened </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and then it's like, all right,
well that's what I think. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I get that like the best
stories are the ones where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can read it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like someone like you
can read it where like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you don't have to even
think about the fact </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that there might possibly
be a deeper meaning </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's still enjoyable. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And at the same time, people
like me that liked to look </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> for deeper meanings can also enjoy it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah. Like once you get too
philosophical, but you know, why </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> why do we watch entertainment
is to feel things </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's the end all be all right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Entertainment to make us
feel something, whatever you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> want to feel, whether
it's like adrenaline. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Sometimes you just want to
feel depressed or whatever </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know, it's and watching
something like, for example </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the ending episode of
the van galleon I've I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> remember first time I've watched it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I hated that because I'm just like, why </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> why can I not just be given the answer? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Why, why is the answer? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Not just, you know, being presented to me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> on like a golden platter, you
know, that's what I wanted. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And then as I grew older
and I, it stuck with me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and I've re watched it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm just like, Oh, this
is, this is making me feel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Different things. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Maybe I'll change my mind on it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> But right now for me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like entertainment and
media, it's just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just want to relax and
thinking is not relaxing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I just want to get on with it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause I'm so God much. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I just want to do
the things I want to do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And to me and payment is purely </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a gas stop on my destination. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, let's just stop for
a moment and have some fun. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> No, I mean, I get that too. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, it's not like every pieces came </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I watched this like mind
bending and it's like, it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like I said, sometimes you just need to be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in a very specific room to
enjoy this piece of media. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just like, you know what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I want to feel pretentious right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I kind of want to like figure </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> out if this has a deeper meaning. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I, I, when I speak to people who talk </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like that about the media,
they like, I'm like, you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> part of me is envious because
I don't care for that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But because I think a lot of
people are envious of that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because I think when you meet
a lot of people, they'll claim </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that they can see the, find
a meaning and all of that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And most of the time
they have no idea, but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you know, I dunno, I'm
just completely open </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> with the fact that I'm
like, well, I don't care. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't care to care </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah. What I like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> What, what I don't understand
is the other extreme </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> where it's people who
can't seem to enjoy media </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> unless there is something deeper about it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, I, there are times
when I just want to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> watch a shitty ISA call </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and just not have to think,
you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. I guess it's like
the people who like think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that every single piece of entertainment </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or media has some kind of
deeper meaning under it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like no anime review. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> A non non-binary has no deeper meaning. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just a slice of life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like just chill. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Well, it feels like privilege. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The problem it's like my only
problem is life in life is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that my media that I
consume doesn't have enough </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Meaningless. It's like, it's
like, Oh my how privileged </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I used to be where that's a
concern, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's like the biggest,
first world problem where like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you can't get enough fine
art, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> That's like literally
like billionaire problem. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh, what me off even more. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, you can have your
own interpretation for media </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right? That's, that's, that's
very normal for everything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> But what me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> off is when people
project their own meaning </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> onto this piece of media. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I remember, I remember
where the attack on Titan, when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, the basement
thing happened to them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There were articles to be like, Oh yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is promoting Nazi-ism
and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm just like, Oh, it's
not, Oh God, he gets, he gets </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> to a point where there's a
difference between, you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> analyzing it and interpreting
it in your own way. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And just there's even when
they know the right answer as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> well. Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just like, no, no, I don't
care what the author says. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> This is what it actually means. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> He just doesn't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, no, I'm pretty sure </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if the author said that
this is what it means. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> That's what a mean. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Well, it's, I mean, there's
plenty of cases of where like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The author loses control over the work. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Well, I mean, isn't that like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the whole thing was Ava, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Where like the frog grip,
the death of the author. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> So you've always been up to
anything interesting recently. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, we're currently
back in lockdown always. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> So we haven't really been
able to do much really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Japanese covers pretty useless. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, yeah, but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Statement restaurant,
please close at eight. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> So you can still travel
and do whatever you want. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Not an enforced lockdown in Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's always a suggestion. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It's a suggestion that
in Japan people listen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, yeah, no, I was crazy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think like where was it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It was like, it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because usually after we
finished recording a podcast </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we going out to dinner
and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I think we were at like
one of the restaurants nearby </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and they were playing like news
footage and the re watched. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yes. There was a shot of station </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> zero people in front of it, which is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like crazy because she did
a go station for you guys. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I know it was like literally
the most busy station I think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the world. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Isn't it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. It is at least in Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Most of the world. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think station. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I died a little inside. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Whenever someone, whenever
a friend comes to Japan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I asked where to meet and
they say Shinji meeting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> at re watched station is
impossible, but like navigating it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Isn't so bad now I hate now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I think you get Bouguereau
is worse than average. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> What are you on? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Because when you try and
get to like the other </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like the subway lines, you'd
like for someone she can stay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> she literally has like 30
exits girl has maybe like 10 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like depending on which exit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you come out of sh sh re watched </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like it tells you to go on
the other side of the station. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And you would think walking
in a straight line would work. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> No, you can't walk in a straight line </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in re watched because
you've got to pass depending </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on where you're on a
station, you've got to pass </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> through like 10 different dailies
with gigabit grow station. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I always, if someone's just like meet </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at this gate that I dunno where the it is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> then I'll just go out of the regular gate </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and I can at least walk
around the station. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But if you try </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and do that with re
watched station, you're. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> If you ever come to Japan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you're going to meet anyone here </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you're staying and
you're staying there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> re watched never say you're going to meet </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> meet at re watched station. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It is a lie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's saying you're going to
meet the re watched station is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like saying you're going to meet somewhere </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in like times square or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It's a massive area and
station doesn't do that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It's not even that it's like saying like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll meet you in New York. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, all right, cool place outside </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of the station and then
send them the Google. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> But you could do that
with any other station. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It'd be way easier to get out of it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause I, I remember I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I met Jeff here mother's
basement at re watched station. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And as soon as he said it,
I was like, Oh, here we go. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> God, I got to find, it's
basically finding where's Wally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with your mates. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And you know, with Jeff,
is it shouldn't be hard </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> cause he's massive. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right. And he says, he,
I asked him where he is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and he's he goes, Oh,
I'm a near this place. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think it's, it looks like
there's a big camera nearby. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, cool, cool. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> So, so I go to like the
nearest big camera and so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> big camera is like this
it's huge department </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> store Charlotte. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like electronic store basically. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I go to the IU West re
watched B camera, and then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I send him the message and
I'm just like, okay, I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> outside big camera. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And he goes, I don't
see you and I'm go buck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was that at that point
I knew ticks off of one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And I, and I, and I tell him
just to send me the Google map </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> coordinates and he's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> on the other side of
the, is that re watched </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> West, like Google maps. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> It's so much easier. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh. So you can just literally meet </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at like one station </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because some of the stations lie </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with how to get places </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like as well has like a
East West exit or something. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> No, dude re watched is
like, has like seven West. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It has an East West exit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah. That doesn't, it doesn't
even like re watched doesn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> even have an East West exit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I think Shinju has like an East West exit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and a new east-west exit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's how many exits
their own re watched that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they've literally run out of
directions to name the exits </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> The train stations in Wales
where it's just a platform. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> What was it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> That was the whole station,
maybe a vending machine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If you're lucky </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Honestly like what I
usually do, I've done this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with a few people and
it's actually proven to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> be effective is that instead
of meeting in re watched </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you meet one station down
on the, which is Yogi. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because walking, because
walking to your Yogi, like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> from your yoga to re watched
is the exact same time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that it will take to actually get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> out of re watched station
is because walking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> from one side of the station
to another, depending </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on where you are could take
up to 15 to 20 minutes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Whereas like Yogi only has two
exits, very straightforward. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No, bro, what do you mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm doing what you love to do best? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Which is min maxing myself. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay. Well what is the optimal straddling? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Google has this thing
now where it tells you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which cart to get on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So it tells you which train car to get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> on for the smoothest and quickest
exit and 95% of the time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's spot on. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Let's do that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll say trick question though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> There is no smooth exit or re watched. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There is, there is never </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I have legit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I always have to Goshen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Juki right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And obviously I'm always using
to do that because I need to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I listened to what Google, my God </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Google tells me, you know,
every time and it bang on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like go this exit gob, the first set </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of stairs you see every single
time it's basically right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> You think someone who just
come to came to Japan ball </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like which direction of re
watched and which ex there are. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't even know where it, I get out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I, I mean, it works for me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just listened to what the PC,
the PC master race tells me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If the computers tell me to go somewhere </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I go where the computer second </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Carnivores. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The first time you come
to Japan, don't do that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Find where you want to go. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> When you go to the station,
there'll be numbers </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on the floor. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Just pick the number </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what the Google tells
you to go on and then do </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> it. Trust </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> re watched. You all get lost
navigating this station. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. Don't don't trust the station signs. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause there'll be like, Oh
yeah, if you're on the platform </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> be like the exit this way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> You don't trust the sessions. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's all I've got. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Because, because when you go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to re watched and you
follow Google maps, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Google maps says, take the
West exit out of re watched. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And then you go, you go to,
you, go out your trailer </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you go see the signs. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And there is probably every exit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> But the exit that it says on Google maps </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> The mistake, you're looking
at the signs, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The signs, the signs,
all they do is deceive. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They, they make you second guess. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Right? Don't listen to the song full of. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Listen to what Google says. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> A hundred percent, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because thing is right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You'll be on the platform. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Right? And there'll be like eight sets </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of stairs that you can take. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That'll be an hour. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This is like this way. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This is the way to where you want to go. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And sometimes it's like the
most unoptimized way to get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> out of the out of the station </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or go to the line that you want to go. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And there's bunch of stairs. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And sometimes it isn't
clear which stairs to get. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's a mess. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Right? If Google tells
you to get off at a cart </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> go immediately to the nearest
set of stairs that you see it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I guarantee it'll work. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And just go out the exit
that you see closest. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It'll always work. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Google knows. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Don't listen to the signs. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They're lie back. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Don't try a voice. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> You'll see. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I dunno, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I, I think I'll just
avoid getting off fishing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just, I just feel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like not going through re watched </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is just the optimal straps. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just, I want to fly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> out of the country without an airport. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, if you're going to go to Japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're going to be going
through re watched. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. But like I rather </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> meet like somewhere far
away from the actual </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Station out of this place to meet </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Somewhere, anywhere near the station </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> because it's just extra. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just extra stress. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> You're adding onto your commute. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> AI. Do it for you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know because it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I have tried following
the AI and Google maps. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Isn't perfect. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's pretty good. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Is this, what is this why you hate it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Mo more because of the AI maps? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I definitely. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> So that's why you hate you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Such a mess of a station. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The way it's been laid out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like shouldn't you queue. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I get it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It makes sense. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is that the science makes sense. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> You can see the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I follow assigned to an exit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It actually takes me to the eggs. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, because I like putting my trust </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in my own sense of direction. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Right. So if I'm in a
place like eco bucardo </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I can trust that wherever I am. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can find the right way out. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just follow the signs. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just follow the signs. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Not the right way with, with, with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> re watched. I'm if you
literally have to put your trust </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> in an AI machine to tell
you the right direction </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then it is just a poorly planned system. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It works though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I kept where I need to get to no problem. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Well, let's say that I wanted
to people watching this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you'd never been to Japan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like what the is this problem? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> If you've never been to
Japan, don't listen to corner </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> meet anywhere outside of China </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Listen to the white guy in Germany. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Would you trust the white guy? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Listen, listen to me,
the white guy, trust me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I find life hacks where they don't exist. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah. I mean, we've locked down. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There's not so much new I can be doing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So recently I had, this
had woke up one day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I was just like, Oh, I
should get back into fate. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Go. No, no, I saw you taking a bath. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And I was just like, no, no, no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> No. It's like watching. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like watching a
friend start a new drug. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It's no, please stop. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just seeing a mate
like just relapsed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And he's like, no, no, you
were 10 weeks sober, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Come on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm kind of the same way. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I did something that I
haven't done in literal years </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which is by an arrogance,
like a Japanese area. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Ooh. I am brand new </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Came out arrogant. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So cause I was in Akihabara a
while back doing some shopping </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> for a video and, and I was
walking parceling Mellon books </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which is like, you know,
where they sold a little </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like donations and
stuff and out the front. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay. So basically say out the
front, they have like a bunch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of signs for like new games
that come out and every now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then they'll also show
some signs for like arrogance. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Right. Cause that's where they sell it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And there was one where I was just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that actually looks really cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I didn't actually
know it was an arrogant. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I thought it was like a
standard JPG or whatever </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I was like, that
actually kind of looks cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I looked it up, found out
it's an arrogant by Alice soft. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was like, wow,
Alice self actually just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like click baited me into
thinking that this was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like a legitimate JL Fiji
when it's just a irrigate </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with JPG elements in it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I was like, all right, you know what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll buy it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll buy it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's locked </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> down. I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Go out anywhere and I haven't bought </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and played an arrogance so many years. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll do it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Play at it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And that's kind of all I've
been doing for the past three </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Days. Really trying to
give context to kind corner </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> About what Alice soft has done. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah. I just zoned out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know if there's
any games like that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> of famous outside of Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That also basically Alice
soft is like one of the oldest </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I guess like most well-known
in the era gay world. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> There's like illusion
like Alice soft, what? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> A leaf,
a leaf? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. You train them and poke them on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> You know, Maples and other maker. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> My favorite Pokemon type maple
lumber sugar is another one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> There's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Basically it's like, it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's basically just like
an O G arrogant developer. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And they came up </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with a new game that
looks completely different </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to anything that they've done. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay. So I played a few like
Ali soft games back in my head. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So we said, what the do you do in America? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Explain to me it's a visual novel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> visual novel with porn. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Or if it's good </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Connors like, wait, how can you get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> off? How </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Does that work? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> If it's good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Basically think of it as
it's like perfectly halfway </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> between jacking off to a Dogan
and jacking off to a hammer. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Imagine how the latter
or the former field site </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Basically it's like jacking
off to a dojo, but the audio </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> from the hand ties playing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. So there's voice acting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Sound effects. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> So, that can also be auto played </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> or so like you you're
playing this story game </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you might say you just beat one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> out and then you just carry </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, 30 seconds after I've got it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've just looked at discussed
of what I've been testing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, turn that off </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> With all the milk you've been watching. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I will be disgusted right after it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> You are in like a heightened
state of like, you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you're basically like a monk </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for 30 seconds where you're
like, I will never have sex. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Well, I'm not, I don't know
why I'm like turning the. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> You get postnatal. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh, a hundred percent
every time, every time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And then I'm like, weak-willed with porn. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> If I could abandon porn, I
would, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. I would. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If I, if every guy says that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> if you could say comment, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You just never need to ever again. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll be like, sure. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Why not? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Well, let's try it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Let's see how it goes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I have the completed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> No, not November. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> No. I've never attempted it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Well, it sounds like you're
wanting to attempt to right now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I ended up getting like
a wet dream eventually. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Right? Like that'll happen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Right. If you don't care. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Well, if you leave it for a month, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> When was the last time you
didn't check off for a month? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I will never, but that's because I'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but that's because I'm not going to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Spew being like, I can live without point. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> No, I want a one point. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> No, I want to, I want to live without it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't want to be, I
just find out this is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> this is the literally I
don't want to be horny. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I want to, like I've
ever seen in real life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I hate being distracted
from what I'm trying to do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's just distracting. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I look at that meme and I'm
just like, I want both really. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I want to be horny and happy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> So you just, you just say you see this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> as like a distraction
from your optimized life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Optimized lifestyle is
being ruined by this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh my God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I can never hear the word
optimized the same way </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> after this podcast. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> You're you're playing this game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> You know, it's a game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> How are we going to game? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's reading. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It's tricking you in a jacket. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Alice soft one has like full
on JPG RPG elements as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh. So you're like you're in the middle </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of a battle and you're trying to Jack </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> off. No, no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> No, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Okay. So think of, okay, this is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I hate the fact that I'm
using this as an example. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Think of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh God, here we go. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Wait. Like the persona
games are, in my opinion </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> persona games are the
perfect blend of visual novel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and JPG way. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like they've somehow managed
to make two like elements </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of two completely
different styles of games </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and mix it perfectly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right. So in persona, the J
RPG elements are most often </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> than not completely separated </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from the actual visual novel elements. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right. In persona. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. In persona. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Whereas </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> What a visual novel of quake. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I dunno if I just fell
small, smaller Jake. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> No, that's pretty this for me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So in persona, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like the, you have the
visual novel elements </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then you have the
JLL in between the yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. So like, you know,
you'd have like, you go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> through a dungeon or whatever,
and then, you know, once </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> once you complete that dungeon </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then it goes into the visual. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You call it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, I would argue that
the GRPC elements fill </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> up for you as well, but regardless. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, you know, you have
like the story elements </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you have like the actual
like gameplay elements. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right. Whereas in this era gay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the sex scenes time start to happen </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> during only the visual novel elements. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Hmm. Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> So, so the, the vision of elements </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of the sex scenes and the
gameplay stuff breaks up that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> So like a standard Silicon. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> So like the standard error,
like a standard error. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Okay. That doesn't have
JFE GL in the heart </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's basically just a visual novel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with sex scenes put into it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah. Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> So it kind of interweaves
with the story with this one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just that separately. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It has a J Apigee portion as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Wait, what do you mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Like you battle, like what are you doing? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like what? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm confused, what are you doing? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What the else do you do in a J LPG? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> So you're just, it's just a
dead and normal J RPG game </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where you're going around
battling monsters leveling off. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then it cuts to like
a visual novel with yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Who comes up with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Unlike on a slide. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can literally hear the gears </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like turning in his head
and it's just not computing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just like, wait, what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No. Like they don't, they're
not coming to the gym. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> They're just stuck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. I'm just like,
this sounds to me, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is the equivalent of
being like, so it's a food </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> tray that jacks you off. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, I don't want
those two things going </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> near each other. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What are you talking about? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like those two elements,
the JL PG game, and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just a visual novel with porn in it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I like just two elements
that just shouldn't be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> involved at all. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Why not? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Why? Why would, why wouldn't you want them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Look, don't look like your </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> As if like there's the visual novel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like storytelling, part, and
then there's the sex scene. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then immediately, and then
immediately there's a battle. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's not how it works </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But how does it work then? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Works as if like there's
the storytelling element </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the visual novel element. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And in the middle, there is a sex scene. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So it's sandwiched between
the visual novel elements. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So there's the visual novel elements where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're telling a story and there's porn </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the middle and then
it just cuts to when it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when the done with the talking it goes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to a normal dead-ass game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah. What, why </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Does this look good to you? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Am I insane? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This sounds awful. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It sounds great. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> No, it doesn't. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You're just playing devil's advocate. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay. I've I mean, I've, I, I say this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to someone who has also played Aero gaze </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> before this there's
something, there's something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> about like hen Thai games
and arrow gays, where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the sex scenes feel like this
there's something different </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about feeling like
you've earned a sex scene </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh fuck off. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> A hundred percent, a
hundred percent agree. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Like you could have the
most mediocre sex scene </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but you feel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like you've earned that sex scene. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's even more so in this game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because like you can unlock
certain sex scenes depending </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on what you do in the J RPG </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> a person who watches a hand-tight. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't want an X-Box achievement. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I want a hand tie. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And you know what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm a person </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Who watches a hint high and skip straight </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to 15 or 20 minutes or not
know what we're talking about. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Story and hand tag. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But I don't want to sit there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and read a book and then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> into the book and then
wipe the cut off my hand </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and go around my RPG world,
leveling up my character. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right. I don't wanna fucking deal with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> like, look, don't get me wrong. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll say, man, this is not
the type of game for anybody. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> This isn't, this isn't, this isn't like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I completely understand that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The stuff I like in hindsight </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's pretty shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. This is like, you
don't want to say like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't eat where you shit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right. This is like beating
the that you're sleeping. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like this is like, this is so fucked. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like this shouldn't be
a combination of things. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like only Japan would make something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like this because it's
just so stupidly like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like this shouldn't exist. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Like look at honeypot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> That was, that was made by Americans. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't like honeypot by honey pot either. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I enjoy honeypot because it's
literally what I just think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> of because I can buy American
because like, I, for example </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Bejeweled or some wasn't that game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Like it was one of those </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was like, it's like a puzzle game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's a puzzle game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But also gave him that a too. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> But then under, because
the thing is, the thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is it's like Jackie off
to a jigsaw puzzle, be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, Oh, Oh, it's making porn. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The pieces </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Of making a poem because the
thing is, the thing is right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You have this gameplay loop, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> You have this gameplay loop,
but unlike you, I need a reward </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for playing this game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I need a reward for playing this game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Unlike you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't the X-Box </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't jack off to Xbox
achievements, either terrible. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Most of the time, it has to
be story most of the time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's why I play games. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If I have a gameplay loop,
you can have the best </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> gameplay loop of all time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If there's no motivation for
me to play it, then I'm just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> going to not play most games
that don't have a story. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause it's like, what's the
why, why am I playing this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah. There's there are so
many games that I agree have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I can totally agree with that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but why is that porn in it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Because that's the rewards
you get for playing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> The game because I'm sorry you
find feeling a little horny. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Sometimes I just can't
imagine holding the yet </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Xbox controller and then just put it down </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> get the tissue box out like what? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Say for example, like a game, like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for example, degeneracy
should not be reached </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Well at first I gave him like
dead cells, which I heard </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which I, which I played
and I played it for what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> five minutes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I thought this was a really good game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then I got bored for five
minutes because I was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> why am I playing this game? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> There's no motivation
for you to actually play </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> through levels. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's nice gameplay loop. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Same with something like Celeste. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's amazing game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is an amazing game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I went through one level when I got bored </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I really couldn't
care about the story, man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's so good. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's the thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If it had a reward </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for me to complete the
level that I would inflate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> through it, then there needs
to be some kind of work. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> So what Guk is saying, is
that Celeste would've been </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And what's the last, would it be? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> every time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> If, every time, like if every
time I completed a level </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of Celeste, there was a Hentai scene </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or something like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> You literally just went </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, Guk wants to S to
have like a beat a level. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And then the porn hub
music starts playing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> That's what Guk wants. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Yes. That's I want that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Imagine guys are too
comfortable jacking off. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Imagine that imagine an
Sero gay with something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on the gameplay level
of dead cells or Celeste </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or something along those lines,
masterpiece, masterpiece. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just imagining that right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> That would be, that would be a mask. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> That will be amazing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because like, you know,
every time you finish a level </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of Celeste you have such light. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yes. Like moments, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, yes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I, I went through that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I died hundreds and hundreds of times. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And now here is my reward. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Hell yes? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That is going to be the best
jack off you'll ever have. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah. To, to not saying,
make Celeste porn. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm not saying that's what I'm saying. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> For example, we don't want
to lude the character. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's not, we're talking
about, we're talking about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if we had a gameplay loop </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of something like Celeste
or something on that level. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And then we had, we
had it hen side, my God </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that is improving upon perfection. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You people have not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> how has noon crowdfund
the now I'm making these </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I amazed all the. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I am going to fund some money. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Gimme Some money </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll make it happen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's fucking animals like you
have the reason why we have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like Minecraft sex scenes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Like this is the prop
you guys would want to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> put porn and everything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh, have you seen the
Minecraft porn on YouTube? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's so fucking awful. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Some of us kind of like
finishes at level in mind. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> That's not even a levels in mind. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Jerry finishes getting
some diamonds in Minecraft </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just swapped over </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> to the next tab and
start playing Minecraft. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Do you know how hard it is
to get diamonds in Minecraft? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's like a great achievement. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I can say that publicly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> because I know I'm not the
only one who genuinely thinks </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that the fact that Minecraft
won't even exists means </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I am not. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You're saying you like Minecraft porn. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No, I'm not have a problem with it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No, I mean, I don't care what this is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like a kid's game though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I've this, this podcast
has been a weird one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just think it's sad, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> That there are kids out
there who legitimately like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are curious about porn. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And the first thing they think is my two </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> loves Stephen Minecraft. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I would like to see if
they did that to him. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause it's only kids
watching these things. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Right? Cause no adult can to Steve. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Steve blocks something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, no joke. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not saying I am,
but I think, I think you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> underestimate some like adults willpower. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I've okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I have jacked off to Minecraft. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I've this is the first I've
ever heard of Minecraft porn </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> on this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> You've never seen it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Never seen it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Describe it to me please. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, we just kind of
have to show you this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> You need to describe it to me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> In like four or five years ago </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> wishing been made the video about it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but there was actually
like so much like full </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> on traditional porno
I've made in Minecraft. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> When, when you first
mentioned it, I thought, okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> we're just being sarcastic. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> There's like a, what's his name? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Captain sparkles. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Right? The one who was
like Minecraft animations. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. Basically imagine that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But they would literally be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like a porno situation where it was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> someone would be like, Oh
no, it's like a, high-quality </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> like Minecraft I saw one
that was like, Steve, like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like Steve, like a creeper
or something or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And the creeper is like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> All right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. This is legit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> This is actually, we will show you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This is the path. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If you don't hold back, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If you let your creative juices run wild </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on projects like Joey wants to do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> with all of this, this is what happens. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And we don't need this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We don't need this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Don't get me wrong. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We don't need it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> That's the thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Right? People want it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> No, no, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It doesn't matter what people
want people to have to sell </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> People don't deserve what they want. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know if it's worth,
I don't know if it's worse. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What I just imagined in my
mind from you describing it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or actually watching the actual thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> we'll show you afterwards. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I don't know, maybe
just we can add a clip </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of like got reacting to when
we're done with the episode </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we'll leave the cameras rolling. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Just like this is a post, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It's literally like, it can
only be kids watching it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right. It's so disturbing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> That it's just funny. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Well, I mean, it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Funny to us, but obviously I'm sure. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm sure the on the kid
watching is pretty much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> every reached that age. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Is this what our parents felt
when they walked in and saw us </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like jacking and elf to
animated he's how is this how </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they felt now? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, I'll never forget the look. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> My parents gave me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Whoa. You've never had like
your parents like walking </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on you jacking off. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> No, I've hit it very well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> If they have really, again, I
remember that was my stairs. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Would Creek I had a warning. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. Your parents walked in
on you with my dad walked in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on me once. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> How big was the screen? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like this tiny meant
jacking off on like a game boy SP </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Like my old, like desktop
computer with like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't think it was like
a 16 inch or whatever. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I had a black and white TV. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh really? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> The black and white. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like a hand me down

<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. It's awful. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> So I couldn't couldn't put porn in it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> All right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Well, I can't believe I'm
about to tell this story. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't even remember how old I was. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was easy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was, it was, I remember,
I don't remember exactly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how old it was, but it was
around that age as a teenager. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> When you first discovered porn, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, you know, way between like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know, 13 to 15,
something like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Maybe even early for some people. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I remember a lot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was, I think it was
legitimately the first time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I watched like a hentai on my computer and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Straight to hentai even watch it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This was like, this is like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not long after I discovered porn. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He quickly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Got down that rabbit hole. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, no like that, that first time I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but the first time with
hentai was a different story </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was in my room and
like, my room has like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> had a lock on it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I thought I locked the door. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh, Oh. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And my thought. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I remember, I remember
as well, we hentai it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it was a comedy show,
Collegeville, Kalamazoo. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh, classic classic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Right. It's like next
to bible black classic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Right. And, and yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> So I was like, Oh,
something has arosen in me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right. My, my little joke </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Has woken up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Right. So I was like, let's give it a go. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And so I did it and then
I hear like a, a clock. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> The door opening. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I had looked around and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Standing there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He's pretty, he's pretty
proud of you there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh. He looked at me and
he looked at what was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> on my screen and he looked
at me again and he just said </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Really, mate? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Your dad seems like the
most Australian man alive. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> He just said, I remember
exactly what he said. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> He's like really mate couldn't
have been regular porn? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I wouldn't be, I wouldn't
even be disappointed with you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if it was just regular porn. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was like, I mean, I've,
I've been past that point. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I was kind of experimenting. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And he's like, all right, whatever. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, I dunno what I dunno. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I have already gotten
bored of regular porn. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm seeking new adventures. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I could, I could legitimately
see the very moment </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Where the disappointment came. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, it's like,
it's like a certain look </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in my dad's eyes where it
kinda went from like, Whoa </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> what are you doing to, oh. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh no, he's into that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> He's into that shit. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Huh? Oh yes, father. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I am into that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Are you winning son? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> He wasted his days. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And now I talk about it for a job. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> So yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I hope you're proud of me dad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That felt so desperate. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Please love me please. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm winning now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm finally winning dad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's just that that
moment is carved into you. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And you're like, you're
like the son who just looks </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for your dad's approval. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't have a lot of
like distinct memories </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> during my childhood,
but that was definitely </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one that will like forever stick with me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I, it, it's kind of just
implanted itself into the back </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of my brain now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've never been caught,
jacking off at all because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to me it's like, if, if I do
this, a checklist happens. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think 100 for me, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It's, it's the same- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - When my snake, unfortunately, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's it's the same way, when you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you leave the house
and you have your okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Pat keys, wallet, phone, same thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Same thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> When, when you do the same
thing, same thing, you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you do, you do the deed and
you just like head door locks </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> headphones on or whatever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Make sure nobody's in the
house or nobody can hear. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then you start. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - With the lock on my door. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I got a little too overconfident.
So I'm like, yeah, this is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This is full proof isn't it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then I just, I guess
I just forgot, you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what it felt like, it
felt like, you know, when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're playing Pokemon </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and you like go into a
cave and you put repel on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it runs out just before, you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about to leave the cave and
you get into an encounter. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's what it felt like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like shit, I wasn't
that close, but I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I've, like I said. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I thought getting walked in on, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is like a common thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Cause you see it so much on the internet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Right? It's like, I go
in like, what do I do? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, you know, that kind of stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> So have you ever walked in on
anyone or been walked in on? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh my God. Maybe I have, I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel like these are
like buried memories. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. That's pretty a good chance. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've pretty walked down. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I dunno. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've been to parties and seen shit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but like people to don't
care, but just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like a private time, you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> No, I don't think I have actually no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. I, I th I think I've
never walked in on someone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> but the closest I've come
is it was union university. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know, it was visiting
a mate and it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like a group house. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So like two or three
of them mates are there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and we were getting
ready for the night out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I was just like
saying hello to everyone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then I knocked on this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I knock on one of my
mates door and I, you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that panic scramble hear?
(laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You can hear so there's doors locked. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Right. But I knock on the
door and all I heard was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Honestly, that's all I heard was. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (scrambling noise) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then he opens the door </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and the laptop, which is opposites </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like where the door is,
is conveniently closed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I'm just like, Oh, you're just doing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And he was like, nothing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was just, just working on
my presentation, you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I've never actually
walked in on anyone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but I feel like it's more common </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> in America because in university there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you share a room that's,
this is what I can imagine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Weird to me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is why I can't
imagine having a roommate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because how would you,
how'd you schedule that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Do do anyone in America. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Can you ask me, do you have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> do you actually have to
schedule your sessions? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because when do you have to
be like, where are you going? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> How long will you be out what
time are you coming back? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Urban legend. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Where do you tell each other? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Where do you like to do you like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> have like a calendar
where you schedule it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay guys. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay. So this time is my time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's going to be a sock on the door. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's how you know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And if the sock is on the
door, then it is like code red. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Don't come in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Never disturbing during </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, like, I guess like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I want to ask you guys is like, I mean, we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> none of us have children. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right. But like, hypothetically </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> say it like bright. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right, right, right, right up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Hypothetically. Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Like if you ever like,
get a kid, for example </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you become the role of the parent </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then you walked in on
your kid doing that, like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> how would you guys, like, what
would you say, join it after? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is not, it's not really
to have a conversation there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> You're like, sit down son. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, Whoa, but I'm sure
some parents have, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, Oh my God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, what is even like as a parent </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> what's the correct answer. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Ah, I'm going to tell him not to do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Really. It really, because
they're going to do it anyway </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but you don't encourage them and be like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> watch as much porn as you want son. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like my dad said that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Something similar. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He's just like, because
like I specifically </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> remember you can get addicted to porn. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Right, right, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I remember my dad wasn't
so much like disappointed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> in the fact that I was
like jacking off it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Okay. That was the Hentai </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was the hentai </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> He was like, I don't care
that you're jacking off. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like if you have a penis </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you're an adult, that's normal. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right. So whatever you were
eventually going to get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> to this point </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it could have been anything
else you were jacking off to. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I probably, you just walk out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And then the next time I see like my child </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I probably just be like, we
can just forget about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Right. Because I, I feel like
the more you talk about it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the more you put lights on it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the worst that they're going to feel. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Well, just, just make
it as, make it as casual </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> as possible to be like,
how many parents, you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> end up doing like this, sit down, son. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Let's have a talk. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel that's the worst answer. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause like, I feel like
there's nothing more. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, I never got the talk
from my parents, but I feel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> if I ever was in that
position, I'd be like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Did you ever ask your parents
where babies came from? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You gave me some answer. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I still remember. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I still remember the answer my mind. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yes. So I thought that
was literally what she </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> said was babies came
out of the belly button. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Right. And thinking about
this as an adult, I think I'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's permanently scarred me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because when I see a belly button now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cause as a kid, as a kid, I
had this disgusting thoughts </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> of oh babies crawl out there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And now as a fully grown adult,
I still see belly button. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just like, Oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> all I all I can think seen an ACE Ventura </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> You know, when he's coming </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> out of the Lake rhino,
that's all I can imagine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like some alien shoes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like looking back I'd rather than my mom. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> How just tell me graphically
where babies came </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from. Well, as, as opposed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to just telling me yeah,
they, the belly button. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause I remember that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember the first time, like there's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's two moments that
have scarred me fluff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> One was that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And the second time was the
first time I saw the matrix </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where? Yeah, the matrix cause scene. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> There's a scene where, how
have you guys seen the matrix? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. I can't imagine the scene. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So there's same thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Which one is it about? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, that there's a scene
where the agents pin Neo </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> down and then like a spidery
shrimp, like emergent </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> crawls up his belly button and that me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> up so badly because I'm just like it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay. I reinforced that it was possible </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for things to go in or
out of the belly button. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> So I'm just like protect
this at all costs. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> my vital point. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I thought he was like some alien burst </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> our share where she's like, you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I had a similar thing with
him, with the mummy, you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when like the beetle is rolling. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> That was the first time I
like physically was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm sorry. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like, yeah, that matrix thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I blocked out my mind
because I remember being </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember watching
that like a ten-year-old </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and being disgusted. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. God, it was awful. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> But yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean that's a tangent right from porn </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know if I'm my
kids or my kid do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. I'd probably be like,
well, did you do it efficiently? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Did you mean max and son? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> How much time did you spend it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But that 30 minutes you're in
that full that's way too long. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> You cannot get in the
habit of doing that son. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Cause like when you see the
like people talking about like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I legit would worry if my kid
got like addicted to porn. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh it was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you hear about the adults
who get addicted to porn. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like Terry crews was addicted to porn. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Right? Was he? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, he was addicted to porn I think. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And there was generally
like I sent you the link. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I, I was on YouTube
and there's just a video </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> something called, like
coming clean or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Remember it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it was just this guy
who was just like, no one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no one had exposed him on YouTube. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No one had said anything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> He just came out with it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He was just like, I'm
addicted to porn guys. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm going broke because he's
like, Oh you had a few million. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And he just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh, I do remember that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> He was that guy who was in
like a happy relationship. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> He wasn't married. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Wasn't me happily married. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> He wasn't, he wasn't like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it was like a buff
really good-looking dude. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. I remember. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And he was just like, yes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> So like I'm just like
horribly addicted to porn. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah. He just spent his money </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on chatter Bay so bad for the dude. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's like, you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> had this like come out any other way. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> People probably would've
mocked him, but he, you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> he spoke about it himself </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you kind of felt like
really bad for the dude. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> You're like, I can't, I can't sympathize </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> per se because I would not sympathize. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can't ex you know,
experience that myself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But like, I was like, dude,
I would never want that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on like my kid or something to be like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> cripplingly addicted to
like virtual video porn. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Right. Whatever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't, I feel so bad about that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think it especially
hurts considering the fact </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that like he's going broke. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. And luckily the guy like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> the video is really good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I recommend watching it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like just to like, I dunno. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And him and his wife was
like understanding of it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And w she helped like walk him through it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I still was really sweet </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I hope the guy's doing better now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've, I've no idea. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't watch any of the videos, but like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> how'd you even get to
a point when you rise? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Like what, what, what is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what is the line where you
realized, what, what is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what is a porn addiction? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It's, is it how snap it's
going to kill me for that joke? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, is it to the
point where it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> you're spending so much money that it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like putting a dent on your
car to spend money on porn? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah. You off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I can handle the hot seat. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I've never spent any money on porn </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel that is like a
big line to cross where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're comfortable getting
your credit card out to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to put in. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Right. That's like just a lie. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't want to cross. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'd be really sad </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> in my son or my daughter,
if they were like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you've got a premium process subscription. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> why? Why? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah. I don't know what it's
like to me spending money on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like Kensai games or something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I completely understandable. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> As soon as you spend money on
like, I guess real life porn </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> for some reason that just flips
a switch me to be like, how </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> why? I think it's because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, unlike arrogation like
hand-eye and stuff like that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there was so many options
to get the same thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> That's for free. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Right. Because I've, I'm guessing none </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of us have ever actually bought a hint. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I DVD or hint. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh, wow. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Well, I did. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I did. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I bought the classic. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I bought mother knows breasts. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Did you actually, I actually bought it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. I bought a physical copy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because obviously the podcast. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. I, it hasn't arrived yet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I bought it because I was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I noticed that the, that who's selling it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They eventually, delist the older ones. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And I thought, well,
I've got to get a copy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of mother's breast just
in case it goes into that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That doesn't count </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because you've already seen him to it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It's going to be pristine. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You bought that for me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I bought it to preserve </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is the you're going to frame. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And you're going to begin to
show your kids and be like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> kids cost me $50. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Well, that's understandable. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right? Like, no </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> one's going to frame
their Brazos subscription </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on a wall. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Right. So it's like, when you mean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> there are people out there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But because it's like, you know, you hear </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about those, you know, that'd
be like politician scandals </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and they'd be like, he
spent $40,000 on porn. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, I don't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I even know how you would do that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Or you start to spend
that much money on porn? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't even know how you
go about how would you, like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what I want to know is how would
you not have enough sources </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of porn that you need to spend money on? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think a lot of people want
like specific porn, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, I think again,
like this is where a lot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> of like independent craziest company. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> No, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> That's, that's totally the reason why </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> only fans this thing, because I feel like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No pay $20 for something I a dude. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Right? Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, like for me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> for me, like, I can't,
I can understand why </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people would want to support
independent creators. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like for example, only fans or something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because you know, you, there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there is that parasocial
relationship in there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And I can totally understand
why people would want to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> spend money on that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't understand like
browser subscriptions </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or just like when there is no parasite </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> there is no parasocial relationship. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I would almost argue that only fans </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and all those parasocial
relationships are way worse </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> off than getting a break. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I totally agree with you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It is a dangerous </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't even like dislike
anything about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just feel sad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I look at it all. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, I just feel sorry for everyone. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, I mean, other than the creators </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> are making bank, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Good for them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like totally understandable. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The grind you do what
you gotta do, but like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what do you look at some
of these guys and you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> see what some of them say online? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, you just feel sad for them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> This isn't to demerit any like, Oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't work as, or anything like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is a lot of the,
they make is awesome. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And a lot of them put
a lot of work into it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I just feel dangerous </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Line that I don't want to cross. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't want to go into that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Cause if you, if you pay for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> One, I feel like you'll do it again. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll probably buy another one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I know some really good ones </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's dangerous for the
creator as well, because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Then you get, you know, some </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> of these supporters who get
a little too comfortable </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> with it and try and start crossing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, I can't imagine </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I can't imagine what they
have to deal with on the day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Huge, huge respect to them every time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like creepy dude, you
know, thinking that just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because they paid like a
grandiose amount of money </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to this creator that suddenly
they're like best friends </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, when that's
just not how it works. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> A few of them on Twitter </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> this is pretty good to
see like, Oh God cut. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> What do you see? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I like just seeing what they get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> up to is like it, I mean, it's sad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Some of the they got to
deal with just to like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you got to like fight just to take </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> to have people take you serious. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh my God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah, because the thing
is, I would like to think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Everyone's end goal for
watching porn is like, you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> an offset for being able to go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> into like a happy
relationship where you just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> feel satisfied and, and
like happy with banjo life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, you know, you stop wanting to be horny </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you just be happy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Saying Brandon horny happy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I feel like if you
go out and pay for porn </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you're crossing a dangerous
line where I've no return. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Right. Not, not that you can't
return from it, but you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're getting comfort. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It may not be dangerous. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just perceive it to myself. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah. That's I mean that this
is, this is sounds dangerous. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Everyone has </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Brian has a different line. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is my line as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Where if I go out and cross this line </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's the line that I'm not comfortable </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with myself being about. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And you know, some people are comfortable </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm sure there's
healthy people out there who </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, have I'm sure </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The thing was the addiction thing, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like it's like 95, 95% of
people are totally capable </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> of self-regulating and
not over-consuming things </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but there's a good amount
of people out there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where they find that one
thing that just breaks them </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and they just can't stop. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah. Like it's just what it is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's just, we go back to the point </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of how would you recognize
what, what point is too far? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Is it when your life is
being actively ruined </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> or when you just can't
find a happy relationship? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. Which is like, again </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> why like going back to that
video, like massive props </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to the dude for being
able to like stop himself </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and be like, you know what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> This is getting out of hand. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And honestly, like I, to me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was just amazed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that he was willing to
talk about that publicly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And you know, to me, I
was like, that's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that's like pretty big balls to come </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> out and be like, listen guys, I'm addicted </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to porn knowing that people
are going to meme you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But in, in reality, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's probably a lot of
people going through that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I have massive respect
for the guy for coming </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> out. And I think I remember as </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Well, like from what I saw hardly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Any meaning at all, the
comments were really positive. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Again, like w when the stuff is sensitive </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> people don't want to talk about it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Cause they mean it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> But it's really important
to have people come </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> out and be like, listen,
this is a real thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, it's me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> over. Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's the exact same thing with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> for example, Gacha addiction, you know, we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we can meme the out of it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But if someone has an issue,
you should take it seriously. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And you shouldn't just think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that people are going to mock you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and meme the out of you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Some people with addiction
to anything is never good. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Some people will </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but the good people out there
will actually understand that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know, you can have
an embarrassing problem. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Sometimes. Sometimes
it's hard to tell when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you've gone too far </SPEAKER_01>
