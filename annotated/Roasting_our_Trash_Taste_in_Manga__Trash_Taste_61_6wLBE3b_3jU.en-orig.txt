<SPEAKER_03> i am reading </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> that's it librarians wish they could </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> have connor's brain right now they they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wish they could access this fountain of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> knowledge </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and we thought obviously the best host </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> for the manga centric episode which we </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> are going to be doing today we don't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> choose host scan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> it's a rotation yeah and it just the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> stars aligned they were sending us a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> message just like it's connor's turn </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> caught a mustache who's the mongoose </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> episode yeah so that's what we're doing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> today like you've hosted the dojinchi </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> episode as well i just realized my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> complete chance and now you've also </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> hosted the manga episode right gonna say </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> i read yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> i'm somewhat of a reader myself </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> anyway yeah as we've said this is the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> manga episode of trash taste where we're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> gonna be discussing our favorite mangas </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on our favorite preferred method which </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is gonna be the three by three which you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> see on there we've talked about manga in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the past in a lot of different episodes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but uh i don't think we've actually </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> established like what our all-time </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> favorite manga is or like our manga </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> tastes cool yeah it's it's really weird </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because when we were thinking about what </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> if what haven't we like specifically </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> talked about on theme in an episode and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i was like wait a minute we've never </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> talked about manga and for some reason i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just assumed that we already had yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because it feels like we have right yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> exactly but like it just i was like well </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> we did the anime once obviously we did </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> the mongols right right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and of course i'm a bit uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thinking i was thinking about the fact </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i wonder because the movie one that we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> did recently uh is probably gonna have a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> lot more variation i feel like this must </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> be some more overlap this time right </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah i'm i really don't know like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> there's one or two i'm like i'm pretty </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sure if it's not on your list you would </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> put it on your list anyway there's at </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> least one i know that i probably i mean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah you're kind of limited in your i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> mean you're so expensive i mean i i know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> i've probably got at least one that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> the same as you i think i might have one </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> that's the same as joey as well here's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what i realized uh when i recently read </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh records of ragnarok yeah is that i've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> only read really long running manga yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i've not i don't think i've read a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> single manga that had like less than 150 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> chapters </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> i would actually agree with you on that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> i've it's okay so i realized when </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> picking my three by three is that there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> isn't that much choice or there isn't as </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> much choice as there is in the anime </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> world right of like manga that really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> left a deep impression on me and that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> because like manga you know if if you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> watch a season of anime it actually </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> takes less time to consume it than </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> reading a really long running manga </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> series because if it's like a like a one </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> shot or like a one volume kind of thing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it probably was not going to leave that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> deep of an effect on me i don't know man </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> i've read a lot of one shots that were </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like man this is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> dead ass better than some like yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> donald trump one shot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that was good that left an impression on </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> me i didn't expect to see manga donald </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> trump but </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> surely that given uh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> i didn't realize how much i missed death </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> note until i read that one shot and i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> was like damn we kind of need a sequel </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> to death he was just playing with us </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's the worst part is that it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like it was like uh you know like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> pro coming back and just styling on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> everyone and then being like see you by </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> the way yeah i mean like just being like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> i could come back yeah i could kill it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> it's like that villain wrestler who just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> comes in clotheslines and then </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> builds all your furniture leaves yes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah but then i also realized making </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this 3x3 is that i really haven't read </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> as much manga as i have watched anime i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> mean i i'm i'm unfortunately not the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> manga man that's probably joey right i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> think i think in your head you feel like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> manga is easier maybe maybe because </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> you're you can speak you can read </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> japanese fluently maybe </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> it is because you can just pick them up </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah you should go to the store pay two </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> bucks get the manga and you're good to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> go i mean as someone called the anime </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> man i obviously read a lot more monkeys </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> you know as we all know about it </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and i i do think that if that was the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> case i think i would probably read more </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> yeah but i think because the fact that </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> i'm not i do enjoy reading digitally i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like the ease of it but i do find that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's a little more </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i don't know it feels harder to get into </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i don't know why i mean digitally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah when i'm reading it i like it yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah but it's getting into it where i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like i don't know because when you when </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you see it in the store you can pick it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> up you can flick it through you're like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> oh okay there's no better feeling than </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like a physical right right right that's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> when you really get into it right manga </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because unlike normal books you have to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> actually just read it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it pops right out you can see oh okay oh </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and it feels a bit more intimate i guess </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and i i guess like most the manga that i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> put on my three by three i actually read </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i've read on paper </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and uh i feel like i don't know if </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's a complete coincidence some of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> them some manga i know are really good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and i purposely will not read it unless </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> it's physical copies yeah um other manga </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i kind of like i maybe read online and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> if it's like good then i try to go out </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> my way to buy physical copies </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah but i mean i like i'm saying i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think that for me at least a little bit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> anime is slightly easier to consume it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> really depends i don't really understand </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> how i consume manga </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> i don't really get it i think i like it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> i understand but i don't think i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> i get it it depends on the series for me </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> definitely like there are somewhere just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> like i really [ __ ] struggled to like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> get into the manga but for some reason </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> it's really easy to watch the anime vice </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> versa yeah also another thing when i was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> picking my three by three is like i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> really did i tried not to pick </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> titles that already had like a big anime </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> adaptation or had or something that i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> watched the anime and i feel like it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> doesn't make a change </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're trying to be like like i don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> watch the meme i don't read the means no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> because it's trying to be the artist </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> okay for example like i don't think </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> there's any point me putting one piece </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> on on my on my three by three so it is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> because the manga is the one with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everyone asking me why when i started it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah yeah because like the manga is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> amazing but i feel like with that you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> could easily you could either read the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> manga or watch the anime and you could </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> either have like a good experience on </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> each and everybody i don't think there's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> a single person watching trash taste </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that doesn't know what one piece yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> and i'm just like and i'm just like do i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> really need to tell my trash taste </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> viewers that i am a one piece fan </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> do you really need to know that i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i was my japanese class this morning and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> uh it was like they made me listen to </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> like japanese people speak and tell them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what they were saying and i got totally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> thrown off in one audio clip because </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> there was a woman talking about her </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> dress but it's one of the other ones </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah one pizza and i was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh she likes red one one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> piece </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i was like so thought i couldn't listen </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to the rest of it like yeah should you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> say one piece like the anime that you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> know we should have like the ptsd </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah i was like one piece </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> i can't escape it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when i was first getting into one piece </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i really wanted to buy the manga volumes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> obviously </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah i typed in one piece on ebay and </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_05> chapter i read up to i've read a good </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> chunk of black below i haven't caught up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because i know that a bunch of [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> happened and there's a lot of big plot </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> twists that i know about but i haven't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> read yet right uh but i've read most of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> black butler and it's so so much better </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in manga format than anime because the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> first yeah really the first okay the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> first season is basically like kind of </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_00> don't like it i don't want to talk about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it now um but yeah the third season of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> black butler the anime is based on like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the manga and it's amazing like it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a really morbid part it's really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> dark and you kind of realize how good it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> can be yeah um but yeah the manga is a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> really really good good read and i'd </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> recommend it if you kind of like the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> idea of black butler but don't want to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> go through with the anime yeah and i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> wouldn't have read it if it wasn't for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> my youtube videos yeah because like i've </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> heard the second season of black butler </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> is that different from the manga </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah completely </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um but like genuinely give the manga a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> shot it's it's pretty good so what's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like different about the manga than the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> anime that would you would recommend the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> manga over it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> well it's like way more serious way more </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> like it doesn't like [ __ ] around and it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> doesn't really feel like because the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> anime very much feels like it's kind of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> just yowie bait at times yeah yeah it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> definitely generally pertained to its </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> audience yeah and it's very and the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> first season again it's very casual it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> doesn't really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it it does it does cover a lot of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> same things but it does it in a way that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> i've just i think oh okay i watched </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> season one of the anime and i thought it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> was like it's fun it's fun but the the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> manga does it so much better it does so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> much more justice and i feel today's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like art style is a lot just like more </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> gritty and like kind of different it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> so good well she gets better as well and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's so good and the third seed of black </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bat like covers like a circus arc yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's so good and the anime does it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> justice </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> of circles </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> is like the anime finish now or or is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the manga finish sorry i think the man </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> is still going the manga is still </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> ongoing oh it's still going it's still </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> going okay it's quite long running and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um i don't know how many volumes around </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i think we're over like 13 at this point </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> i think it's way more quite a lot i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> think it's like over 20 now is it really </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> over 25. i think i've already read up to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> 10 </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> all right but i really enjoyed it i </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> wanted i don't know why i stopped i'd </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> probably go and read it because you know </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> when you catch up to a certain point </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> you're like i'm done yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> for me like my manga reading habits is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that i just love binge reading martial </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah so much i can't once </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 30 now volume 30 of black butler i know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i've read over </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> half i think right but i don't know how </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> long ago that was because i think what </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> was happening is that i got really burnt </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> out on it because i read so much of it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> in like your space and your entire </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> career was yes </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> yeah then that happened then i got which </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> but i think this is probably going to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> remind me to get back into it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> because with one punch when i did that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as well which we'll talk about later </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah but genuinely i think even though </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> if you've seen the show i would give it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> a shot yeah i've definitely i i did </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> remember giving the black butler manga a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> go like after i finished watching season </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> one yeah because i just at that point </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> season two had already finished airing </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> and i just heard yeah don't watch season </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> two yeah so i was like all right time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> for the manga then and i just never got </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> to it yeah and there's some it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really really dark at times like you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> forget like the main premise is that in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> black butler he hits a demon and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> he's made a contract with him yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to have his life at the end yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and like they kind of play off it a lot </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> in the anime and make it seem like oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's kind of hot huh it's kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> okay you know but uh yeah in the manga </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they constantly remind you sometimes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like oh [ __ ] he just like murders people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like yeah they're straight up and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they're not afraid of like showing like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really morbid stuff yeah some really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> good plot twists you know like i won't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> spoil some of them but there's some </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really [ __ ] up [ __ ] that happens in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that right and it's really worth giving </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it a shot even though all the stereo not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> stereotypes what the all the uh what's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the word </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> facade i guess facade or the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> preconceptions that a lot of the western </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> anime fans have i think in japan it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> pretty [ __ ] popular i think oh yes </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but it's popular but it definitely does </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> have like a strong female audience yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean sebastian is iconic yeah i mean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> being the sexy man </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah yeah i mean he was like the sexy </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> man of anime for like the early two the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> early to mid-2000s i still argue if you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> make a list of top five sexiest anime </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> characters sebastian's on like yeah he </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> is just sexy he just has that like she </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> has that like cult folks hit the pubs </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> [Music] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> it's black butler in it like he's just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> he's just an icon of his time for like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> anime and manga at the time like for </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> like there's there's a few like i'd say </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> characters in like anime that just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> personified a certain character trait </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like do you think of yandere for our </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> generation he's [ __ ] you know right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> right you know what i mean you think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> sexy man it's sebastian from black </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> butler yeah don't think anyone's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> replaced him yet yeah i know i mean the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> one that got close was maybe like yuri </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> from uranus oh yeah but even then even </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> then </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah i don't think he's just i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> don't think he's just charming </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> is just a staple of like it's like the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> sexy butler yeah of and but also just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> very swat very charismatic yeah like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's very entertaining and i feel like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> sebastian does carry it a lot of the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> time because he's just so fun and even </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> though he is like obedient he's just he </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> makes it so entertaining yeah and and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know again and even my videos i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> didn't didn't even remotely do him </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> justice he's such he's so witty and so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> clever in the anime and the manga sorry </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's it's so he's so fun to watch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the uh you know the third season of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the anime is good and the uh book of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> murder i think it's called is that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> correct book of murder is pretty fun </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like kind of like a mini whodunit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right all right within like in like two </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hours it's pretty fun that's cool yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's uh obviously </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sebastian solves everything and does it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> magically which is always fun because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> because it's like what if shakamoto </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> became a butler later on in life </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> that that is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i feel like sebastian and sakamoto are </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just like they're lyrics </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> you know what i mean they're literally </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> the same person </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> sakamoto is just sebastian in school </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> yeah </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> because they literally have the same </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> kind of like it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> maybe maybe sakamoto is a little more uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> tongue-in-cheek yeah but sebastian very </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> much has the same kind of uh visual </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> humor a lot of the time and does like a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> lot of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you know he's the joke is often that he </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is just so insanely competent at </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> everything he's just so op he is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> literally opie as [ __ ] but it's amazing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like it's so good i just love it it's so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's i feel like there's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this not a manga that that has the same </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> feeling as black butler i don't think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there's a single manga that feels like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> it or anime show that has the same kind </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> of vibe yeah yeah yeah i feel it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> definitely like created a staple for </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> genre like there's probably a lot of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> manga that's imitating black butler 100 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> percent </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah because there's not many manga out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there that do like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> deal with like pretty intense themes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they have like all these like thriller </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> aspects they also have the the you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the what parts that appeal to the fuji </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is quite a lot yeah right so it kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> mixes a lot of genres together and i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> think even jana tobaso herself said that </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> she didn't even know what genre she'd </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> put it in </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> because it's so it touches on so many </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> genres throughout the manga yeah that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> why i think it's super unique and worth </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> worth reading </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> okay did you watch the anime or read the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> manga first anime first okay i should i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> should have expected that actually yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so anime i got into so i watched the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> anime yeah and you know i thought </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> wow i just watched it and i thought it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was kind of man that's kind of boring </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> i thought it was okay you know i thought </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> season two was god awful yeah and at </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> this time book of six hadn't came out </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> yet and uh basically i i did that and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then someone was like oh you should uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you should just do like character </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> impressions for my youtube channel yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> well okay i did a few and then sebastian </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> just happened to be the one that i tried </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> first and i thought it sounded nothing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like him </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> like a british butler guy right oh my </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> god it's him but looking back i'm like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it doesn't even sound like j michael </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> taylor </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but you know i'm sure he was offended </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that people were i'd be offended </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> uh and then i did that and then i got </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you know i got surrounded by people who </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> loved it and you kept like telling me </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> read it read it yeah i was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> reluctant i was like no so wait what </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> what was the first manga you ever read </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> first is it on the three by three </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that you like distinctly remember it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> might have been black but no it must </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> have been black butler yeah blackballer </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it was black butler and i didn't read </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> any for like two years right </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> he just thought manga equals blackboard </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> the reason why i actually got into i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> remember this next i did a manga dub of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> uh part of the uh the uh a couple of the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> boat arcs called the campaign companion </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> just the border the white sock the book </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> of atlantic is it </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> book of atlantic i think we called it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> because they made a movie about it i </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> haven't watched the movie um i did a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> comic dub of a portion of that and so uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> yeah i just ended up reading it because </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> i was like oh this song looks cool and i </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> had it out of context and i was like oh </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> okay uh well this is cool i'm gonna go </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> read the rest and i started reading it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and i read past that point and then i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> stopped right but everything before i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> enjoyed but i'm probably gonna go finish </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it yeah because what i want to know is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that i'm looking at most of these and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i'd say </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> a lot of these have come from </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> recommendations literally from us </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> telling you like go out and read it i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> know exactly which one's got recommended </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> i know which ones i recommended </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so let's do it in the order of i watched </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that i read them yeah yeah yeah yeah go </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> go for it okay so next up was one punch </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> man okay yeah so what what inspired you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> to read one punch man i guess the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> animator yeah season one was too good </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> how can you you can't [ __ ] block me like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that right like season one was so good </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> yeah yeah and uh </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> i saw the manga and i was like oh a lot </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of the times when i'd see the manga and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i when i wanted to go further like past </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the anime we start reading the mark and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everything ah it's not the same yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but one punch was the one where i was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like holy [ __ ] this is insane yeah like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this this artwork is just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> insane yeah i noticed you have two </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> murata yusuke manga yeah i love his art </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> man </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah and he's so good at visually </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> conveying like action action and also </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> just kind of like metaphors i've seen </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> godly yeah let's talk about i swear like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because i think especially in sports </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> anime yeah sports anime a lot of times </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> live and die by the metaphor yeah right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> right because how how because concepts </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> need to be explained yeah yeah because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> like how can you convey a certain move </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or a certain like aspect of a sport that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> people who are do not understand a sport </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> can easily understand you go for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> metaphors and by far the manga that does </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the best of visual metaphors is i sure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 21. you know [ __ ] your high q and your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] christmas </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> this is why i would want him to do a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> chat anime you would explain the concept </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> of chess through metaphors </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah like this is a pin and he'd </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> figure out some weird [ __ ] way of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> showing it i would love that but yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> sadly it's not popular in japan </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> big rip but yeah one punch man i i just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like dude this one was still to this day </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> one of my favorite mangas out of all of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> these i still think that one punch man </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> maybe one of my favorites right it's so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> hard it's that's the difficult one </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because you have jojo because jojo is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> there as well and i think jojo might be </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> my favorite obviously um </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> but ah i think jojo is my fa is it like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> because i have a difference between my </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> favorite and the one i enjoyed the most </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah right and i think i enjoyed one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> punch man the most because it was just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> pure fun yeah yeah but jojo is my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> favorite because there's so much about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> jojo that i love oh yeah and i love the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> style of jojo i love all of that and i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> feel like giorgio is so much more than </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just the margaret it's experience </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> it's a culture you know you don't just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> read jojo you believe it you live it you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> experience it you become jojo there's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> just something about jojo which we'll </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> talk about later but yeah just there's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> something about it um but one punch man </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> man like i finished season one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and i was like okay i'm gonna check it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> out i'ma see what happens after yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because it ends because i mean after you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> watch the boros fight uh which you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> if you haven't if you don't know what </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> one punch man is i'm gonna explain to </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> you it's a guy who beats everyone in one </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> punch that's literally it and he's a man </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and at the end of the season one of the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> anime he has this amazing fight that is </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> so visually stunning yeah and just </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> amazing and it's so hype but it's </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> probably one of the coolest animated </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> fights in anime yeah um </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and i was like okay i have to know where </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> this can go because everyone's saying </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> the story is amazing onwards so i </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> started reading it and i was like oh </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> okay this is pretty cool the next arc </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> starts and i'm like okay this is really </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> interesting right because we start the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> uh what's known as the monster arc yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and the garo arc </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah and they introduce gara which is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like the one of the main characters </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> going forward in the in the anime and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> manga and season two covers uh i'd </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> probably say the beginning just barely </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the beginning of one of the the it's a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> long rock yeah it's very long it's still </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> ongoing on the on the manga um yeah i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> started reading it and i was like god </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> damn this man's drawings are just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> another level yeah yeah actually insane </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's it's insane because i remember </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> reading one punch man before the anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> came out because everyone was hyping it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> up so i was like it was the one show </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when i'm just like let me let me just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> see let me just read like a chapter or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> two just to see </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what can i what i can expect so i tried </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> reading a chapter or two and then i read </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everything that was out you can't then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you can't pick that up and not read </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everything that's impossible and then i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> remember reading and being like there's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no way the anime is gonna live up to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this fight </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> i was just like there's no [ __ ] way </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but like not not because the r is like i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> think some of the best art that's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> available i mean there's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> when you turn the there's a panel right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> where saitama punches so hard yeah the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> clouds split yeah yeah and in this panel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> you like the detail on the earth yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and the clouds is insane no there's some </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> panels that are literally just animated </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> keyframes yeah where you read it and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's it's it's just like it's just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> an anime because it's just basically </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> keyframes right so like i was very very </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> impressed at you know the team at mad </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> house for be being able to put their own </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> spin on his amazing [ __ ] art yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like living up to this amazing art but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> even without that one punch man is some </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> of the best battle shown in like 100 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> arts yeah that you can find in all of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> anime and manga yeah and i think that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we're i'm very glad that one punch man </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> season one was animated the way there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was because i think anime season one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is more of a comedy yeah and then season </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> two onwards is an action i feel like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> comedy very much takes a seat after the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> first arc well yeah because i mean you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> can only do so much with that single </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> concept right yeah but but like the way </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that they made it work every time was so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> genius and funny like one punch man </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> season one is one of the funniest shows </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> in anime yeah and in the manga i feel </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that although the art is much better i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> feel like the comedy doesn't hit as hard </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> because the comedic timing is super </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> important for jokes and i feel like you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can't have as good comedic timing when </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're reading something as when you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> experiencing it the joke i think i think </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> it's just like a different experience or </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> difference it's a difference but a joke </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a joke read aloud will always be funnier </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> than a joke you've read </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like that's just oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't know i disagree </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> i thought that too until i read like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> stuff like guinta </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah but i bet the gintama animes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> delivers the lines funnier </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> i don't know it's hard to say like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> sometimes it does yes but then there are </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> some chapters that i i think gintama is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the only manga that's genuinely made me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> laugh out loud reading it yeah and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's like a very powerful thing to say </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right because like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> again it's like as you said a joke is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> much funnier said out loud yeah but it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like timing timing you know everything </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> playing into the joke yeah there's so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> many aspects that can help elevate the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> joke i think that i think that comes </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> down to at least with manga how good you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> are at like framing yeah right and i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think munata yusuke is so [ __ ] good </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at framing yeah like a concept yeah that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he can just somehow do that with comedy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> as well he already proved it with actual </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> 21's like action scenes yeah and he this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> man can also do comedy as well i'm like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> what can this man not do yeah i've read </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> the original one webcomic oh yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how was that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah it's it's a it's a lot harder to go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> but also i know so explain one can't </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> draw that's why so the original the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> original yeah the original uh one punch </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> man is a webcomic i'm sure you guys know </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> this it's a webcomic and then um </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> picked it up and was like hey let me </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> draw good for you like real good yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> and and then published in shonen not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> jump it used to be jump right jump plus </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> jump plus now right it's once a month </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which is painful because i think uh juan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> did weekly is it i believe the webcomic </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is over now right is it um kind of like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> it's not over it's just on hiatus oh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> okay cause i've read up to everything </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's out and it's just kind of in the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> middle of an arc right now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah but like the manga </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right now is adapting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the it's so it's in the monster arc </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> stuff yeah it's it's still in the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> monster arc so it's taken the webcomic </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's kind of like a like a basis and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just really expanding on that yeah i've </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> noticed because that they've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in the the difference between the hmong </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and the webcomic is that they've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> put aspects of the story that happened </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they've moved them around yeah the manga </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> into like better timings yeah yeah like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's some characters that got their </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> backstory um </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in the webcomic at a certain time that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they were shifted to them when they were </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> having a fight yeah they got the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> flashback and their backstory uh like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's a superhero called super black </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> alloy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who is a man that is super muscular yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's his thing and he gets his </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> flashback at a different time but in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> actual uh the redone manga he gets it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> during one of his fights with garu right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um which i noticed was oh okay that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> interesting i didn't i didn't know they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> were mixing things around yeah um but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah the manga is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh my god just take one look at some of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> these panels and you'll be you'll be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah you'll be reading it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah it's definitely one of the best </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> action manga i've ever read if not the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> best honestly uh yeah it's hard i can't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think of anything that in terms of pure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> action and fights that comes close in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mind yeah i mean i haven't read many so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> i can't say but i mean i still think </SPEAKER_07>

<SPEAKER_03> description back to the shop i i really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> i really as you said terraformers </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> terraforms is great actually that was a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> great moment yeah but like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> the story is kind of mad at times yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> but the action is spot on it's so cool </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i've spoken about terraforms before but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> terraformers is just uh it's a manga </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> which is one of my favorites and i've it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> has like a ridiculous amount of chapters </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i think like 400 something i think it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> has </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's like 30 it's almost 30 volumes i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> think yeah and it's like i think they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> just started a new arc yeah when i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> stopped reading it and it felt like it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> was going to be the last and biggest arc </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> and i was like [ __ ] me i think it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> already finished has it finished i think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> has it i don't know no way because i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> only read up to him around like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> volume like 11 or 12. so the concept of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> terraformers uh which i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> dude i was so [ __ ] sold on this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> concept because i was like that's </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> [ __ ] bad yes it's very cool so </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> they're they they sent a mission to </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> explore uh the moon </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and when they got there there was </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> cockroaches that could just they were </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> just ripped like giggity chat like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> giga chances </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> someone had shot their fridge into the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> moon and they had cockroach on there </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> sorry </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like giga chad cockroach i know we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> spoke about terraforms before on like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the third episode or something yeah it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> been a while yeah so there's uh there's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cockroaches on the moon and turns out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they're not just any normal cockroaches </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they're giga chad cockroaches that are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like super human beings super smart but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have the senses of cockroaches yeah so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this whole team dies that goes there and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> you see this right away so it's not a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> spoiler um so that then earth goes and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they're like we must do something so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they go and get </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> warriors or people they think are worthy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to fight and they inject them or in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> their dna with insect dna yeah </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> so each one of them has insect </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> attributes so one of them is like a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> praying mantis mixed with a human and so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he can punch really like lightning fast </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> one of them i think they inject it with </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like a flea so they can jump really yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah yeah and one of and this was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> an i was sold one of them got the uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> what is the [ __ ] what's it called it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the shrimp that can like flick at like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> all the punches </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah yeah it's the manta shrimp that can </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> break clash by flicking the air yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah in front of it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and i was like oh [ __ ] i know the men to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> strip this badass </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and so then they send them to the moon </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to go and uh do research and fight back </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> again </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's so [ __ ] cool because then it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> turns into like a political thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> because obviously if there's [ __ ] on the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> moon there's gonna be a lot of countries </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> arguing about what's going on there and </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> who did it yeah was this here how many </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> how many chapters they have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 22 volumes okay is it over or is it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> still gone </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah it's a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> three years ago yeah and it was still </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> ongoing yeah was it yeah when did it end </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> a couple of years ago right 2014. no oh </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> i think it started in 2014 didn't it it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> started 2011. oh [ __ ] where when did it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> finish </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> really there's no way i could have read </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everything because when i finished </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> reading it it was not </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> done going are they yeah pretty sure are </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> you sure it's over </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> either way you need to catch up on yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> by the way i need to catch up and it was </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> such a fun manga and if you like one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> punch man i think you'll love </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> terraformers i i'm curious how did you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> find terraformers because what's the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> anime </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> i'm i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm so sorry </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> what what convinced you from the anime </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> to be like i'll read the manga maybe the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> blue maybe the manga is better yeah okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so terraformers had an anime adaptation </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and it was notorious for being </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> absolutely dreadful because what they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> did was they made this extremely gory </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> anime yeah and they were like this is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> great let's just censor everything yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but they did it in the worst [ __ ] way </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they literally put black dots and bars </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> across the screen so there were some </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> scenes where you couldn't see anything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it's literally infamous because i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> remember one of the first screenshots </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah because i remember i read some </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> performance before the anime came out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and i was just like how are they gonna </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> adapt this because some of these scenes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are pretty like brutal pretty gory </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and then i saw that i think the famous </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> scene is where like the cockroach is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> holding someone's head yeah and it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> just like he's just holding a black </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> circle </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because dude this i i'm still convinced </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right if this had like a good anime </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> adaptation like a solid animation like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not one punch man level but close to it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah right of the action scenes being </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> done that well this would be like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> [ __ ] oh yeah and that's what i was </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> looking forward to because i remember i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> i got recommended the manga from like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> one of my friends who was like dude you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have to [ __ ] with that this is amazing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right i was like oh because could you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> imagine the shock people would get when </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they're like this there's a scene right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where uh it's very early on so it's not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> really a spoiler but one of the scene </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> because they all the teams drop in </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> different locations on the moon so you </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> kind of get like play by place where all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the different teams are on the moon and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one of the scenes where one team just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> goes out of the ship and immediately </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just they see a flash and someone's lost </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> their head already yeah yeah and it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> hold on [ __ ] and i was like right after </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> she was injected as well </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> all right here comes he comes apart </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where she kicks us yeah he immediately </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> dies yeah and it's like oh [ __ ] they're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they're stronger yeah and it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everything about this show is so hype </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and like reading the manga is like okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how are they gonna build on this and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they just keep finding ways to make it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> more and more interesting yeah it's like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> holy [ __ ] and the art style is so cool </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> honestly honestly </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> like the manga just never stops kicking </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> off it's it's like permanently just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> kicking off it's really popping off </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and if there's not fights there's some </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like game of thrones political [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> going yeah yeah yeah and it's like all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right just as we're on the moon doesn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> mean that china doesn't hate russia like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah there's stuff going on yeah it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> like it's so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's so good and it's yeah and i love </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> how they introduce like i love it when </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> shows when there's a lot of characters </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that it's like this is the character </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this is where they're from this is the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> height this is their ability and you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> like sick sick thank you and i can </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> mentally remember that information </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah because the the how i discovered </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> terraformers is moving on to the next </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> show on your list which is gantz like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i literally finished dance i was like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> need more shows like yeah it's very </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> reminiscent i i think it's just like how </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> brutal and unpredictable like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> unpredictable it is in terms of who's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gonna live who's gonna die and i feel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's you know it's it's the meme wedge </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where if you can't predict what's gonna </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> happen or who's gonna die it's like oh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's gonna like the game of thrones but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> like the first time i actually was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like properly shocked at who lived and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> who died was [ __ ] gans </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> which i don't know if how much we can go </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> into spoilers about gans but </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> you cannot predict who dies </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah and and the anime was like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> it was decent it was pretty solid i feel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like if you are between the ages of like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> even though you shouldn't be reading </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> this for 16 but if you are at the age of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> six no no no no no this this is like the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> perfect i i think i watched the anime </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> when i was 16. this is like the most i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> 16 and i want to be experiencing badass </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> okay there's a scene that happens very </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> early on right yeah this is quite </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> graphic um where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so i was explaining the premise right so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> against what happens is uh wait wait how </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> does it very very start it starts with </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the the two main characters jumping in </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> front of a train yeah so oh that's one </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah yeah yeah so the two characters die </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> in a train crash or like that scene was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] yes yeah so they died pretty </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> brutally in a train crash um and </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> afterwards they wake up in this room and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this black </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> circle has transported to them to this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> room along with a lot of [ __ ] along </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with other people who have just died and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they're all wearing suits and everyone's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> wearing a suit they kind of look like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they're wearing like [ __ ] suits or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whatever suits yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> and uh they're told that they have to go </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> kill this alien oh no they they don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wear the suits that's all the weather </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> suits yeah they're thought to wear some </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> people don't want to wear this yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it looks it looks like it looks like a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] uh it does like a gibson yeah it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> does kind of look like a [ __ ] suit right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and there's just a moment in this anime </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that either manga it's a slight spoiler </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> but not really early on uh where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a girl gets transported in the room </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and he's like a teenage boy and he's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like let's have sex and she's like okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah just have sex and you see it you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like whoa okay what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> and they don't they don't do it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> terraformers in the animals </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> in the anime there's literally two sex </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> scenes in the anime yeah and he just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> stopped having sex there in the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> hallway of this house and it's like it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> like whoa okay uh i haven't experienced </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> this before in a manga yeah just [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> happening all right this is this i don't </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> even think dogen's gonna get into the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> segment </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> literally just girl appears like do you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> wanna have sex because we're dead and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he's like yeah sure yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> and i remember watching literally </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> watching dance when i was about like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah 15 16. that is the most i'm 16 and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm just like oh my god </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> they're sharing a sex scene </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> what do you mean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> when i read it like last year you know </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> it's it's one of those shows that </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> there's nothing quite like it yeah well </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> this is really fresh holy [ __ ] i haven't </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> experienced anything like this yeah and </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> it doesn't hold punches you know and the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> whole aspect is that they have to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh kill these demons that exist in the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> human race aliens aliens yeah they they </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> say that there's been aliens that have </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> been living in the human world and then </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they have to like kill them and so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> they're worth points and there's x </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> amount of points to come back alive yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> exactly or you know there's there's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> different things that they can do with </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> points right they can bring people who </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> have died before back to life as well um </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> the point is that to kill an alien first </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you you you think it's like an easy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thing to do yeah but like it's really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really [ __ ] difficult to kill these </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> aliens and every arc there's a different </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> alien that they need to kill and there's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a difference </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it gets harder and harder and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> progressively like more and more people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> will die to the point where you can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> never really expect who's going to live </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and who's going to die yeah um and i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> remember like i feel like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i feel like the peak arc was part two </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it's like separated into three </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> parts i think yeah i think part two was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> the best uh part three had some really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really good moments i feel like there is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a certain climax to gantz that really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like it really it made me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really existential yeah yeah i know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're on it yeah and without spoiling </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> two specific details when they find the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> creator of these balls </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that [ __ ] scene just like i remember </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> reading the events of that scene and i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> oh my god this man did like 10 tabs of </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> lsd yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> it's it's so it's so like giga brain </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> existentialism but yeah i mean awkward </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> have you read anything else by auckland </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i i've i know he did the uh ini was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] yeah i've heard i know of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> other stuff he's done and it's all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> [ __ ] from yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> the the most recent one he did was this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one called gigant </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i've heard of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's like giggit and god put together </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> another just awful uh gig is also just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> like i i've started reading it's just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> real no it's still going </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to take that long </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> it's really [ __ ] good but it's like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you know it's an okuhiro manga because </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just [ __ ] there is uh there is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> one scene that i will warn you is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> extremely questionable uh in the in the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> world oh yeah and we spoke about this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> before in the podcast extremely </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> questionable just giving you a heads up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> uh yeah it's a little racist they're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> quite racist i mean ice shield has a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> similar sign yeah yeah yeah yeah i think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> we spoke about this before in the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> podcast as well but just get a heads up </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> if you do go into it there is like that </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> moment yeah um it's very yikes and like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> uh okay uh </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> all right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> what i love about gantz and uh </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> terraformers it's just it's pure bat </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] insane fun oh yeah yeah it is and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like it's it's kind of like the edgy 16 </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> year old in you but like there are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> somebody brings out the 16 year old in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you that thinks like just fighting and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> death is badass but like there's there's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like two like kind of different </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> categories i put this in you know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there's there's like the edgy 16 year </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> old kind of shows where it brings that </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> out of you and it remembers what you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> felt like when you were 16. and then </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> there's shows like elf and lead and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> mirai nikki </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> elephant yeah that you watched and i'm </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> just like damn why the [ __ ] did i ever </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> enjoy this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah i can look back and i'm like that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> was good yeah that was a look back i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> like why was this even remotely popular </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> i was like i was like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> 10 out of 10 when i was 16. i'm just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> was i this easy to trick when i was 16 </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> when i saw blood </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> when you were 16 this is this is new to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you like yeah this [ __ ] is exciting </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> you're like whoa </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you can do this yeah oh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> it's artistic yeah it's just like it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> it's it's crazy yeah i remember a point </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> when elfin lead was literally when i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> joined the community elephant lead was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> considered like a modern day classic </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah i don't know i think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> if you thought the anime was good read </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> the manga because it's like completely </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> different and i was like all right that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is no different no it is it is very it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> actually more [ __ ] in the manga oh oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> okay but like you know 16 year old aj me </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> was like how how could they improve on </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> this and then you read it now and i'm </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> all right yeah i mean i think i've like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> watched like full moon alchemist before </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it you know yeah yeah yeah then just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> going from that where i was like okay </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah i was like i was like looking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> at my monitor on like all like with all </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> these [ __ ] pop-ups everywhere like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> whoa what the [ __ ] you just cut them up </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah with like ghost arms like what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah from i think that like the next </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> show after elfin lead and miranda was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> probably a karmico kill </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> um where i remember he got so [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> popular and i'm just like i watched the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> anime okay that is what i'm 16 yeah i i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> am 16 like i i'm i'm 14 and this is deep </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i am convinced right okay i like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> alpha i know evelyn i like how can i get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> killed i'm just gonna say it right now i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like it okay okay i don't care what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> people say okay i like it [ __ ] you i </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like that did you finish it the anime </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> i think this will make sense okay this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is how i i view it sure </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> pov you're a fairy tale fan </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you're tired of fairy tale you want </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> something a little edgier you go </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> immediately to act make a kill yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> that's it feels think about it yeah it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> is literally fairy tale with but fans </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> but with way more edge because it feels </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like fairy tale in many aspects where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> it's like this is dumb dumb [ __ ] why </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> specifically fairy tales because people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> who like make a kill are fairy tale fans </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you are right you're all right it is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> literally uh if you are a fairytale fan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i bet you love i can make a kill yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> you are right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> think about it think about it say i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> agree with seven deadly sins no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> but that's that's all kind of the same </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> seven deadly sins i think people know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> it's slightly different i think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so we need to make a chart of like what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're likely to like based on which </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> show we just get like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah we do right i think i think if if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> seven deadly sins is on one end it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like yeah hunter hunter is on the other </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> end i think yeah yeah yeah and then what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> other shootings are there like i don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> know just like i don't know [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> seven deadly sin somewhere to me i can't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> make a kill is just like the generation </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they go into seven deadly sins or fairy </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> tale and then they also much mirai nikki </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and they were like what if we just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> combine the two what if we just combine </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the two and that and then you get a calm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and go kill when you're like great i you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it you require </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> even less brain cells to enjoy this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> brilliant i i even though i recognized </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the ending was [ __ ] dumb for i can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> make a kill i liked it i thought it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fun i had a great time watching that i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> not afraid to admit just the the plot </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> twist yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah it was come the [ __ ] off but i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> still had a lot of fun like before that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i had a lot of fun with the show i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> really enjoyed it yeah admittedly as </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> much as i planned on coming to kill </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> first like five six episodes pretty fun </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah it's just like brainless fun but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know what else i read that i read </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> speed run reading to julian yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> so that i can talk about it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like i'm i think i'm like one volume </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> behind right now and it's pretty [ __ ] </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> good so far i'm surprised they're ending </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it this </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> soon though because i'm not gonna go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i've heard that it was not too long ago </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that we got introduced to the main </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> villain so yeah i'm not gonna i don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wanna </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't wanna say anything because i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> don't know anything that's just what i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> know so because everyone was telling me </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that it had so much much left but </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> whatever i'm gonna i'm probably gonna </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> read it i might make a video about it i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> don't know if i should on my main </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> channel it's pretty good maybe i will </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> maybe i'll i wouldn't say it's as good </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> as i think it would be on brand for you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> right yeah it'd be on brand for you i in </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> my opinion it's not as good as like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> seven part six or seven but it's up </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> there it's still pretty good it's jojo </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we'll see how we'll see how this uh how </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> your feelings will change in the news </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah i mean i don't know like the ending </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> of jesus might be [ __ ] amazing right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah true who knows but yeah jojo i mean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> i mean it was the jojo manga that made </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> you a jojo fan right yeah so it was </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> definitely i was watching part five </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and i wanted more of part five because </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> it hadn't fully aired yeah we were only </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like ten episodes in and i was really </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> enjoying it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so i went and picked up the manga and i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just [ __ ] loved it like i said such a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> great time um </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> it's a shame that it's the english </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> official releases are quite slow mm-hmm </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> um i think we're they just finished </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> part four </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah i mean like really yeah oh geez </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> like a lot of people forget that jojo </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just like was this super [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> underground manga that only like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> select few people really read before the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> anime became a thing and so there was </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> dust yeah in the west and so like there </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> was just no interest to translate it </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> officially until the anime came out now </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's weird seeing it become this like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> massive one of the most biggest anime </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> franchises i made a video on what was it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it was like i had this series like back </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> in the it's like five years ago i had </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> this series where i would like go into </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> manga and like kind of find like myths </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and like kind of secrets and stuff like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that and kind of talk about it yeah i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> remember i made a video on it was part </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> three oingo boingo and there's that like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> you know the moment </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> i made a video on that five years ago no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> views </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> no views at all i was like oh my god and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> that's when i realized i was like oh no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one in the west knows jojo yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> at that point i feel like jojo was such </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> a 50 50 on whether it would do well yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i think it just i'm really surprised </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> that it did it just got i think it just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> got lucky with the with the memes i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> think so yeah it was it was like it was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like so perfected for meme culture that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it was like so ahead of its time yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's it's really weird because you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it wasn't really memed until part three </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah the anime came out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> i guess i feel like i i did not see </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> anything about it until part three came </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> out and then i saw i never stopped uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> seeing the d.o versus jotaro like steam </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> sale memes you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> you'd see a ton of memes with the aurora </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and all that yeah yeah that's when it </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> really started picking up steam i think </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and then it started i then i think the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> um people started realizing how good the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> anime adaptation was and then part i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> remember it really kicked off during </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> part four yeah airing in the west was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when it started really getting some </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> steam yeah and then part five just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> insane </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah the part five anime adaptation of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> jojo really like centered into like this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like because the [ __ ] jordano's theme </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah did numbers for the meme community </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> oh yeah yeah and jojo in general i mean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how many people got into part jojo in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> general </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> from the journal's team yeah because i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> it's like the um what was the undertale </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> theme uh megalovania </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah it's it's up there with megalovania </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> in terms of like obviously it's the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> anime community yeah right because think </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of like iconic meme music that came out </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in the past 10 years what what have you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> got there like actual like iconic like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> super iconic </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> theme megalovania there's probably some </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> other that i'm forgetting yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> i think that was joking there wasn't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> really an explosion of like jojo never </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> exploded you just slowly crept up in </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> popularity until you couldn't you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> couldn't like it was inescapable yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> i've really helped since part five </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> started airing it really blew up yeah i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> feel like a noticeable change yeah in my </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> opinion part five is probably one of the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> only parts where it's actually better in </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the anime yeah yeah part four i think </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you can go either all part four was yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> either three three two and one hundred </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> percent the market yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i think part three was like dragged out </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> too much in the anime yeah you can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> speedrun it yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> you could be like all right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> obviously don't do that but you can you </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> can get through it at a good pace yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> um but the part three of the anime is </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> very slow which i think jojo in general </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> is better in manga also because you have </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> part six and seven which are very good </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> part seven being especially notorious </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> for being just amazing </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> part seven is possible is amazing part </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> seven is where i feel like iraqi really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> came into his own and finally made like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the perfect jojo part where there was no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> pacing issues yeah i feel like every </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> part of jojo had some kind of weird </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> pacing at some point or another every </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> character was fun and like memorable </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah like so so for example like part </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> three it drags out a bunch part two is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> very short and sweet you don't really </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> get too much but it's very nice and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that's why part two is i mean joseph's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the only redeeming factor about that </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the villain's boring yeah right part one </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean it's no touristy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's quite boring i won't lie it has a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> lot of charm as a jojo but at least it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> short all right it's very short you can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> read through it part four </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kira who is the arguably one of the best </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> villains in jojo isn't there for the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> first half so you kind of get a slice of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> life for the first part which is which </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is fun but it takes a while for it to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> kind of find its footage yeah if if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're not a fan of that kind of stuff </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you can easily like fall off it yeah and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> be like why is this popular yeah why do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> people like this um plot five is very </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> solid uh i think that uh jordana is one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> of the weaker joe joe bros uh joe joe </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> pros jojo's um you know bootstrap really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> does carry oh yeah yeah yeah um and then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> part six you know it's good it also has </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a bit of a controversial ending um i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really like i like it but some people </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> don't like it i can understand why </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> people wouldn't like it i feel that some </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> parts of part six are a little weak but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> part seven is like from start to finish </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> banger every single character banger </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the villains even like the side </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> villains i mean it is it does have kind </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> of the least memorable jojo's though uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> johnny uh yeah i don't know i feel like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> johnny doesn't get good till like the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> last quarter maybe johnny comes into his </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> own yeah yeah but i feel like jono </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> doesn't really come into his own no at </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> any point no sorry if we're going on a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> whole talk about jojo um watch or read </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> jojo just just talk about it jojo fans </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> being jojo fans exactly right you need </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> to read it because then you can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> experience part 7 which you should 100 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> read it is amazing no you can't skip to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> it don't do that yeah because part 7 has </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> so many references to previous parts </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> you'd be spoiling it read it all it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> amazing yeah yeah uh all right what else </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> feelings are vinyl and saga did you put </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> this on your list or not or we're gonna </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> get it i uh i didn't put this on my list </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> oh okay yeah i almost did but then i was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like yeah the anime is out villain saga </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gets to go on my list wonks the banger </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> two because they uh spell a welsh town </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> correctly </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah it's got one of the most badass </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> like antagonists in like manga and he's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> welsh yeah welsh as well of course i i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> didn't i knew you would love this skull </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> lads </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> represent represent they went to like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> somewhere and that i was so glad that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> they i want i really want to because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> obviously i read it in english yeah i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> really want to see how they spelled this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> welsh town yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> like because it's like it was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> or something right yeah and i was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> how the [ __ ] do you how the how on earth </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> do you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> i don't remember how i'm pretty sure i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> got up to that part but i don't remember </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> how they spelled it i really want to see </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> how they spelled it i was like oh that's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> a funny name because how on earth did </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> you put the sound they probably don't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they probably didn't yeah they already </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> did yeah they probably did like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but uh yeah though honestly memes aside </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> um vinyl and saga is amazing like i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think even if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i had read more than 10 manga </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it would still be on there it is so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> [ __ ] good it's on hiatus and it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> still amazing is it on hiatus yeah isn't </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it i don't know i think i i feel like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> it's still i read up to a certain point </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> i caught up and then i stopped yeah what </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what is it about like all these like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> sane and manga the sane in classics i i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> would like to call them that just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> eventually goes </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> masterpieces always go on yeah saying </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> that masterpiece is always going to go </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> on hiatus right and it's just villain </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> saga is just amazing and like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> the you when you realize it's a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> prologue the first arc is just a </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> prologue yeah and yet it's still one of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> the best stories okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> what do you think for because if you've </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> seen season one villain saga you know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what the prologue is you know what the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> main are the main beginning arc is what </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> do you think of the farmland arc </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i really like the farmland </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i'm excited to see the reactions </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> so the farmland </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay so we won't talk too much about it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we'll spoil it but it changes the pace </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> drastically yeah if okay so if you think </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that if you go into season two thinking </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that it's going to be in the same vein </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> of season one you're going to be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> disappointed the way i find a feel about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it right right is that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> berserk and villain saga they have a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> crossroads and they both went different </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ways with it yeah yeah whereas you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for example guts right never stops </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> becoming violent yeah god's argument </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> becomes more violent every time yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah and you know vinland saga tries to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> make a character that maybe feels a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> little bit more guilty about that yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and so that's what was really </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> interesting for me is that they weren't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just like okay this guy's good at </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> killing yeah that's what he does now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah he just keeps killing he's like no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he he actively like he matures he </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> doesn't want to keep doing that that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and that's what's so interesting about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it and really recommend reading it it is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just amazing it's like a huge artistic </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> risk he took with that oh yeah i think </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> it paid off </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like his the the worst thing he did </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was making the prologue so [ __ ] good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like like imagine that being the worst </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> thing you could do you made it so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] good that people expected you to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> keep doing that yeah yeah and it's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> he he keeps doing it but in a completely </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> different type of story yeah because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like villain saga is [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> incredible but like the prologue is so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> different than the rest of the story </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that if you come into it with the same </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> expectations you're gonna just get </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> whiplash you're gonna be like where's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the action where's the killing where's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the violence there was so much of this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in season one and i was just like well </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> once you've realized that the story was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> never about that that the story was all </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they were building it up the whole time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah when you realized that everything </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that his father said at the beginning </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> was what the story was meant to be about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> from the from the get-go and everything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> else was just like everything else was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> like a bigger tangent than anything that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> we've ever gone on yeah you know and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> that was yeah yeah season one's just a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> time but it's so true to life because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> even if your dad told you [ __ ] you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> wouldn't [ __ ] listen to him yeah but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then you'll realize when you're an adult </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> he was right all along exactly that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i'm sorry i went against you father it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so good because it's so like even though </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the situation's obviously crazy but even </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> though it's not that unbelievable </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because you know it's it's set on like a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> real part of history yeah you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it it builds characters in such a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> compelling way that are so realistic and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> every single character in this show </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're like i believe that could be a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> dude yeah yeah i believe that i i see </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> parallels to myself and some of these </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> characters that are uncomfortable yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and that's what i loved about it it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so good and it presented war in a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> horrific way yeah as war should be yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and so if you haven't please do yourself </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> a solid and and read vineland </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> it is amazing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> if you like vikings i just just you know </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> just just at least read if ask a lads or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> at least watch the anime for asking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> because he is honestly like i think one </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of my favorite characters oh yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> oh he's straight up my guy and also i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> mean </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> i'm very excited for the reaction to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> anime fans and my only fans to the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> season </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> two yeah to be like hey when does when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> does stuff happen </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so how long are they going to how long </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> are they going to stay on this farm it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> goes from like doom to runescape in like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> like one chapter it's like it's like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's like doomed it's like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> like stardew valley or something like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> that i guess that's spoilers enough </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> right yeah i mean berserk we've we </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> literally just talked about berserk yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> it's a classic for a reason i've spoke </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about claymore before yeah um claymore </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> again is uh very similar to i guess </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> berserk in some ways yeah i'm stock fans </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> would you say you enjoyed it enough that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> if you had read more manga you think you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> would still be in yours i don't think it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> would be on here if i'd read </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> some other big names that i know i would </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> enjoy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um i think it's got a benga first half </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah and then loses its steam yeah you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know there's some stories where you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> reading the manga and you're like this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> [ __ ] planned everything yeah </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> like a blueprint yeah yeah he knew </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> exactly what was gonna happen and he </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> knew exactly where this was going </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> whereas with claymore i feel like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> they would he was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they were just writing it and he had a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> core idea and he just didn't or they i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't know if it's a guy or a girl yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uh they just didn't really know how they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> wanted to finish it but that that's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's the i believe george armada talks </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> about this there's two ways of writing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> stories and there's the architect and </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> the uh </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> something like something to do with like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> growing plants or something yeah yeah </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> one likes to design everything like a </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> building you have every single aspect </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like out perfectly and the other it's </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> like a greenhouse you just kind of grow </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> things see where it goes see what goes </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> with it i definitely feel like that is a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> riskier way of doing stories but also </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> can lead to some super interesting </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> results yeah and i feel like claymore </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> just kind of lost and i feel like the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the architect like type is like the the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> downside to it is like you could build </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> too much and then you kind of have to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> like oh should i have to pick up all </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> these right here </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe you build too much of the world </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah sometimes it's a bad thing i mean </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> you can pull up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> right just like hunter hunter introduced </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like seventeen thousand things yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> there is it's just harder to maintain </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah exactly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> breaks down and you put more bricks down </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and then you forget the foundations you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> laid yeah you start building a chimney </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> where you've already built like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fireplace on the other side it doesn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> make it like any sense something except </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe i'm running out of bricks i don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know how much time left my back hurts i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can't draw [ __ ] i should have thought </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> about this or you could just be like a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> rocky and just be like yeah i'm just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gonna plant the scene here and see how </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it goes which is what i love about he </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that is the perfect example of that kind </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of writer iraqi literally just gives you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ideas and then he just keeps expanding </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> on it yeah and you can tell he has some </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> idea where he wants it to go but you can </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> tell also </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you can tell there's so many moments </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> where he just like and he even says it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> himself right when he just decides to do </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> things he doesn't remember half the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> he wrote </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> it's such a fun way and it leads to such </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> fun writing yeah 100 but yeah claymore </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> although </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> an amazing concept amazing first half </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah definitely and the art is so good </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> you're beyond that that's amazing yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's one of the best [ __ ] love what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> is it what is it about dark fantasy </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> where just the art is just always about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> i don't know it's it's it's like a rite </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> of passage right oh you want to write a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> dark fantasy show me your drawings you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> better have godly and for some reason </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm a simple man um i like rankings so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> whenever there's characters and they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> have ranks </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a true gamer they're clearly defined as </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> this is number one strong this is number </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> two strong i don't know why i love that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> but you're a gamer yeah because it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> like i mean i i feel like there's just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> something embedded into like yeah humans </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that i just like rankings we love </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> ranking things yeah and i love and then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the story aspect of number seven could </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> actually be stronger than number two </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah in some ways and that's super </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> interesting why you like one punch man </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> i love the hero rating system </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i think it leads to such interesting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like characters in really strange ways </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um like yeah i love the bicycle man in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> there yeah i mean that's just why that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just part of like showing an anime right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> we need to rank people because people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> like ranks people like i love it what </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> what are the what are the youtubers </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> going to make videos about if we can't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] rank exactly right in japanese </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> companies you get ranked on your </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> performance yeah with a rank and uh like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> a grade i want to be number one yeah so </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> like it's it's like they they love doing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> it everything needs to be ranked here </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> like a bidet rank </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what i love is how everyone's just found </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> out like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> power ranking things just like people </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just you could power rank the most </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> mundane things </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> this is why it's here this is literally </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> what tealistic yeah it's literally just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> powerful yeah yeah yeah um and then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> obviously i shield 21 which is uh i've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> watched crocodile basket i i've read </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i've watched your mushy pedal uh what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> other sports anime have fans </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i've watched haikyuu slam dunk i haven't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> read slam dunk i'm gonna read slam dunk </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but so far this is my favorite sports </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> story oh yes yes it's awesome and again </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like the visual this single-handedly got </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> me into american football yeah i i still </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> don't know the rules fully yeah um but i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> had a fun time i mean it's very deviated </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> from real life it is i'm like i'm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> watching real american football and i'm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just like where are the metaphors </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> where where </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> you're not gonna lie like i was like oh </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> you know when i when i read this because </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> i was like in the prime of my childhood </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> when this was in show and jump right so </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> everyone like everyone was trying to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> like do rodeo drives and like double </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that ghost </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> this is the one move that is probably </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like the most feasible </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> if i ever throw a football ever again </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> you bet i'm gonna like picture a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> angel behind him </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> there's a panel where like he throws </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> this ball and it's like this amazing </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> artwork of like this angel yeah the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> angel throw or something </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> this panel it's like a spread and it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] beautiful yeah yeah and it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just oh it's so good i think some of the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> best is where you see the battle of the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> metaphors and i think it just makes the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it makes the sport scene so much more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hype </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because i can't remember the exact </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because it's been years and years um but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i remember like very vividly just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> someone kicking a ball and it just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> it it's kicked with like so much force </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> or something that it like penetrates </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> something that's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] i'm i'm speaking what was like the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> second to last match what was like the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> last match was against the best school </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> yeah they were like the best school in </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> japan yeah because that's was probably </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> the highlight of it and then afterwards </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they fight america </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> that's right oh yeah and that was kind </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> of that kind of sucked yeah but yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> they go against like the best players </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah the real number seven the real </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> number the real 21 21 21 [ __ ] house </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> the real high shots </SPEAKER_08>

<SPEAKER_03> three of the locker room did you reckon </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they did it on purpose or an accident i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> reckon it's by accident so i was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> wait don't tell me all of these at all </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> for some reason volume one and four was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so so it's probably just you know you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know when you like take a dvd out to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> watch it and you have to put the dvd in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the dvd player back in the box yeah i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> think you forget that you've just like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> was owned by like a teenager and it was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> like well i need to hide the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> degenerative [ __ ] from my mom i'm going </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> to put the bow before oh my god that was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> totally it wasn't it was slowly yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like they'll never know we'll never know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> we'll never know i just think it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> barbara some kids jacked off dior </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> volume 1. i'm trying to throw that out </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> uh is this junji ito so that's uzumaki </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh yeah it's this i'd be surprised you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> know it's ichigo 100 oh it's itchy i've </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> heard of this i have not read it or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> watched it okay um so which one would </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> you like to know first obviously we i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> think we can get rid of uh </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> again jojo because we've already talked </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> about that already talked about that so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> not hunter hunter okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> i i i'm probably going to get destroyed </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> okay okay i haven't read hontanti yet oh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> okay wait i've watched it and it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> amazing yeah the only reason why i i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> think the biggest takashi sim hasn't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> read </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> so much about hunter hunter </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> just from outside information but i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> haven't actually read it or watched it i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> i own all the volumes right now i think </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> it's sitting there waiting for off for a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> rainy day i think it's i think it's safe </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to say this it's the best show to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> animate i feel like a lot of people say </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that i feel like i've been lied to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because the amount of times we talk </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> about hunter hunter and me and connor </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> have just like been talking about the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> dark continent </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we always mean like netro getting up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> i just i just always assumed that joey </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> was just like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> literally all the information i know is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because people around me don't stop </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> talking about that it's not okay you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> need to go watch it what the [ __ ] or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> read it the anime is amazing i never </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> said i read it or watched it </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> i just assumed the anime man had watched </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> hunter hunter </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> i feel like this has just been a game of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> among us now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] impossible there's an impossible </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> among us </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> so much about hunter like i could </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> probably like give you the outline of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> how it goes but i don't know what the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> names of the arcs i want to go back to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> every clip now </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i know like dark content and our camera </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> and arc all of those the hunter exam arc </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> and all that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> i know them again because i hear it from </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> everybody </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what i want to know is how we've just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> found out about this despite the fact </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that we've talked about it so many times </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on the podcast is this publicly known is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this widely available information yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you've like been a part of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> conversation i swear to god i don't know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> we're gonna have to like rewind every </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> clip where we've talked about hundreds </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> i've said it on i've said it on streams </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> multiple times i've never read or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> watched it i i can't be there for the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> whole three hours </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but yeah like again i know so much about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> hunter and i know i'm gonna like it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that's why i'm not in a rush to read it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> or watch it because i don't know okay i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like it yeah me and full metal outcomes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah it's like it's like of course it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> like we've just found joey's full </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> message it's like it's takashi </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> i know and again like i know it's going </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to be good because i love togashi yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's [ __ ] amazing i don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> don't read it watch the anime </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the animals the anime is better do you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> agree </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> uh </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah because i've heard both sides of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> the argument listen what's the other </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> side of the argument the other side is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> that the manga is good because togashi </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> is good </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i mean that's so it's so it's basically </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just like a preference in medium then </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> right pretty much yeah i mean yeah i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> mean i'm probably gonna watch and read </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> both to be honest it's it's just a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> matter of which one to do first yeah i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> mean hanzonz is just prime mad house and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> madhouse haven't been at the prime for </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> like a long time i think yeah and the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> manga also looks like napkin drawings a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> lot of the time not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> in the beginning and the volumes the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> volumes are fixed oh so they fix it yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> in the shonen jump volumes uh the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> magazines it looks like [ __ ] okay but </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> then he redraws it for the actual i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> finished the anime and then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> carried on reading and i was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> am i reading like one web comic right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> now like what what is this it was about </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> that uh drawing honestly it's yeah but i </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah wow yeah but then he takes the time </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> to actually redraw everything properly </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> for the actual book so the books look </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> like [ __ ] amazing sense but also kind </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of sad if you're a big hunter hunter fan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> who waits and then you have to go back </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and read it but yeah if you read it if </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> you read a week like you're probably </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah it's like a weekly </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> um so that's your favorite shonen jump </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> title of course well i mean here's the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> thing uh a lot of these are shortages </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah so i kind of realized that what's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> black cat doing show black cat slam dunk </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_03> villain he looks like the uh you know if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you watch very odd parents </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> crimson chin he looks like yeah you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> like have you watched very often the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> buff fairy right yeah he looks like the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> buff fairy from very high </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> looks like the buff fairy from from </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> fairly odd parents </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> oh my god </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> he has the muscles but like the weird </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> neck yeah yeah it's literally like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fairy art parents </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> he looks exactly like that oh my god </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> look but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> ruined one of the pictures of the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> villain villains </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> all right so like so have you ever seen </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> the anime of yuhaka show i have </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> not not a fan not a fan not a fan is it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> it's i don't know it's bittersweet right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because it's like the same thing with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> black cat where it's like i love the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> manga so much that like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it wasn't like the perfect adaptation </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> that i wanted like it was good but it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like i'd rather just reread them what </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> was it what was missing to make it the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> perfect adaptation </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> as someone who's like i haven't read the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> manga of you hakusho i've only seen the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> anime oh really yeah oh did you like the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> anime i [ __ ] love the anime well </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you'd [ __ ] love the manga even more </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> okay but like is there anything i can </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> get from the manga that i couldn't have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> already gotten from the anime or just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> re-watch the animation because i thought </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> the anime was like a really good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> adaptation especially for history like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> records of red rock </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> that's better than that that's solid </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> animation you know </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> i mean i don't know like i think this </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> might just be like the the whole thing </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> with like how manga art styles i feel </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> age better than animation in a lot of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> aspects yeah in my eyes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to differ you think so like demon slayer </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in the manga it just looks terrible </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> compared to the animal well i mean </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that's because like the animations </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> the character designs change differently </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right but like in the anime adaptation </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> of you hawk show they did a pretty good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> job of like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> re-adapting like uh togashi's art style </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i feel like i haven't read it from what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> i've just seen of it it looks one-to-one </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to me i don't know i'll just a glance </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> that's like a person who's i don't know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> i feel blanched it but i i sometimes </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> look at clips of the anime of you haksha </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and i'm like something about this hasn't </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> aged </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> chinese 90s yeah it's 90s like the 90s </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> animation is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> some of it hasn't aged very well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah i mean some some of it's like very </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> janky limited animation this is like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 90s anime yeah but like they still had </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> like when during the big fights there </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> are still like those sakuraga moments </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> absolutely like those have aged </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> wonderfully i mean i i honestly think at </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> this point it's just like a personal </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> preference like the same thing with slam </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> dunk right it's like slam dunk for me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> like i watch the anime as well like a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> [ __ ] banger of an anime but it's like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> i just personally prefer the manga to be </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> honest i actually have like huge </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> problems with that slam dunk anime i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> think that's age horrible i've heard </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that sounding amazing very good and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> that's because it might be a nostalgia </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> factor yeah it's probably his nostalgia </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> factor because i watched it in </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> university and i was just like man this </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> is a it's a really slow sports anime my </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] god they literally like take ten </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> episodes it's like it's like a hundred </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> times </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sports anime sorry sports shows uh sorry </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> support support properties in general </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh almost better in manga normally like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> i just just because of pacing yeah i i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> think that that's true like 10 years ago </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or 20 years ago now </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> um because like slam dunk i shield i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> would like recommend the mango </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> that's that's why for me like both slam </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> dunk and you yeah in my manga three by </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> three not my anime yeah yeah yeah like i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> much prefer the mangroves yeah because </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like i i feel like old sports anime they </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> had horrible pacing but like shows like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> haikyuu kuroko actually your mushy pedal </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i really am yeah yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like they i think i think within the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> past like new generation sports i mean </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they've really fixed their pacing issues </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to the point where if a match lasts more </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> than three episodes then it's like a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> super super important match like have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you seen haikyuu uh i've watched the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> first two seasons okay so season three </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> is like one single match it's like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah and when i saw that i was like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> here we [ __ ] go again another another </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like dragon ball z esque fight scene in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a in like in a sports anime but like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that match was so [ __ ] intense that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it needed 10 episodes and like it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> just what it was not stretched out at </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> all yeah at all and that was like to me </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like the highlight of haikyuu so far of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> the anime i enjoyed crocodile basket i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> thought the i enjoyed the posting on </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> that even if yeah because it was very </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> quite fast really yeah i think it was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> like actually good pacing because it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> like never more than three episodes yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> because how many times how like i can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> only be invested in one match for like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> so long you know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> there's only so much that can happen in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> a single match well i was really good at </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> building up the [ __ ] i think yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah you're like what do you mean you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> know they they weren't rushing too much </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> into like the powers yeah they were </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> pretty sparingly adding them in i felt </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> and then i i didn't watch the movie but </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> everything the movie was everything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> passed the main </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> run of the what is it three seasons two </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> seasons three seasons three yeah three </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> after the how many is that 50 episodes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> something like that i guess over 50 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> episodes yeah it's where they beat the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uh the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> does it end oh it doesn't matter but the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> point was that i found that after like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that that was like not really invested </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> anymore it's such a shame for me because </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like from the i didn't watch all of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> kuroko like but </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> from what i did see </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> i really enjoyed it but it sucks because </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> for me now slam dunk is just like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> forever just ruined basketball and i i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> wonder if i will read slam dunk and i'll </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> feel like i can't enjoy this croakers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> better or if i'll feel that like there's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> definitely been both cases so like i've </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> i've recommended slam dunk to people who </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> first read kuroko yeah and they were </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like ah it's not as good because they're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just used to the kuroko format because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like unlike kiroko slam dunk doesn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> have any like super powers it is like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just very bare bones raw it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> an nba jam versus nba 2k yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're pretty much pretty much yeah like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> it kind of like it kind of like takes </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> the fact that it is probably one of the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> most realistic adaptations of sports in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> manga yeah but it still makes it just as </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> exciting but it does it in the most like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> cinematic like [ __ ] type of way and i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> mean like you know in the case of slam </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> dunk like when that first came out of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> japan that it created a [ __ ] cultural </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> phenomenon well every time i have an old </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> taxi man here and he asked me if i like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> anime or whatever i'll be like yeah i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like anime and then he's like oh do you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like slam dunk they always ask me yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> they're in the like 40s plus they always </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> ask me if i like yeah it was like a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> cultural phenomenon here in japan wasn't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> it when it came out i think i think the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> year that it came out i think i read </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> something like uh of all like middle </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> schools and high schools in japan the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> attendance of basketball clubs raised by </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> six hundred percent well that's not a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> huge sport in japan as well yeah but it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wasn't but it got bigger </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah i mean it was that good i mean </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in my opinion </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> the final chapter of slam dunk is still </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> one of the most beautiful chapters in </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> all of manga yeah i mean </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> he had balls to just put zero dialogue </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah the entire last chapter has zero </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> dialogue yeah i'll get that one and it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> just stands and it is the most cinematic </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> final chapter of manga ever in my </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> opinion but i mean like yeah so i mean </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> obviously that's great um so black cat </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> all right so black cat for me </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> okay so you know how my character like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> my avatar on youtube </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah oh so that came from black guy from </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> black oh my god okay so yabba ki kentar </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> who's the guy who made black cat he has </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this thing in all of his manga so he </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> also illustrated to love her as well </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah um </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> i mean it is [ __ ] good but um he has </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> this like kind of easter egg thing in </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> all of his manga where in every chapter </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> of his manga he puts this like little </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> white cat in at least one panel of every </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> chapter of his vlogger just as like a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> little hidden easter egg and it's that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> cat face that i use as my mask so like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> originally like [ __ ] back way back </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> when on like new grounds and [ __ ] like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that that was just my logo oh and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then it adapted into my current </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> avatar but like i don't know black cat </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it's weird it's definitely heavy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> nostalgia factor but i think this was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the first time i ever read a manga and i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was like wow </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> like manga artists are [ __ ] talented </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> it was the first time where i was </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> actually wowed by a piece of artwork you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> want to explain what happens in it i i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> can try and explain but i honestly can't </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> remember anything it's been a while yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's been a while for me as well </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you want to try this </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> he's not a black cat no but that's like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> his code name yeah he's an assassin </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> right he's an assassin yeah he's number </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> 13. that's it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> and his name is train he has two guns </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> train heartness this is two guns oh is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that it yeah train hardness train hard </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> two guns two guns yeah he has two guns </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> two pistols yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> sven </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> i remember that this was the first </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because i just got into anime i'd say </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> anything i remember about it this is the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> first show that i was like yeah you know </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> what not every anime is above a seven </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> uh this is the first show that i was </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> like i'm gonna teach you a lesson as an </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> example to the other animals right five </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know what i mean like i gave it a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> lower score than i would have just to be </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> like yeah you know what i'm saying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> that's the proof of point i'll give out </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> first goals yeah sorry okay give it five </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because i didn't i i think i remember </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> watching like a few episodes of black </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> cat years ago and it was just me it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just that phase where you'd watch </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everything yeah yeah yeah yeah and then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i was like cool guy in the black coat he </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> looks kind of cool i watched a few </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> episodes and it was just like wow </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> so what happens extremely well so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> black cat is like he kind of uh so train </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> obviously he starts off as this like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> assassin but then he escapes from the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> organization that he's part of and he </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> basically the entire manga he gets </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> chased by the organization members come </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> back to the organization because he has </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like all the syrians or whatever yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and like there's a dude in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> organization or i think who also left </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the organization who is like he's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> basically like the quintessential male </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> yonder </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like it's really like i remember the the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> main bad guy is like i don't know i've </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> never really heard of like a male </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yandere antagonist before in a manga </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah especially in the show no matter i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> just realized out of context you kind of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> sound like you're describing john wick </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> or something it's like he left the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> organization and he isn't there he's an </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> assassin yeah this is just gold coins </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they killed his dog </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> he killed his black cat </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> [Music] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> but yeah basically and then like sven is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> the guy who like has like uh he's like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> an explosives expert and then eve is </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> this uh he's like this she's like this </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> test tube like experimental this is when </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> every single manga had to have like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> rag tag band of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh people who could yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> special things yeah and have comedy okay </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so why is this in your 3x3 i'm so cute </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> it's in my 3x3 because it was one of the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> first manga okay so when i was growing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> up reading manga i obviously started off </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> reading things like doraemon and like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> you know the quarter quarter comic </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> magazine which is more aimed towards </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> kids under the age of 10 years old right </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> then when i got to around 10 11 years </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> old i was like oh you know what throw </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> him on quarter quarter stuff </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's a bit too young for me i've got a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> big pp now i'm i'm a big i'm a big boy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> now i'm i'm about to enter middle school </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> right i want to read some some of this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> middle school </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> dance </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> so i was like you know i want to read </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this like shonen jump thing that i keep </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hearing all my japanese friends talking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> about yeah so at the time i borrowed one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> of my friends shonen jump magazines yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and i think that particular magazine </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> black cat was on the cover of it oh okay </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because black cat had like because like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> every month and every week on show and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> jump that happens </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah they change the cover you know some </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> chapters have like you know colored </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> pages and some of them are like have </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like center colors and stuff like that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and i think black cat had a front color </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> chapter </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and yeah again like you know you go from </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> darymon to this right like clearly this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is going to make you go whoa </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what the [ __ ] is that and so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah and i think like honestly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i really enjoyed it i mean yama kentaro </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i think still makes some [ __ ] godly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> character designs i mean you know the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> reason why tolava is so [ __ ] infamous </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is because like the character designs </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] cute like he knows how to draw </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really just aesthetic looking characters </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and like you know black cat i feel was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> definitely when he was still kind of in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> his like younger times where like he </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hadn't quite refined his art but near </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the end of black cat his art just got </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> better and better and better and better </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and like okay i don't know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's just like a it's nothing like deep </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> or anything or like profoundly in any </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> way it's just a really solid </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> um with like really just intricate nice </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> arts does it hold up today </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> you know what i haven't read it in quite </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> a while i did would you recommend it to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> someone to read now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> it's hard </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> it's really hard </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> because like i don't know because i'm </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> obviously looking at this shirt because </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> this show is very </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> nostalgic it's very nostalgic i'm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> obviously looking at this with like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> roasting glasses yeah yeah yeah so like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't know maybe if you're a fan of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> like yellow cantor stuff like if you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> liked you know what you saw in tolava </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> okay and one like that with action does </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it is the story does it kind of wrap up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> does that have a good conclusion yeah it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> does actually it has a really nice </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> conclusion and like the the final fight </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> with like the the male yandere </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> antagonist who's a really [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> interesting character and the powers in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> everything like super cool yeah um yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i don't know it's again it's just like a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> really solid shonen jump manga that's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like very inoffensive i feel like i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> think this is the start of the time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where i start to realize anime </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> anime sometimes just don't have endings </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> well because i started off with death </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> note code yeah alchemist i'm like sick </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> these are great </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you you spoiled yourself you literally </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> spoiled all of anime for yourself oh no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i did not had a great time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because what i mean is that no no other </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> anime that just is a normal anime he's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just going to live up to those standards </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah exactly yeah so then i started </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> watching shows i'm like wait </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> why didn't this end where's the ending </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and this one this is when this is how </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> you know everyone else had the same </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> desperation as me because you whenever </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> you type in the show the first autofill </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> is when is season three coming out of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> this show literally there are no plans </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> for season three of this show literally </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> when you get like when you type in no </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> game no life </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> because everyone's like wait why would </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that not be a season two this is a </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> popular show right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> there's season two coming right right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right never happened yeah and then this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is when i started to realize i'm like oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they're just not going to finish shows </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> they're just going to like release shows </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> they're just going to be like we </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> released it we're not going to finish it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] you guys i'm sorry sometimes i wish </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> anime was produced by americans because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know that it would [ __ ] end it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> might not be good but you know it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> coming out that's why i feel like manga </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> takes more of the same form as like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> american tv shows because some markets </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just go on for [ __ ] ever and like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you're just like you know i'm not i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> don't know if i'm even invested to see </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> this end anymore right like this then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> anime will make like a billion dollars </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and they're like no i don't think we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> need another no there's no more </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> sometimes sometimes an anime makes like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> a billion dollars but then it's like one </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> hundredth of the entire story and you're </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> just like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> how like how they ever gonna adapt the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> entire story it's gonna take like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> [ __ ] 10 decades to do this </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and so you know there are some stories </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> where i'm just like i i just i know i'm </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> never going to see the end of the anime </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> and even like manga form </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like i'm still waiting like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hippo like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how long is ippo going to go on for sure </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right like jesus yeah obaki right like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> you should go on favorites yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> i should go on forever but speaking of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> bucky obviously bucky's the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> sense his daughter yeah b stars [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> amazing that's that's like the newest </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> one that's on that's probably the newest </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> one like i after i finished reading b </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> stars i was like oh that is so close to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> a modern masterpiece how come uh in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> terms of manga i come back here isn't on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> here </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> bucky i don't know </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like for me bucky is one of those shows </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> where it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's good don't get me wrong it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] amazing and it's so unique yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i feel that it's like there are some </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> parts where it's just like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> it's just a blur when you read it you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> know what i mean or it's like it's so </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> long and there's so much [ __ ] that </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> happens in it that is just so insane and </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> ridiculous that you you think of one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fight scene and it blends in with about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 10 other fighters that's just true it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> true right like part two for example </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> right with the whole tournament yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like i'm just like i can only remember </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe like one or two fights i re-write </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at the other side there's like 20 fights </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> in the manga yeah in the enemy then you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> showed like four yeah right well that's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> pretty because most of them were kind of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> underwhelming yeah true true a lot of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the fight even in the anime there was </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> only then you should like six and i was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> like ah three like with bucky you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> remember the most like notable like meme </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> were the ridiculous type of scenes right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> whereas with uh b stars for example it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just as like one cohesive story it was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> just a really [ __ ] unique yeah really </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> done well and it's just yeah has it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> concluded yep it ended when did it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> finish it could have been too long about </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> a year ago so how many seasons of the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> anime do you think there </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> should be if we were to adapt everything </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> to adapt everything yeah so </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> we're at season two right now which is i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> should probably shouldn't say </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> where we're up to in season two but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> that's probably about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> volume </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> seven or eight how many volumes are </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> there over twenty </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> so what does that wasn't season three </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> announced already i think so yeah i'm </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> sure i'm sure netflix wants to keep that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that coming and yeah i am very happy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> with that and it gets different and it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> gets more and more interesting after </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> that because i'm hoping we finally get a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] anime that finishes in anime </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> form we never [ __ ] get it anymore </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> we're getting it like the latest one i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> can think of that we're getting is is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> attack on titan and that's only like one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of the most successful animators </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that's the whole [ __ ] world watching </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it for them to be like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> maybe we could just finish this one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like it's like the streets are like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> start new anime yeah finish old one and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> stop finish this one finish because it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> just like if an anime gets over three </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> seasons like because even even if we get </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> a season two that's just like that's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> just like getting the table scraps right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're like oh my god i can't believe </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> i've got a season two </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> [Music] </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> like playing mashup </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh [ __ ] off [ __ ] off is this doing well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you cannot tell me this this deserves a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> second season no game no life doesn't </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> [ __ ] right yeah </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> but uh yeah so b stars so you think it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like up there's one in classic now </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> because i i i think so the ending wasn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> exactly like amazing amazing like it was </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> just a solid ending if we get the full </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> anime adaptation of the manga in the way </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> that it's going right now it would be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> considered a masterpiece </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> man i personally would see it as like uh </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> easy like nine out of ten at least i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> mean i mean i i can i can see that like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> if if the anime keeps up the quality of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the story because i love season one but </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it felt like season one just felt like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> it's kind of a setup season it's like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the the ending of b stars is very much </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like the ending of part six where it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like the people who love it love it but </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the people who didn't like it were like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you know </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i mean it's like a lot of people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> say that it's like kind of an </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> anti-climactic ending but i thought it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was kind of fitting to how the entire </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> story went because like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the final part of beast does there's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like this big fight that happens </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> obviously of course but and and then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from that big fight it kind of suddenly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> winds down into just like regular stuff </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay and like to a lot of people that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> was seen as anticipation i like that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> though i like a little breathing time to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> say goodbye yeah right i mean i like to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> all right guys just kind of read a few </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> more chapters with you guys before you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> guys [ __ ] off forever yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> what gets me sometimes is i know like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the there's always the hype around the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> last chapter right because the last </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> chapter you saying goodbye to everything </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you know this is this is where this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is and people like try to put a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> conclusion in the last chapter whereas </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> some of like my favorite manga is when </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that last chapter is just the climax is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> over it's done it's purely just an </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> epilogue and i feel like epilogues are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so [ __ ] underrated in so many anime </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and manga because most of the time it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just like you get to the final episode </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right and half of this episode is the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> climax so you've got like 10 minutes to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> say goodbye to all these characters </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> give me a follow-up yeah give me a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> friend i hate the epilogues that are </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> there's like like seven minutes left of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the episode it's like yeah are they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> gonna are they gonna stick the landing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> and then you know that it's a rushed </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> epilogue when they start talking and the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> ending song plays yeah no no no and it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> not even it's not even an epilogue it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> just like a slideshow of just like here </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> here are the characters now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh here they go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> um and then we have ichigo 100 which </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> again for me is like another i wouldn't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> even it's weird what's this about i've </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> i've i've </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> explained this okay so ego 100 is just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> this really just super simple </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> rom-com okay essentially like you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how shonen jump every time right they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> they replace harem wrong comms right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like once one harry roncon ends another </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> one takes its place okay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> issue 100 </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> 100 was the one that well first of all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like it was like right at its prime when </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i started reading shawn and jump so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> again big nostalgia fact i'm gonna </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> completely admit that but second of all </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> to me it is like the one manga series </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> where there was no one clear winner like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> right up until the end it was like all </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> the girls are so liked through and </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> through like people think quintessential </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> quintuplets is like the ultimate like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> any one of these girls could win type of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thing it's like yeah no no it's not each </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> girl 100 is because you start off with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> liking one girl </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as you do with any harem wrong comrade </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of course but but but if you are saying </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't know how the [ __ ] cost the music </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you did it but she did it in a way where </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> by the end of it any one of them could </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> win </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but you don't know who like right up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> until the end and it's just so simple </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> but so well done and again like i like i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> really like college numbers giza style </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> because again very different it almost </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> super 90s oh yeah i mean because it is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> very well </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> they all look like the chobits robots </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> oh yeah they do they yeah they look like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> the same era it looks like the exact </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> same character design as well they look </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> like they're like all robots </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> and it's weird </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> to fall in love with you boo beep beep </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> beep beep beep beep beep right because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like to me it's not even the best </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> rom-com manga oh okay it might be i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> think so is this a harem rom-com how </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> wrong well we all know that joey loves a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> good one i like that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i love a good harem roll don't get me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> wrong in my opinion the best rom-com </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> manga ever written his eyes which is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> also from shonen john which came before </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> this one so like this one basically </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> replaced eyes i've heard if i got an </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> anime adaptation didn't that in like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> early 2000s yeah i was like it was like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> a very [ __ ] adaptation </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> it wasn't it wasn't very it was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> forgettable that's all i know </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but um yeah it's it's done by the same </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> guy who made a zit man </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh okay okay i'm like all of those he's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> done a lot of manga um but yeah i don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> know again this was one of those shows </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that i think this show is the reason why </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> i love harem wrong </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> okay so do you read did you watch the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> anime adaptation of this at all it's an </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> anime yeah there is there's an anime </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> adaptation it's not good oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> basically everyone every like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> basically most of the shows on here have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like very mediocre anime adaptations </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> like aside from these stories </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but that's true </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah probably you yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> but uh yeah um and then we have uzumaki </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of course honestly anything from junjito </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> could have been in here again he's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> probably the reason why i love horror i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> mean i i do think uzumaki is like kind </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of like in terms of like a long form i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> think he is his magnum opus i think so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> some of my favorite works of ginger yuto </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> isn't using but just his one shots </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> actually yeah i feel like uzumaki is his </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> like only long-form work that i think is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> like the best yeah and again like that's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that's why i i feel like i could have </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> put anything in there like i also </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] loved tomie which was his first </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> one that he made which is also </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> brilliantly horrifying like if you love </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> like your kind of bondi body dysmorphia </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> macabre horror type of thing i do really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> want to read gingy too at some point </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah yeah it's part of the mo it's again </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> it's a trip it's on the infinite list of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> i need to get right now it's just like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> with jinji ito you don't even need to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like be that invested in it because i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> like i think the best entry point for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> june to you so it's just to read some of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> his one shots because like i feel like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like one there's only like a few genres </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that really work well with one shots and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> horror is some of them because all he </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> has to do is like he hits you with this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like really weird [ __ ] idea and then </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> he just ends </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah it's like he he definitely like has </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> taken a lot of inspiration from like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> classic asian horror in the sense that </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the stories don't necessarily make sense </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but at the end of it you're somehow </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> still invested and still terrified yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's purely that he purely just assaults </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you yeah with all of these senses of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> just super disturbing [ __ ] </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and then kind of just like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that's the end </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> how do you feel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how do you feel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how do you feel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> why are you here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah so obviously i i think it's no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> secret that i love you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah um and then i guess we'll just talk </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> about the center one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's a reason why i put it in the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> center because i still think to this day </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's one of the greatest manga series </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> ever made it's the one manga series that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i know like i'm i'm building myself up </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah it's like it's like i've watched </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> the last season of bojack horseman it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not because i don't want to yeah i just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm just kind of not in the mindset </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> where i want to be depressed i mean you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> know with your three by three right you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> were talking about like the one that you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> enjoyed the most and the one you think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is the best is different yeah yeah this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> is definitely that the one that you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> think i did not enjoy </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> at all yeah like you don't enjoy it but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> you just can't stop yeah yeah but it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> one of those i i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> know this even though i've never read it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's one of those </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> series or stories from why i understand </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that it's just it hits you and it sticks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> with you and it's like you you read it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> once and it's just a part of you i just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> got like [ __ ] to do you know like i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gonna be sad for like a while yeah right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah i gotta deal with it i remember i i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> binged this manga for the first time and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i i finished reading it at like four am </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah and i just kind of the moment i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> finished it i just kind of closed it and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> just sat on my couch i know exactly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> let's say after every bojack episode </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah and then they're like then they're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> automatically playing the next one like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> no no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> give me some time </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but i think i think the one thing that i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> really like about oyster pumpkin is the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> fact that it almost like it almost goes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> beyond manga like what iniosano did an </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oyster punch is so like we were talking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about metaphors before right with uh you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> know i shall 21 stuff like that yeah the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> metaphors in oyasumi poonpin are insane </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> because </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> literally like what kind of mangaka has </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> the balls to turn their main character </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> into a metaphor i think it's genius i </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> think it's absolutely genuine so to </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> explain oyster punch for those who don't </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> know </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> this is the main character his name is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> pumping </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> um he's a bird character but and every </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> other character in the manga is a human </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah but all the human characters see </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> poonpoon as a human it's okay so it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like how he sees himself </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> it's how he sees himself but it's also </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> how you as the reader see him </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> as well so like throughout the manga as </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> he's got so basically it's this manga </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> where it follows this life of </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> growing up so he starts off as a kid and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he turns into a teenager </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't like the sound of this yeah i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't like it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [Music] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i know it's gonna be [ __ ] and it kind </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> of very slowly yet steadily it goes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> through every inch of his life </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's a lot of things that happen to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> him and around him that are very [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah that's how it looks yeah yeah so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like you know it starts off with him as </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> a kid he meets this girl </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know learns what falling in love is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right learns the the the joys and the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> heartbreak of puberty and then i feel </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> you man and then that drags on with him </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> and then he has family problems he has </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> problems with his friends he has </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> problems with basically just a broken </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> life you know it's a broken life </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> and what's so brilliant about oyster </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> punton is that as obviously you know </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like when he like gets older he's he </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> gets bigger and taller but still the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> bird </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> but then there are certain points in the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> manga where his look completely changes </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> so there's one part in the manga where </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> he just turns into a floating pyramid </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> for about two chapters oh okay and it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> not really explained why </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> it happens but as you're reading </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> metaphor context yeah it represents </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> something in here okay and it's very and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's very literal in that sense </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> how long is it how many chapters i have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> seven volumes i own it's all of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> i've owned all of them for years it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> been city it's 12 volumes i think okay </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> well hundred and twenty kilometers like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] okay so i own seven of them </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> well no i believe at least the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> translated volume yeah the western </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> volumes are a lot thicker yeah yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> they're a lot thicker so i have iron </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> there's 13 volumes in japan is it but </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like 120 something chapters oh so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you could probably read it in one day </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> you could easily written i mean i read </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> it in one day like it's it's been </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> sitting on my shelf i think for years </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's just been staring me and i'm like i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> stare at it and i'm just like today the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> day it's today it's tuesday did i read </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> it no just the thought about reading i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> unhappy </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> basically yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> my very first experience with hearing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about yasmine pinpoon was actually like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when i first started dating sydney and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so i um this was when i back when i </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_00> those people that you know gets truly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gets invested and involved into a piece </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> of fiction </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> um so i'm just here sitting and sitting </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> in my room sitting in my office doing </SPEAKER_08>

<SPEAKER_02> at the end of poon poon but yeah there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> were definitely moments throughout pune </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> that </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> i kind of just opened my eyes wide and i </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> was like holy [ __ ] like there were many </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> times where i actually said to myself </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> out loud i was like no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're not like this no it's not like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's like and again it's like it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the way that he can somehow </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> fit this [ __ ] bird character into a </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> super realistic context of like very </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> realistic setting with very realistic </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> characters yeah and give this bird this </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> the most human life possible is so </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> insane to me and the fact that he can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just do it seamlessly like you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> obviously at first if you're going into </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this blind yeah first couple of pages </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> you're like what the [ __ ] is this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what what the [ __ ] is this bird yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but you kind of like learn to grow with </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it and again like you know it's it's one </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> of those things where like a lot of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people say like oh he turned it into a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bird so that you yourself can put </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yourself into pinpoint situations </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah so that if you're not fixated on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> one particular type of person you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when concerning looks and stuff like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that like you can just imagine this is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> any human </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it's just yeah and again it's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> ini osano literally just took all these </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> rudimentary concepts about manga and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just went through out the window and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just went i'm just gonna draw what i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> think is cool </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> and it's like there's lots of like weird </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> [ __ ] in it as well but like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> i mean i've been trying to write a video </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> about this manga for so long but </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> literally every time i reread it first </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> of all i get destroyed for about a week </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> so i try not to do it but second of all </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> there's just so many subtle things in it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> that i keep picking up on that i didn't </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> before that just completely makes me </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> change the way i view this manga and </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> it's just yeah it's insane </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> so like again probably the manga i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> enjoyed the least yeah yeah but </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> definitely one of the best yeah in my </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> mind </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that's what i assumed it was going to be </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> which is just like i'm not reading this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> manga to enjoy it i'm reading this manga </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> because i know it's probably going to be </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> one of the most </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like powerful pieces of media i've ever </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> consumed yeah and that's that's like my </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> assumption going into it and the final </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> chapter made me cry like [ __ ] crazy i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was like [ __ ] man </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's brutal but yeah um i don't know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> what else i can talk about yeah i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> realized that you know even though i've </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> read a lot of manga you know what at the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> end of the day </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> shonen jumps just kind of the king to be </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> honest i mean it's it's kind of the king </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> for i mean it's how </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah yeah i mean shonen jump just has a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> formula and i don't know what that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> formula is but they just keep it works </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> they just keep pumping out bangers not </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just bangers like everything they pump </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> out just seems to be like a global </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> sensation and even if it's not it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> going to have some kind of cult </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> following behind it it's just kind of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the ones that i remember the most for </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> some reason like like [ __ ] now like i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> remember when the big three ended or </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like you know naruto not the big three </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but the ear of the big three were naruto </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> bleach in one piece one piece is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> obviously still going on but everyone's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just like what's going to replace it how </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> can anything replace naruto and bleach </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's those were like global sensations </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then my hero came out and was just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hold my hold my beard and then demon </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> slayer came out and i was just like hold </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my sword </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then like [ __ ] now jiu jitsu </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> kaisen and now like chainsaw man's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> coming out which is going to be a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> massive [ __ ] in here like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> where do they miss when that like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> are they [ __ ] aimbotting like what's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> their secret like what the [ __ ] is going </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> no legit and it's like you know again </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> it's like you know you you kind of get </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> in that period of your your manga </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> reading life where you're just like you </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> know what </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> maybe maybe it's time to graduate from </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> the show now yeah you know it's it's </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like it's kind of formulaic i want to </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> try something new so you go out read </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> some of the the more obscure scene in </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> manga or like the shoujo or the you know </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> the jose manga or you know some like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> weird gore or edgy type of [ __ ] and it's </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like there's lots of good ones don't get </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> me wrong but at the end of the day </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> you're always going to go back to sean </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and jump yeah i don't know what it is </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> i remember i i said i said that opinion </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> on twitter and i got a lot of [ __ ] for </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_06> odds </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> okay so so before before we get into it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> there are some that i feel like i would </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> put in there if there wasn't already </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like an amazing anime adaptation of it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> right i really want to put vinland saga </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> on there for some for for example but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> i'm just like well i've also really </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> really enjoyed the anime um so you want </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to go through them okay so from </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> uh going down from uh oh great teacher </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> onizuka kingdom </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the breaker </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 20th century boys domestic girlfriend </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> love hina </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> berserk </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> beck and siren siren really yeah i was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> not expecting cyrus what is is breaker </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is it the korean one that's the man </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> that's the man yeah yeah to me like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> break it out i'll start off a breaker </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because that's the only one on there </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that is actually not actually a manga </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but a manual um i feel like breaker is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that one it's it takes it's basically </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> everything i wanted from a shown in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> anime that you could not get from shonen </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> jump because it's it takes the kind of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the shonen </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> shonen jump like battle battle manga </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> formula and adds martial arts to it and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's it's so rare to see something uh to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> see a manga that just does martial arts </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> well and i've kind of realized if if i'm </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> looking for martial arts because you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> know if if you watch the uh </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> film three by threes you'd know that i'm </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> a huge [ __ ] fan of kung fu movies and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> stuff like that right and it's just so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> hard to find that same vibe in the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> martial arts i mean you know god of high </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> school as well yeah yeah so you got like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> god of high school </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> they don't really care about kung fu in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> japan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah exactly in a sense yeah almost but </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like veritas is like the perfect balance </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> between martial arts and superpowers </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because people are like still very human </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in here and you know you can still take </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> someone out with a gun but they have </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> enough power that they're kind of also </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> superhuman as well right so it's it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kind of balanced in that way and like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like it's it's got like a very you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know it's got a very standard story it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this guy who has zero martial arts </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> powers and zero key as you know that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which is the power system here um and he </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> meets he just meets this guy who you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> know he's beating up some street thugs </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and turns out he's just like a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know martial arts master or whatever </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right and so to help teach this guy or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to help this guy basically </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> protect himself and not be bullied and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all that um he gives him like this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> medicine which you know is technically </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> he he gave it to him by accident </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> and uh ends up this guy is just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> obviously a secret genius in martial </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> arts and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> kind of like takes on the entire martial </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> arts as well enhancing drugs of course </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> always say yes of course </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> what if we could use 100 percent </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> but like it's it's like it's cooler but </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like in terms of like formula yeah it's </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> a very very standard formula but one </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> okay like the art is [ __ ] fantastic </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the cover looks amazing yeah it's so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like so much more detailed than you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> see in a lot of just standard shonen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> jump manga right and what blows my mind </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> is that this was like a weekly release </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> but the art quality is that of like a </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> monthly release manga you know what i </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> mean like one punch man for example is a </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> monthly release right so you you can see </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> why you know it took the time to be to </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> make to make it a monthly manga this was </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> released weekly and it's not as good as </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> one punch man in terms of high quality </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's like way better than pretty </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> much most standard shonen jump weekly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> manga damn and it's like the action </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> choreography and the action art is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] insane and it's just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just like pure fun it's just pure </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if you know what you're getting this guy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is like a weak link okay but the amount </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of times that he [ __ ] he [ __ ] does </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> something badass unexpectedly is just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like it's just insane and it keeps like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> the stakes keep rising and rising and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what i love as well is they really build </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> up i really love the board building of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just like the secret organization that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of like martial artists who like kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> rule the world you know it's it's like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> in real life yeah yeah like in real life </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> it's got like it's got like the same </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> kind of like vibe as john the john wick </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> world if you know what i mean i'm down </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for that i love john obviously obviously </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the main protagonist isn't john wick </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he's it's someone who grows into someone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who's going to be that skilled in that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> world </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but it's kind of got that same vibe in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> world building and it's just i [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> love it and not enough people talk about </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> the breaker i've definitely heard of the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> title because it's just one of those </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> shows you hear when </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> some someone says oh you know [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> amazing manual right like us what was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> the other solo leveling right </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> that like i hear a lot of and then i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> really need to read i mean solo leveling </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_02> it's it's it's good but it's i don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> know why so loving works so well it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's basically just an easter car in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> disguise but for some reason um it's it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> feels i think it's mostly carried by the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> arts right the arts just [ __ ] amazing </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> mama art is like next level i don't know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> how they do it so consider literally </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> every manual i've read has just been </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like oh my god yeah i i really don't </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> know how they do it so [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> consistently yeah it's insane um </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> and then yeah what what else do we want </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to talk kingdom uh i haven't read </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> kingdom i've been i'd rather bring it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> i've read the first five volumes of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> kingdom because i read it long right uh </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] god this has 500 chapters it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was like one of those manga when i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just like i'm so glad that there is just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> like an infinite number of chapters </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> it's not that i dread it's that i dread </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that i literally can't do anything else </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like i can't watch anything i can't read </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> anything else because i love that i'm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like that's that's the feeling i'm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> constantly looking for because i love </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> the feeling of just being so absorbed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> into this manga or anime or something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that i literally can't get on with my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> life unless i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> unless i'm finishing this thing because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like that that to me is like pure </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> enjoyment right and kingdom gave me that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> for like a good like month i i only i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> only had time just a month </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> i lost the month of my life i think and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it was like the best month ever i only </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> read like the first five volumes of it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> because i was like at a manga cafe just </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> like chilling waiting for a friend or </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> whatever and i had to leave i was like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> no i'm not leaving yeah i need i need to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> continue reading this is [ __ ] insane </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah so so like so like to give the to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> give a brief like sell yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um so it's like when china was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> fragmented into different different </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> kingdoms </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you see </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you see what they did there three </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> kingdoms yeah um no it was uh i think </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> this one has seven kingdoms right and so </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's the story of it's just it's just an </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> epic basically it's it's the very </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> definition of an epic where it's just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the story of uh so one one like there </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> was there's one farm boy shin who's the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> main character and by complete chance he </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> meets um he meets one of the future </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> kings of the kingdom that he's living in </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> right </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and throughout the entire history of </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> china no one's been able to unite all of </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> the kingdoms no one's been able to like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> take over everything and just unite </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> everyone and so it's very simple it's </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> just the basic story of the king growing </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> up to be a king and uniting everyone and </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> it's the farmer who the farm boy who </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> grows up literally as a peasant and um </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> it's his story of becoming the greatest </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> general uh of china it's basically if </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> you took the golden age arc of berserk </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> and just made it in epic yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that sounds good yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> which is awesome because golden asia was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] awesome i love the golden age </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah like imagine the golden age arc but </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> um </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the biggest to me the biggest selling </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> point of kingdom is the battles so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this man's drawing over here </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> he can't contain his love for kingdom he </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> went down he's choking up thinking about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah i just want to talk about kingdom </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> okay </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so i have never seen any </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> other piece of media </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> depict warfare in as much detail as i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> have kingdom right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because there's only like there's it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> been 500 chapters and one single battle </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> can easily take up like 50 to 100 </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> chapters </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah it's like lord of the rings </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah i mean it's battle for helms deep </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> here yeah yeah yeah yeah literally like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> imagine every battle imagine if that was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> just every battle right but it's [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> ins it's actually [ __ ] insane go for </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> it are we close to finishing the story </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> no we're about halfway oh [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that puts me off because i i don't want </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to get into something where i'm going to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> be like 50 years old and i'm like hey </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> son uh my favorite manga is finishing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> kingdom literally every one piece fan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> but like but it's it's it's one of those </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> manga where it's it's such a simple kind </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> of it's it well it's it's simple and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's not right because obviously there's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot of there's a lot of like politics </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> involved there's a lot of like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> intricacies into how they basically take </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> try to take over their kingdom because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's i really can't condense it down </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> into like whenever i'm getting it's an </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> epic yeah it is an epic </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> but like it's because it's broken up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> into like different arcs you can just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> read one arc and you just you can just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like stop it it's kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can take a breather like i literally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> binged one arc then binged another arc </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then binge another because i'm just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like i just want to see what happens at </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the end of this battle and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's it depicts what like i said it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> depicts warfare in a better way than </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i've ever seen in any other market </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because like you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know how they like try to write </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> smart characters in a lot of fiction </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> whereas you to to write a smart </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> character you have to make the other </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> character dumb right so there's been so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> many like there's been so many like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> warfare kind of scenes where it's just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like they they introduce this like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> really smart general or something and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's because he sees a strategy that the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> other general doesn't see and it's like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to the reader it's the most obvious </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] strategy of all time we're gonna </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> go around the back yeah holy [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> they'll never know if they flank them to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> the right yeah exactly and and with </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> kingdom the reason it takes like about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> like 50 to 100 chapters per battle is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because it's they're pretty 5d chess </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> they are like it's it's it's so </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> incredible to see so many styles of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> generals battling against each other </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because it's it is literally like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> watching two gm's play against each </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> other and no it i i'm absolutely serious </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because like you're you're turning the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> page and you're like both both sides are </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> making moves both sides are like taking </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> pieces they're taking rooks they're </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> taking bishops it is kind of like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> watching a chess game except it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because it's a battle it's not just it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> not just all about strategy sometimes </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> you have people who [ __ ] flip the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> board and there's and then there's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> nothing you can do about that just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because they're too powerful and there </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> are some people who knows that this guy </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is someone who is going to flip the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> board and he takes that into account and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the winner of the battle isn't the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> person </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is isn't the person who's like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> necessarily dumber it's just the person </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> who maybe thinks that extra half step </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> ahead and you really don't know until </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you turn like the final few pages of an </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> arc how it's going to turn out the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> author must have like [ __ ] binge read </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> like the art of war like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> honestly because like honestly i've only </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> heard like the most insane i'd like to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> let this be like the other like those </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> reviews yeah yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> five stars yeah like my work </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> without spoil without spawning it's like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> some of the best moments of this manga </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like i think with this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> this uh this manga has an arc which is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> one of my favorite arcs of like all of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> manga and that's that's because it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like it's an arc without spawning the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> exact plot points it's an arc where you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> have like [ __ ] five six generals all </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of them have like are making [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> playing 5d chess with each other making </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> moves against each other and you're just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like holy [ __ ] i can't even keep up with </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the amount of strategies going on and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the different pieces like that that are </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> being pushed around it's absolutely </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] insane it's so big brain that i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> really cannot explain </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> again ever since i read those five </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> volumes of kingdom i've been this close </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to just been saying [ __ ] and just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> buying the rest of the volume is it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> published weekly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay that's good that's good it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> published but there's no way they're </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> gonna get to five dollars i've just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> given up the hope on manga where they're </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like okay now we're publishing monthly </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> all right and i'm never gonna read it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because it's never going to finish yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> if you want to see like the brain </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> expands me more of just like of just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> reading something that is just like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> super smart without making making it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like seem pretentious or something yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> and the artist </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i think someone asked i don't know who </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was when george are mine this question </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is like if you're not smart how do you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> write smart characters </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> if you're not smart yourself how do you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> write a smart camera yeah yeah like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> legit i just i still i remember they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> answered something but even me i was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> thinking about i i don't know how you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> would how would you because you wouldn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> know what smart is because yeah yeah so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah it's like i think this is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> this one because this is what smart </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> people are like yeah it's like how do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you ask your smartphone how do you write </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> a smart character who's like 300 iq when </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're not 300 iq yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what i would </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what i would uh guess is that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they are uh the author of this must have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> just studied so many like history </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> historic battles because some of like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the taxes and strategies that can they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> come up with this it's just like it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> 300 iq versus 302 iq and it's just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just like that extra two iq that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> gives them the edge in battle it's porn </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> that matters yeah yeah yeah yeah exactly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it's uh it's it's such a good absolutely </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> if you want something that is just an </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> incredible epic read kingdom okay uh </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_06> it's like cause like because like you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> okay have you seen the anime i've seen </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_07> what the anime yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> it was like late 80s right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it came out in the year 2000. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i'm not joking are you serious i am </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> still a trap question i felt the track </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> set up when you asked that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> well it feels like late 80s it feels </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> like late like early 90s it feels like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> late alien late 80s early 90s anime </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> adaptations yeah it came out in the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 2000s it came out after cowboy bebop </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> but because </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but because like because the anime are </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> the same </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> crisis on the gto today </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> so i mean i think i've talked about gta </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> briefly before but to uh to give to give </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> a brief synopsis of gto it's about it's </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> about this teacher who is delinquent oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> he great oh he great oh he's a great </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> team he's no no no no he's not a great </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> teacher yet because he's just he's he's </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> he's uh so his name is onizuka and he's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> delinquent who finds himself in a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> teaching job right and let me guess let </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> me guess he's just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he's he's not a good teacher in the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> start but he he learns to love the kids </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and he wants to help the kids so he </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> becomes a good teacher no actually he he </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> wants to be the greatest teacher in all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of japan hence the name great teacher </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but uh what he he's given like a very </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> problematic class right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and uh yeah he's he's not like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> greatest teacher academically and that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> part of like that's like part of the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> point of this manga is that he doesn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> teach academic lessons he teaches life </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> lessons and i know </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> i know i know i reach these kids he's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> not he ain't book smart he's streets </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> but like how you wear a bag kids make </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> you sort it correctly yeah but like if </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but like it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's a manga that i think really </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> affected me when i read this as like a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> teenager because </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> you know it it sounds it it is like a </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> completely cheesy kind of um setup right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> because you know it's just oh this it's </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> a teacher who reforms a problematic </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> classroom and teaches them life lessons </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> it makes them appreciate life and stuff </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and yeah that's that's exactly it's it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> a it's probably </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the best feel-good manga i've ever read </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> japan loves those kinds of manga they're </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> like yeah there's another manga like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that called rookies i don't know if you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> know that one i don't it's like if you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> took gto but you made them play baseball </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and but it's like it's the exact same </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> like feel good vibe you have the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> delinquent teacher who like teaches a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> bunch of delinquents to like join a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> baseball team and stuff like that yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> exact same feel as gto is like just as </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> good it's just it's just really it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's also a comedy one and i i do like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the comedy but like what i really love </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is that you know it it it's not it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> doesn't teach you so much cheesy life </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> lessons right it's so much just just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> teaches you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you especially growing up in asian </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> culture it tries to teach you that you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> know grades and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like this the school system isn't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what defines you as a person and i feel </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like a lot of people might need to like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> hear some of the things that this manga </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> especially </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> especially in japan and especially in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> asian culture and kind of the cherry on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> top is just how [ __ ] goofy and at the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> same time badass onizuka is um i [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> seeing the antics he seeing the antics </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they put him through is just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everything is such a treat like what my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> one of my favorite one of my favorite uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> scenes in the manga which never got </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> adapted to the anime was like he was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> trying to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he was trying to teach just like this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like leader of like this uh gang to like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> try try to attend school and take it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] seriously and all that [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this guy this this student leads him to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like this underground like fight ring or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> something i can't remember the exact </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> setup but he's just like look </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if i arm wrestle a hundred of you and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> win </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> then you gotta come to school and it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just like this is this is so this is so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] stupid right because it's just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like how are you going to [ __ ] arrest </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> arm wrestle 100 people and then he he </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> beats one person he beats two persons he </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> he starts he starts taking on three at a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> time and like he's three out of ten yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah he starts taking on three times </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's the shonen mark okay yeah and it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just like it's the way the way that it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> just kind of builds up and like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> escalates is like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> hilarious and badass at the same time </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and it's it's something where it's not </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> 100 serious but when it hits it [ __ ] </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> hits and some like it's a manga that can </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> really </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> i wouldn't say change a person but it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> if if you're looking for something that </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> affects you in the opposite way of pun </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> pun where it's just like wow it uses </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> comedy to teach you not depression yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> it still teaches you like very important </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> life lessons but it it you feel </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> wholesome i feel like i don't want that </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like genre of manga is so like beloved </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and known and quite you know more common </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> especially to a japanese audience i feel </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> it's slept on in the west </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> probably like there are so many like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> good like feel good comedy centered like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> lesson type of manga that is out there </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> and they're all [ __ ] great yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because i feel like to do this type of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> manga or to do this type of story it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so hard to just not be cheesy yeah you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> know like and i feel like gto is that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> one manga when i'm just like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> like you you see this done in any other </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> way and it would just be cheesy but the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> way that they do in this just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it almost doesn't take itself seriously </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah exactly yeah exactly </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> um so yeah onizuka is like i think one </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of my favorite characters in manga </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> for that reason </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> uh what do you want to go on next can we </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> talk about siren </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> okay why is siren what is siren what the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] is that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> it's shown i'm surprised you've heard of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> siren i [ __ ] love cyrus you love </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sauron oh my [ __ ] god that's why </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that's why i was like why is this here </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's one of those like it's one of those </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who's explaining the place underground </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> shonen jump manga that like it didn't </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> have very long run time did it um it had </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> like a good 100 chapters did it it got </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> cancelled that's right yeah it did yeah </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> i will tell you the plot okay so um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's going to be like a slight </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> spoiler but i feel like it's within the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> first four chapters and i feel like it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> it's it's a big twist that i feel um is </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> what got me hooked into this manga right </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> so </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> um so it's that's the main i can't i </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> can't actually remember the character </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> names because it's been so long since </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> i've read it but it's this main </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> character and </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> uh he </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> i don't think there's anything too </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> special about him at the beginning he </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> runs a service where he solves he solves </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> problems right that's got nothing to do </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> with what happens right and so he sees </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> this girl </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> um it looks like she she uh she looks </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like she's going through some issues or </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> something so she he tries to help her </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and in that process </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> he </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> he follows her and then he gets </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> transported with her to just this </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> new place he doesn't know where he is </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> right </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> um </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah he basically gets isekai right goes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to another world yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he goes to another world </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he goes to another world see a theme </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> here yeah no he goes to another world </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with this girl right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um and then they're in just in just in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this like barren wasteland and then they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> get transported with a bunch of people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's kind of like the gans kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> theme where where it's it's not let it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not as brutal because it's like shonen </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> jump gans so it's not it's not got like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> massive gore but like people just start </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> dying left right and center right and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for some reason she has like a special </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> psychic power that she uses to survive </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> so he kind of follows her right and so </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> in like fighting through this kind of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> death game kind of barren wasteland kind </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> of thing </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> he </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> he like tries to figure out where the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> [ __ ] he is how he got there and what the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> [ __ ] going on right and then it's like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the big twist at the end of episode four </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> is that he goes on top of this like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like uh building that's just been like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> laying like it's it's like uh what's the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> word i'm looking for like abandoned or </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> not not abandoned but it's just like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's what what's the word where it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> just like like it's been years since </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> this building's been overgrown </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> dilapidated dilapidated yeah it's this </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the lab station building right and he </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and he goes on it and then he sees mount </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> fuji right </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's just he realizes </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for some reason he's in japan he's in a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> city that is in complete ruins and the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> apocalypse has happened and so he </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> doesn't know how he got there or where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he is that's right or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> should i say it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay i'm gonna say okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> or when he is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> but i mean i guessed when you were said </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that he's in japan yeah yeah time thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i said it was dilapidated </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> signal the passage of time yeah yeah so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so that i i guess i guess that that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> spoils it but </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but yeah i mean so what i love about </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> this is that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's a shonen jump action manga that had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that has has a mystery core because the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> core of this is him going back to his </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> own world or his own time and kind of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> figuring out what the [ __ ] happened </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how did it happen </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and in that process like i'm that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's all i'm gonna say because in the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> process there's so many twists and turns </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that come from that and him trying to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> figure out what's going on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um and it was just nice to see </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a shonen jump that has action in it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but also has this really mystery aspect </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that keeps you coming back and just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> keeps you like reading the next page </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just to figure out what happens because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i feel like there's there's been shown a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> jump with a mystery aspect for example </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> uh what's the one where they eat kids </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> again i promise no one promised </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> nevertheless like been like promised </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> neverland and it's been like obviously </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> i've never heard perhaps an airline b </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> described as what's the one where they </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> eat kids i mean what am i wrong i don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> know why i got it right away am i wrong </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> am i wrong i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is what it is like shenanigans it's not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what it mean it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> the one about the kids trying to escape </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> it's the one where the kids get eaten </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> like i i like i i like the fact that it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> had a mystery aspect and also a battle </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> shonen aspect and i feel like it was so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> underground because nobody [ __ ] read </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> it i think the problem with siren is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that it kind of came out at a time where </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> shonen jump was just absolutely stacked </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> where like everything else in china </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> because this was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mid-2000s shown in right so this was not </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> only in the midst of the big three but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> also like the lesser known shonen jump </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> stuff that was not the big three was </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> still very very popular so why do they </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> get cancelled then um just because it </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> wasn't popular enough yeah i'm just like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> i feel like i feel like another thing is </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> that unfortunately the art style just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> looks so generic because this came off </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> the bleach it doesn't look </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the main character looks like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> ichigo yeah yeah it kind of looks so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> generic but it has so many original </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> ideas like i really like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> without spoiling what the main </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> character's power is so like anyone who </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> goes to this world gets a special power </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> of their own right and i like as an </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> engineer </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> he has like a really unique power where </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> i'm not going to spoil exactly what he </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> is but he can't control this power like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> he can't </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> consciously control this power so what </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> he does </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to kind of figure out a way different </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> ways to use his power is he makes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> subroutines </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> for for this power so it's basically </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like he makes programming loops for this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> power to like follow a set algorithm to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> do exactly what he wants </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and i'm just like that's such a unique </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> idea like slowly remembering this monkey </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> man </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can type 2 000 words per minute </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> but yeah like i mean i could i could put </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> i could have put like hunter hunter or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> other shonen jump manga on here it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> nice to see some variation but yeah like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i said every every shonen jump manga i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can think of putting on here has an </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> anime adaptation so that's that's the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> only reason why i put siren on here </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because it's my it is my favorite shonen </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> jump manga that does not have an anime </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah because it got cancelled because it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> wasn't popular yeah isn't it the other </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> one i would put on there is uh did you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> ever read m0 i did not read it okay </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> that's another one that was like kind of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> it came out around the same time as </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> siren where shoney jump was just stacked </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> never got an anime adaptation but it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so good what's that about </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> m0 is about it's this basically it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> this kid who enters this magic school </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but he himself has zero magic abilities </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah so this is literally like think of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like [ __ ] might here academia right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but instead of quirks it's magic power </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you have like certain levels of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> magic and the higher your magic level is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> the more powerful like a magic card you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> get that can like activate magic skills </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> and the main character again he has zero </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> magic so he gets an m0 card oh okay and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's just him basically just trying to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> basically survive and graduate yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> magic school but like the art style is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> so unique and it's so it's such a dope </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> solid story but again it's never got an </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> adam adaptation and like hardly anyone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> read it because again </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> jump no it didn't get cancelled it had a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> proper ending it got like 12 volumes or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something oh and i had a proper ending </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> it just no one read it because during </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that time shonen jump was so stacked </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> right all these other insane shows it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> stacked now as well stack now but like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> mid 2000's showing and jump was like so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you can you can recommend it even though </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it doesn't have an ending like is it oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> no it has an ending it's just very </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> rushed uh but like everything by the way </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> they're like wrap it up come on i mean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> the same as well yeah but like i i feel </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like i can still recommend it because </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the mystery aspect got solved and it got </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> solved in a decent amount of time what </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> didn't get what was like a bit </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> unsatisfying was just each character's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> resolution because it got wrapped up so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> quickly but the mystery aspect which was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the reason i was so addicted to whis and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> reading that gets wrapped up just fine </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> and that's why i can still recommend it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> so uh what's love hino about </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> wait have you not read osha no i don't </SPEAKER_07>

<SPEAKER_06> cute but she looks like a like a pokemon </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> reject </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> um she's uh i think every character in </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the 90s yeah yeah yeah it's true because </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> i think they all had like the same kind </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> of thing so out of ten </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> i mean i i've </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> just give me give me a [ __ ] score </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gone what is it how [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that that stutter was a five that's it i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> i think loving it to this day is like a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> solid six or seven </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> i think it's just a fun six or seven </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> it's a [ __ ] if if you like harry </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> manga </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> which you don't so okay if you like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> harry monk i still think lafina is such </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> is a very very sword it still stands up </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> to us why did you love harem anime i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> have manga so much like what about the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> harem speaks to you god oh that's like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> girls eh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i want all the girls okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i'll i'll break it down okay because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> this is gonna be a really weird analogy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um if i'm like if there's a harem manga </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that i'm invested in it's not it's not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> specifically about oh there's a bunch of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> girls what i equate reading a harry </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> manga to it's kind of like watching us </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> watching a sports match right because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like no you're gonna [ __ ] say that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah because okay because pick your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> team when you root for them you pick </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> your team and you get emotionally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> invested right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you pick your best girl and you [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> root for them and you stick through it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> through thick and thin yeah and then </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> even if they don't win </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> they've won in your heart yeah if even </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> if they don't win but if they do win </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like it's it's such an emotion </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> yes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> yes you literally become a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sports fan i bet god's never as happy as </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> when his [ __ ] harem </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> part of the best part of harrens right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is being he's watching it with the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> community because like half the fun is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> seeing your girl win but also half the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> fun is [ __ ] on the fans of the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> losing girl as well that's like that's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> like equally as [ __ ] that's what i loved </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> about it 100 because i read it with a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> bunch of my japanese friends who were </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> all just as invested and they all had </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> their own winners and when i when my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> girl won i was like [ __ ] you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> i told you joey had the biggest dick </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that week i did </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> i felt good </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> okay so like i mean it's i still think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's a solid harem i think one of the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> biggest differences to a lot of harems i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> met is that i do like the character </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> development of the main guy he starts </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> off as obviously a [ __ ] loser with no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> personality but as the series goes on he </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> actually develops why don't we ever get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> chad's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> where's the space for growth if they're </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> already achieved they become more modest </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> maybe they love modesty no one wants to </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> see </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [Music] </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_08> with his teacher right and </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> one day he just randomly goes up to a </SPEAKER_07>

<SPEAKER_01> i make sure thank you sydney you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> she goes to a mixer and he meets this </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> girl and this girl for some reason wants </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to lose her virginity because she just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> at the age where she's just like [ __ ] it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> i got nothing better to do doesn't the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> anime literally open with them like yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> after the anime literally opens the with </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> them just off </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right and so he sleeps with this girl </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then he's who he's just met and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they say goodbye </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um and then he goes home and then he </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> finds out that his dad's getting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> remarried and then he meets the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> family that he's getting like his dad's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> getting married to and it turns out that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the mother of or his future </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> mother-in-law </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> uh or his future stepmother </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> uh she has two daughters </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> one is the girl he slept with and the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> other is the teacher he's in love with </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and that is the premise of this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> girlfriend </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> literally this is this is incest and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is just like this is like what if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we made all pawn categories into one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is what it sounds like basically </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> this is like basically combine every </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> port where are the laundry machines okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> four of them in this house </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> okay so like i will fully admit that the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the concept i mean yeah this is this is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> a hentai block okay this is this is your </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> this is this is your kisses this </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> like when we did the anime three by </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> three people were like why why is the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> domestic girlfriend anime not on there </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> it's because i actually read the manga i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think it's a good [ __ ] manga and i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> would defend it till the day i [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> died would you say it's a masterpiece i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> would say i mean </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> it's a masterpiece in my heart okay okay </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> no because like i understand because </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> like what happens is like this </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> masterpiece is short for masturbating </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> yes but like okay what i love about this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> manga is that it takes the most like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's the situation is a complete car </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> wreck and it just turns to a car wreck </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to a train wreck to a [ __ ] nuclear </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> holocaust like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> the like the layers of how </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> complicated the situation get just let's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> just get stacked on top of each other </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> what what offsets this is that it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> actually a really well written manga </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's like a a lot of following you're </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> being very oxymoronic right now okay </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> okay okay because a lot of thought was </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> really put into the characters so the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> characters actually seem really </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> realistic and you can kind of like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> empathize with them right </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> what's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> what you can't relate to is the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> situation that they're in so you put </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> really </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you put like you put actual like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> realistic characters or well written </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> characters into this really [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> trashy wacky situation and it's such </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's like a juxtaposition </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of just you're actually invested in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> these characters but also the stuff </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that's happening is so wild that you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> just want to keep reading just to see </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> what happens next it's like a soap opera </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but the characters are actually really </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like you're really really invested in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> these characters </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> i i just couldn't get to that point with </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> the anime honestly </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> what's more of a battle this or kingdom </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> what's more of an epic battle </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> it's two different battles isn't it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which is the bigger battleground oh oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> oh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i don't know which one's more five head </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> man one of them is like you're </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> physically getting hurt because the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> other is like chipping away your brain </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah okay because because like the anime </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is a really okay what the anime did is </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that it just took all the trashy moments </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> in the manga without any of the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> character moments and just put them and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> just speed ran it so it made a bit of a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bad pawner huh they made it bad yeah but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> he made a bad porno okay </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's uh i mean what what porno doesn't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> have character development well well how </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> can i implement most of them a good one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> we don't need it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and uh yeah i i will i will keep talking </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> about the dimensions i'm sure if you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> want to talk about it just ask him in </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> public ask him anywhere </SPEAKER_07>

<SPEAKER_07> three by three i'd say a dojin three by </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> three this is all and uh an anime three </SPEAKER_07>

<SPEAKER_06> century boys okay because that is a that </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_03> well the cover looks badass yeah so it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> [ __ ] amazing so 20th century boys is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> my favorite manga of all time and i've i </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> only read this just before moving to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> japan and it's it's it's kind of like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> the oh yes me punishment where i knew i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> would love this for ages and i held off </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> reading it until i had just the right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> amount of time and the right mindset and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that just so happens when i had the few </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> week break before i moved to japan and i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was like okay i am now ready to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> experience i'm now ready for emotion and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it lived up to everything and more i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like i knew it was like a magnum opus of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> a piece of work yeah and i still like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's it's amazing but also it like every </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> every lesson and every message you try </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to say like spoke to me personally as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> well so it was kind of like a mixture of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> personally this was my kind of story and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> also it's an amazing story this is this </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> was the manga that made me go wow </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> he's a [ __ ] genius can you give me a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> very quick rundown of the show sure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> okay </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> so oh oh it's pretty convoluted applause </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> it's it's a very give me the most </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> bare-bones explanation okay so i'll try </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to sell you this as quickly as possible </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> um so imagine like when you're growing </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> up as a kid right you play hero and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> villains right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like you you play a hero and someone </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> plays the hero and someone plays the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> villain and normally a super villain </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they try to take over the world right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's a cartoony plot they take of the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> world and the hero stops them now what </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you could make this very childish </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> plot believable </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> that is basically what 20th century boys </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> is right sounds cool it's someone who </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> basically </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> tries to take over the world and naoki </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> naoki hiroshima went how can we actually </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> make this actually seem realistic and </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> terrifying and terrifying as well that's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> that's like the bare bones basic premise </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> of this what i love about this is that </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> it's kind of like a mystery so it </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> doesn't open up with that that premise </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> what it opens up with is this guy who's </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> just a normal guy who stumbles upon </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a conspiracy right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of course you stumble upon a conspiracy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you see how deep this how deep this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> conspiracy goes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah exactly exactly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it the way the story unravels is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like you are given pieces just to how </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how deep this conspiracy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this conspiracy goes and how far it runs </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and the more chapters you read normally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like you see a mystery and like you can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're able to like kind of get a feel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for like how big this mystery is right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what i find [ __ ] amazing about 20th </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> century boys is that i was like 5 to 10 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> volumes in or something like that and it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> felt like i was staring into an abyss in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> terms of this mystery like this this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> this feeling where you just don't know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> how deep this rabbit hole goes like you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you're just like there's no way this can </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> go deeper then something gets revealed </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and you're like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> where does this end </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> how the [ __ ] how far this does this go </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and like the way that and that's what i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> find i find that incredible there's no </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but no other mystery that's just giving </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> me this feeling of just like it was kind </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of like almost existential dread because </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i didn't know how far this sank or how </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> deep this went </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> um and it's probably like it's my </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> favorite manga of all time i think it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> my favorite mystery of all time </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> i'm so so amazing at writing these just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> mysteries where it's just like you don't </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> know where it's going and also </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> i don't know about you but urasanaki i </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> feel is a genius at writing </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> some of the most perfect antagonists </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> yeah in manga i mean he also did monster </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah right yeah okay you should have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> said that yeah oh yeah yeah it's the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> same guy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> same guy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but like monster is like way more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> character driven and i think it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> much more small scale this one is like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] massive scale it sucks so much </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> to read now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> and like this is this is never going to </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> get an anime adaptation because </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> i mean compared to monster this this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> would be like hundreds of episodes maybe </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because that's just that's just how like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> monster was like 70 something episodes </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah this would easily be like 150 200 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> episodes yeah yeah make it happen honey </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> got over 148 true yeah and yeah i i feel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> like it's the greatest manga i've ever </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> read and it's definitely up there yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is there anything more than that can you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> give it a higher praise than that that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> that it's it's mine i guess i have to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> read it [ __ ] me yeah it's brilliant it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> my uh it's it's it's i i like i can't </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> even pick a favorite anime of all time </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> but the fact that i can pick a favorite </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> manga of all time it's telling that's </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> telling ladies and gentlemen we got him </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> we got him and it's not domestic </SPEAKER_08>

<SPEAKER_06> like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> [Music] </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> it's uh what i love about beck i mean </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> it's a very simple story in that sense </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> it's a completely character-driven story </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> where </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> it's about a boy who joins a band and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they're very underground they're trying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to make it big um and it's literally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just their journey of making it big </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right and you know i mean you've seen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> movies and [ __ ] you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> star is born huh a star is born yeah and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> obviously there's i mean this is sabrina </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> miley cyrus hannah montana </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the best of both worlds sorry think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> about that but just like better </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> how </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> [Music] </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's very heavily reliant on the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> characters but like the way the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> characters are written and just the how </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> they like play off each other and like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> all of the i mean a it's very realistic </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> which is already like a big plus for me </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> especially with like a character-driven </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> story like that but also it's just like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i don't know it's just a really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> good journey do you think i'd enjoy it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> uh do you like rock music i enjoy rock </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_03> music i felt like the pressure was on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> for some reason sorry go ahead </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah i mean it's what i love about beck </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is that it's just all </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it just captures </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the you know the love for rock and you </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> know good old you know old classic rock </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and roll and just like how rockets </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> evolve through time so so do they </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> mention like all of like like did they </SPEAKER_07>

<SPEAKER_07> cover of the beatles and [ __ ] yeah yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> how does </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know because i i just thought about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> a second i'm like oh wait surely you'd </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> want to listen to the music right yeah </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> so that's why i watched the anime yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> that's what i think yeah </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> i thought that as well right because i </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> was just like [ __ ] i kind of really want </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> to know what happens but i don't know if </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> i can get invested in a um in a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> manga about music where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't i don't know if you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> anything about manga but uh you can't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> really hear anything that's going on in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the market don't have audio yeah and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> then i realized and then i realized the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] i i kind of realized a super </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> life hack uh when reading beck right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because what because you know i i also </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> watch the anime that's what got me into </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> reading the manga </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um and i realized that when they're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> playing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in their concerts and it's like you can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> literally just play whatever song you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] love and you feel the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> emotion [ __ ] brain </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> know i gotta go through expansion </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> playlist brain expansion i mean like you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can do it if you if you kind of like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> want if you want to like really get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> invested and really like put yourself </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> into this rock concert but what what's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> amazing about the manga is that it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> somehow captures the energy of a concert </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so [ __ ] well and like if you've ever </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> been to a gig and if you've ever if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you've ever like seen sorry sorry thanks </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_06> conor when he listens to someone talking </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> about music </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> reaction </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> music yeah so someone like read musical </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> sheets near me </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> no if you've ever been to a gig and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> especially like a rock concert there's a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> certain like energy to seeing your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> favorite bands live and i don't know how </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the manga the manga which is a medium </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where you can't hear anything it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> captures the energy so well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you can play the music of whatever </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> your favorite band is and you're just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like holy [ __ ] i'm feeling hyped and the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> reason this is saying the feelings yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah yeah exactly and the the music is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> kind of like complimentary to that as </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> well </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um and like if you like if you like the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> anime joey then you're gonna [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> love the manga because the manga takes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the best parts of like the best scenes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> of what happens in the anime and there </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> are there are scenes in the manga that </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> are like five times as hype as anything </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> that happens in grateful sounds i know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what i'm buying next </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah and like it's it's hard to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sell back uh if you haven't seen the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> anime because if if you haven't seen the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> anime i think that's the best way to get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> into the manga because it's like i said </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's a musical manga um and it might be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a hard sell if you don't know if if you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't know what you're getting into but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> but if you like rock if you feel like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> good old rock and roll i still remember </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that scene in beck that made me be like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> hell yeah it was like the the scene </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where he does the cover of i got a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> feeling by the way yeah yeah that scene </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_08> hell yes moment it is so good i don't </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> know what you're talking about it's such </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> a great it's such a good thing it's just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> so steeped in rock culture yeah that's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> uh if if you're if you like that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> there's a lot there's a lot of people in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> japan who just love [ __ ] rock and </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_03> like they say like oh with this person's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> inspired by hendrix or sex pistols </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> there's another manga that does that um </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> exactly right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that was the joke i was gonna go for </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and uh of course the uh only square </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's been taken up by all three of our </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> three by threes </SPEAKER_06>

<SPEAKER_03> tell it was nearly about nearly done </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it kind of had like its own somewhat </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> conclusion </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> around that point i mean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> when i was reading it and i saw the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> dreaded i saw how many chapters i had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> left yeah a little sinking feeling was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> coming from my heart but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know i i still i i'm i'm very thanks </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i felt like he was so close to the end </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like we were there like he was he was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> literally prepping yeah he was prep </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> i still think he had a lot </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> i don't know because he he you know you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> know how before a big raid you know you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> get some new armor you get some new </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> stuff right that's what was going on it </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> was definitely a prominent fight coming </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> we were gonna and it was gearing up that </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> it was like all right we're getting a </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> big boy fight yeah yeah yeah we might </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> have been like 10 years away but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it was coming it was coming it was on a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> plane </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> it was like oh she's coming i'm like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i mean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> do we need to explain the plot of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> berserk do we </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> i mean it's just i guess we should a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> little bit right if you haven't read </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> this there's probably people watching </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this who have not read berserk yes i </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> mean i was one of those people would you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like to explain the plot um </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there was a boy who was orphaned uh he </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> was thrown to the wayside in a pile of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> horrible fluids on the ground and uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there was a woman who was like no we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> must pick this up and the mercenary band </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that was traveling with this one was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like no let him let him die and die but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then somehow the woman convinces the man </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to let her pick the baby up and raise </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this child who is going to be guts our </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> main character and as you can tell this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> upbringing is not the best and hor many </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> more horrible things happen to this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> child through his upbringing but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so many gross things but the band of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mercenaries also train him to be a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> warrior </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then you know because he said so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> many bad things happen to him during </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> during his childhood he becomes kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the the lone gamer warrior that we all </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> think is the coolest thing ever uh but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you know the black swords yeah the black </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> swordsman right the guy who can carry </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> the big ass swords </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> the one who can just beat everyone alone </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> right and and you know </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> slowly realize that that's a bit of an </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> empty life and uh wants to make friends </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and then uh bad things happen very bad </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> things happen um </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and bad things continue to happen and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> getting over those bad things and trying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to learn to accept people and love again </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> i suppose in certain ways um it poses </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> itself as this like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> big bad guy with a sword fights monsters </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> and bad dudes and tries to survive the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wall but at the end of it you realize oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's not about that no it's about his </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> journey yeah it's about it's always </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> always about that it's it's always it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> always about this it's about it's about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> him </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> it's it's literally just like a monger </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> about his life yeah and the cherry on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> top is just god tierra </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> the art is just insane like it's it's </SPEAKER_07>

<SPEAKER_08> who have never read berserk they look at </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> it and they see oh musty man with big </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> sword go bro you know that's that's </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that's that's kind of like what it looks </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like on the cover but like what everyone </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> who's read berserk and the moments that </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> stand out in berserk and the parts that </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> people remember are always like the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> quiet instruments yeah it's the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> beautiful moments and that's and that's </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> because there's the juxtaposition </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> between like the [ __ ] up [ __ ] that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> happens and the bloody and gory and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> amazing action that is in the manga like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it's juxtaposed with some of like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> the most beautiful moments you can find </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> in fiction just the scene of god </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> standing in the field of flowers yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> just that that whole like mini arc if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> you will yeah it's like one of my </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> favorite moments really yeah i was just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like oh [ __ ] they just took like they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> were like hold up yeah </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> yeah because i feel like i feel like the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> story of berserk speaks to just a call </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that so many people can relate to like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> hey </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you know to get [ __ ] real for a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> second like if you've ever felt lost in </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> life or you don't know what your purpose </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> is or you don't know </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> if it's worth it if you don't know if </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's worth it or why you're [ __ ] here </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like if you're just ever having a bad </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> day </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like that's exactly what guts goes </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> through in berserk you may look like a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> big muscly man but he like the journey </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that he goes through is exactly the same </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> realization that a lot of us </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> have gone through in our lives you know </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> under that hunk of muscle there is a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> heart you can't you can't chop your way </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> through every problem yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> that's what you know he tries and he </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> realizes no he can't see as much as we'd </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> all love to be the overpowered mc like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at the end of the day that that's not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> going to help you solve every problem </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah that's what uh you know just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it shows you i guess in some ways not to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> get too lost in the things that are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right in front of you right which is a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> lot about what berserk is about yeah i i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> think i think the scene that sold me on </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> berserk if like if i can get to like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> small spoilers of the golden age arc </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um it's it's like the scene after he </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> beats like the hundred men because like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you you think in warfare you [ __ ] one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> man takes on a hundred men that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] badass in any other anime that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> would like that's framed as like holy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] this is an incredible feat which it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> is yeah and like i like i remember like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it was just gutz's reaction it was just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> realizing it doesn't [ __ ] mean </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> anything yeah like also the aftermath of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone coming in the forest yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> seeing him just murdered a hundred yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah yeah just like disgusted they're </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> like what the [ __ ] how is this man alive </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> [ __ ] but yeah that is it's it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> afterwards that he just realizes i'm i'm </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> doing this for no reason i'm literally </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> just killing 100 men and it just means </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> nothing to me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah like even right away like even </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> though um i you know i think i said this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in uh the last episode uh the last time </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> we spoke about berserk i do think that i </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> would have preferred um the first part </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> which they because they they have like a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> time skip i would have preferred they've </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> just put that in the right time right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> because i feel like it kind of oh and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> just start from like golden age yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i think it would have been perfect </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to start from there um even though i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sure people disagree with me um because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i feel like you get so many </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really cool experiences if you didn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know what was going to happen yeah um </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and also just getting to see </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> his childhood from the start yeah would </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> tell you all about the how [ __ ] up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> this thing's going to be yeah i guess i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> guess they needed a hook right to you i </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> think so i think that's why but like you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> know i wonder </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if it was done again </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know would it would it be ordered </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> differently looking back </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i don't know um that's obviously just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> pure speculation yeah and i'm sure </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> people would uh completely disagree with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> me and that's fine that's opinions right </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that's what yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> i think especially is especially what </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> happened recently berserk's really </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> changed my perspective on how i view </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> media as well because i'm just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> before i'm just like something that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not finished can't be a masterpiece and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then i think about it and i'm just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> berserk is a pure example of something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> that has done more than [ __ ] enough </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> to be a master yeah like an unfinished </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> masterpiece is still a masterpiece you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> know and i i feel like i that's really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> changed my perspective on other shows </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which may maybe not ended it may never </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> end and i'm just like well i think it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> still done enough to be called like a </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> masterpiece yeah and i think berserk has </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> really showed me that as well i agree </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah real berserk read berserk please </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> and listen to guts's theory even if </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> you're not into dark fantasy i think </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> it's still i'm not into darth vader i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> still think it's it can be very much </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> enjoyed </SPEAKER_03>
