<SPEAKER_05> - I really want you guys to smell the arm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I'm not smelling your fingers. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Please,
- No </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Get that shit away from me! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> (exhales loudly) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Put his nose in it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (groans) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (soft music) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> What's up you salty salmon slices. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Welcome back to another episode
of the Trash Taste Podcast. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm sorry, what?

<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah you heard me right.
- Where did you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> come up with that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's gonna be every
time I host an episode </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's going to be my thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's going to be the new intro. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's a thing now? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Shut though, man we didn't
discuss this before hand. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I was thinking of that
shift for like two weeks. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - What the fuck?
- I'm like this is gonna slap. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's the best you
came up with in two weeks? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Hey man give me some time
well I'm working on it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - All right.
- Well, welcome </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> to the trash taste podcast. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> The show where we talk trash
about our tastes anatomy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm your host for today, Joey </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and joined as always is
Garnt and Connor dope. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yo. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So this episode is I guess
the first special episode </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Speed off episode. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean if you're being linked
from our main channel videos, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> hello, welcome to the podcast.
- Welcome. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But if you haven't seen
our main channel videos </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> do we wanna explain what we did? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Joey go on. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh yeah, Sure. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So basically on our main channel </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we decided to do like
a little fun challenge </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> where as you can see </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> our backdrop is a little bit burnt. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - This is a big table </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> that has a lot of potential space </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> to be filled out with some Weeby shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So what we decided to do is
we decided to venture out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> into the weebland itself,
Akihabara in Tokyo </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which is like known as like
heaven for tacos essentially. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yes it is. I can confirm. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And we decided to
challenge ourselves to see </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how many figurines or I guess anime merch </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we can buy with a $500 budget </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> or about 50,000 Yen if
you convert it to Yen. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And just instead of just
going out and making it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like a vlog kind of thing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we decided to turn it into a challenge </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where we fight each other for brets. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Let's make it fun. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Let's make it challenging </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and let's make, let's put
some stakes on this bitch. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Let's make in a relaxing experience </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with shopping into stressful hell </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where you buy shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You don't want to meet
a dumb set of criteria. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Would you like to speak-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Out of the money in our pocket. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing)
- Yeah, exactly right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - So essentially we gave
ourselves a number of challenges. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We had some small challenges that we did </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the four enemy stores that we went to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> in our main channel videos. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Again, if you want to check
it out, go check it out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah you miss a lot of context </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> if you don't watch that video. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But if you haven't seen it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and you refuse to for some reason, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you'll still be fine
to watch this podcast. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. So basically we
all have scores already </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> from challenges that we went to, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that we did in each store </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is probably on screen right now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- You'd know that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if you've watched our videos </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but here are all our scores. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. All right it's not the final score </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like any good Mario party game, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> It doesn't matter how many
stars you end up with. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's all about the final count. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's all about the bonus stars </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and this episode is essentially </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where we go over the bonus stars </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> as well as show each other what we got </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because right now we don't know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what the fuck each other got. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - We maybe got like a few glimpses </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> as we like passed each
other passive aggressively </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in each of the stores. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> But right now we have no idea
what the other person bought. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So that's what we're
going to find out today. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> So we have a bunch of
overarching challenges, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yes. So we have some that
are like pretty obvious </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like who spent the most
on a single figurine. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> What was else, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who bought a figure from
the most popular series, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which you lose a point if that's the case. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Normy award. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - We'll go over every challenge at the end </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> after we've finished showing
everyone what we've bought. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> But for now I just wanted to ask you guys, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we just filmed it yesterday. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - How did you guys find the experience? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean, I found it super fun. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> That came out like I haven't
started editing the video yet </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> as I'm recording this episode, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> but I can already tell that video </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> is going to be so fucking fun to watch. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I feel like it's just fun. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Like that's like the, any way to, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you can see them having fun in it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Cause it was just, I mean, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like a kid in a candy store, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Essentially. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like we always go to these stores. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's a very expensive candy store. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs)
- Exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - we always go to these stores </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and being able to like film
in there, with permission. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know, we want to do
that professionally as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> We didn't Lo gang pull this
shit, if you know what I mean. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - We got permission because
we respek the country. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. We, we got all
permission from the stores </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's just great </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because you kind of just got
to let loose in the store. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, some of the stores
that have people in there </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so I was still trying to be respectful, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but you know, like Animate, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there was no one else in that store. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - No.
- Just us. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - We, we got in like before
the store even opened so. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - When we left the store </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> there was like a massive queue. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Of people trying to get in. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - And I was like, Oh, I
feel kind of bad right now. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Felt so bad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Then we just come out just like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with all our crap and just being like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you guys have to lay on </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs)
- Look at these peasants. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - But yeah, like a lot of the stores </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> were like very happy to have us. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean like Amiami made us like
sign that like little thing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in that photo.
- Yeah, it was crazy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - If you ever go to Amiami in Akihabara </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> look out for our little plaque. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. We have a trash
tastes like plaque. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh do you think they
going to hang that up? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Is that what the (laughs). </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I assume so.
- Yeah they should. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I really hope so. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But like no, but all of the
stores were super freaking cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- They were very supportive. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> So there's first of all, big shout out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to all the stores that did give
us permission to film there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But yeah, without further ado, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think we should go over what we bought </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> in each store and judge our, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> as the name suggest,
Trash Taste on figurines </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and other anime merch. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - So let's just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> jump right into it.
- Wait, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> before we jump right into it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - I wanna jump right into it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I can't wait to jump right into it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughs)
- Oh my God </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> let's just hold off on
the jumping for a second. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I want to discuss, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so did you guys have any strategy, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> going into this game or
into this challenge even? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I said I did in my main channel video </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but in retrospect I didn't. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - If I win, it was all a plan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> If I loose, I was just having
a fun time with the boys. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know, I think that's... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Okay to be 100% honest,
I like had some idea </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but I think it, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> my strategy was just see
what you guys are doing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So if you guys are trying
to go off all the challenges </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I could see you guys
with paying attention, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> like, okay I was going
to, but if I knew that... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because I could tell
some of you, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> weren't paying as much attention </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> to the challenges as others. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was just saying.
- The only challenge </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> that I paid in mind to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> was only one that I remembered, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> which was the whoever
gets closest to $500. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which is worth two points. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah which is like two points. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like I have to prioritize that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> because that two points is big. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Two points is big but, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> like I remember, because
I couldn't even remember </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all the challenges we agreed on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I went to into the day being like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> okay, this one's an obvious challenge. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> This one's an obvious challenge. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> As I went into more stores, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, I am not keeping track at all. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I am running out of money. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know what's happening. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - When I was in Animate, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, okay, I'm going
to do this in this store. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm going to do this and that store. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then I hit the second store. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, what the fuck am I doing? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I have-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I was so short-sided
on like the challenges </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> that I had to do in that store. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- And then I was just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> fuck the other challenge. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I need to get this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So to put it in perspective, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we've got two challenges for every store </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> as you probably saw in the video. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So which is a total of eight
points that we could get. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's 11 points up for grabs </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> in the overarching challenges. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yes.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So I mean, if you do really well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> on the overarching challenges </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> it might not fucking matter. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah exactly. Like
we're all already close </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> from what we've already seen. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We're like maybe one or two points-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Eight, seven, six. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. So really close.
- So that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a two point discrepancy.
- So right now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I might be losing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> but like any good Mario party game, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can always come back right at the end. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So, yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Should we just jump right into it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> (all laugh heartedly) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Let's jump right into it! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So we start with Amiami, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh no sorry, Animate first? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] We start with Animate. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Animate! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I didn't buy much in this store. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> It was the first one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I didn't want to pull the trigger yet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay. So here's the thing about Animate. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I didn't know how much I should buy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - We're just revealing right now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or what do we do? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean, who wants to go first? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh. Shit. Can I go first? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You're the host.
- Okay, I'll go first </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I only bought
one thing at Animate. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] All right, same. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> So one of my challenges was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> to get a Made in Abyss Figurine. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Couldn't find it. Not just at Animate. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Any of the stores, I couldn't find it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> So I just lost a point for that one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But I figured, you know, what? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll get something like kind
of cool and kind of niche. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> So I got a Chaiki Moto from Dororo. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh damn!
- Oh wow, I didn't even know </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they made for this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah
- I know. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> It's a ninderoid of a Chaiki Moto . </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I mean, Dororo was so fucking awesome. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I love Maimai Kamisama stuff, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I love Dororo . </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I like my ninderoids too so. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know what, not bad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's really, really cute. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean, we'll probably figure
out the pose of it somehow </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - But it's the stressful
thing about ninderoids. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> So you just have to pick one pose </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and that's...
(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> We all know it's never going </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> to change from this pose. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - They're also so finicky as well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but once you've nailed it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> you're like hell yeah.
- Exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So that's the only
thing I got at Animate. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because, yeah, I got
a few things at Animate. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I had two challenges, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I think I got fucked </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> over some of the overarching challenges </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> by just Animate itself. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Really? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So let's go ahead. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So the first thing, the first challenge </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was to buy a Deku figure
from My Hero Academia. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So as we all know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> one of the overarching challenges </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> was the person who buys
a figure from the most </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> popular series gets deducted points. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So there's my deku figure. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I was actually getting
a bit worried, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because there weren't many like figures </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in Animate.
- No, there wasn't. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Animate was more like general merch. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, it was really varied in-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah so the only thing I
could find on ninderoids. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And so my second challenge </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> was to ask a store clerk, in Japanese, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> to recommend me a figure.
- Figure oh sumi. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - You had to pull a sumi masen. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wait, what did he recommend you? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, he recommended to me Edward Elric </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> from Fullmetal Alchemist.
- No! </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You've totally lost it.
- You've totally lost. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - I was like, whoa! Oh my God you've, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> one, you recommend to me </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> the figure from the one series </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I haven't seen yet, fucking. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> (all laughing heartedly) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You haven't seen it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh my God.
- That's so fucked. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And two, you've just
made me all to lose a point </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> by recommending to me, I checked before, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> for the fourth, most
popular anime series on mal! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> So thank you for making </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> me lose the point.
- Oh my God. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Wait, because I see the price there. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's 48 bucks, right?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - How much did you spend on these two? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Are they both 48 bucks? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - This one says 48,88. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And this one says-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - That was like about 52 bucks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, this one will be a
little bit more expensive. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - You got done dirty by that man. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah
(laughs). </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> In the video, I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> oh thank you very much
for recommending to me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And inside I'm just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> I can't believe you've done this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I bought one more thing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which cracked me up, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which is an Ishtar plushie. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> It's far Ishtar. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] It's kind of cute. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's kinda cute I like it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, from Fate? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah from Fate.
- Oh. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> Okay, what the Fuck. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> That's kinda cute.
- I think that's a, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> what is it? It's called tsum. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like a, it's like a
giant tsum tsum, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think that's the
thing that's over here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah. That's so cute though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That is very cute. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. That's gonna look sick. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - So how much would you
spend on Animate overall? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - $120. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> (Connor exhales)
- Jesus. I only spent-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Wait this is 30 bucks. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I only spent 48. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, so I also spent 48 bucks </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> on my red Cell fan. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, I was looking at that one. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - So my two challenges were </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> get a female figure </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and get one from a show
that you watched recently. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I watched like a few
episodes, like two months ago, so. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Why didn't you get the Nezuko figure? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I saw you eyeing the Nezuko and I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> motherfucker, if I-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - He doesn't wanna lose the point. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I didn't wanna get the Normy award </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> And I knew that demon
slayers are the most normal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Whatever the ranking say, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I would've lost the Normy award at heart. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> You know what I mean?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And plus you know, I
don't want to risk it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And also I thought, you know,
it's kind of a cool figure, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know.
- Yeah, it is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If we have Nezuko </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it makes us look like fake anime fans. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm just saying like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Nah, get the fuck out, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Nezuko </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> is best Imouto of last year.
- Whatever! Okay! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I think Garnt has like
fulfilled the prophecy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> with these two. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs)
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Literally the boomer of AniTube here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Tell me about why Nezuko
is, you know, best-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I've gone like how many episodes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and I've not talked about Iumoto here. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh my God.
- And you are taking </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> this chance away from me.
- Just give us some time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> You know, Garnt's going to get there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - I was thinking we'd just
put it in the front for now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We'll just gather them
in the front for now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - (laughing) I was very grounded. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I, okay for the record,
I hate ninderoids. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I think ninderoids are
like stressful purchases. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I love ninderoids.
- and we have four </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> goddamn ninderoids. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because you have to pose them, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And, and the whole selling
point of a ninderoid, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm putting everybody
sponsored by ninderoid ever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The whole selling point </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of a ninderoid is that you can move it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But tell me, everyone
who wants a ninderoid, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> when have you changed
the pose of a ninderoid? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I've changed it a few times. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's a lie. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's a fucking lie.
- I've never changed it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yes, he's lying. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I've changed it because
I'm sponsored by those guys. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Thanks guys. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It is stressful. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And then you've got to worry about the box </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and the little things, and I just. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I sometimes like, where I'm just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I look at the little parts and I'm like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I want to change it eventually. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then I do. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I'm like, okay, I'm glad I kept watch. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Actually, before we go on, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> question to you guys, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> what do you do with a figure box? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Do you bin it or do you keep it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I store it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Shit man, I ripped that shit over. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - No! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Even after living in Japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where the box is like half the value. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because yeah, the
mentality for me is like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if I eventually like
possibly get like, you know, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I lose interest-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm gonna sell this figure. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No Fuck off, you're not
going to sell the figure. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's me, I tried. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like this guy. I'm like maybe
I can sell this JoJo merch. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> You don't know, fuck! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You'll never gonna sell that JoJo merch. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - All right, but here's the
other thing I do, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> What helped me at my last place </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> is that it makes moving
house so much easier </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you keep the box. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah, it's true. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because you'd like, I usually, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> what I do at least with figurines, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Is like, I throw out like
the plastic like mould, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I keep the box.
- Yeah, I don't even do that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I throw the plastic mould.
- It just takes up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> so much space. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - But the thing is, if you
chuck out the plastic mould </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and you flatten the box, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then when you like move house </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you can just open the box up again </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> glad wrap it in, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then boom.
- I'm just too lazy for that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I just put it in the cupboard.
- You save so much time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and money and like possibly </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the risk of like ruining
a figurine when you move. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And like that saved me so much trouble </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when I moved to my current house. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So that's why I hold onto it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Right.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I said it's for repurposing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, it's not. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Solid purchases there overall. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think just makes a good taste. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I think, they're gonna look great. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - The next store-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - My favorite anime, Fullmetal Alchemist. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I recommend you guys, watch that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Your favorite character
from your favorite anime. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> (heartedly laughing)
- Oh my God. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - But the next store we went to was Astop. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I spent so much money here. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Actually, okay. what were you... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Before we get to Astop, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> what was you guys' strategy with Astop? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay. Astop is probably the store </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> that I go to the most just casually. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, I think for
all of us it's the same </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> So I knew I really had to spend time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> just like looking around. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because there were so
many figurines at Astop </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that I legitimately have
never seen anywhere else. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Even though they're
technically secondhand. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So I'm like, okay, I'm
going to aim for those. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> And I think I got pretty decent solution. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because for me, Astop was
the most daunting shop, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because, okay, so in my challenge </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I had to squat 10 times </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> before entering the store.
- That's not a challenge. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - That was easy to do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And my second challenge was an auto lose </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> beacause I had to buy
the most expensive figure </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which we found out was like 1,000 bucks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I knew I was going to lose that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I was like, I was going into Astop </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just not trying to complete any challenge </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> but just trying to like
buy figures that I like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's not a certain.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Follow your heart. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. I kind of went
fucking mental in Astop. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I filled up my piece of paper. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - No! Are you serious? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yes, same here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> Okay. So like, because like with Astop </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> there are so many figures </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and so many display cases </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that you don't remember </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which figure you saw where. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> So my strategy was just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> if I see a figure I like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm gonna write it down </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and maybe I'll cross it out later. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I fucked myself over so much in there </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> because I was just like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I remember seeing you
like halfway through. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I filled up my entire sheet </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> and you didn't even have a piece of paper. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I was still looking for like stuff. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So I was just going, okay, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that one, okay write it down, write that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then I got to the end </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> and then I couldn't remember
which figure was which. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> So I was trying--
- Yes, I heard that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> It was like, is it this one? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> I think, it is maybe that one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. So it was like
basically trying to choose </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> between my children. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> So I'm like, what the fuck
am I crossing out right now? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, I have no fucking clue. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Wow. Okay, because yeah,
like for me, like Astop </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I knew if I wasn't careful at Astop </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I was going to go absolutely ham </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as I usually do just like casually. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I'm like, okay, there
are still two stores left. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We're not even halfway
through this challenge </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> so I have to like limit myself </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> as much as possible at Astop. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So I only bought three things. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - At Astop. How many did you get? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I can't remember. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like five, six. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, you'll see. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Do you want to go first then? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I'll go first. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And then me and you can take in turns </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> showing one off each.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I decided to like kind of
go for like smallest ones. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> So my two challenges was the
first one was really easy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I had to go up to the store clerk </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and ask if they had Boku No Pico merch </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which they said they didn't. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Thank God.
(Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Did they know what it was. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The guy was in English speaking stuff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> So he's like, ''Is that the one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> ''where the two guys fucking?'' </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (all laughing heartedly) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> You'll see it in the video. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But the other challenge was really easy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It was just pick a figurine </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> that either myself Garnt or Connor likes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So obviously I went with
the one that I liked. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's bullshit by the way. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So mine is still in glad wrap right here </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so I've got to unwrap this shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I obviously </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> got my goddamn Waifu.
- Oh my God, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is it fucking Monogatari? Jesus. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Of course it is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Look if I'm going to
be on this show casually </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like all the freaking time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of course I needed to get my wife Shinobu, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> but I actually don't even
have this one at home so. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I guess, I'm just gonna go next now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> because of course I
followed my heart as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God you've got Monogatari as well? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Hell yeah!
- Hell yeah! </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh God. No my wife! </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - So yeah, I knew Joey
would get a Shinobu figure </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> becaause I saw so many boxes
that were just purely Shinobu </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I'm just like, get
that shit out of me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Get that shit out of my face man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - You might need to like
hold it up to the camera </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because they might not be seen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There're even boxes in the way actually. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - So I mean like what I
tried to do at Astop was, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> at the beginning I just tried to note down </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as many figures as I
could for under 20 bucks </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because I feel like anything over 20 bucks </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was like kind of risking it in terms of-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean especially if you're buying </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like seven figurines on Astop. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> So this one's, I don't have this figure. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Because it's short hair Senjougahara. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, that's cute. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Dude I personally find the
short hair Senjougahara's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> figurine so much nicer
than the long haired one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - There was so many good
Senjougahara figurines. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So it like hurts me that I
had to buy the cheapest one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - All right boys. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> You wanna see what I bought then? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is a... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think it was a 900 Yen
sold out online figure. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - You didn't even get like
the good sold online one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was the cheapest sold online figure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because you know, if
you're going to buy garbage </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> why care about which terrible item it is? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It was 900 Yen I think. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it was the cheapest
sold online figure. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> . [Joey] Oh damn okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Was this for a challenge? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. Remember? I had to shout </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I freaking love SAO. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - While buying an SAO figure. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I will say that shout
wasn't a shout at all. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - In Japanese culture
that was like full shout. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - That was just, okay,
''I freaking love SAO'' </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - No! It was louder than that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - It was just like, ''I
freaking love SAO.'' </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> It was like a gradual
like building volume. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Let's get this boy out of here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, the other two though that I bought </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think is super freaking cool </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because they're two figures </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that I personally really wanted but also </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just like really--
- Sorry it's making noise </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> over here. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> What did you say over there Joey. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Let's get the shit out of here. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think it goes without saying, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> don't listen to the audio only of this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's going to sound probably horrible. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Hey guys, just opening
a box over here, I mean. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - No. This is box opening ASM guys. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay but let me show you
the other two I got, okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> This second one I got is Shonen Jump. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Oh, that's so cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Okay that's
pretty fucking cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right? Like I'd never seen this before </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> does this count as a figurine? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Probably does. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. It's a piece of
you know, solid kind of-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I love Shonen Jump </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and that's gonna look so cool </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> on like the shelf or something like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think if we had a coolest item award </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Because I didn't know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if we could get a coolest item over here. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because we have to all agree. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. But I think we can all agree </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> this one of the coolest figurines. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And the other one I got
is also pretty cool. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It's Puck from Berserk. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Oh that's cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. Look at how tiny this guy is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] How much was that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - This was 980 Yen. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh wow. Because every
Berserk figure I saw </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> was so expensive. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like there's a few figures
in the store that I found. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like Nanachi, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> the little Nanachi figure. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Nanachi was like 250 bucks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh yeah no, the Made in Abyss stuff </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> is so expensive. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Yeah, because
it's so hard to find. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So even I got that Made
in Abyss thing at Astop </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I probably still wouldn't
have been able to do it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I'm not going to spend
$250 on a Nanachi figure. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, Angel Beats! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So I got Yuri from Angel Beats. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> She was, I can't remember how much </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but it was between 10 and 20 bucks. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's so cute.
- There's one figure </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that I didn't get </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I of course put Sagiri down. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I of course put Sagiri down </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you see my video </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when I'm like trying to figure out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which figure is which </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I was like just crossing our figures. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The realization when I had crossed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> out Sagiri was just like
my heart fucking sank, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> My heart sank and I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh no I crossed off sagiri. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> How could I. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing). </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Don't don't look at what I'm unboxing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, this is essentially
all I bought at Astop. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think I spent... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I didn't even spend $100 at Astop </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I think because I spent 9,940 Yen at Astop </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because this Shonen Jump one was 5,000 Yen </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> which is kind of
expensive but not too bad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean I just tried to get Cindereys. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - You got another Ishtar piece? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's a double Ishtar, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> two Ishtar.
- Oh my God </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think I even forgot her. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think it's like Medudine </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or something like that.
- She's cute. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's probably written on the box. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't want to say I've
bought the single best figure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - But are you gonna tell.
- But what can you say? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> Look at this $30 Mike Wazowski gem. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's actually so cool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I actually love that.
- That's actually like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> no joke, that's a good figure, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I know, cause I saw Mike Wazowski like-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I heard you shout it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I was like, Mike,
what are you doing here? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - So I have, it was a $30 purchase </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I'm just want to
make you guys laugh here. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I just wanna--
- Can, I see that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I actually love this.
- That's a good figure. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> It's well made.
- I love this dude. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Let me put this up here.
- I love how like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> the base is the Monsters Inc logo. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yes! So good.
- That's so cool. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I bought it for a troll </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I actually thought
it's not bad for 30 bucks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - No that's actually, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think our audience can appreciate that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's so cool. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I kind of want it. I love that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> (humming a tune) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well that's Toy Story, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, that's not-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Do you have any more figures coming up? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I have plenty of more figures. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, I'm all out </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so I'm just going to watch you guys. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - You guys keep talking. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Hell yeah! Megumin my Waifu. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - She was cheap, I think
she was like 19 bucks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Some Megumin figurines, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's a pretty big figure. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> The form factor of this
box, it's pretty deceiving. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's one thing I have
noticed about Megumin figurines. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Some of them are like way
cheaper than what they should be. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's hard to tell the difference </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> between an $80 Megumin figure
and a $20 Megumin figure. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah.
- It's like, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with some of the popular characters </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's like so many different prices </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with some of the popular characters. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Because I think I was about to buy, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was going to buy darkness as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> So I thought Joey was
going to buy Megumin. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was too
- I thought about it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I'm like, I don't need to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I reckon one of your
guys is gonna buy her. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Hold on. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Has nobody bought any JoJo figures. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh wow. It's funny you asked. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughs)
- Thank God! </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I would just like to preface that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that was not a scripted bid. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> That was totally just coincidence. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, because we were just showing figures </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> and I remember thinking that
I say in the video, okay, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Connor is gonna buy JoJo figures. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't need to buy any JoJo figures. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So if he didn't buy any,
I would have been like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how did we go an entire fucking trip </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> to Akihabara without
buying any JoJo figures. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I bought multiple JoJo figures actually </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> because of course I did. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, good. On brand. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So this is the, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> a figure that I've
actually never seen before. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> This is the-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh I saw that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, Joey's destroying-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm just destroying my set right now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is the crazy diamond JoJo figure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's the one of the
special colored editions </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> actually, I think cause there's
a normal colored version </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I've never seen this figure before </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I've never seen it
listed anywhere or anything </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but there was two of them
in the store funny enough. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it was only like 19 bucks. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> For 19 bucks that's a really nice figure </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and if you've seen JoJo figures </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Some of them look absolutely-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - They charge a lot more for a lot less. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's tragic that
like a 20 bucks figure </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> for the special colored
edition is like way better </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> than I paid 120 bucks for-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Also like the thing with JoJo figures </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like a double-edged sword </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> it's that like some of them
just look like absolute ass. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Some of them do not
look like the character </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Not at all. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And it's kind of tragic </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> because it's like one
of the most influential </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and popular series in Japan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and they do them dirty </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's a good figure. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, that's a beautiful
figure, right boys? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We can agree on that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That is a beautiful figure. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - All right boys should I show
my next figure that I bought? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I bought a lot at Astop. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I think I bought 10. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> This is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Dude. I was going to buy that! </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I knew he was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> because before we left the store, right? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> And I don't know if we got this on camera. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't think we did. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> But Joey was like, I'm was
going to buy this figure </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and he pointed to the booth
where I got this figure </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and he was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ''Oh it must have been
in a different booth.'' </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was thinking, I fucking bought that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, the moment I like, I looked over, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> it was like a comic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, I looked
over and it was just gone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and in my head I'm just
like, someone bought it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - It is like -- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - How much did that cost? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] It was like 30 bucks.
- It was 30 bucks . </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Look at how cool that is for 30 bucks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] It is so good.
- It is not standing up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm realizing now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I wonder if the cape... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh the cape. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Guys for 30 bucks.
- I know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's pretty fucking good.
- It's fucking steal. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - And like how often do
you see Akira figurines? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Never. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] That's pretty cool.
- For 30 bucks </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's fucking steal I think. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Absolutely. That's very cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh, now it's standing up? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I guess now it's just-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - You got one? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah I got one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This is my last figure. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I of course I wanted to fill this channel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with some degeneracy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Of course.
- Oh what the fuck </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> did you buy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think I know what you've bought. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just the question is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how much was I willing to spend on it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> And (laughing) this figure-- </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - What did you get. What's in the box. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh no I just had a breakdown. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Are you kidding me? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yes! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Rias really? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yes.
- Oh my God. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Do you wanna know how much
I spent on this figure? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't think I wanna hear it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think I walked past it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and I think I remember it
being way over my budget. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - How much? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - This was $170. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Garnt, what the fuck! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Holy Shit.
- That's kinda hot though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - When I saw it I was
like, I've got to get this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Because, you know that
meme when you just like, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> ''How to help me budget this correctly.'' </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> When I was going through the sheet </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like crossing off
figures and Sydney was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just get rid of the fucking
High School DxD figure. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, I'm not getting rid
of the High School DxD figure. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - She stays Sydney, you leave! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - I walked past this figurine in my video. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like I would get this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> if it wasn't $170 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I didn't want to go overboard. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> But the moment I saw it, I'm like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> one of these fuckers is gonna buy it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - That feel when I realized </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that I don't have the
most expensive figure now. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (groans) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Breaks my heart. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> All right, should we see what I got? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - A piece of wing, another wing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] let me put that together. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh this is in two parts. Okay </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - So I was trying to put that together </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> underneath the table. It was pretty hard. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh it's magnetic. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Okay. Yeah, because you have to do this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Yeah. What is this? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> Oh shit. Okay.
- This is two in one figures. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> Is this the dragon from Slime </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It is indeed. And it
comes with more parts? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Holy shit I didn't realize </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that Slime will be representing this much </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> because honestly like I
didn't put too much thoughts </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> into what I was trying to buy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] There we go. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Holy shit this came with so many parts. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm so glad you got Rimuru. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Oh, that's so cool.
- So this was actually-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Wait till we build it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but like this was a two in one figure. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know if that counts
me buying two figures </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I paid one, but it's two figures. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean that's technically one right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - No because they're not actually joined. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They were both sold together. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So I guess how much
I paid for these two. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - 20 bucks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - A little low bro. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I pay 30 bucks for the both of them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Okay wow. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because I originally had a Meruem figure </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and a Rimuru figure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which is 35 bucks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Was it just Rimumu on its own? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No. It was like a bundle. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - With the dragon? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, It was just Rimuru
on its own with Meruem. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then I decided to go against </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that just to go for Meruem so-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well I'm glad that
we don't have a single </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like character that's like overlaps. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah I'm surprised because I thought-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I thought at this point </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> we would at least have like
some dups of some characters </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> but we've miraculously
somehow gotten around that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why is this head not going in? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> What the fuck! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - This wing is not going in either. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But yeah.
- Then he sold me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a faulty thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm joking, he was very nice to me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So is that everything you bought Connor? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, there's way more. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Oh my God.
- Do you wanna </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> try to assemble this while the next? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] Yeah, give those. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Get a look at that poor head. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my God (laughs) look at that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] Oh no man! </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - My figure gone? I spent money on that! </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> But yeah, I thought. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's falling apart.
- I knew none of you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are going to get a Slime figure. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I thought, you know, I'll get it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Cause I thought also it's super blue </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I thought that would
look sick on the podcast. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - So like how much did you
spend on all these figures? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> We'll find out later </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> because this is the store
I spent the most stuff. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I thought because when I
finished going through the store </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I thought that I had at
least bought the most figures </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> in the store </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I saw Joey's whole </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I was like, I got this one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I didn't realize how
many figures you bought. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. You're watching
my next figure then?. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sure. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Oh yes. Let's go. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Rohan Kishibe.
- Kishibe Rohan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 17 bucks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] What? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 17 bucks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] And that face is not bad. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's a damn... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> No that is like one of the
more accurate JoJo figures </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that I've seen. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - For Araki's figure as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. That is a nice figure. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Dude look at that like swaying head. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah dude, look at this boy, 17 bucks. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's a good fucking deal. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I can't get this fucking head on that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - Hold on, give it.
- We can get it to work. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - His head just does not want to come on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I have three more </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_00> So I'm not gonna look at what it is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just going to start unpacking it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God how the fuck do you do this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I know, right? It's so hard. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Okay. Go for it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - We should give it to our producer. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Meilyne to, to put together. Right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Meilyne, would you like to put

<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Oh yes I saw that one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - That was the Levi
one you were eyeing up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Levi, sitting on a couch </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> just doing Levi things
like I just thought-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Like what's he holding? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like a handkerchief. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Oh, okay. Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just Levi's sitting on a couch. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I thought it would look
so like nice on the set </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and also it's best boy Levi, like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] Of course
- Look at it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's a beautiful figure. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. That's actually
really nice like small-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's an expensive figure though. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm not gonna lie. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Really?
- How much was it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> 70 bucks. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Whoa! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> But I had to cause like,
it's Levi sitting down. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean, come on you guys. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - So was that the most expensive figure </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you boy at Astop then? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - At Astop, yes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - But not overall.
- Not overall. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay. I don't think it
matters because there's this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah
- I didn't get to that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I think I've won.
- I got close to that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but you know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> So that's, Levi's sitting on it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just think it's so cute. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know why. It's just that I feel-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I love it when figurines
have like interesting bases. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like it just makes it
seem so much more alive. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I love it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> All right. We're still going with Connor, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> there's more.
- Connor and I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just like giving him
a handjob under the table. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's like it's just, go break it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Next up.
- Boys and boys. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Boy, My God Gendo, Jesus.
- Dude that's cool! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's cool. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - How much do you think this is worth? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I wanna say $15. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Five bucks. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - What! Are you serious? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Did you guys not see this? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - No because like I said the thing about-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Connor] Oh, that is sexy. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah so that's a bundle with that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so that goes next to it.. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, we've got the
whole Slime bundle there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah we do. Oh yeah shit! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - I got this for five bucks. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I thought you never see like, I love it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> when they make figures of
characters that aren't the mains. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Because they're always like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> really rare, they're
normally super expensive </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> but the fact that this was 5 bucks </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I just think that's awesome. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because they were like
1,000,000,000 Asuka figures </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> 1,000,000,000 Rei figures </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh my God. Every single,
like Evangelion like robot. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Is this the last one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It is indeed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Man, you are like-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - I think I might've won the most figures. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think you might have.
- I think he might have. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - You might have won single handedly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> with just this store. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - No I think you've bought
more figures in this store </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> than I have overall. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I think so too. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay don't look. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay I won't look. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I should've gone more ham at Astop. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because I was surprised
with deals at Astop. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - There was deals at Astop. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> Are you ready boys?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - For the last figure, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> let me get these out of the way </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> I feel like they may be having a.... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> This is my last figure. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Ooh, Eren. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - It comes with a little
swords you can put in. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I just thought it was a cool figure. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think it was like 30, 40 bucks. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, you guys wanna
have a look at that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - That was my final figure at Astop. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think I got quite the fucking whole. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think you did.
- You did. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Jesus Christ! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean, I just can't get
over this Rias figurine. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt and Connor laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> That is some, one of the nicest figures. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was eyeing this.
- [Garnt] Isn't it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And I'm just like do
I commit to the podcast </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> or do I just buy this for myself? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, that figure fucked me
over for the rest of the day. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But you know what? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was worth damn it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was worth it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> That was like-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Look now, from now on after this episode </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you get to fucking stare </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> at this beautiful thing in the background </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> every single thing.
- Why are we getting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> demonetized every
episode? We've got this-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Is it because of a Rias' bare </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like dump truck ass right here. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Jesus Christ.
Demonetization, what was that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - So with that giant whole ass away... </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> My God! </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> So let's go with the third-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Wait, how much did you spend at Astop? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean spent less than $100 at Astop. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> My most expensive thing was
the Jump thing right here </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which was 50 bucks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's cool a shit though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] It is cool a shit. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I spent 220 bucks. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh my God, shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I need to check how much exactly I spent-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because one of the challenges
was whoever spends the most </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> at a single store gets a point. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - What was... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Actually, we can figure
that out ourselves. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I also spent 220 bucks at Astop. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh! </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's going to go down
to the tiny numerals next. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> But the third store we
went to was K-Books. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> K-Books, much like a lot of stores </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the large of Kaikan building. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They sell figurines </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but they also sell a
bunch of like other merch </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like figurines, plushies,
just little knickknacks </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and stuff like that so. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] I don't remember... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh no I do remember exactly what I bought. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I bought two things. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay. So let's talk
about strategy first. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So what was your guys'
strategy going into K-Books </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is the point where
I started considering </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how much money I have left. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Like Astop it was like spend spend. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because I felt like I was
too behind at Animate. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So I went ham in Astop </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> and then this is when I was like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> okay maybe I should start
like being careful when I buy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh no, I was the complete opposite. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> At this point I had more
than half of my budget left. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Garnt] Oh my God
- Oh shit I get. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - So I was going to go like
big bucks boy on K-Books </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> and the final Amiami store. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So what did you buy? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - So I got two. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So one of my challenges </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was to get an Astolfo figurine. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know why super specificly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but luckily I found one Astolfo figurine. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Didn't even come in box. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - This motherfucker.
- Oh Goddamnit! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Because what happened right? Was-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - There was two. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He just hit the one that you didn't find. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because we were walking past it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I saw the Astolfo figure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and I was just like putting
loads of other figures </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on top of that.
(laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I was like, Connor, look at this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> and I didn't see the second one so. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah there was another
one like right near it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So I like waited ahead </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I watched him as
he was going through it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and he actually found another one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But the one that you
buried, he didn't find. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I didn't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> This is the only one I've
found and I'm like, thank God. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh dammnit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because he always got
me with that conspiracy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But then the second one I got... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh the second challenge was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> to find a Cardcaptor Sukara figurine. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Unfortunately I couldn't find one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I know that if I went to K-Books </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like six months ago, like the new Sukara </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> was still like hot and
fresh in everyone's minds. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I knew I would have found one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but, so I gave up on that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> So instead I spent big boy dollars </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and got this really cool
Yuojo Senki figurine. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Garnt] That's so cool. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, I'm not a huge
fan of Tanya personally </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but this is a fucking cool figurine. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's an awesome figurine.
- How much was that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> This was $132. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Ooh okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - With an interchangeable head though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Great! Can't wait to
change the heads every day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Every episode we changing the head. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh my God. Don't say that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> we'll have to do it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - We're gonna have to come here. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But that's pretty much the
only two things I bought. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. Because at this point </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I was just trying to stay alive. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Astop really fucked me over. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh way yeah, because
spent how much at Astop </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And then you also spent
a shit ton at Animate. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. So I think I budgeted it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, I think I could
only spend around 70 bucks </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or something or maybe less in each store. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I had to complete the challenges. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So the first challenge </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> was just getting a figure
from a Shonen series. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Another Mike I can't take it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I mean, I already knew
I'd lost at this point. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> So I didn't really... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> But what surprised me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I wasn't really
familiar with a K-Books </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so I didn't know what kind
of merchandise they had. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They did not have a lot of Shonen figures. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - No
- That's all. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right? It was between
this one and a Luffy one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I just went for the cheapest
one because I needed to-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You wanted the challenge done. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I wanted the challenge done. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Second thing was to buy
something Lewd, all right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - That was not difficult </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as there was a gigantic hentai section. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> There were like like Hanbok like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I think like half of the
store was just like 18 plus. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - So I'm like, this is big Rei mode. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> What lewd thing can I buy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that's really cheap and
can keep me on budget. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> So I brought Dojuinshi. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh who did you get? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh my God.
- Jean Outta </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - Of course. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I just like I was more focused </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on finding a cover which
wouldn't get us easily like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which just wouldn't
get this video off the, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> what am I talking about? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Demonetized or age restricted. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's big brain YouTuber boy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. But I did buy one more. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - But I just checked it
before we started recording. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't think I can share it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Maybe you can just show a blured picture </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> and we can all get a reaction to it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay.
- Yeah. maybe mood on, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just put like a huge black screen </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> over whatever Garnt brings out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> So I bought a Dakimakura. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - A what?
- Wow, where are we gonna </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> put that? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - I thought we could just
hang it up on the wall. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> That was like the intent. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> We're not going to be able to use this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because I was like I
need to buy a Dakimakura. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - ''I need to buy a Dakimakura!'' </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yes I do. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right. What did you get? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So I bought the
cheapest one I could find. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> And like it was in the
section there weren't many </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like the Dakimakuras weren't all lewd. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> You know, there was some lewds, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> there was some one </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> and they were all like covered up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Where are you going with this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So I couldn't tell how Lewd </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> the Dakimakuras were I just
chose the cheapest one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh Jesus.
- Oh wow. Oh no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - We're not going to be able to use this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Black all of that out. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - They sell that?
- Yes. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - This wasn't, this wasn't
even in the hentai section. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay. Can I ask? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Because he got the cheapest one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> How much was that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 40 bucks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - What! 40 bucks
- That's the cheapest one? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah that's the cheapest one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> Right I bought Like a sens one at home </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that was Akatena. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Don't ask me why. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> So my two challenges were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> buy JoJo figure and do the pose. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was really lucky </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that there was any one JoJo figure </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which I'll show you shortly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The other one was Buy a Wall Scroll. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> Now there was a bunch
of cheap wall scrolls </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like 400, 500 </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but I thought I should
probably get one from a show </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that I actually like liked. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> So I spent 10 bucks on Katanagatari. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Oh, hell yeah.
- My God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I love, Katanagatari is
one of my favorite shows. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] It's so good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's totally underrated, not underrated. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So many people haven't seen it as well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Everyone who has seen the
show says it's fucking amazing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah it is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - And if you haven't seen it, it's like-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's Nishio Ishin of
course it's gonna be good. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like a Quentin Tarantino anime </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel like it's so fucking good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - People who haven't seen it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> are just like, which season
of Monogatari is this? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laugh heartedly) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's nothing to do with
the Monogatari series. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's amazing. Please watch it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And I mean she's Waifu material. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah definitely. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - So that was 10 bucks I mean. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah that's bringing me
back memories up constantly </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I know when I've been </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to this show.
- Makes me wanna </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> watch it again. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know where
we're going to put this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'll just put right it here. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Also I got a JoJo figure. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Of course. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Which one though?
- Which one? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Because I remember </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> when you got the challenge and you were </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like, buy a JoJo figure. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was like, this motherfucker. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You got so lucky with the challenges. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I did.
- The only reason </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> why you got four points </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is because all of them
was so easy for you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Except okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And the last door, we
shall talk about that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That was a little annoying somehow. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> But yeah, so I got the Giorno
Giovanna Golden Experience. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Ooh! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's actually like it's, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay I'm not gonna lie, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> His face doesn't look
like 10 out of 10 on it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but that's what you get with JoJo figures. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> But at least we got another JoJo figure. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh nice. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> So I'm the one who did all the hard work. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - So what's that, three now? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> It's Rohan, Giorno and Diamond. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - This was 66 bucks though. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And that's like-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Can I see that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. And to be honest with you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> 66 bucks is kind of like cheap
for JoJo figure normally. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - The more I look at this face </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> the more hilarious it gets. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just like look into his face. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's kinda how I would say.
- It' kinda funny. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - We'll take a picture of this
and show it on the podcast. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's not how I would
describe as manga accurate </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> but it's, I mean, more like Kendall, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but whatever I'm not gonna (indistinct). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> That's all I bought at K-Books. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> I was just doing my challenges. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay so we each bought two things each? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh no, I bought three. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, I was just like-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just wanted to get my challenges done. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I got my challenges done </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was like I'm just on the mission </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> to demonetize this channel. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That was my mission. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Don't worry you will do that naturally. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was worrying because
like I went into K-Books </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I mean I was thinking like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm gonna buy a $200 figure. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - K-Books quickly ruined that plan </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> because of the challenges. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I spent 77 bucks on just my challenge. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then obviously I
realized when I got to Amiami </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> which we're gonna do right now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I had challenges that I had to do as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So we should talk about Amiami. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Okay, so let's talk about Amiami. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So for me, Amiami was just,
I was just trying to survive. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was, I think I figured out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I had like I think $60 or $50. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - 60 bucks left?
- [Joey] What! </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I was just, at this point, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> just praying and hoping. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - But you wasted fucking
$40 on a fucking pillowcase. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Like why would you do that? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Don't judge me, okay? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It wasn't even a part of the challenge. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I know. I just wanted
a Dakimakura, okay? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - It's just like a guy </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> who like gambles all this money away </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and says I just don't understand </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> why I got the money all
the time, man. It sucks </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well because like, I knew this would be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> my only opportunity to buy a Dakimakura. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Of course.
- Why did you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> want to buy one so badly? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because he's fucking part
of Trash Taste, that's why. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Look it's called Trash
Taste for a reason. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Fine. All right. Sue me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We had a lot of blank space </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in the background where
we could hang one up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I was like, Dakimakura? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I think that's a good purchase. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And now I bought one wasted $40. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Can't even use it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> Fucking brilliant. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - We can't even hang it up. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just going to be a
black box in the video. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've got one at my house. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I've got a pillow. The
Dakimakura pillow so. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, I've got one of
Shoujo hanging on me wall so. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> But with me, for Amiami </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> this is where I spent
the most amount of money </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I had almost like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think I had like 2/3
of my budget still left </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I knew I'd been
into Amiami before, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> not the one in Kaikan that we went to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but there's another one
in Akihabara as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And you can spend a
lot of money in there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah I spent a lot of money there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I know they have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> some really expensive figurines, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but they have a huge selection as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I knew I was going to find
something hopefully good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean that's before this Rias
showed up and ruin my plans </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but my two challenges I believe was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> by a plushie, a character plushie. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And the other one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't remember what it was. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> But I got a plushie. I
actually got two plushies. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] Okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because I needed to, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> spend my money and get
close to $500 as possible. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - So I got Moogle and Chocobo. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay.
- Because I love Final Fantasy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and Final Fantasy Seven
remake recently just came out </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I love the fuck out of it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] That's cute as fuck. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah so give out JLPG some love as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I got that and the
most expensive figurine </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that I got overall. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh more expensive than anyone? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - This is the most expensive overall. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Did you buy this
purposely to like finish-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I bought this purposely to get as close </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> to $500 as possible. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - So this was not part of the challenge. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I got a Tokisaki Kurumi from Date A Live. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Oh nice.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean again, this is kind
of going to be like Rias </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> in the sense that like,
possibly demonetize. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh that's hot. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - But I know Tokisaki figurines </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> can for some reason, so expensive. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean she's a really popular
Date A Live character. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - How much was it then?
- This was $141. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Not as expensive as the Rias, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've already lost that challenge but. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I may have overheard or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> saw Joey when he was buying that one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I thought all I gotta do is beat 1300. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I literally just went over 1300 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> on a more expensive figure
which I'll reveal soon. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay. Because, was that
everything you bought? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - And that's everything I bought. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay. Because for me, Amiami
was a stressful experience. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Not because of the store itself. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The store itself is great, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but because I saw my challenges, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which was one, find an
Evangelion figurine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That was a lot harder </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> than I initially gave it credit for. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Really? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. Because I missed
the entire figure section </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right at the back. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I was just walking around </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and there was one figure
I found which was $200. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No, actually no way that
I could buy that figure. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I found another
figure, which was 50 bucks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No, 50 to 70 bucks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But that was the tiny
little budget that I had. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - You really fucked yourself. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Yeah. I really fucked myself. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - You hate to see it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> This girl me fucked so badly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Hey, I mean, she's a succubus. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> ( laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What can you say? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But luckily I found an Asuka pop figure. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh no! Why did you do a pop figure? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No! Why God. Why would
you buy a pop figure man. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because it was the cheapest okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think this is going to be awarded </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for the most normy. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> This thing right here. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> No offense, if you like pop vinyls </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but we-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - No offense. If you do like Pop vinyls. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Like we say, no offense. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> They're fucking ugly dude. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I thought they'd be nice. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I fucking hate pop figures. Oh Jesus. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> How much did you spend on this? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 14 bucks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay not bad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know what it's like? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, you come to Japan, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> You have all these amazing figures. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- You go for fucking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> pop figures. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like going into like
Germany an being like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I want hotdogs, from the can please. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I want not none of that stuff. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like going to
Germany and being like, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> can I have an Asahi? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. It's like, what the fuck? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - No fine. I-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - All right... I'll give
it for the challenge. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> It was for the challenge,
because there're like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> like this Amiami had
a lot of good figures. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That I really, really wanted to buy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I just needed to go for the cheapest one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then the second one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which I had no idea how to complete was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> buy a furry and like
100% non-humanoid figure. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And I was like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the only thing I could
fkn think of was Chopper </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> from One Piece. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Did not have any Chopper figures. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> So I was like I've probably lost this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I was like, wait a minute. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> There's there's probably
one thing I could twist </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and that's Eevee figure. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, that counts. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I was like, okay if I
can't go the chopper route </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> maybe I can go to the Pokemon route. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - How the are fuck have they
spelled Eevee on this box? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - [Joey] EIEVUI. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - What's with that? Why do
they spell it like that? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - I don't know because I guess </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that's how they pronounce it in Japanese </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> But I don't think they realize </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> that there's a way easy spelling of Eevee </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay that's cute. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay you know, that counts. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Because when you pulled that out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I thought you were going
to get one of these. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, because I didn't think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> those kinda does a figure, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> But I'm like Eevee's furry
is non-humanoid figure. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Shut the fuck up I am getting that point. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No okay that counts. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because there was between like Eevee </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and Miu too and I was like Eevee's cute. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> So yeah what were the
challenges that you had Connor? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - I had, buy three anime mugs or glasses </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> We painfully asked </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> because they were no sets or anything. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was like they were all
like pretty expensive as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh you had to buy them separately. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah , and then it was also </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> buy a figure that you think is trash. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - So wait, how much budget did
you have left at this point? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - 140 something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, so you like balanced
it out pretty well </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> between the four stores? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah because I basically
spent nothing at Animate </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I spent 70 bucks at K-Books. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> So I kind of like did pretty
good at budgeting by accident. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I hadn't planned anything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think not having challenges </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> that fuck me over was helpful. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah that was definitely helpful. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - The figure that I thought it was trash </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> was just this shitty Sunrio one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I thought you were gonna
go like ironic trash, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, it was like 220 Yen as well </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which might be the
cheapest figure as well. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's is probably the cheapest figure. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - I just... </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> Who the is the Sanrio character. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Does anyone know it?
- Oh I think I know it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know it? I know like the. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Pochacco </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - I know Tamagu one, the egg one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> - I love Tamagu. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> - Gudetama? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And obviously Hello Kitty </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I don't know. What
the fuck. Okay, whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And the funny mugs I bought from, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know where they're from. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Do you wanna open them, I guess? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sure. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That was 100 Yen luckily </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But every other mug was like 1,000 Yen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I managed to find two for 600 Yen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> So we have more mugs now
for the podcast I guess. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> We'll drink from those possibly </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> maybe never I don't know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - These are like tightly packed </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There's the mugs. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> So I did the challenges. Cool. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then I was like so annoyed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> because the there was a Froppy figure. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> The one with like the
cool comic book text. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I sold that one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I had just enough budget to get that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if it wasn't for this shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> So I had to completely change my mind. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not saying this stuff is bad </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it ruined my plan, just saying. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> So I had to go with a different... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean ,I guess you get
what you pay for, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's all I'm gonna say like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was 100 Yen for a reason you know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What series is this? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't fucking know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I have no idea. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh no, it's all characters on the back </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which I didn't see. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then these are from some Otome game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah they look like Otome games </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't watch or play any Otome games. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I know they're huge here in Japan but. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean for a female demographic </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I would just prefer Yaoi. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Just straight up Yaoi. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Don't like try and-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - If you had come out with a Yaoi like mug </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think you would have one like coolest. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs)
- Maybe. The final figure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and most expensive figure that I bought. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right, oh C.C? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh C2! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - C.C, C2, whatever. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Same thing, 2C. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> It's her like on the like pedestal. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] That's cool. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's a dump truck I've ever seen. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - Ooh.
- That's an ass. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - That's who you see in the figure. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I should get it out </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> so you guys can fully
appreciate this figure </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> but yes that was--
- How much was that? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - That was 130 bucks,
honestly worth every penny </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I guess while they're
opening these figurines up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I guess I just want to ask you guys, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like how was the challenge like overall? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Like do you have a good feeling? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I have more stuff by the way. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, you have more stuff. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I have more stuff.
- Okay. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which is probably... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you want to open this while I. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay.
- We should also </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> preface as well that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there is like consequences
for the final scores </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and everything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Basically, whoever has the
lowest score at the end </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like including the points that we got </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in our individual videos </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as well as the points
that we're going to add up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at the end of this episode </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> has to do some kind of punishment </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in a traditional really
sadistic Japanese way. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We're basically gonna
be consuming something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that we personally don't
really want to consume </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with these two because
they're absolute pussies. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They're going to have to
eat one packet of nokdu </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which is like Japanese fermented soybeans. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's disgusting. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I love it.
- It smells horrible, okay? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I love it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Thank you very much I grew up with it. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> So obviously I'm not going
to eat that if I lose. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm gonna have to eat the spicy noodles </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that I ate in my JoJo quiz video </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which you can go check out on my channel. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah. But we're going to find that out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> at the end of the episode </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> once we've calculated all the scores </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I guess in the meantime as well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> let us know down in the
comments below so far, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> what is the favorite
figurine that you sourced. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's my one I know it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Most likely it's going to be this one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm like so happy I bought that now </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> because I bought it on
pure instinct, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I wasn't trying to win the game. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I didn't have any strategy in mind. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - You were horny on maine </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I was just horny on maine </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I just wanted everyone to see it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I love as well </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> how the base is like buried </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so you can like walk up at it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Damn! That's a good figure. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Damn that is a beautiful. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Ooh, look at that butt dude. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Look at that competition man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just saying so
- Who has the bigger </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> dump truck. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Now I know Garnt </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is gonna shit himself now </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> but the rest of my purchases </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> were to get that even 500 bucks. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - So I just bought like a fucking. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't even know what this is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What is that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> It goes on a doorknob
I think, or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't really know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like an arrow-man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Let me open this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - A towel of some. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Of Ani Tore. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was 100 Yen. A towel. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - What is this show? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's the POV anime </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> where like the cute girls like workout. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah oh shit. I remember. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's so bad. I love it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I got some scroll from some shirts. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Wow, you've really like
weighed like cold stuff overall. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Did someone have like a challenge </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> where you have to buy a wall scroll? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was from a different... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Trading cards for 210 Yen. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like what trading cards? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - What is this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh, wait, you can put something in here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's probably for like tickets maybe, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> something like that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Train tickets, maybe concert tickets. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> It's you know, if you want like to know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> who is a weaboo you just put this on them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like a tracking, you know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's everything that I bought </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and it came out to an even 500 exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh, are you serious? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Bang on 500. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh fuck! </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - I did this footage in my video </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which you guys should see. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I went to the cashier
and I went 10 Yen over. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> So I asked the guy, I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no take all this stuff out </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm going back. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ( Joey and Garnt laugh) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And they were all so confused </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they were like, ''what's
he trying to say?'' </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like, get rid of the
stuff I got to go back. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> So I went and found exactly what it was. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Did the math on the spot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> went through my camera footage </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to find out what I spent at each store. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Until exactly 500 bucks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I was like, I don't think there's anyone </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> that's going to get close
to $500, like at all. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I was like if I can get
as close as I can to 500 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then I think I probably won. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> So I think my overall
price came to 49,840 Yen. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So I was 160 Yen off. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Wow. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because for me, I was, after Astop </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> I had just stopped
calculating stuff and that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughs)
- You had given up. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Like I was like, I'm
probably going to go bust. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm probably going to go bust
and lose the entire thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But no, mine actually
came out to 47,152 Yen. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh, we all got really close. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Which is like $470. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's how... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We should probably explain </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> that we are calculating it by dollars </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> by just dividing by 100 from the--. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, because that's roughly what it is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- So I guess </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> for the first challenge of
can get closest to $500, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> those two points are
going to go to Connor. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Hell yes, that means
I'm in the lead now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Holy fuck those two points. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Damn I was so confident that I was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I thought like old both of you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> were get to get like kind of what I got </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> so I'm like, no dude, I'm 160 Yen away. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I got this. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Joey seemed so confident
when we were filming </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that I thought he must have done </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> the exact same thing as
me and got like exact. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] No! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No because this fucker, he was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I thought he'd planned everything, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Same . </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I talked to him off screen-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - He turned up smiling and everything. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I'm like, he's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I got my strategy for each store </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm like, I have got none. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I did not. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - No, I was just bluffing you guys. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Obviously like a good game of poker </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> You've gotta be overconfident. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Whatever, you bluffed me
into being exact with my money. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I wouldn't have done that if I didn't know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that you might've been exact. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Goddammnit! Because I didn't think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you were going to like
buy all this small shit </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> to like get exact. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I wanted to get those two points. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't want to eat fucking nokdu Joey. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Nor do I. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, well then, that was huge. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> So let's go over the next
couple of challenges. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I think there's 10 left. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- 10 left. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So the second one is
the most expensive figure. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Obviously that goes to Garnt </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> and this does all that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That was 160? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - 16700 Yen. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Wow so 170 bucks basically. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And yours was 140? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Mine was 141. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - And the mine was 137. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So Garnt gets to the
point for that I guess. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Next one is the cheapest figurine </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I got that 220 Yen figure. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah.
- Did anyone beat that? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - No mine was Puck, which is 980. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Ooh. Mine was, I think I
can't even fucking remember. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> It was 1,000 bucks, I noted it down. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - 1,000 bucks! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, it was 1,000 Yen. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So even even if I didn't buy that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I still had the Evangelion. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah you still would have won with-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - So yeah, you still would have won </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> even if it was anime figure.
- So, okay, damn, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel pretty good right now, all right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay.The lowest rated series on MAL </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, you wanna go first?
- Which one is yours. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What's my number? It
was like Otome brave </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> which I think is that Mug </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it was like 2,375. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh damn!
- Okay what's yours. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Mine was (laughs), Rias. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Really! That's the lowest? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Oh my God
- Yeah, it was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> 1,744 on MAL. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay. Well, give me the point </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because mine wasn't
Berserk, which is 5,687. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No way, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because it's the anime not the manga. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Hell yeah. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - What the hell. Goddamn.
- It's the garbage anime </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> not the manga. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm sure if I looked at
what that fucking towel was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> the scores might be a little different. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't fucking know what it is. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> So I guess that's not fair. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Point to me baby. Let's go. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. So the next was </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> the most figures bought. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - In one store. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - No overall. Did we do store and? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - No we just did overall. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay, well, I only bought seven. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I have 14. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - 10. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, I think you bought
some more figures in Astop. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I filled up the thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and I bought everything
that I filled up in those-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You bought more figurines at Astop </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> than I did overall. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I'm not gonna lie, right
you have a good selection </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I think my selection is
pretty fucking strong as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh yeah, no, all three of our selections </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> are really strong </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- I don't know about Garnt. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean this figure is great but the rest. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Look at, his selection is strong? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Get out of here Garnt. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay, next one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Most spent on one series. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> All of mine were separate </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> so I'm just going to go off the base </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that this is(masked over by Connor) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - I totally forgot about this one. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wait, what could it be?
- It's probably JoJo, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wait it could have been JoJo </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but it wouldn't have been... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I spent a lot on like
Attack on Titan and JoJo </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but I didn't get anything
near 160 overall. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - She's just solo carrying
these challenges for me now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - What was the thing, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Is that we may challenges
that we'll reward you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> for being frugal with your money </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and buying little things </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but also would reward you if you bought, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> if you did the gamble
that paid off the most, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, that's the gamble. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because you had to guess, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because I was thinking in my head, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> would Joey buy a $200 figure? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> I think he could.
- I was going to. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I thought both of you couldn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and I was like, maybe I should just give </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> up on that challenge, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And just focus on everything else. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Fuck.
- Yeah because like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when I saw her, I was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just want to buy her </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because she was like a
really unique figure. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I saw tits and I thought I'd just. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I saw titties and I didn't think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and before I knew it I was
writing down the number. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - His wife was right there as well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but it didn't matter. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It was funny because out
of every figure I bought </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> this one was the one that I
didn't think about the most. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was like, I'm getting this figure. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm not even going to think about it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] My god. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> The most spent on a non-figure. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh for me it would be </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I guess the squashy, which is 2,800 Yen. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Mine was 1,100. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay. Mine was a Dakimakura. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Shit he spent 40 bucks on it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> I guess it paid off.
- [Joey] Fuck! </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - If being at degenerates
fucking saved me in this game </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm so fucking happy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Goddamnit.
- Okay. All right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> What's the next. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Next one is most spent in one store. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay how much did you
spend exactly in Astop. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I spent $197. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - What did you spend? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - 22,380 Yen. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Fuck I spent 22,190. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh, come on. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay. Here we go. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Closest to 69 (laughs) closest to $69. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This was the meme one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I don't know at all about this one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> For me it was the Shonen Jump thing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> which was 4,980 Yen. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay. Mine was mine
was the Edward Elric one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah
- Which was 5,299. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - All right, I win $66 baby. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> on the Giorno Giovanna one funny enough. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh shit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - So the one that I had no choice to buy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> got me another point so, sweet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh my God I'm gonna fucking lose. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay, normy awards </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> so whoever has my highest
rank on Mal loses the point. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think I lose this, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - What did you get? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Attack on Titan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Is that higher than Fullmetal Alchemist. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Attack on Titan is number two I think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> if I looked correctly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Ooh I thought I lost. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Number one is Death Note. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay I'm definitely saved </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> because mine was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> the Monogatari which is 56
- Yeah, most popular </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> according to myanime list </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> is Death Note, Shingeki
no Kyojin SoldaT online </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then Fullmetal Alchemist by the way. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - How did I not lose that one. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> Because I saw by boy Levi. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Where is he? ,.Where is it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Look at how beautiful he
is, okay, I could not. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God.
- So I lose a point. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> So Connor loses a point. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - Okay. Final one, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> buying a hentai figure. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Okay, So I-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean that's zero points for me, baby. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm gonna argue this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay here's why. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I didn't realize this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> but you can replace Rias's
tits to be uncensored. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Are you serious? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. I didn't know what that was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> until I opened it up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Those are just nipples. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I didn't know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> they came with interchangeable nipples. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my God. Wait, how
do you take those off? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> It's not the thing that--
- We're going to find that out </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> after the, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - So I think
- Oh, so they're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> attached to the head. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean I would like to argue </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that you bind the
Dakimakura already counts </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> as like a hentai thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - But that wasn't a figure </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> but I think that uncensored nipples </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> counts as a hentai figure
because we can't show it-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh, but is it though? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Cause it's High School DxD. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's not technically hentai. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - If there's tits out though
is it a hentai figure. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> - I mean, I would like to argue that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> if it's something we
can't show on this podcast </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> then I think it counts.
- Of which I have two now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah exactly fucking degenerate grading. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Then I think I get a point. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, we'll give Garnt the point </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This isn't a hentai figure so. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No that's just a cultural figure. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Man I'm so fucking glad
I bought this figure now. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Dude, this single figurine
clutched you the victory like. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Oh my God. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Okay. And the total scores were </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Connor with 12 points,
Garnt with 12 points </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and I got seven points. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - I would have won this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if I didn't buy the Attack
on Titan figures by the way. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I would have won this
if I was actually smart. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I probably would have lost this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> if I didn't buy this one single figure. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - So it was also your downfall </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> but it also got you all
the points in all this. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - It got you more positives
than negatives this thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because, God, when we were like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> going through all these challenges </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because we had completely
forgotten the overall challenges </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I was like, wait a minute. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think this one figure could
be a lot of these challenges. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I totally forgot we put
hentai figure in there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I would have bought a
shitty one if I remembered </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because like, it would
have been hard because-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's not many hentai figures. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No ,because all of the hentai figures </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> were like 100s of dollars. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> They're very expensive.
- Yeah they normally are, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> it's a very cultured island-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - I just like to point out </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that over all of these
like overall challenges </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I only got a 1 point. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - You hate to see it.
- And that was the fact </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> that Puck is the lowest
rated out of everything here. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I think the thing is, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Is that he went all out with that, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I was a bit more conservative, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> spread my money out you know. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And then you kind of. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> - I just bought shit that I like. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - You went mid-range. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> You were like I'll keep buying
kind of expensive things </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> but not really. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was just like, I like this shit, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I'll just buy it. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is what happens </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when you try to strategize and just. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughs). </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - I will at least like the credit </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> of probably getting the coolest one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] No.
- That's cool. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] You can have that point Joey. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. I'll have that point.
- You can have that fake point </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm still not going to win. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll take the pity points, fuck you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I fucking love this figure. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This is such a nice figure, holy shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well, since I lost I guess </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I have to eat a horrible thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I think our producer
Meilyne brought something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> which I am not looking forward to eating. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well that already. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can't even smell it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I can picture what it smells like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Meilyne] I've opened it.
- Thank you Meilyne </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> our amazing producer. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - All right. Well my
challenge has arrived. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Hey, it's Tai. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So what is this? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's pickled mud fish. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - So apparently according to our producer </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this smells awful-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - And apparently is just as bad </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if not worse than a surstromming </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> which is like pickled </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think it's like merkel or something. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like Swedish thing
that all YouTubers eat. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay. Do you want, you wanna open it up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and give it a smell there Joey? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, I'll give it a sniff. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - What's it kinda like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh my God I just saw
that man go to heaven. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I saw that man go to heaven. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That smells like actual like poop. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - You went to heaven there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Smell it.
- I can smell it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> from here man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Smell it, like put his nose in it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (grunts) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh what the fuck. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - This looks really bad. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] It looks and smells poop. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like vomit, bro. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You're not going to be
able to beat that down. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I've smelled this before. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Of course you have, it's Tai </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh jeez it's fucking
stinking up the office. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Fucking eat it quick </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay. I mean we have no utensils </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> so I'm just gonna have to get in there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Can you eat that?
- I think I've eaten that. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh my God.
- You have eaten it? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. It's like really
salted fish, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> So it's going to be super salty. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh God, what the fuck! </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm just going to
grab like a piece of it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if you don't mind. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh my God, wait, just
show it on camera show. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Show that piece on camera. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Garnt are we gonna sensor that? </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> Like Jesus! </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> It's smells from here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Garnt] Yeah. Careful with the bugs. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> - Is that enough? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Just don't get on the microphone please. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Bon a petite. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (soft electric music) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] How is it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> - Tastes like I'm eating dirt. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Oh God that's (grunts) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> That's so salty. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's just salted fish, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's so salty. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I don't know why I'm leaking my fingers. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing heartedly) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Ooh, get me some more of that. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Get this man some water. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Oh,it's getting worse. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because what kills you
is the fucking after taste. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The first few bites aren't that bad </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but the more you chew it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> the more like the flavors come out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then the after taste just it hits you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and your breath is gonna
stink for like a fucking week. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I got it down. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> - All right. Well done. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh my God this fucking stinks now like-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Hey guys. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> How are you. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> - You should wash it down with the durian. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think that would be a good idea. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> The thing is you did lose
pretty badly on this thing. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh I can still smell it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Maybe your durian will help. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> (Joey coughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do you wanna smell my finger? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> - No. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> (laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Sticky fingers. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh stinky fingers more like it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Oh Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - Stinky oh oh. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my God, it's actually getting worse. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh that smells viral. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can still smell it what the fuck. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't think, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like I have eaten a lot
of weird foods in my life. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This is easily the grossest
thing I've ever had. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel sorry for you Joey. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you smell it over there? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh Jesus it's concentrated </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like a fucking-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think the smell is getting stronger. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah we're in the fallout zone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> here like, my God! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like a nuclear blast. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm like fine if I hold my nose </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because like, I don't like smell the thing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> but the moment I get it out, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> oh, I could smell my own breath </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's fucking viral. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Next time next week
when we do the podcast </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Joey we'll still be smelling it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Well I really just hope </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this doesn't give me like an illness </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> because we're like going
on a trip tomorrow. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Offending all Tai people right now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> I mean like I hope I don't
get like food poisoning </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_00> because like, we're going
on a vacation tomorrow. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah
- And I don't want to be sick. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Oh God, this mic is gonna fucking stink </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm sorry.
- It's awful. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - We're gonna have to
like spray this mic here. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - We can open the windows </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> when we finish this episode, like Jesus. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey exhales deeply) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So now that the challenge is over </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what are you guys' closing thoughts? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm glad I didn't literal eat shit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughs heartedly) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I mean, you know, the ultimate goal was; </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to one, not lose and become like this man </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> who's going through like
the five stages of grief </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> with his face. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm definitely at the last stage. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah, we got to decorate the office. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think by a miracle </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> we got like some pretty good variation. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like I honestly would love </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to do something like this again in future </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> with another challenge where
we can each go and film </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> our own parts-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I'm surprised that out of
all the things that we bought </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> not a single person bought the same thing. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. Because that was the thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I was most worried about, right? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> When I, you know, pitched the challenge </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> the thing I was worried about was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> what if we all just go for
the same fucking figures. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - 10 Dekus, I would like
three of your finest Dekus. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because yeah, I had a lot of fun </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> filming in the stores </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I would love to do
something like this again. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know if you guys
enjoyed seeing the aftermath </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> of all our different individual challenges </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and how we like approached
it and everything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, I mean, I think it's street rolls. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I think we had fun with
every step of this process. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> So I really hope that was
reflected in the video. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I got to ask you though? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Because this is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> your first time doing like a video filming </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in public you know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay.
- I'm used </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to embarrassing myself in public. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like how was it? I got to know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was hard. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> It was so hard. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - [Joey] We saw you
struggling at the beginning. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Like I was out of Animate
when I was filming my intro. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't even know if you're gonna see that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> because I'm I'm thinking about filming </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a separate intro anyway. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I was just like
tripping over my words. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I had no idea. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Like give me a script, great. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I can read off the script. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If I just have to talk </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> about my thoughts without any scripts. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And like, a podcast is
different in my mind </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I have people to bounce off. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Because when I'm looking at a camera </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm like, Hey guys, there, I'm
here outside of an Animate, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> and I'm like, Oh shit man. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's like someone
trying to speak English </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> for the first time. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> (laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - It's definitely a
skill you learn I think. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah I mean I was awkward as fuck </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I remember the first time I filmed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> And I hated it. Yeah. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - But I think I got used to it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when I just, hit Astop. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> Animates, I was still like
getting my feet on the ground. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> With Astop I was just, I think it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> thanks to just the place as well </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I wasn't thinking about
what challenges there were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I was just thinking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about getting as many
fucking figures as I could. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I did, I got a lot. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah you certainly fulfilled that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah it was a lot of fun </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I think as well like a great environment </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> like when you get permission
to film in a place </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you just go wild.
- Yeah absolutely </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> because the original plan for this video </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was just to like MacGyver our way through. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Go pro or underover. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Under the chin guards. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - That would have not been that great. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. But I mean, I
haven't edited the video yet </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I think it's going to
be pretty entertaining. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> And you guys can let us know as well </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like, how you guys found those videos </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> how you found this episode. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Hopefully you guys enjoyed </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> watching me eat literal shit on camera. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> This is easily the worst
fucking thing I've ever had. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can still fucking taste it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I really want you guys to smell my finger. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, I'm not smelling your finger Joey </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Please.
- No! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> - Can you do it at least for the podcast. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> - No. Come on, I smelled that shit. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Get that shit away from me! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (exhales loudly) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, I definitely </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> even though this was it like a
logistical nightmare planning </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> speaking about logistics from episode one, </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> this was like an actual
logistical nightmare planning </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> all day. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So we had to like bounce stores </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it was short notice and everything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, I would definitely
be up for doing something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where it's like three angles again </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's a challenge that
we conclude on the podcast. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Because like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm not sure if you've seen the video </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but by the time we got to Amiami </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was exhausted. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> Like, it was kind of like that feeling </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> when you've just spent an
entire day at a con working </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> and you're like I've got
to do one more panel. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was just a con in general. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And fuck it, Oh we've
got to have dinner? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh shit I wanna sleep. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Like I remember post-filming </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I just went home and collapsed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, same. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I didn't leave my bed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think we walked like
10 kilometers that day. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I checked my like, stamps. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Typical Tokyo day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - True. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You've done a lot of walking
when you come to Japan? </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah but I think-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Okay, so what was the favorite
thing you guys bought then? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's a good question. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Easy for you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Instinctively I want
to say like, I mean yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's a good fucking figure. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's a solid figure </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I think the most interesting figure </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and like coolest one
that I'm glad I bought </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> was maybe the Akira one. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which I thought was just so fun, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> or the Levi one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Mike Wazowski though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> (laughs) </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> That's such a good figure. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like all ironicly that's a good figure. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's fucking good figure.
- Yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - And also the 500, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've forgot the name of the
character for Shinley's dad. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Gendo </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Gendo figure, fine yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's a good deal. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think my favorite
was definitely the Jump. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh that's so sick. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Because it's so unique.
- I love unique figures </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because they have so many
figures that look alike. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - And who doesn't like Jump. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Exactly.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - That it's just going to look good. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay what's the worst figure you think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> each of us bought. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The worst figure? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> - Yeah. I'm gonna have to agree. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> - This thing, what the hell? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> (joey laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - I don't know actually, </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I liked all the figurines I bought. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Maybe that's why it lost. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> (laughs) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - What's the worst figurine
you think I bought? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - The worst one you bought? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I mean, you bought so
many I can't remember. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - That's pretty bad.
- It's probably that one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - You've not gotten the monogatari one. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> That's kinda-- </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Excuse you. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> That's kinda Trash Taste if I do say so. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you want to smell my finger. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughing heartedly) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> - Smell my finger. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I have a registered weapon now right here. </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah and there's not much to say really. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel like we've </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> adequately roasted each other's purchases. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - And I guess I wanted to give a shout out </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> to all the stores we visited. </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> - Because, okay, so disclaimer, </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_02> but the stores were fucking great. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah really competent as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like, if we showed on those figure </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this isn't representative to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what they had at the store. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Yeah, because some of them were just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we needed to buy stuff just
to fulfill the challenge. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I wish I could have bought something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but a pop figure for Asuka. </SPEAKER_00>

Joey's finger smelled like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> after he rated School Days a 10. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm not over that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Hey guys, before we sign off </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just wanted to give a quick
shout out to today's sponsors. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Now this is a very long name </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so I'm going to have to read it out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's sponsored by Animationism, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a project by Japan Media Arts
Festivals Oversea Promotion </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> initiated by the Agency for
Cultural Affairs of Japan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Man, that was a mouthful. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's a serious mouthful if you ask. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> But if you guys don't know what they are </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> they have a lot of interviews
with Japanese creators </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and also with a lot of
Japanese Anime studios as well </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and a whole lot more. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - Anyway, they're having
a free anime screening </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this weekend online </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which you can check out
in the description below. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - So for those of you who want to know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the name of the three anime films </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it is Colorful Ninja Iromaki. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> The second one is Matasaburo on the wind. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> And the third one is
simply titled Rebecca. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> - So basically these are three films </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> from the Young Animate Training Projects. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And if you've ever watched
something like Death Billiards </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or the original Mi Mi Mi. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Those are films that
came from this project </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so by watching them you can
support the anime industry </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and that's fucking awesome in my opinion. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> - So if you are interested </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in the art of Japanese culture
and animation then make sure </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to go down to the links

<SPEAKER_05> is actually not a figure. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Just saying like, I
mean, then I would win. </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> - Look I already lost, all right. </SPEAKER_05>
