<SPEAKER_03> so i was like okay i am a straight a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> student </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what is what the [ __ ] does this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the first thing i did when i got my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> results was i phoned up my mum </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and told her that and told her how well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i scored in this exam like a good asian </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> song </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i called up the doctor and i was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> just a check this wasn't ranked was it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> this was this is casual right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is free play right please say </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> please say this society </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> please say no but yeah so i mean my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> results i got like all a's which is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> great as you'd expect from someone who </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is under the age of 30. you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> generally supposed to be quite healthy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> right yeah yeah but i got i got a b </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on bmi yeah which i mean obviously i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> built a little different </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> right yeah and this is japanese bmi </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which i believe is slightly different i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> don't know if </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i'm led to believe that's correct but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah but i mean bmi is [ __ ] anyway </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a lot of [ __ ] this is a hundred percent </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> muscle not fat don't happen </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and i got a c on my cholesterol all </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right but i got </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i got like uh well i'm not sure how </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> cholesterol work exactly because i don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know [ __ ] i'm dumb </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but one of so there was like they had </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like three different cholesterols and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all of them were like a little </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know all of them were kind of out of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> touch right right right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um but i was like in my head i'm like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> well they gave me three c's now for my </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cholesterol like but what are the odds </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> of one of these cholesterol being good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and the others not being good right if i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> go ahead and amazing cholesterol the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> other two aren't going to be like well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] i mean where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm gonna pick it up i mean i don't know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> to me it was odd i mean mine was worse </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because i got a c </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> on my liver and i think a b on my heart </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> rate monitoring or something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> right really and everything else was an </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> a what does that mean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's the thing right it's like usually </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on your thing like i think you two got </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like a doctor's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> note right or like a doc did you guys </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> get a doctor so you can ask </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when you get the thing i don't know if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you said yes or no you can ask if you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> want advice </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right and i said no i don't want advice </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i i said no you don't want to but i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> still go like i've got i don't know if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's the same doctor's note that we're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> talking about right but it was just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> summation of the test results which </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> didn't explain anything no it didn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> excite </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it just said um some of the values are a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> bit you know abnormal which is you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> higher or lower than we expect </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but there shouldn't be anything to worry </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> about i didn't even get a summation did </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know my mind literally like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> overall i got a c and the summation box </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was just blank i was like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh yeah yeah you're just going to tell </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> me that my liver is bad and that's it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i feel like should i be worried </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> some context would help yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> did did you have to get did you get a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> note that said you had to come in three </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> months later as well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like i did i got that they told me back </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> in three months but i don't but it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> optional i mean on the thing it says </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like if you get a c </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they recommend you come back three </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> months later but i didn't get like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> note saying that i should come back </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> so yeah mine said you should come back </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah yeah you have to pay for it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and also i you know for cholesterol </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> he's oh i'm obviously going to turn up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and they're going to be like hey you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> should uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> exercise and eat healthy i'm like thanks </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> dog i was going to ask because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i heard i heard you're back on the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> chicken and broccoli diet no no i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> haven't gone right back to the chicken </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> breast okay i haven't i have started </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> eating a little more health </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> consciousness is it because of the test </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> results i think it helped helped me be a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bit more conscious it made me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you know when you would you would maybe </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just go for the karate or you would go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for the chips it may </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> be a little bit like second thing like i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mean i i definitely have like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> stopped drinking okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i think i've only drank like once or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> twice is is is the liver 100 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all problems come from alcohol because i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> feel like it's not just probably there's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> gonna be a whole host of others </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because the problem with the test </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> results is that they they gave they gave </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you the grade </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but they didn't tell you how to improve </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it and i guess i guess that was bad </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because we literally </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ticked the box that said we don't want </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> doctor's advice because i i had assumed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like any other health checkup that it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> would just be like you know that you're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> going to be good right yeah it was just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the generic </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know are you doing well do i need to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> go to the hospital to really </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> have a lifestyle change no but as soon </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> as i saw the [ __ ] bee </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because i got a i got a b in my blood </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and i'm just like how the [ __ ] do i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> improve my blood </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what am i doing wrong why is my blood at </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> b just improve your men </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just like control it like because they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> were they were like they were like going </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know the the white blood or t cell i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm not a [ __ ] i i i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i saw the b and i'm just like as as </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as an asian student you know because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> whenever i saw a b in a test i'm like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay i can improve this test score </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i can study a bit more i can optimize </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> this a bit more somehow </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what i found interesting was that like i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> always thought to myself that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i was very deaf for my age like because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you know i went to like a lot of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> concerts growing up and just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] basically destroyed my easter </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like headphones and [ __ ] like that yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but so i was expecting like on the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> hearing part </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that i maybe get like a b or something </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right i wouldn't even have complained </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about it but then i saw i got an a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah so i was like oh it's not that i'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> deaf it's just that i don't listen </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it kind of made me realize i was like oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm glad to know i don't have a hearing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> problem i just have like an attention </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> problem i just don't give a [ __ ] that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> not that's my that's my problem </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i was telling the company i was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> listen if my eyesight or my ears come </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> back [ __ ] i know exactly why that is and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's because i don't know what the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] was happening when they were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> talking to me oh yeah they just put the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> headphones on me i'm like wait what wait </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> whoa whoa whoa </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_04> like can you hear it and i'm like here </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> what what am i listening for like and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> then i realized because i had done the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> human benchmark test </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right right recently that it was the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> frequency thing yeah yeah same way you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can hear it yeah but i was like what are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you what do you want me to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like what am i hearing for like a bulb </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like what i didn't know what was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> happening </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but i was like oh okay [ __ ] all right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> how did you because with the eyesight </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> thing right you have to do like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like a circle yeah yeah it's cut </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> out right yeah yeah how did you guys say </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that in english oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> no i said it in japanese what do you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just point out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> because i i really [ __ ] up in the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> eyesight thing because i didn't know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> what they were like looking for right so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> i thought it was like a normal eyesight </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> test thing where now when i was just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> e yeah because because okay so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to explain the eyesight thing they have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> this circle and have like one of like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> either up down </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> left or right that's cartel and then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right now the diagonals as well cut out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> i didn't see diagonals i didn't see </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> diagonals diagonals yeah there were </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> diagonals no </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> no no no i only saw up down left right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> they were diagonal no because i caught </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all of them right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah i did too but they were diagonal </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> there was no diagonals there was no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> doubt my one they gave me they usually </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> have diagonals right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> i've never seen diagonals because the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> only reason i knew about this test is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because when i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> exchanged my driving license from </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> british to japanese i had to do the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> exact same thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right yeah and i i was just it was this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> exact same thing again </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah and there was no diagonals i mean i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> definitely got it right because i came </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> back with like a one point two she could </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> be like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just men talking about diagonals yeah i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> don't know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah because right next to the circle </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> thing you had like the letters as well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so i was just reading out letters when </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they were asking what direction </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> i would have said what direction was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> missing from the song </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because i was wondering why she was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> looking at me really weird </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and i'm just like and she kept asking me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can you see can you see and i'm just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah yeah yeah let me just read out the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> letters for you so why are they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> this is easy as [ __ ] yeah luckily i've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> done the simulation before so that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah i was right not panicking as much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah man i mean i i clicked no to the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> health advice because i just figured </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that it was going to be the same old </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you know yeah just eat healthy listen </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah because let's be honest right if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's if it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> unless it's something you know bad like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really bad that actually requires </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> treatment </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right they're just going to tell me hey </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you should exercise more and eat healthy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know i do most of that anyway yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> because you know i mean like i think for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> cholesterol it's pretty simple it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> pretty simple literally just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah but for some of them like for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> example liver or blood </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you look at that results in little yikes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah it's like it's like a number of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> factors right like what do you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how do i improve my white blood cell </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> count i don't know do i just take an </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> injection </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of why blood cells what do what do you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> want me to do i have a theory right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is this could be a very uh pleasant </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> theory i don't know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> my theory was because we got the health </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> checkup done right after like christmas </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and my theory was well i've just been </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> drinking and eating straight for like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> three weeks this is clearly come on we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> got to write this off this doesn't count </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of course my collateral's going to be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> higher i had like 8 000 calories three </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> days ago </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> of course it's gonna be higher sure </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> maybe i don't know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> but i didn't drink a lot in christmas </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> so much yeah yeah i think that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> definitely skewed the results that's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that's what i'm going to chalk it down </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> to i mean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> doctors out there please validate me in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> the comments </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't want i don't want to hear if you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have an alternative theory just say if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i just found i just found it funny </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how like i think it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i think it's this is different </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> definitely the difference between like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> asian culture </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and like western culture where i feel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like in asia living in asia they try to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> make everything a test and everything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> kind of competitive and that's just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i that's how i was raised as well so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whenever i see a grade </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i like something in my blood drives me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to try and improve that grade </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah it's true yeah and i don't know if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i'm just like over competitive or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i just maybe well i think it's good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right because if you're the kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> person who you are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah those things work really well but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there's obviously some personalities out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when they hear oh by the way like your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> bmi is bad or your live is bad where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> they just like instead of like wanting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> to be like well [ __ ] you i'm going to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> improve it it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh [ __ ] i guess it's just like there's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no hope like why why is it like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> working and then it should make it worse </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right yeah but i don't know i feel like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as as you know as someone who grew up in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know kind of kind of both cultures </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i think a lot of toxicity can come in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> putting so much value </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> into a grade or a test and i feel like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> definitely living in asia </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they put way too much value into test </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> results and school results </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> do you think there are like some schools </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and like companies where like they get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bullied if you got like a bad </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> rating i think it's totally i it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> definitely a thing in asia </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> because i heard because [ __ ] got </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> a d in his blood yeah because because in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in in asia i i i don't know if i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> talking about my ass but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you see in like anime definitely where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you get the test results right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's like publicly posted yeah so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you you publicly know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> what your fellow classmates got and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that to me seems like a lot of pressure </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> they do that for like university like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> entrance exams as well they're like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah but create a huge billboard in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> front of the school and it has like your </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> number on it and if your number doesn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> show up you basically fail yeah brother </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> so it's like a public execution they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> literally make a public tournament arc </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for your test results </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like no one no wonder they put so much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> value and testing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and i think that can that can definitely </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to me from my experience can definitely </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> skew with your mentality when you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> go out of schooling and you realize that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not everything in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> life is graded and not everything in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> life has a percentage or a grade that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> uh judges your results and how well you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> do yeah i think especially because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> given the industry that we've gone into </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> which is entertainment if you will </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> uh then if you call trash taste </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> entertainment but we're trying our best </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> here </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um i feel like the skill set is nearly </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 180 it compares of what what you learn </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> in school </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right it's purely based on like i feel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like social skills and 90 percent of our </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> job oh yeah right being able to read a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> room </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah like talk but you know and i mean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> obviously there is a lot of technical </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> aspect obviously like learning how to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> set up all this equipment </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but the majority of it can't be taught </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in a classroom oh no and it's kind of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i mean you know how can you grade </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> someone's social skills imagine we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> started doing that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh i mean did you imagine oh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> connor you know you were on s but ever </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> since the event happened </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you've been kind of a bomber you're kind </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> of a d now you know what i mean </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like yeah it's like it's like getting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> graded for every tweet you make right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> honestly if you're like if you're just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like oh how's the b plus tweet yeah yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah that's true </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah he's just gonna fight away i mean i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> went through a period in life where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you know i was the stereotypical weave </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that didn't go out and i had </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> zero social skills and how i learned was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i think everyone goes through that stage </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> especially if you go through university </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where you kind of want to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you kind of want to reinvent yourself </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right you move into someone new and you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> want to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> be a new person so what i did was i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> basically just had like a full year </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where i just went out as much as </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> possible </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and talked to as many people as possible </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just like try to go out my comfort zone </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and that was [ __ ] hell for me as like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> this introvert </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> it's kind of like a trial by fire period </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> of my life that i would never want to do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 300 spartan training social strategies </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it basically was because i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i literally i literally just did not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know how to socialize i didn't know how </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to read a room i didn't know what the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> social network was that's like such a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> common like cultural thing in japan that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we actually have like our own </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like phrase for it which is university </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> debut yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> really it's like it's like a cultural </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> thing in japan where like because there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are so many like anti-social kids </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in middle school and high school and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> that when they go into university </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're like oh [ __ ] i'm like one step </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> closer to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where i have to socialize in order to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] live </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in society so university is literally my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> last chance before i'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> thrown into that world so i'm gonna like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> make a 180 during university and just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anything and everything possible to just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> completely change myself around </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i think it is a really op mindset when </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you when you you know because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> you know i wasn't cool at all in school </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i was i was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> very much an in-betweener you know i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> wasn't cool but i wasn't like i wasn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> like on the bottom of the social ladder </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> if you will you weren't like bullied to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean that's because i started fighting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> back my way out of there </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know i was just kind of like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> whatever like nobody paid attention to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> me never had any luck with like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know dating or anything yeah i was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> never had any of that but then i thought </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh wait like no one knows who i am in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> university </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah so like i don't know no one knows </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm a mid-tier social </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm a i'm a ct on the social ladder </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know i didn't reinvent myself it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> just like you don't do the mistakes you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fall back on crutches that you had like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like don't like you said right you go </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> out more you don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know i could play video games which </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is what i probably would prefer doing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if people invite me out i'll say yes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because you want to be seen as fun and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then seems fine everything goes easier </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you learn more you get more </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> confident </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> if for me it was go out of your comfort </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> zone for me it was like the complete </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> opposite </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i was like the really social in middle </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> school in high school and then when i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> entered university because i started </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> doing youtube yeah right i like kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> regressed social media you also lived at </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> home right yeah i lived at home i can </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> imagine that's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> way you must feel did you feel like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> different from like the other people who </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> are living on campus </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh yeah a little bit i mean our campus </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> was weird because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i think the majority of people in my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> class did live at home oh wow yeah we </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> only had maybe like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> a handful of people who actually lived </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> on campus which uh which </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which university did you go to again uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sydney university okay so i guess it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> because it's a city university yeah i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mean we have our own campus and like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> dormitories and stuff like that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that uni students live in but i think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> the majority of people because it's such </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> an accessible university because it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like smack bang in the middle of like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sydney like city so people can just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> get on trains and buses and just go home </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> basically yeah because i i feel like no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one in my class </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who lived locally to the area really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> from there well that's because you went </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to swansea right and yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what is there to do in swansea well it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> a good question guys </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm still wondering that myself </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> i didn't live locally either i live like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> an hour and a half by </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> bus [ __ ] so i didn't live close at all i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> could have like i was at a distance </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where i could have easily lived on the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> dorm but then </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i heard from people who were living in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> dorms in sydney university they were </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like don't do it that's a good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> experience though </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you know being thrown into hell honestly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i i feel like i learned </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> more valuable social skills um and just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> life skills going to university </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> than i did actual career skills that i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> using that that i learned from my course </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't think i realized it until i left </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and then i actually started like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> functioning </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah on my own yeah i don't i don't know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what i would have done without that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> period in my life jesus said like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it basically taught me how to survive in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the world </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and how people really are and all the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> expectations i had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> growing up and like because as a kid </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you kind of expect that as you grow up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and the more mature you get you assume </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that everyone's just gonna </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> realize what they're doing get mature </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then you kind of realize </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um going through university especially </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> especially that that was a [ __ ] lie </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then you go out of university you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> start like the working world and you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> realize oh everyone here is just like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> growing up university students and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> nobody actually knows what they're doing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and everyone is still </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> secretly as immature adults aren't as </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> adult </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as i thought they were right yeah i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> don't know i feel like i don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it's either like people just have their </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] together or they don't like there's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no in-between like i don't know i've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> never met anyone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> most adults that i've met are just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kids in suits essentially </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's basically the best way i can </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> describe it and um </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it's it's especially especially here </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like seeing some of the recent </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> stuff </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's been happening um obviously stuff </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like let's uh can we can we talk about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how uh the stonker market can we talk </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> about the stock market that's uh that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we've recently just seen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah we're going to be very delayed we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are going to be very delayed because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's so worried so what's it just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> happened to us it's just happened </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or is is happening i don't [ __ ] know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> it's a constantly evolving situation by </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so by the time this airs it's probably </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> everything we're probably going to be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> saying is going to be outdated yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> um who knows the stock market might not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> even exist by the time yeah my god when </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> reality is this entertaining who the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] needs tv this is what i'm saying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's what i've always said </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> real life is so much more interesting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah you couldn't make a movie </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about like if you'd pitch the movie </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> being like right so what happens is a </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_04> yeah i mean no one no one in my family </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> has anything about it i mean yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know i think my my family always i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> think every single generation of my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> family is just like made enough to get </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> by </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right yeah do buy some nice things here </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and there yeah so </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they don't think stocks was ever on </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> their mind i think my my parents had </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> some stocks in the companies they worked </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for as like a gift right yeah so i think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> my dad checks up on those stocks but in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> terms of actually </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> knowing about the stock market yeah you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> know no one in my family has any idea </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> well right because it's not something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you know everyone commonly learns </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> right but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that's that's that's what i was thinking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> fancy gambling for rich men yeah well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that's that's what it's like marketed as </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i mean i'm doing my research and like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> probably </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> probably reading into this um you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like i was thinking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> why the [ __ ] aren't we taught this in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> school because i feel like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> especially knowledge on the stock market </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a lot of the reasons why people don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> get into the stock market </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from what i've realized is because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> nobody knows [ __ ] about it it's it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because no nobody was taught this in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> school </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it sounds so complicated that nobody </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> has the effort </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or energy to really read up and learn </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about this i mean i didn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and the only reason i started reading </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about up about this was because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the [ __ ] stock market was on fire and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it turned into a massive meme i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> literally </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> started reading up about this because of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> a meme who would have thought that memes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> get you to go into like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> educational adventures it happens all </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> the time man </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but hey but like what this made me think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was why wouldn't we talk about this in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> school like there's so many </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> growing up there's so many life </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> essential like knowledge that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i think should be that that i think </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> everyone should know to be fair though </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like i'm thinking back like when </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you were like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> 15 14 right you wouldn't pay attention </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you wouldn't have paid attention </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> no i mean they always say like oh why </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> didn't they teach kids about taxes in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> school as well because i don't think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> they're happy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no one would [ __ ] yeah i think even </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you aren't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> even with taxes i do think that there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> should have been something yeah yeah no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i agree there should be something so at </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> least you when you get to that point in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> life </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you are aware and you can go back to be </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this is why it was important because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's there's so many things like for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> example </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i don't know why they're like it's not </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> compulsory to have a financial </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> management course </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in in in in school they should be they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> should they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because financial management is such an </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as like an </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> adult life essential skill and it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> something that you have to learn </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> by just by just either one your parents </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> teaching it to you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or two [ __ ] up and realizing that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is an important skill you need to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> instead of scores are like no let's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> learn the quadratic equations yeah but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> we'll need that but no let's learn </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that's beautiful actually </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah you're doing it on the quadratic </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> equation </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> let's let's let's learn that there are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> 180 degrees in the triangle </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i've used that before in my life let's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> learn about the tangents </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and the cosine of the side is the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> powerhouse </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well you know i think i think why they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> should be teaching </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like taxes and financial advice in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> school is not so that like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you get because obviously kids aren't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> going to [ __ ] come out of school </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> being like hello let me do your taxes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> just so that when they leave school it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> like it's on the back of their mind yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i've been taught that this is a thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that's going to come up and that i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> should learn how it works </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> for my value yeah exactly it's the whole </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> point of school i feel should be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> at least preparing you for what you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gonna face in the adult world and you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> know there can be some specialized </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> courses yeah i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i i mean it up but i can understand why </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they teach mathematics and algebra in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> case you want to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> pursue that right what i am saying is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there are so many </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> life essential knowledge that i had to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> learn on the fly and everyone does and i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was just not taught this stuff in school </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and i'm thinking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> why the [ __ ] is this not taught in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> school yeah and the thing is is that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like yeah you know people can argue </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> being like you know oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who needs to know the [ __ ] quadratic </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> equation what people are going to like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> architecture or like math-based stuff </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but like yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> financial advice and taxes like that it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> doesn't matter what job you go into </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're going to have to deal with it as </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> an adult yeah i mean it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> there's so many things in my school that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> we were taught that like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> were were replaceable in my mind like we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> were taught like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> we were like dude like media studies and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like jesus where we just like analyze </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> like newspapers and [ __ ] and just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> talked about like the media and how they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> advertise this stuff </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's in my job now but i didn't even get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> anything useful from that yeah i i had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to do that as well yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i didn't have to do that and then i did </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like cooking which was stupid because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i'm let's be honest i'm not a good cook </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as i'm sure guys will find that to be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> honest </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> be honest make money get over easy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that's what it's all about yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> no but like you could have replaced it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and i think that um </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] what was i going to say [ __ ] i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> totally forgot my point now [ __ ] i'm </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> done </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> go back to you i'll i'll i'll figure it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> out okay okay no i'm i'm just saying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like there's so many </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> important things in life that i just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> don't know about like i you know like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for example i have no idea about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> anything about mortgages or anything </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like that and when i say mortgage you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> say the word mortgage right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you're like oh okay you are grown up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but you know you know yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as a kid you hear the word mortgage </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're just like i i don't need to worry </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> about that yeah that's grown-ups i had </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to learn that [ __ ] on the fly i was like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't know what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the thing is everyone should you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> aim to own a house or own some property </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's like the one of the final goals </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in life right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and yeah it's no nobody's taught this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] isn't it bad the only time i've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ever heard the word mortgage was in a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> monopoly game </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's the only time i've heard and and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know well i still would have never </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> still don't know how to mortgage in a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> monopoly game yeah exactly i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i still i still have like the bare bones </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> basic idea about a mortgage because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i've i've not gone through the process </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of buying house because that [ __ ] sounds </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> scary to me yeah it is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and i i did go and see uh uh mortgage </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> getting a mortgage i don't even know how </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> they work </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah because i feel like you should know </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_01> like well you could you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> mortgage and i'm like that would i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i don't know that word yeah ideally </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> anyone with any kind of savings would </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have a financial advisor sadly you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you know it's it's kind of difficult to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> get a good one or get one that even you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like understand yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> down to be like okay this is what i do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and he was like wait so you make videos </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and you get paid to do that now like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah and he's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> okay i mean i would love a financial </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> advisor because i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's like like there's so little i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know about it and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this this kind of this you know the wall </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> street's bets </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> thing that's been going on has really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just opened my eyes to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how little i know about this stuff that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i feel like i really should know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah yeah like a youtuber i've been </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> watching recently is a guy called </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i think it's graham specter i think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah the millionaire guy who's like i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> saw him in like other videos </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> where he was talking about it's it's he </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he seems like the most grounded </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> millionaire i've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> ever you know i couldn't stand him at </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> first he seemed like a dick </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and then and i started watching him i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> was like all right okay he's pretty cool </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but he just came off as like an ass no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like the biggest thing that puts me off </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is every episode he goes he does the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> but don't forget to like and subscribe </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you like the video and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like no matter how cool a person you are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you say it immediately and ironically </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like yeah immediate turn off but like i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> was watching some of the videos and some </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> advice that he he gave which was some of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was like just like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really basic financial advice about how </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to like manage your money </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and this the thing is he he gives advice </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> any person from any level of income can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you can like um </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can can take to heart because uh like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one of the ideas that he </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> really tried to propagate is like no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> matter how much you earn you can you can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> everyone should get into the mindset </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well that you can invest something yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's that's what that's what i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> because i i was i had grown up with the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> mindset of like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> people the word investment that's for </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> rich people that's for privileged people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i can't invest i don't have the money to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> invest but even just investing like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a fraction of your paycheck or something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> in the long term </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> can really help you financially and give </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you a lot of financial stability and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this this is the stuff that we just we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> were just never taught like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i i guess as well because you hear so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> many horror stories about investments </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> going wrong and you also hear about like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you know people who take advantage of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people with like you know </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> find a fake financial advisor who says </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i'll help you out with your money and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> then just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> runs off with it right yeah yeah exactly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's so scary to trust someone with any </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> amount of money </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah and you know if even if you have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like barely anything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it's still all you have right it's scary </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to give that to someone yeah yeah like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> oh i trust you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> to take care of this because because the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> way that i was taught up because uh you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know i i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i also didn't come from like the most </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> well-off family so did i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you didn't have a lawyer or a finance i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i don't know i didn't have a family </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> financially </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> i just gave joey's parents i thought </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone had one of those i mean my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> parents </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> my parents declared like bankruptcy when </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i was a teenager it was you know it's oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah so you know i i was taught i was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like i grew up with the mentality that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know you should try to keep your </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> money safe you should </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know gather up as much as possible </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and i realized how much this mentality </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> had affected how i think about just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> resources in general </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so what what i realized is that i'm that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gamer right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i i am that gamer who whenever you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know whenever you play an rpg you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't use anything </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you get you get it you get a rare </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> item don't use it i don't use it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and whenever i play like command and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> conquer or something or some </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> rts games right i wait until i have a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] ton of resources </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then i start buying stuff out and i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> realized i realized this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this week when i when i was like where </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> did this come from and i realized oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's because that's just how i manage my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> money and that's just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i i've always come in the mindset of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i've got to save this just in case of a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> rainy day i can't invest it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i need to save it because you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> investing money might be </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> risky so it's better to just save it and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know i i kind of realized this as i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was doing research and i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> learned a lot about myself uh this past </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> week because of a [ __ ] meme </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because a lot of like entrepreneurs are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like spending everything they have like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just goes like right into buying [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like they have like no savings it's just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all the businesses </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's all just high risk high rewards </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah but then also as well you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> online there's so much of those fake </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> stupid entrepreneurs </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> online that have just really like ruined </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> in my mind </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the image of an entrepreneur dude speed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> run ruin in like five years dude </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if i go on like a twitter or a social </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> media and it has the word entrepreneur </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> on it right you know two years ago </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah entrepreneur was probably one of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the coolest things you could say like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you're an entrepreneur now i just think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh you're just doing a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> multi-level marketing scam to me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh you're selling me a course on how to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> be more confident have you seen those </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> courses yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> those things are insane they cost like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's like 1k for the first course and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> then they're like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> all right now you've unlocked the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> ability to get the next level of the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> course for only five thousand dollars </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and it blows my mind they're like trying </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to teach you [ __ ] that can't be learnt </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah it but it blows my mind that that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people buy into this stuff </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because they're obviously just people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> who have who are spending the money </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're giving them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on this lavish lifestyle but then they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sell back to you like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's insane and i don't know how people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> get sucked into this like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with like when we were talking about the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gambling stuff i can understand how </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> somebody can get into gambling you can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> gamble away </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> i don't understand how someone can watch </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> these entrepreneurs right these fake </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> entrepreneurs talk about how </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they can make you loads of money and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they can tell you how to be like there's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> loads like real </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> realtors have you seen those yeah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like i could teach you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the best real estate course of your life </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just come here for a hundred dollars and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have someone else do [ __ ] and then have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> five more classes i'm like how does </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> someone believe this [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's all fake obviously i don't get it i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> mean someone believes the [ __ ] because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's i think the biggest problem is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that there's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> so much information out there right now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you don't know who to believe </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you don't you just gotta i mean i can </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> see </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when someone knows nothing about yeah i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i know nothing about many things </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah but i also know when someone's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> chatting out of them no no you know what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i mean </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you have you have a [ __ ] detective </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a lot of people don't have a 500 pay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> wall right out the gate for a lesson is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> normally the first indication of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i think to a lot of people you know they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> see that pay wall and they see the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> presentation they think oh well this is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> probably legit yeah i mean i'm putting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> money into this so that must be like if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> they're paid </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if i have to pay this much for this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> course then it must bring results yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe maybe i just can't see that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because obviously we're doing like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> entertainment </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we've been on the internet for long </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> enough to know what's going on </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we're producing content i know i know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> what fake content looks like right i can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> imagine how it was made </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> whenever i see one of those like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> marketing um </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> trailers of like oh you can learn x </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> amount and earn x amount i swear they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they all have the same [ __ ] templates </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and with the same inspiring stock the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> first </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> music i made three thousand dollars the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> next month after that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> i made one million dollars and it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> oh i'm sure you did </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm sure you did off off mugging </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> everyone off yeah exactly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like it's it's like the equivalent </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of going on a piracy site and then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> seeing the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> adverts of i earned ten thousand dollars </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from filling out surveys </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you're like who the [ __ ] actually </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> clicks on this and believes this stuff </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> the fact that you're advertising on like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not even pornhub or like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> some shady hentai website this pill and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> your dick will go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> three times the size in three months it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> must i don't think about it more it must </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> come from </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like targeting insecurities right like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> absolutely yeah like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> some people are very insecure about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> their financial amount yeah like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> absolutely i'm sure there's other things </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like that i mean i just realized now </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> why would they offer dick pills oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because people are pretty insecure about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> their dicks back looking right yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> probably the same kind of yeah and they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> probably and they don't know any better </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> right they just think like well i want </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just the quickest easiest like most </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> straightforward way to get a lot of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> money oh look at this ad </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's a harsh lesson in life to learn </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that miracles truly donate </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah i mean i mean it's i'm sure </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's really thought that you need to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> actually put that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> work and effort into it yeah that might </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> just be that might be a lifelong yes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i don't think any amount of pills is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> going to save you only so many times you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> can pop that bag yeah exactly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> exactly no i mean i feel like it's the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> same reason why people fall for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> multi-level marketing scams apparently </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is really bad in the us i have a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> lot of friends from the us who tell me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that they know </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> high school who tell them that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> constantly message him about it really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah yeah i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't know how bad it is because i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> connected to strange people who have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> strange friends but </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> in order to like get out of that kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> stuff like risk taking is definitely </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> where you'll always have a fallback </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if it doesn't work out and then there's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> just a risk take where you just yolo it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah at the end of the day right the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> let's be honest right the way life works </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> if somebody had </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a million dollar idea yeah right a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> stranger isn't going to come up to you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and pitch it to you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they're going to [ __ ] do it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> themselves yeah exactly right like if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> anyone comes up to you promising to make </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you money that should be the biggest red </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> flag </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in existence nobody nobody can promise </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> to make you money yeah yeah for for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> example </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like if if that person also promising to </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> make you that money </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is a billionaire themselves why the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> aren't they doing it yeah exactly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> exactly which is when i realized where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like you know when </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what i've realized growing up is you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know my my mom and dad would give me you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know advice </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about how to be successful in x and why </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and i love my mom and dad </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but then i came to a point when i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> realized that some of the mentality </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> especially when managing money </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was was not wrong per se because that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what that's the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> mentality that they had to survive </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because that's the environment it was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just different </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah it was a different environment i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> got to realize i'm growing up under </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> different circumstances </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and i have to you know i have to choose </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sometimes whenever </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> some advice does pertain to me and when </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's when it doesn't and when someone's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> promising you to make money that's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> okay we're three successful youtubers </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right but as much as and as much advice </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as we can give </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we cannot promise a random person to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> make them a successful youtuber </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right we can give advice about how to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> increase their chances </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and how to you know how to help work the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> algorithm for example but we're not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> going to drop like a million dollar </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> video idea because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> we would just do that there's no way </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there's no way that i can sit here and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> guarantee you that yes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i can give you advice to make you a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> youtuber that gets a million subscribers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> nobody can do that yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> earn x amount from you as far as i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> concerned we were all very lucky in that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> case as well right we had </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> we had the we had the odds in our favor </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but yeah it was but nobody taught us or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> like told us what to do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i mean like i i i preach by that you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uh we we did we did a lot of things </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right uh and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we all were also very lucky in a lot of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> aspects there wasn't there wasn't one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> without the other </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um there are things that you can do to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> increase your chances of success and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> massively </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> get the odds into your favor but to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> guarantee something to guarantee success </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like that it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> pretty much impossible yeah i think the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sad truth of life is that you just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> realize this is like i think the stock </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> market looks like a [ __ ] casino too </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> many people and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i thought it was a lot a lot of the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hedge funds do treat it like such yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> exactly </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we learned that today at the end of the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> day </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's truly a sad moment when you realize </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there isn't really a get-rich-quick </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> scheme </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in life it doesn't exist right and like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> if you're looking for that i feel like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you're already setting yourself up to be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> disappointed or organized if there was a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> scheme that could 100 </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> give you like a success rate of like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're gonna get famous </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you wouldn't think everybody would be </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_04> numbers and like and they never </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> i mean by the time when i first started </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> really blowing up on the anime community </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_03> extra classy i would have a i used to do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> patreon fan letters </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where you could pay to be pen pals with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> me okay that sounds </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like that doesn't sound like a nightmare </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is about to happen that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when i made that i didn't think it was </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> gonna so it's not on there anymore but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it used to i used to think that it was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like oh this is such a cool way to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> connect with me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah and i didn't realize about like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> logistics yeah yeah because you never do </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with patreon you never think about the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> logistics until you realize </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> oh i have to do this every month yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> basically i agreed to write like 20 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> letters </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> a month which uh i'm not good at writing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> either and i don't like writing yeah so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> writing one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> one letter for me takes like 30 minutes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i've seen it i've seen your handwriting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so it's not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> writing so much so it was just painful </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it was really frustrating as well sorry </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i'll go on to have got hit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> after but it was frustrating as well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because like people would join patreon </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for like one month and leave so i would </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> send out a letter </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that would just be like hi how are you </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> nice to meet you tell me about yourself </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then not get a response but i'd have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to write </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> but i'd have to write like seven of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> those letters a month yeah every month </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> and i was like doing them all by hand </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how how long was the letter itself uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like a page or two </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> jesus jeez that's a long for how much a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> month i think it was on like the 40 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> tier but that was included with the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> voicemail so like how much how much </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> would uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> let's let's break this down cost to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> effort-wise how much would it take you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> too long write a letter not long </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean i guess if they paid 40 dollars </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for 30 minutes worth of work but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> i always get distracted and i couldn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> focus because i just didn't want to be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> doing it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah right so it was awful but yeah i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> had i had someone as well </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> same same with a fan letter who was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> um </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they like it was this really weird </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> situation where i'm not really sure what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> happened </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because i was just being like ah yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> cool i like pokemon too </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i like these things because i would try </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and be honest and try and make a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> friendship with them </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah and then they were like they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> replied one time being like oh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah so i told my my co-workers at work </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that i have a boyfriend and i said it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and i was like and then they asked like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is that okay and i was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh sure i don't give a [ __ ] like i'm not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gonna go wrong i'm not gonna go around </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> saying that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you can say that like she she </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> she brings up the sea dog va youtubers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> that's amazing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> she's like you wanna see my boyfriend my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> boy look at that guy </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sebastian he's he's his name's sebastian </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm just thinking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm like is that a brag because if they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> pull up my videos half of them is either </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> going to be me reading bl </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or me uh in the cosplay yeah and i think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i think they were from like midwest </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> somewhere </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's a very conservative state so i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> couldn't imagine they would take too </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kindly to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> me being like naked in my room basically </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> going ah you know like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so yeah that was interesting that was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> fun um also it's a boyfriend that never </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like [ __ ] responds to like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> messages already it's a boyfriend this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> is a one-way boyfriend boyfriend that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah that replies uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> once a month via mail yeah but yeah i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> ended up getting rid of that because uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah just stuff like that sounds like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> effort yeah and also just way too much </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> effort and this is the stock image to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> accompany it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh what is that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> this is this was this is me writing the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> reply email to the hitman that they </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> hired if i didn't say yes they were </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> dating and then yeah this is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> the obvious this is called nutting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> during fan courses i've popped i made a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> video about this you can watch it yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah it's really old now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i i know the story but yeah so </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> essentially there was this time </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where i was doing uh fan call as hetalia </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> characters </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where she sounds like cringe already </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah so i was doing it i was doing it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> with someone else who was doing another </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> voice </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and we were on the call with the person </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and i thought </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like there's some weird breathing sounds </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> coming from them but like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i was like huh this sounds a little </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> weird but i didn't think much of it </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_00> you bring a ducky mackerel of someone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> from like vampires </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so like yes so like what happened was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that we were on this call i thought </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's weird then when we got off the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> call it was only like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> six seven minutes all right i was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was that was that weird that call was </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> weird </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right yeah like oh no i don't i don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> think so but i was editing the audio </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah so i go back and listen to the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> audio </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and i'm like she's definitely nothing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that ain't like that isn't like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that isn't like hyperventilating breath </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that is like it was like slow </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_04> so i made a video about it but i i pitch </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> shift it and changed it and it sounds </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> even creepier </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it sounds like a two-year-old scary yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> because i wanted to protect their </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you know particular identity obviously </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because right i don't know if it was i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't know if it wasn't but like </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_02> for france </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um so yeah so i up until very recently i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> used to do patreon phone calls and uh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> not in character no it's me yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah so i would offer </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's gonna sound like a lot for like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a hundred dollars an hour uh to have a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> call with me but then if you ask any </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> youtubers around our size they'll be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like wow that's too little </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah because it's just i know it sounds </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> absurd it sounds stupid my parents all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> thought it was dumb they were like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people pay to speak to you connor that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> absurd </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> my parents got the same reaction why </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> would anyone want us to pay to speak to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you connor </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like mum [ __ ] off mama um so anyway up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> until recently i used to do patreon </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> phone calls like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like i said uh i would have like i'd </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> call it like generations i don't really </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know why </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but people would always leave in mess </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and join a mess and there was only 10 </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> spots on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> my course so only 10 people at a time </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> could clear these calls all right um </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and i would only maybe have like one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> person who was on it for like two plus </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> years </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but the rest of the time is like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> rotating people and like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i had some really [ __ ] uncomfortable </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> ones that i haven't really spoke about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because i'm just like this is so [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> weird but i mean this will speak about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it now </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah so this is one time this is by far </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_00> just like okay </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> get the [ __ ] out of my life please i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> mean that's right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i emailed them basically saying hey uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm removing you from patreon what the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] you doing this is sad </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like yeah like oh yeah of course that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> not cool because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it wasn't the worst thing was that she </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> wasn't going around to like her close </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> friends for some reason she was going </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> around sending them to other youtubers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> oh saying i'm friends with connor look i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have this message and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> unfortunately some of those youtubers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> didn't know that i was doing the patreon </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but i mean i i've gone through that as </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> well where i've had people going around </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> saying that they know me and saying that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they it happens </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i've been friends with me when they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> weren't just to try and get in with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> other people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and yeah it's like that's that's the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> biggest [ __ ] red flag for me but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that's why i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's kind of one of the big reasons as </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well as time is why i removed the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ability to call me on patreon i don't do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it anymore you can't have a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> phone call with me i mean i i think the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> worst thing that happened to me was it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> literally happened to me at a convention </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where you know i had a guy who was going </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> around telling people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> telling companies that they knew me and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that that they they were trying to use </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that as an inn that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's that's somehow even worse isn't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that when they're going around to like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> because they're potentially ruining your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> name yeah yeah exactly but they're also </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> trying to profit themselves yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i can deal with someone being a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> creep i could that's that's insular i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can i can i can just immediately shut </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that down </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right someone does that that's repairing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i have to do yeah yeah that's horrible </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah yeah luckily </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know that's i guess that's why it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> triggers me so much because i i hear </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that i'm just i just think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> too like the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> i would gladly have someone hit on me on </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a call a hundred times </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> rather than them go to a company saying </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that we're friends yeah you know what i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> mean because i can you know that's fine </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> don't do that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> do not do that that is the biggest </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] move you could do we have gone </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_03> uncomfortable about holding a stranger's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> baby that i just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't know it's like holding someone's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> expensive vars you know it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i still don't know how to handle babies </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like someone asked me if i want to hold </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if i want to hold their baby and i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just like does it come with an </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> instruction manual </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> what do i do like i i feel so inadequate </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> when it comes to handling babies they're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> great for the 10 seconds where they're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like crying and then the moment you pick </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> them up and they start crying i'm like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh god oh god </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what what do you think please please </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> stop yeah but like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know as as odd as that is and and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> almost creepy you could say yeah yeah i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> mean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's flattering more than anything i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> guess but it was i mean don't get me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> wrong they were very nice it's probably </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> flattering </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in a sense it's flattering i just i i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> would feel that if anyone named a baby </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> after me that's a bit that's a bit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> too much pressure on me i feel like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> naming your baby after any influencer is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> a bad idea did you find them mainly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> what did you type in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay then found it by typing in c dog </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> baby apparently it comes off i just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think it's a bad idea </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> naming your your baby after any </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> influencer yeah we all know we're just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one bad team </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah don't name your kid after your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> family it's like it's like it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> getting a tattoo but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah favorite but youtuber luckily </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> luckily </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it was just connor and not c dog v8 yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah that would like it i i have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> i have like no idea how corpse husband </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> feels whenever </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> when he sees like his voice like what </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_03> yeah um yeah so that was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that's how that happens yeah that is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> very bold indeed that is very bold </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> uh i've got i've got like the next one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's called the smooth paper </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i've been handed uh pieces of paper </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> before just at conventions you know i'll </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> do i'll just like sign something or i'll </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i'll take a picture and i'll show me a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> piece of paper </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right i'll be like hey here's my number </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> come text me i think that's kind of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> smooth </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's very old stuff i don't know why </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's smooth i never replied to any of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> them because i'm like bro </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> my phone doesn't work in the u.s sorry i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just have the internet but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's very smooth i like it i actually </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like that one i think it's classy now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> now you're going to get this every </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> conversation because it's like it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with this one </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like it's not intense it's like i i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if i want to call you i'll call you i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not gonna call you just letting you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because i'm too [ __ ] just the casual </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right that's that's how i imagine people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah there's something simple about it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's so inoffensive </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> but maybe it's because i'm a guy i feel </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like if i was a girl and guys kept doing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it to me i'd be like annoyed yeah that'd </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> be very creepy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i kind of like it it's very </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> flattering when someone is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> attractive and they send you you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> they hit on you it's like oh wow </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this league really oh no get out of here </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> i thought </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we weren't even playing the same sport </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> dude i thought i was playing checkers </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> you're playing 4d </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> chess this don't match but yeah i mean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> you know i mean it's a nice ego boost </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for like 20 minutes until you realize </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> he realizes a bit weird yeah he realized </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> that's a bit strange golden rule don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] your fans right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah exactly especially in this climate </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i i just think that's like oh yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> stick by honestly yeah dude whenever i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> used to because for the first like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> two three months in japan i was using i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i had like tinder because i thought </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> no one's going to recognize me on tinder </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fantastic yeah but yeah those people who </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> recognize me on tinder here </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who could speak english obviously and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then obviously a white guy would stand </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> out right yeah and they were like oh i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> watch your videos i'm like immediately </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> unmatched </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah yeah honestly like see you did you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> played it smart </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was that why would i want to i don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> want to date someone who turns up and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they're like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yo i love that video whoa whoa whoa whoa </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> whoa </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because i thought unfortunately there's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> a lot of youtubers who probably use that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> as an ego boost right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean okay getting in the whole topic </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of [ __ ] your fans or dating your fans </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> there is a way to go about it there is a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right way and there is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> definitely a wrong way like yeah they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they met through being fans </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah and there was a that no one ever </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> would question the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> the what's the word legitimacy the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> legitimacy or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the efficacy of that right that's a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> legitimate relationship </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but there are ways doing it that that it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> like taking advantage of your power and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i think that's why people have the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> problem </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah and unfortunately a lot of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> youtubers don't understand when they are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> just kind of taking advantage of their </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> own power yeah in the situation yeah i i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> feel i feel like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like hooking up like i say hooking up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hooking up with the wrong words </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> because if hooking up with your fans </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> implies that yeah you you are just kind </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're not doing anything you're just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of throwing throwing your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> fame out there and everything like that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah and i feel like you have to be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> really self-conscious about this and i'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> glad that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> people are like looking more into this </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and like i'm like put putting more </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> attention </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> getting smarter about it yeah and fans </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> are getting smarter about this as well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as they really should be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um and it's the responsibility you hold </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as a youtuber </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and sometimes you just don't want to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> worry about that you just want to meet </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> someone where you don't want to have to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> worry about this power imbalance because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you you are you know we're all just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people as well we're all just people and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sometimes we just want to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> switch off this part of our lives and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just be a normal [ __ ] person like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> anyone else </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um yeah i don't want someone who's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> watches my videos and has an expectation </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of me in general that i can from that is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> portrayed through right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> right it's funny because most of the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> friends i've made </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who started off as fans like as we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> became </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> friends they just started watching less </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and less of my stuff and because that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's that in a lot of the ways that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> made me more comfortable or they we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> stopped talking about it because </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they were just mates and we would talk </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like mates and talk about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> whatever else apart from my job as i'm </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> sure that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i kind of feel that works in the same </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> way with like friends between two </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> youtubers right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah i definitely like watch like less </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> of like my </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> youtuber friends videos after we just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of went </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> past that point just became friends no </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you you keep up with it just just to see </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> what your mates are doing yeah yeah yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but you're not like damn bro that last </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> video [ __ ] banger bro like i would </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> have done this differently </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah like i showed i like showing sports </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my mates you know yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's different from being like yo i'm a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> huge fan of what you did </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] yes [ __ ] banger right there yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> man life's hard if you're you should </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> if you want to just be safe don't [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> your face rule number one </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> working good for me yeah yeah oh my god </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> uh this is my stock image can you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> explain </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> why you chose this one okay so there is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> a labrador </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with a gun holding her i just thought </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> this one was fun you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> okay sure i don't know it's kind of fun </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> this is what happens when you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> reach like the end of your project and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you just like i'll just throw whatever </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] i put up oh we're about halfway </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we're about halfway okay okay the next </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one start getting a bit more obviously </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> okay uh you've been hit on the youtube </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> comment section of course </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah of course yeah take me on a date </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> next time i visit japan </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> that happens yeah that happens a few of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> those comments it's like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> uh no how about how about you pay for my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> date yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i wonder if anyone is ever in the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> history of youtube probably has </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> would have taken a comment like that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> seriously and i mean they tried to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> pursue it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i mean i mean maybe if you like you're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> if you're a smaller youtuber maybe yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean i i did something similar along </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> with like email someone emailed me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> asking me to go on a date </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but there's a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> um anyone can write a youtube call </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> they're live and then obviously you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people ask you on dates on live streams </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all the time you're streaming </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i get comments sometimes being like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> oh we're on a date and we go in japan or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> people people subtly ask questions that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> are like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i think that they think they're being </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> subtle right but it's very obvious what </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> they're asking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like for example one very big giveaway </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> as to what some people are asking um are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like hey </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> uh would you ever do like long distance </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> relationships by the way just uh </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and like some people might genuinely be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> curious right but there's like a way </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> that certain people ask it that is like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> uh no no you know it kind of gives you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that vibe of like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're asking this for a purpose yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and also </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i get donations sometimes which i think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's another one actually </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but um where people will be like oh um </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just like wondering like what kind of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> age age group do you go for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uh if it isn't obvious by now uh milfs </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> so you know you know if you're if you're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> around my age lonely housewives </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> the walls for the next stream is your </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> husband just not cutting it i don't want </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to know who he is but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i'm kidding yeah i mean yeah stuff like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that what else do i get there's ones as </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well you know what i get asked a fair </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> amount which </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is like the least subtle which is like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> would you ever date someone who like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> doesn't do youtube and i'm like would </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you think i exclusively date psychopaths </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> when you have you know you get how many </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] views we get a month on our own </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> chat like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> eight nine million views a month right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> all it takes is one person to think i'm </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> attractive </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> why i don't know to then go on and then </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> do something right i don't think </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i'm inherently more attractive than </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> anyone or most people yeah but the thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that like you should have a platform </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like right but the thing is that like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> i've never experienced i don't think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> gonzo experienced that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> really well not not to this but then i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> also i i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> also i also but also like i feel like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> your content </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah i do videos about like dating and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> stuff yeah yeah i mean i mean like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it doesn't surprise me because you do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> more appeal more to that kind of thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and any any anyone who </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like has because a lot of your content </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> base started off with literal fan </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> interaction </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah for me i did i literally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> didn't start </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like even for most of my videos i don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> show my face on like yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> whereas we don't give a [ __ ] about us </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my whole youtube like career in the show </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> which built off interaction and i'm very </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> grateful right which is why like it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> doesn't surprise me why some of the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> weirdest fan interactions have </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> come from come from you i guess so yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that makes sense if you give avenues for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> people to talk to you they'll find a way </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> to hit on you that's how it works </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and this is the stock image oh my god </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what is that that was me at the end of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> the figurine like </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_00> you laughing man it's true though </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_04> he ever was yeah right i agree </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know honestly to me it's like as </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> long as the mindset is there that you're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know you're in my world and you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on the same wavelength of thinking and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you treat life the same way i don't give </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> a [ __ ] about your age </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah i mean i feel like some people use </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> your heart i just don't want you to be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> younger than me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because i i feel like some people just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> hit a certain age and then they just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> stop giving a [ __ ] about how they look </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and taking care of themselves right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or alternatively they just think they </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can get away with the lifestyle they had </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in their 20s </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and just bring that to like their the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> their 50s </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like 30s 40s and 50s because you know i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> think being 30 now </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> as the only 30 year olds i i've heard </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that being 30 is just basically being 20 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> with one debuff </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um that's [ __ ] blood yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah and uh yeah i mean i feel like some </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> people do age like [ __ ] fine wine and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a lot of asians just don't age at all i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> guess </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> until they've reached like this cap and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then they just start aging and then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> they're like oh oh we have to age </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> oh okay okay honestly um also going back </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> to the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> naming after my baby it wasn't an insult </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> by the way trying to make sure that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> clear i don't think that's like a bad </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just thought it was very intense just i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> mean it's a very light a lot i mean i've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> never heard any other story like that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like it's so overwhelming that you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like which emotion do i take away </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like i put myself in your shoes and the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> biggest like </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_00> of guy viewers that i never had before </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right right um and i stopped doing as </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> much yowie stuff and slowed down on that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i mean it's still like nearly it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it depends on the month it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> depending on the videos i make yeah it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> about 50 50 now which is nice and it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> slowed down a lot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> uh but there's ups and down sides right </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_02> be hit on but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for someone to get in contact with </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> and also the on the opposite end any </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uh taking this advice for any like young </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> budding youtubers out there </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like tread carefully with fans hitting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> on you don't [ __ ] your fans man </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it never works out listen you know it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> might work out one tenth of the time but </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> there's the problem is is that but are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> you willing to take the risk yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> i mean you have to be really careful and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i think the biggest problem </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is that whenever whenever you're like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> youtuber starting out especially when </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're a small youtuber i feel like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is more a message to small </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> youtubers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um who don't have the experience or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> don't think they're gonna get big </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because you don't [ __ ] know if you're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> gonna get big </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> right but you should treat you should </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> treat the fans or you should treat your </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> audience </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> no matter how big you are exactly the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> same and it's it's stay grounded yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i mean i'm sure there's cringy messages </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> out there of me hitting on someone at 19 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that would just embarrass me but it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> again i'm 19 you know just [ __ ] yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but like you're you're like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> it wasn't like hit on fans of me like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> shimmy nudes you know what i mean it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> just me being an average 19 year old </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah exactly like when you're younger </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like you don't you don't really have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like the senses to know what exactly is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> cringe you're not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> also when you're younger you're just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> hoarding as [ __ ] yeah exactly and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you think you can get away with you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> know being horny </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you grow up and you realize man i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> did a lot of stupid [ __ ] yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah young dumb and full of calm that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> as they say </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> lovely joey words to live by yeah but i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mean it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like because there's some people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know there's a lot of youtubers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> out there very very openly happy to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> admit that they date fans they're like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you know the normal famous celebrities </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> get to [ __ ] their fans and no one bets </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> an eye </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's like well i mean yeah that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> double standard is like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> this is the way i interpret it and why </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's the case that normal celebrities </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they don't bank on the fact of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> relatability they don't bank on the fact </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> of being </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they're like people above the club well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> their whole like every like pop star </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is supposed to be like a character like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> an absurd kind of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> not real person yeah right they never </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> pretend to be your friend </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they never like pretend to give a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about you yeah and if you have sex with </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> them they'll probably don't give a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> about it right maybe </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> maybe right it's just a joke but i mean </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> if you do it with an influencer right or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> crossword or a youtuber right i i hate </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i guess it's almost kind of a betrayal </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of what you built up which is like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a lot of the people who watch us right i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> guess i don't know if you guys know like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you guys feel this way like there's a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you form like a bit of a bond right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where you like you respect the creator </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah you look up to them and you enjoy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> their stuff and you feel a lot closer to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a youtuber than you would say </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah because and so it's that that's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> being taken advantage right it's because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> most youtubers are more </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i guess grounded right you feel more </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> real so when you do watch them you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> just like oh </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this is an actual person i'm watching </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah like like i would say </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to be like the right way to go about it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is if you're if you're going to get </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> involved with your fans </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> that you just one of the biggest things </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is you don't do it straight away </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like you need to treat as a friend start </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as a friend treat them like a human </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> being </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> get the get to know each other first </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like any normal [ __ ] relationship </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you need to like immediately like break </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> down or disassemble any like power </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> dynamic in play </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> i was like and and like you put yourself </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on equal footing yeah and with stuff </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like one night stands or something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that gets so messy and there's no way to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like differentiate </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is there a power dynamic there is is is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the person is the person gonna do this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and then you know regret it afterwards </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it it's too messy to be able to justify </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i feel um and if there is a right way to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> go about it and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> there's nothing about it but like most </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of the time it's like you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like do you want to defuse a bomb </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like you if you know how to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah you want to do that yeah go ahead </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> there's a right way to do it but it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not worth it right yeah but like is it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> worth is it like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> is it worth the risk literally blowing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yourself up in terms of career like is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it worth it or you could just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> i don't know be do what everyone else </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> [ __ ] does i don't know well </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> date normally and i feel like a lot of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> smaller youtubers don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like they they don't really think about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this because they think i've got nothing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> to lose so i'm just going to do this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> right now while </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> while i can because you grew up in a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> culture where yeah you do see you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> celebrities and like groupies cats like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sleeping with </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know music artists and everything </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like that you think man </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that sounds like an awesome lifestyle i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> kind of like that stuff so when they get </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> smidgen of that they think i gotta take </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> advantage of this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> while i still can rock and roll </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> lifestyle works if you're in that field </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the rocker roll lifestyle is not the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> youtuber lifestyle it's two completely </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> different things i find </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah it's it's tough it's so tough and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like is it just like it's not even </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> worth </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like getting into yeah right because i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> feel like to get involved in this is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you are literally navigating a minefield </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> oh yeah 100 </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like if you really want to do it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you can do it yeah but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> the reason why i think most youtubers </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> will say don't [ __ ] your fans is because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just like it's so much it's so much </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> risk you're taking on for no reason </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like it and and to me it's like do you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> really want someone who wants to be with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for your videos is that like why is that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> attractive like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they're looking at you only for the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> right because to me it's a competitive </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> mindset </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to me that's like a massive turn off if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they're only with me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> because of my content then that's like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the same thing if you're only my friends </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for my content then you i'm saying you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> can't be my friend because that's that's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> not how i would see a friend yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> the same way i that's how i wouldn't see </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like a possible partner </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like that's like saying like also if i </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> change my content then you're suddenly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> not my friend </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah yeah i there is no bigger turn on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right than meeting someone who just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> likes you for you yeah like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what why why i'm sitting there i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thinking like how the [ __ ] am i supposed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to be into this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then like get my dick hard when i'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> all i'm thinking about you're thinking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is like what's the next upload going to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> be </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like [ __ ] that no i i want someone who </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_03> difficult for myself obviously but </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_04> existence where </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_03> know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> i i just i just want youtubers to have a </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> the that's just human nature that is the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> only </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> we are three horny guys but at least </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> we're horny on main and uh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> we we keep to being horny on maine and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> uh that's pretty much it yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> pretty much man a part of me is part of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> me as glad is that you i have like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> youtube to keep me in chat almost </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> not that i would start doing awful [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if i wasn't a youtuber but </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> the fact that there is this kind of like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> obvious moral lines that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> right that it's not like oh no man </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> should i do no no it's not they're like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> these unspoken guidelines and rules to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like make sure you're not </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> right yeah it really makes me cautious </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about how i come up to people and what i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> say to people makes me way more </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> conscious about how i speak </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> in a way that i think is you know i the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> way i speak </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on live streams the way i speak you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> on the video is how i'll speak to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> most people in my life and how yeah you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> know and i like that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's kind of taught me in a way to just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it sounds awful right but just give a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] about everything </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and pay attention even if it is draining </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> at times it sounds awful i'm like yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you should taught me to be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> not an [ __ ] like but like you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> how some things you take for granted </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah that you when you're you know when </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're an individual who isn't like uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> open person yeah i mean for me it's it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> not it didn't teach me to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you know give a [ __ ] about everything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but it did teach me to really </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> question my own values yeah and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and really justify if is is this value i </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> hold right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right as opposed to like i just think </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> about </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> i just think it this way because i was i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> grew up in that kind of environment </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and it really made me self-reflect and i </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> feel like that that is like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a healthy part of youtube that has has i </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> think i've become </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a better person because of youtube yeah </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> like it's it's about that mentality of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> okay if i wasn't doing youtube then do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> is the things that i do and the way that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> i talk to people and what kind of stuff </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> would that be still considered </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> respectful to other people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> regardless of if i were if i had this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> job or not like would i still be a good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> person if i didn't have youtube </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and if the answer is yes then i think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're following it right if you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> worrying if the answer is no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah well i mean you know look at all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the douche tubers right apparently you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> can get away with that [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> if you have a youtube channel i don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> know do they get away with that [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> though </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like i mean i mean there's a reason why </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they have an audience are they they are </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> on borrowed time are they like a twit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> longer waiting to happen </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> because they're definitely like a limit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> like they're not going to be like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> at the point that they are for very long </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> because i feel like a big </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> i mean this is getting to a really deep </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> topic now but a big problem with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a lot of these like apology videos and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a lot of this kind of culture that that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> has been built up i understand where it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> comes from where we we do need to keep </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> uh we do need to keep each other in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> check and make sure that people aren't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> abusing their power </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but a part of it just makes me feel like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> man people are just treating this like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one big reality tv show </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it's not keeping each other checked </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> we've just made it a modern coliseum </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah we just we just gamified it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> basically we've just you know </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> could we can't kill each other that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the best thing we can do is [ __ ] get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> each other's throats </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah which is which is why right now now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when i see an apology video or twit </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> longer </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know like a lot a lot of like as we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> said we were taught to you know </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have to give a [ __ ] about this thing but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sometimes i see this and i'm like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> i don't have the energy to keep the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to care about this this doesn't involve </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know sometimes it it it [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> sucks when i </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when i hear about you know some some </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> person in the community or in some </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> community </SPEAKER_00>

<SPEAKER_02> but there there reaches a point where </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there is too much happening right now </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that's you can you can it's it's it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> sensory overload yeah yeah it's just </SPEAKER_04>
