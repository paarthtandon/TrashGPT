<SPEAKER_05> in a box so basically they said sound </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like Sea Dog VA but take but take the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> corner out of it yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> just be less haughty you don't get a </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_04> credit that they at least you know open </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> up a thesaurus for this they weren't </SPEAKER_07>

<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] pretentious and arrogant you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> know like I don't know what I mean about </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> it that would be the most intricate way </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> of insulting me start your own like uh </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> project cast a thing and then send out </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> auditions to everyone you [ __ ] hate </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and then just link them as the reference </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> you sound like Joe but less of a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> [ __ ] </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> [Laughter] </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_01> they were really nice I auditioned for </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the thing and I did I guess what you got </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the park </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> wait wait wait wait they wanted me to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> sound like Sea Dog VA you must be less </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> haughty but less less 40 and uh can you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> just like change your voice to that yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can you can you do it can you do it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm gonna I'm gonna hear your voice in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this thing that you're just for and I'd </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> be like we could have had that I'm like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> where's that called where's that guy I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> want that guy oh my God this sounds like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> an amazing corner I would say it's it's </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> it's the voice that I would do uh if I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> was an [ __ ] but 20 nicer 20 night </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> twenty percent nice there's still that </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> level of like snobberiness yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> uh that's so definitely that's the last </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> 40 I suppose yeah so I did get the role </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> I've read for for the part I I've done </SPEAKER_09>

<SPEAKER_05> tell you guys when it is so you've got </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> to play yourself but nicer more I guess </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I wonder because I I got a few things </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> that are coming out in the future I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> wonder if people will be able to figure </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> out which one it is which one is the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> nicest I mean when I when I had to voice </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> my own character in no straight roads I </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> think I had the opposite I was like play </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as yourself but more haughty is that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> possible for you yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've literally called musical.ly just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> like you can't get anything I'm in real </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> life </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_03> conversations people oh yeah we've seen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the [ __ ] they they do on LinkedIn you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> see that one more clip where the guy </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> fired like a thousand people on zoom and </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> then yeah I saw that one oh yeah yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> like crying like he gave a [ __ ] yeah and </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> it was like a one-way Zoom call as well </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> nobody could take part like it wasn't </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> even a zoom call it was a live stream </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> yeah we've done it on Twitch you know </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> what I mean the man literally pulled up </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that that you know that that the meme </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> video everyone uses in in meme edits of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the guy crying yeah yeah that one he's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> like the guy watched that video before </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> we went in and try to emulate that it </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> was so bad wait was this the one where </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> he phoned up half of like he opened up </SPEAKER_05>

<SPEAKER_05> literally a fashion statement my </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> eyesight is not your fashion Joey </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_05> eyesight I wasn't born with short </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> sightedness just so you can wear it I I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> have some fake glasses at home that I've </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> won many times yeah that's good on you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> bad bad eyesight isn't just something </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that you can take on and off Joey you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> have to live with it okay I can't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> believe you do me like this Joey </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you can't see anyways </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> no I've just I've just gotten used to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> wearing like a lifestyle of contactless </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> because I'm I'm preparing myself because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I know for a fact when my eyesight turns </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to [ __ ] at old age I'll be too much of a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] to try and put contacts yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> because I can't my eyes are too </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sensitive I can't do it do you know do </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> you know one weird life hack I found I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> find out like be rich </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> aside from Bee Ridge Lasik so I saw the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> scene in an anime where when one </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> character has like short-sightedness and </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like if you make like oh [ __ ] they fixed </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> it with the pinhole thing right and I'm </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like what [ __ ] [ __ ] is this and I </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> actually memeed it in one of my videos </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> yeah and then then the comments are just </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like no it actually works it actually </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> works trust me trust me and I'm like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> okay what is it so what what you do </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right is you just make a pinhole with uh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you make a pinhole basically a pinhole </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with like your hand or something and you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> look through it and then you're meant to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> be able to focus even if you have like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> short-sightedness I was like this is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> absolute [ __ ] and then I tried it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> and then it worked I was like what Oh I </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> thought you brought that up and it was </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] no I I want I thought it was I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> thought it was [ __ ] so what you're </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> suggesting is that people have bad </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> eyesight should wear glasses where the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> glasses like this big </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> tiny ones </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the H uh 30 H3 the what's that band </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> called uh 303 or three they should wear </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> those glasses </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know what the [ __ ] science is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like insane but I'm like why like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> something about my eyes is broken if all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I need to do is do this and granted I </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_04> read subtitles at all if I'm watching on </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> TV that's absolutely impossible for me </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_04> pinhole and suddenly I can see like one </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> word at a time I can only see one word </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> at a time but for some reason it works I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I have no idea I have no idea what it's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> basically the thing you know in school </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when you were learning how to read and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> you use the rule yeah </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> it's just that but now it's like one </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_06> this </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> basically it was like the most Asian </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like it was like the most Asian advice </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> you could ever think of it was just like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just just look harder </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> she was like son just uh just get good </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just get a good eyesight and it was only </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like until like I was like it was like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> three years down the line when we just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> had this [ __ ] realization of oh maybe </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just short-sighted so wait was it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I've always been interested so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was it like when you when your eyesight </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> goes bad when you're a child right yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is it like a gradual thing over like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> many years to the point where Suddenly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like the the change is so slow that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you don't notice the change happening </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> until it's too late or is it literally </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like you wake up one more and you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> like I can't [ __ ] see </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um honestly I my eyesight was bad to the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> point where look it's it's always been </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bad to the point where I don't remember </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> ever having good eyesight I don't think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've ever had a perfect eyesight I've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just like my some of my earliest </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> memories are having something on TV and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just me going ah I need to sit this I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> need to sit like this close to the TV in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> order to see the TV like I've never I've </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> never sat on the couch and be like okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I can see the TV TV I've always had to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> sound like near the TV </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> um obviously that was you know what made </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> my back my eyes like that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> in the first place uh according to Asian </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> parents but uh no like I've I've always </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> had bad eyesight and it was only when I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was like seven ish that I did I got my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> first glasses and I remember the first </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> time putting on glasses and I was like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> holy [ __ ] this is a life hack </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> what is this people's people's is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> normally yeah what well I think I saw </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that it was a long time ago there was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> this like our artist this digital artist </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that like Drew watercolor paintings of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what it would what the world looks like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to people who have bad eyesight and I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and like what looking at that painting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> as someone with normal eyesight I was </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> just like this is giving me a headache </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> yeah I'm like I'm like damn y'all live </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like this </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like holy [ __ ] so that's I think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's after that that I saw that that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> made me go like okay I need to like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really take care of my eyesight so like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> now whenever I'm like sitting in front </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of a computer or a TV or whatever or if </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> even if I'm like staring at my phone for </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a long time I always wear my blue light </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> glasses because I've always had really </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> really sensitive eyes I don't know why </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because like can you guys open your eyes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> in a pool yes I can't do it because like </SPEAKER_08>

<SPEAKER_00> the water all right I'm gonna open my </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> eyes and I did it for like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> one second and I was like it feels like </SPEAKER_08>

<SPEAKER_08> that's normal though but I pulled my </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> eyes out and all the whites in my eyes </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> were just bloodshot red yeah and my </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> parents were like oh that's that's not </SPEAKER_09>

<SPEAKER_08> like whole swimming sessions like an </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> hour doing it and it [ __ ] hurts </SPEAKER_08>

<SPEAKER_05> below back to the episode do you need </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah do you need to use dark mode for </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> everything yes are you dark mode because </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I'm not an [ __ ] I just think light </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> mode looks like [ __ ] yeah it's like and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> also I don't want to be that guy while </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm lying in bed and my partner is next </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to me </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> the only way the light mode is good is </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> like because the windows UI looks like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] let me see let me say you dark mode </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] play [ __ ] up too much okay </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> hi I'm I'm a light mode user yes I'm I'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> out of myself right now okay that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> probably why your eyes like [ __ ] yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah that's why because you're blinding </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yourself every night I've been blind my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> entire life What's it gonna do make me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> more you're literally like make me more </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> blind every time you've opened up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Twitter it's just like a Cod flashbacks </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> come on it's white so don't let the view </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> it is it is the people who use light </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> mode are people Psychopaths can't can't </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> get over the five second difference of </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> the changing the dark mode and be like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> it's different people like oh I don't </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> like it it's different take it back no </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like the moment you it for one day </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> you'll be like I'm a [ __ ] idiot yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> I never went back I I I have used dark </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> mode on like some apps and I'm like I </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like 10 seconds 10 seconds Discord </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> that's it my discord's still dark mode </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> and I'm like yeah I don't I don't </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> Discord in light mode is unforgivable I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't even know what this is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> okay this mod live mode just looks ugly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> that just looks like let's see it's </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> horrific but like everything else I've </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> switched to dark mode I'm like I kind of </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I like the brightness I like the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> brightness I do not use Twitter in I </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> looked up Discord light mode </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> like white mode mean do you want you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> want to check my Twitter </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> oh my God </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> who uses Discord like this yeah okay </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Discord Twitter I I like it in like mode </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> okay I can't remember if there was a few </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> studies or something a while back that </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> was like I it was measuring the impact </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> on which ones but a few darker light </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> mode I couldn't remember if there's a </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> conclusion I remember that there was </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> something along the lines of </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> um what light mode is could be better </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> because it's more reminiscent of say </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> books or paper yeah because I was gonna </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> say like Joey like you you like I'm in </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> bed okay I want to read manga yeah what </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> am I gonna do switch the manga to dark </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> mode manga doesn't have a dark mode you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know I Read Manga in my [ __ ] phone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> um oh that's one of them yeah okay okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> one of the big reasons I can't I think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> it's too bright and I would I would </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> argue that a lot of manga is more dark </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> than light a lot of the drawing is black </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> it's literally on white paint what are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> you talking about yeah </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> there's more ink on the paper than white </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> what are you doing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> what are you doing it's arguably more </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_09> dark than it is like okay maybe it's </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> something like berserk but like tell me </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> berserk is like berserk is a dark </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> fantasy of course he's gonna have so </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> many [ __ ] like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> but if I'm reading like pump team epic </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then that's like mostly why I'm just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> saying it's a live dog a lot of Doc in </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> them you know a lot of them have a lot </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> of words </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure even the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> most hardcore light mode person is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> watching this bite now being like no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> Connor I'm trying my best </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I I think there's saying the manga </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> argument is very negligible in terms of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is that light mode or not because </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there's gonna be some we're not saying </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> dark we're not [ __ ] knocked over yeah </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> who the [ __ ] it's not all dark </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> what we're trying to say is that </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> generally like the background and a lot </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of that stuff is dark which is nice and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's better because the phone is backlit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know well the thing is because like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> it's not traditional the reason I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> genuinely like light mode is because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> you've never tried dark mode I have </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> tried dark mode no I I I okay the best </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> actually the best mode is the one where </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> it switches for you automatically </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> depending on the time of day because the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> thing is I wake up screen dimmer yeah </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> the screen no not the screen dimmer </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> there's a little there's a literal mode </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that will switch on on some apps that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> will switch from light mode to dark mode </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like an in-car GPS yeah yeah yeah kind </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> of that's like the best mode but like I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> like when I wake up and I just have like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> the brightness of the screens okay one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> thing I genuinely generally welcome to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> your future robot slaves look genuinely </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because I'm someone who needs a lot of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> sunshine you know I I like my sunshine I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> like I like my brightness the way my </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> body are we gonna go do you touch grass </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I also enjoy sunlight but you know what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I do when I want to enjoy sunlight I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] go outside and look at something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> okay open my curtain okay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> obviously you guys have obviously you've </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> never lived in England when sometimes </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> it's just like a [ __ ] cloudy day and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> it's just the most </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I would not live in like the northern </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> hemisphere of like Finland in the middle </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] nowhere </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I will take any brightness Source I can </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> get the brighter the room is the happier </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> I am the more awake I am the more that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> probably why you're blind because you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> just flash banging your eyes every day </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> okay phone's lightness is not even </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> remotely comparable to a light in say </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> like a room like a ceiling light or </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> anything it's not even remotely they </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> also take every selfie </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> they also take every selfie with the </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> flash on no no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> to just be a bunch of [ __ ] phone </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> screens just lighting up the room like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what these lights are totally different </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> type of like I I do not want the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> artificial it's like I want white walls </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in my room I feel so much nicer </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> sunlight does feel so much nicer but </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sometimes you're in a room where you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> can't get enough sunlight sometimes </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> you're in a place where you know there </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> isn't enough natural light and there's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> just the lighting on the ceiling or the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> lamps the last Light I think about </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> getting to fix that problem is my phone </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> okay yeah I will say having having like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> having a bright mode on your PC is much </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> better to me like it it feels for the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> argument's sake I do use Windows Live </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> mode yeah because the dark mode I don't </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know what they did to it it looks </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] horrendous really yeah do you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> use it and I use I didn't even know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> there was a dog it just doesn't look </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> good I'm not sure why oh like it's all </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> it's it try it we'll do it later okay I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> mean what looks bad about light mode </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what what actually I don't get what are </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> you why everyone and says it looks bad </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> okay it's just really it's like having </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> like bread from a store and then you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> know and like you don't know a bakery </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> exists out there fresh bread right right </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> you're really clutch it does white light </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> mode does everything it's it's a very </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> viable option but it's just because you </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> don't know about the joyous ability you </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> can't just say it it hurts my eyes no no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> it doesn't no because it does it hurts </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> my eyes I just think dark mode </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's exactly what I'm saying dark mode </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> it looks better that's what we have </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> after dark because it's a better version </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> of trash </SPEAKER_08>

<SPEAKER_08> I Twitter to me is is I I can't unsee it </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> as a dark Mode app it just it when I see </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> it on light mode I'm like this is </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> [ __ ] like when you watch those </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> documentaries and that you know they </SPEAKER_08>

<SPEAKER_08> rather use I think that's [ __ ] </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> though what you're saying is the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> healthiest way is to not look at your </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> phone what we're arguing is uh well I'm </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> not really he's arguing around here I'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm you should look at the dark mode if </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you're gonna look I'm arguing that the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> best mode is the mode that switches </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> automatically automatically for you but </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> if I had a choice between dark mode and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> light mode I choose light mode because I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> don't want to switch manually to light </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> mode every time when I wake up in the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> morning and see all the boys that you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> don't like about dark mode what is it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that I don't like about dark mode it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> not that I don't like dark mode is that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I prefer light mode or why do you prefer </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> light mode I just I literally just said </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because I I said because I like the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> brightness in my life Joey I like this I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like the light okay I go towards the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> light I'm a [ __ ] moth okay </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I like the brightness why is that a bad </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> thing I like the brightness even darker </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> light mode light mode </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> everything everything you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> everything I think everything aside from </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> Discord because I see I think Discord </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Discord is actually War crime I think we </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> can all agree on YouTube light mode uh </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> everything's so bad in life </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> there's what is wrong with YouTube live </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> mode literally do what the [ __ ] logo </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> has white in it you know what a logo has </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> white in it it's like three pixels it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> doesn't matter okay you know what I hate </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> about YouTube is that you open it right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so you open YouTube yeah and it does </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> okay I did win this up sometimes right </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it'll just open white and then turn to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_09> dark oh yeah </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_07> I want to see a single I think they </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> fixed that recently though but a lot of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people you know uh it's something going </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> to consider yourself if you're making </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> thumbnails yeah I gotta make it for dark </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> and light mode to make sure let's get on </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> both I've never thought about it I don't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't I don't consider like so do you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> so yeah when you make your thumbnails do </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you actually consider that no white </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> background no nothing I try not to make </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> it yeah I look at both because I had it </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> in dark mode so I gotta be because </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> people leave on the default right oh I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just assumed no one watches YouTube in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> line mode </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> no it's default unfortunately yeah it </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> just means that our calls will never be </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the best yeah sad that's just I just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> don't I I okay people are lazy and they </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> just don't change the defaults because </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> they get used to something and then </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> they're too scared to change it like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> this guy have you changed it I guarantee </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> he wouldn't turn I have changed it I'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> saying this is not do not love me with </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the same people who are still using </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> Internet Explorer because they don't </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> have to change </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like a little little science experiment </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> what if you change the dark mode for a </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> week I'll change the light mode for a </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> week and then we can decide and see who </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> has the better eyesight at the end </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> do you think there is a chance you're </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> going to convert to light mode </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> I I started in light mode and then I I </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_01> ironically I saw the light and I I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> didn't like it so I went to the dark and </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that's what I'm in narrative so I I've </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> had the light mode because where I </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> started yeah I mean I had the life and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> then I learned about dark mode </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> afterwards and so I was like oh I'll try </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> this new dark mode thing out and I'll </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> say oh I much prefer because it doesn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> blind me every morning look I'm just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> saying like [ __ ] light mode is the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> pizza crust of the app world okay like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it feels exactly the same where you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> where if you choose to use [ __ ] light </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> mode people act like you've just </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> committed a [ __ ] War crime or </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> something you know a war crime against </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> their eyes or something okay that's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> that's what it feels like okay </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> all right what do you think uh is </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> winning right now in the poll I know </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> it's dark mode why do you think my stock </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> mode because because you you dark mode </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> guides are so [ __ ] vocal about it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> you you dark mode users because I'm sick </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> of being on the [ __ ] train look </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> across and the person next to me and </SPEAKER_08>

<SPEAKER_06> uses light mode confess your sin someone </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> replied it's gone Connor is going to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> defend dog mode like his life depends </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> Joey is gonna say I can see both sides </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> but prefers documents I feel so cool </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> down anyone who says light mode is a </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> sociopath look if there are 500 light </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mode users in the world I am one of them </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> I am one of them if there are 10 live </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> mode users in the world I am one of them </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> I will defend light mode until till my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> dying breath okay I don't care how many </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> of you guys are there because there's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> one or more of me of you if there's one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> more of me I found a brother okay like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> an AAA meeting but for light mode </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> why didn't we convert any time to like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> flickers or anything </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> we're gonna start a movement it's a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> revolution okay we're taking back the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> rise mode the resistance </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> it's one of the things when I when I </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> realized that doctor was a thing I tried </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> it out I was like oh this is much better </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's like it's like having a wrong </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> fitting t-shirt for the longest time and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> then you realize oh oh it can feel like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> this that's what it felt like to change </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> right right like a pair of boxes that </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> didn't quite fit as nicely but you </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> didn't realize that so you're only pay </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> for everybody was the app that convinced </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> you was it Discord because I swear for </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> me it was Twitter Twitter I started off </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> with Twitter because I think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a lot of apps don't even tell you that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> dark mode exists I didn't know it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> existed me neither and then I think I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> went on Twitter one day and they showed </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> the dark mode yeah they had dark like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> true dark and like the dim darker Navy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> dark I use that one love that one looks </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> amazing and then I thought hi what if </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> there's dark mode for other apps and one </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> time I shared my screen on Discord and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it was light mode I didn't even realize </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> dark mode existed and then all my live </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> stream people were like what the [ __ ] </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> what the [ __ ] no okay because like yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was exactly the same so it was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> like I saw it on on Twitter and I was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like oh let me try this out and I was </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> like see how people screaming it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> amazing </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> and I was like oh is that like a plug-in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> or something what is that have you </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> realized about most screenshots you see </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> on Twitter or dark mode yeah with like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> tweet memes don't think about it yeah </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> think about it think about it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_09> it doesn't matter how many it does like </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> I said if everyone was using dark mode </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> do you think people what they want that </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> is that is why take away that is why </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> this is the most depressed Society we've </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> had in all of history I guess this is </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> why this is the depressed generation </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> okay we haven't had that yet okay this </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> is why mental health is such a big deal </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> now it's because too many people are </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> using dark mode </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> I go to my Better Health session </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> after I lost my job and I use my </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> three-month coupon uh it's remittance no </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> it's because it's because people are </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> using light mode to substitute for some </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> social media that's why you're trying to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> grow like a planet </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> come on bro is that all I can feel the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> cells getting energy in my body </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> photosynthesis please don't be like a </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> cannabis plant bro trying to grow from </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> artificial life to this house </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> oh my god oh how the fun are we going to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> stop it I don't know welcome to trash </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> days I can't remember I don't know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because we're talking about haughtiness </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> oh yes let's talk about Isis yeah one of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the most interesting videos I've ever </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> seen actually is your Dogma like artists </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> um the artists who drew like as the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> world would look if you didn't have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> glasses yeah yeah right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um I remember seeing a video Once of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a blind artist and he was born like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> without eyes yeah and I was like one of </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the most interesting videos I've ever </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> seen because this guy's an artist but </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> obviously he's never seen anything in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> his life </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> um and he describes like what colors the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> concept of colors of what he thinks </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right and he's like oh I think I've seen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this yeah and he's like I don't get it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like people people have tried to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> describe colors to me people have tried </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> to describe colors to me and it's such </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> an interesting concept of how do you </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> describe colors to someone who's never </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> seen colors right now you can describe </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Orange </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think the general consensus because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah I remember seeing that video a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> while back the general consensus is like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> when you just uh when you talk about </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> things like the color red for example </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> right you think of like hot yeah or like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> blue is like a cool color yeah but when </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> you think about it it's like that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> doesn't mean anything yeah he's like so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> people describe to describe Reza's hot </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like what the [ __ ] does that mean </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah what does that mean why is hot a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> color </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> plus how the [ __ ] does that make sense </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> because like blue can be hot as well if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> you're talking about a blue flame yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah exactly so it's like it doesn't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> when you think about it it's like okay </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> how do you describe say like this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> particular shade of purple to someone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> it's trash days just trash dating it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like oh of course of course I've </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> seen trash teeth but wait a minute wait </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> a minute I've heard trash days before so </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> is his art good or what huh was it good </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah yeah it's like it's really well I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> think I think it's I don't know how does </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> he know what he's drawing I I think he's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> just I might learn am I ignorant am I I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think I think it comes with that whole </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> concept of like uh you know if you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> born blind or you're born deaf yeah that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> is that is normal to that person as it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is for the rest of everyone else who is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> born with sight or born with hearing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right yeah it's only I think I remember </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> like a comedian talking about this it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> only when normal people make it weird </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that it becomes weird for them right </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because like if someone is born deaf </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> then it's like well to them not hearing </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> anything is normal but it's not until </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> someone's like oh you're deaf oh you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can't can you can't hear music and it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like don't make it [ __ ] weird for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> them they're living fine I mean it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like if I didn't know like document </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> existed it wouldn't bother me I didn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know it existed right another when </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> someone points it out music existed I'd </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> be like whatever dude yeah exactly </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] music exactly </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but yeah like what's what what was what </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I found so interesting is he can still </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like he still can imagine let's say like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what a landscape looks like you know and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> what yeah you have your own </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> interpretation of what the description </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> could be or what you think it is yeah </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah that would visual you could still </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> visualize that yeah like I think one of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> honestly one of the coolest I'm gonna </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> call it ability even though it's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> kind of a condition because it it sounds </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like a [ __ ] ability is I think it's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> called like synesthesia or something </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> where you one sense is tied to another </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> yes right which is one which is one of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> the coolest things I've ever heard like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think uh we met uh Baron J John who </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> actually had synesthesia yeah and like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> he was telling his story about how you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know you say a word or you hear a sound </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and he sees like a certain color with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yourself yes and I'm like this is this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> is like this is the closest we've gone </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> to like X-Men in real life wait wait </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> wait wait wait wait hold up so like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_09> um </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> because let's say you said coffee to me </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> yeah obviously I'm going to picture </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> Brown </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's because you're associating it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> with the object that exists yeah if </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you're talking about say like a very </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> arbitrary concept that doesn't exist in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the Physical Realm and doesn't have a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> form for example </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> God </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I have an image like what color do you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> imagine that </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> uh you know white right but that's </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> because you're probably thinking about </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> God </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> when you say God do you think light mode </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> uh yeah I guess so yeah okay </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_00> okay here's another example here's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> another example when I say the number </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> three what color do you think of gray </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> why gray I don't know just thought of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that color what about number four </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> probably green why green though I don't </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> know it's green when you say color and </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> four I think green </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> like because of 420. </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> I don't think here's the thing I imagine </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> that it's like consistent right if they </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> if you always ask them for it would </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> always be the same color right if you </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> ask me four knit and then a color I I </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> would probably say a different color </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> every time right I really seem like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] year okay so so I looked up on </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Google for example right uh synesthesia </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is when you for example you hear music </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but you see shapes yeah uh or you hear a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> word or a name and instantly see a color </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh for example you might hear the name </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Alex and C green </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah so do you have that or are you just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> like no oh I think what you were doing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> was just like hearing a number speaking </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> random color green yeah I'd say the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> music one was a little sounds a little </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> familiar definitely seeing shape not </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like visualizing shapes to music that </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> sounds familiar but not not the other </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> ones right right well then maybe you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> might I feel that every music has like a </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> if you imagined do you know like if you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because it's like you know if you said </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> like rock in your head maybe you could </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> visualize what it would look like if you </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> were to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh like rock music yeah well it depends </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> for me I think I think like yeah no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> definitely like if you hear enough music </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you get into it then yeah you can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> definitely start to like Envision like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I've had moments where I've listened to </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> a new piece of music and I can Envision </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> what the music video but I don't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> actually see it right but I don't </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> physically see it yeah you physically </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> see it yeah you physically see it well </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like that's that's the condition </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that's synesthesia that's that's so it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like so it's like when you hear the word </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Alex yeah your vision your vision </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> because that color and it's not only </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> tied to Vision as well I've heard of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> some people where you it's tied to like </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> taste or something so why would this be </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> a superpower it sounds like a detriment </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I want [ __ ] shapes in front of my </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> eyes all the time well the [ __ ] I want </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> shapes you just [ __ ] with someone yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> if you just see me like Alex Alex </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> it is a real Condition it's one of the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> strangest conditions I know I think of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah it is I think it's like super cool </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> because it's like it's because you see </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like you see it clearly I'm pretty sure </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right yeah well obviously I don't have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> something well I don't know I don't know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> I've only used when you said the music </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> thing I said I I feel that it's like I I </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> didn't you imagine that yeah yeah but no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> no you physically see it yeah </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> yeah with like what font what Graphics </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> like what I don't know I don't know the </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> condition like like how would this look </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> this sounds what you should probably ask </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> someone any any viewers watching with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> synesthesia please explain in the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> comments feel free to inform us </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> Enlighten us this is my ignorance of </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> where I'm like this sounds too fake this </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I I think this is cool but like I I know </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> that's just because I can't because none </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> of you have it and none of you can sit </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> here </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> yeah it looks like you're explaining it </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> to me and none of you have it so I'm </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like this doesn't make any [ __ ] sense </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> to me oh yeah of course because I'm like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I can only I can only like imagine what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like but you know yeah I mean you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know I definitely can imagine things </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like my mind can wonder when I listen to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a piece of music for example I think </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anyone can do that but like physically </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> seeing something is very different huh </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> you got to be on some like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> hallucinogenics exactly if you're a </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> normal person that doesn't have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> synesthesia but for someone like this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like being on hallucinogenics all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the time okay so here's WebMD only the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> best sources of course one of the most </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> common responses to seeing lessons </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> numbers and also colors you might also </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> see or hear a word and taste food see </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> here so like so like say for example </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> what but like not not but I don't think </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_02> it it's the word that is associated with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the taste so it's not the same as like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hearing the word bacon and then tasting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> bacon it's more like a completely </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> different thing yes </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> let's say someone said bacon and they </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> might I would hear like be realistic </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> like it might not like that yeah maybe </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or vice versa if I said free real estate </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> okay </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> okay my ignorance on the subject and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> might not understanding of it is not one </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> of like disgust or yeah I just don't get </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> it and I want to understand because I </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> think it's different to when for example </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like you know if you see a picture of a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> lemon then you start salivating I think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's very different to that because that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is like an association with priests </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's that's an association with </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> pre-existing knowledge of what that is </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> but your brain is [ __ ] weird enough </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> where it could easily make pre-existing </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> bonds or ties to stuff oh of course I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> mean again that explains the whole thing </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> of like looking at a picture of a lemon </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> and salad yeah yeah I suppose that's </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> because I remember they did that when I </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> went to go get a PCR test in Japan like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> at the PCR Center they have pictures of </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_02> like sour plums and lemons there to help </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you celebrate </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> it was really funny I saw this </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> right now the explanation makes it sound </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like you like I I could believe it if </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> you </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> um you hear something and then it's a </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> very faint picture but like if it like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> was obstructing your view like what like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know I don't know like I want to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> know I'm sure there's different levels </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> of severity to it maybe it's like a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> light Hue or maybe it's just like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> putting a piece of green paper in front </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> of your face I don't know honestly </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> anyone says thank God I'm not a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> doctor if someone came with this [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> I'd be like all right [ __ ] off </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> he's just like no you know [ __ ] </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> I shave this what about you see five </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> [ __ ] off you stupid come on [ __ ] </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> office again you see colors and stuff </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> yeah I can see I can see as well I also </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> have eyesight </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> shout out to those doctors that just </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like believe people </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> no I I I know I mean to me it's like I I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> want to know more about it because I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't yeah it's is that like it's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> um a lot of the times I think that are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like personally and uh our brains are </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> very poor at understanding things we </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> have no concept of being able to like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> feel or experience ourselves yeah yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> so like when I'm asking all these </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> questions it's not out of like it's not </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> real it's like it's just like I just I </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> just want to know exactly how it feels </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> and what you're experiencing yeah well I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> think that's why it's so hard for us to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like say you know whenever you see any </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> kind of like charity movement or </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> something like that it's so hard to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> convince people with like facts and </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> numbers but you hear like you hear a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> story and you're like oh okay I get it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> there is an issue there's a problem yeah </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> and it's not again I want to preface </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this is not from like because I know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that this could be comparable to like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> say mental health and it's like oh well </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you know how could you say that you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> could argue that doesn't exist because </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you didn't feel it or you can't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> empathize with it that's not what I'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> trying to say it's that I it's not that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I I'm asking questions because I don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> believe or I don't necessarily uh you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know uh think it's real it's just that I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just want to know you want to get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I want to feel like I can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> understand and what exactly what it </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> feels like to have this thing it's </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> really fascinating as well because I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> just said I'm just reading more of the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> synesthesia thing on WebMD yeah only </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> trusted sources uh the color uh it says </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's internal mostly the colors are just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> in your mind only a few since </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that uh see colors outside their body </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> okay see that's that's what I would </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> argue right because I how do you </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> determine that though because when I </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> hear music sometimes I can like assign </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and feel and like if I would like I can </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> imagine like shapes yeah and stuff to </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> the music yeah yeah um because that's </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> just I don't know why but like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> physically seeing it well outside </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> basically seeing it that's that's what I </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> thought you meant yeah apparently there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are some cases if that's super rare I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> can understand that yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um but like yeah I feel like this is the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> artist getting described to what like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> what color is you know of course we're </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> never gonna be able to like visualize </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> that because we've never experienced </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> that so we're like yeah I mean I get it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> but I don't get it well because if that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> artist had that symptom for example then </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it'll be a lot easier </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> what color is red and it would just be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> like oh number four and he's like oh I </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> get it all right but the reason why you </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> ask like a billion questions when </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> someone says oh I have this thing is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that you're like well okay well we're </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> not gonna just we need to make sure sure </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> that we figure out what it is that you </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> you have yeah so we're going to be very </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> thorough and ask every single question </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> explain it all to me there's something </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> not adding up there's something </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> happening and then you go and contradict </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> it again later by saying this x thing </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like yeah I just want to know all </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> this stuff because I'm like I want to </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> just hear how it works because sometimes </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> you hear stuff and you're like that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> sounds like you made it the [ __ ] yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> what are your sources on that yeah yeah </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> well well you like listen iPhone 12. </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> but also like the older you are the more </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> you realize man you're it's a brave but </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> the brain is a brain is just [ __ ] </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> weird okay that's like the one thing </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> that I've never been able to like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> understand of like how how your brain is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just this powerful it's going into some </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> shower thoughts we're going to good </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Shadow thoughts now okay like split </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> personalities yeah not like that like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how how does how is your brain [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> capable of that okay so that is that is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> insane to me it's because there's two </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> brains </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> well I think a lot of the time stuff </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> like trauma can cause that right yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> it's like it's like a defense it's like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> an internal defense for some people for </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> others it's not but like there's a many </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> reasons why you're you're brain anatomy </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> or whatever could have the decision that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this is how you're going to deal with it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or this is what's going to happen yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right yeah it's like it's a defense </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mechanism the way I always try to like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> explain to people if this ever </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> accommodation never comes up which it </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> really does but like for example </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> one thing that weep as humans believe </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> without a doubt is that when I've seen </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> something I saw it yes like I 100 saw </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> this you can't change my mind right and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> it's like well no because we have we </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> have many many occasions where like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> witness testimony where they swear they </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> saw it and they swear on their life and </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> it's been not not maliciously because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> they had no reason to lie and it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> just wrong like it just did not happen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it did not align so like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like the brain memories perception it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all like almost it changes at times I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mean that's like if your memories can't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> be trusted as being fact and and what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> you saw like who knows what else to [ __ ] </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> your brain is making out oh yeah and I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> mean you know that's like the whole </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> basis on like sleight of hand magic for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> example it's like your brain immediately </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> thinks oh that card disappeared yeah but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> no it's just your brain just can't keep </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> up with it it's like our brain is like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> an algorithm that has chosen the best </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> way to do things </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> yeah you know I actually have a theory </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> okay going on a slight hand I'm not a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> scientist with none of us are sorry guys </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> this is my theory and of understanding </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> of stuff I've seen yeah okay so I I have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a theory so you you guys have all felt </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Deja Vu right yes of course yes you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> everyone everyone's felt deja vu in one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sense or form even if they've never been </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> to a place or been in this situation </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> I've been in this place before yeah I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> haven't been to this place before </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> so like I have a theory that Deja Vu </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> comes from like you experiencing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> basically the same thing in your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> imagination maybe through dreams or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> something like that because like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> possible yeah yeah because I when they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> say that you remember all of your dreams </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like how that's that's [ __ ] I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> remember none of my dreams but I I </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> believe like some people will say that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah you remember all of your dreams </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> even if you can't recall them and I have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a theory that Deja Vu is your </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> subconscious brain being like I have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> seen this before in my memory somewhere </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> yeah yeah and come back in 300 years to </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> find out yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have you ever felt jamaivu before what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the [ __ ] is that it's the opposite of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> deja vu </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that sounds like a dance move </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> what were you experiencing you're like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've never experienced it I've never </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> experienced something before and but you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's a real thing what have you had </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> what happened I I've never experience </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> we're just asking </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> because it's a thing I don't know I'm </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> pretty sure like Alzheimer's right just </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> describe Alzheimer's </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that's just a fancy word for outside </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like doctor here's jummy food I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> have I haven't been to this place before </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> even though I have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for myself </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> that's just Memento yeah I think our </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> brains are computers in a way they're </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> very good computers and yeah computers </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> you know what's my favorite Channel </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about the brain because the brain named </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> itself </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think about that for a second </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> think about that for a second </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> I realized the moment I was going to say </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it yeah I knew you're going to say I'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like [ __ ] this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I love that one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> I love Connor just like processed for a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> minute and like nope it's not worth it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_06> [Music] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> although one of the freakiest videos </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I've ever seen which I still [ __ ] if </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I want to go to into like an existential </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> crisis I watch this video it's like a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> cpg gray video called like there are two </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> of you or something like that okay where </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> he explains that you know there's the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> right side of your brain and then </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> there's the left side of your brain yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> right </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> and uh so that's connected Vera nerve </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> but there have been cases in medical </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> history where they've had to like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> disconnect the nerve connecting the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> right and left side of the brain yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> um and you can still function as a human </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> being right right but </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> only I think once one other side of your </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> brain is like is in charge of speech </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> right yeah yeah and the other is like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> part of like motor skills and stuff like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that right yeah I mean yeah I believe </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that one side uh if I remember this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> correctly one side of your brain control </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> was one side of it and the other one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> controls the other side of it yeah so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there have been cases where you've had </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the split brain </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and uh they've given like an apple to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> let's say the rights uh they've they've </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> put like the right </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> I'm going to take a toilet break and I'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> going to watch the video and then I'm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> gonna explain it because that's too easy </SPEAKER_08>

<SPEAKER_08> episode this is for the brain right so </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> every explanation you have for it is is </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> not a who don't even [ __ ] know what's </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> happening we don't know what's happening </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> it's way way complicated more than we </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> could ever imagine yes it's the brain </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> trying to understand the brain exactly </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> the brain we don't it's too much we </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> don't know what the brain is so when </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> people are like the left side right side </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> made one personality one good it's like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> no that's oh that's it we'll pack it in </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> there thank you so much thank you so </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> much for that </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> oh okay thanks so we know when to stop </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> the scientists stop wasting all the </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> money don't research anymore it's the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> brain trying to convince itself on how </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> it works we like easy answers because </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> we're humans and it doesn't [ __ ] work </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> like that no of course not and that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> why like study is still being done but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like I think you know with modern </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> technology we are getting a much better </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> obviously yeah I mean we're gonna take </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> educated I reckon one like surface level </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> at this point in time it's like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> understanding how the brain works all </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> right tell me about the [ __ ] left and </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> right side and why you're wrong all </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> why I'm wrong okay wrong predisposition </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> Conor's brain is like I don't believe </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> any of this this is [ __ ] brain is a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> lie he's lying he's lying come on my </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> brain is like don't trust that brain all </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> right that brain is full of [ __ ] Connor </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> all right so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there have been cases where for medical </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> reasons uh they've split the left and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right side of the brain so they've split </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> any kind of connection between the left </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> and right and the right side of the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> brain but your left and right side of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> the brain is in charge of different </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> things so there have been cases where it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> feels like to a patient of one of these </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> conditions that the like they would make </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> her they would try to pick something and </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then their other hand would kind of like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> disagree with them they they noticed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> some disagreement with disagreement with </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that right and so they they have done </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> some tests right where they say they </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> give a command to let's say the left </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> side of the brain and it's beloved </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> division give a command to the left side </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of the brain like pick up uh Rubik's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Cube and they show nothing to the right </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> side of the brain right and they ask </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> them okay did you pick up an object and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the the guy answers because only one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> side of it is in charge of speech no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> didn't pick up anything and then so they </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> give the instruction for like the left </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> side to put the Rubik's Cube on the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right side and the scary thing is that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> because one side is in charge of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> reasoning they'll just like make up a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> reason that that a cube has just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> suddenly appeared in their hand they'll </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> let they'll they'll reason that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> something like oh I've just always </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> wanted to solve a Rubik's Cube or </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> something like that and that is like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> terrifying yeah I believe that this </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> experiment could have taken place and </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> could have happened yeah I just don't </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> buy into the whole the right and left </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> side thing and I mean it seems to me I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> mean that's your right side of your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> brain that's your reasoning logic side </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_06> operation when we took many people </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> so I also Google dicks I'm pretty sure I </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> heard this was a myth one time yeah I </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> Googled it and apparently this is also </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> there is some very very very very slight </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> truths to have different areas of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> brain work but it's not that easy where </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just left and right obviously if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you start cutting the brain up weird </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> shit's gonna happen yeah like the dude </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> who had a whole [ __ ] pipe rammed </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> through his brain and survived yeah who </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> started being way more Angry like when </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> you take out uh the is it the frontal or </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> frontal cortex for the cortex yeah I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> think you people start acting way more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> Angry yeah get way more </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> uh I guess what's the word like isn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that like your reason and logic side of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> your mind yeah I mean you do okay from </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> what I understand you can't just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cut the same thing out of every single </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> brain and the same results are going to </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> happen like it's like if you see there </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> are some parts though like the amygdala </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for example which is like the part of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> your brain that operates emotions right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> if you cut that out of any person then </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> maybe not all of your emotions are going </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to disappear you're not going to turn </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> into like a [ __ ] it's whatever but </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> like a lot of emotions is controlled by </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> that part of your brain so if you cut it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> out then you'll definitely be less </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> emotive oh I just thought they were </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> called kudaris yeah kudres are just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> I don't know I think even remotely </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> pretending like we understand one tenth </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> of brain science </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I took psychology one in college </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> tries to attempt to be to be brain </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> Science </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> question of like what are you you know </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> can you bring this topic up if none of </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> us know [ __ ] anything about it are we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> allowed to talk well we can yeah we can </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> make speculations I'm betting the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> brain's gonna [ __ ] end tomorrow </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> speculating well it's like not if if not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> even [ __ ] you know professional </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> scientists who work on this kind of [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> day in and day out fully understand </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what's going on then I think that leaves </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> enough Liberty for people have no idea </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to talk about it as well also like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> because it's like talking about this </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> season oh is that like a bad I don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> know well I don't know like I feel like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> that argument is used to discredit </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> scientists I hate that argument no but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of course but like what we are talking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> about in this episode isn't going to </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> hurt someone no no like someone's not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know no one watching this is going </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> to be like oh [ __ ] I already got my </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> frontal low back feelings I'm feeling </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> too many things told me to cut my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> amygdala out you know no one's gonna </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] No One's Gonna Do That </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean it's [ __ ] insane that at one </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> point you know a lobotomies existed I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just I just find that insane you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> how that was just like a tree is there </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> any times where it's I still used not no </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> no no </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> I hope I really hope not I think they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> very quickly realized that you are just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> basically killing someone inadvertently </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> but like I I mean I mean it's just the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> equivalent of when you have an old CRT </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and you just start hitting it on the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> side to make it operating in take out </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> your brain yeah have a brain transplant </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah yeah yeah you know your brain is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> [ __ ] for some reason yeah </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> keep you alive you know whatever and </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_07> they put a new brain in it I don't know </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> they can't do that I'm pretty sure but </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> um </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> brain transplant it's possible for some </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> reason we can keep you alive we can give </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> you a new brain yeah yeah are you still </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> you no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> no no he just you just described the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> [ __ ] plot of ghost in the show </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> literally yeah it's like if you if your </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> soul is inside of an Android is that </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Android really is your soul in your </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> brain </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> women </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> now we're getting into like the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> religious terrorists [ __ ] what's the I </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> love that [ __ ] what's the name of </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that thing go on go on say a thing about </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> the new one he's gonna bring up a meme </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> they're really deep thing so like Uganda </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Knuckles </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> [Laughter] </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> uh uh thesis oh yeah where you replace </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> everything right right right yeah do you </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> want to explain what the ship of thesis </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> is for people yes so obviously there's </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> this this question that is arised where </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> if you start with a ship let's say </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> you're getting a long Voyage from the UK </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> to America [ __ ] knows how long back then </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> yeah and every now and then while your </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> ship is going along this route you know </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> a plank of wood snaps off here maybe you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> change some wood here you found after </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> doing this whole journey that your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> entire ship has sort of changed nearly </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all of its parts and the ship is kind of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a little bit different and it's not the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> same ship but it's still called the ship </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> of thesis yeah is it is it still the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> same ship even if you change every part </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> over time well technically speaking if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we're getting into shower thoughts </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> territory humans are also that way </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> because it's like we're constantly </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> reproducing cells in our body cells die </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and then we make new cells to replace </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> those older you know you replace your </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> skeleton as well right yeah yeah so </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> here's the question do you knew that I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> didn't yeah yeah yeah so you you there </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is a point where you literally replace </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> every cell in your body yeah you replace </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> every cell in your body right so </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> basically us now there is not a single </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cell in our body right now that is the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> same cells that we had when we were why </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> am I getting [ __ ] thank God beta cells </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> right now they're replacing my good </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> shells with shittier old cells stop stop </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> making me old no but here's the thing </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> right here's another shower thought </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> newer cells are still making you older </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> how does that work because they're </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> copying it themselves Joey they're just </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> copying over and over again okay but are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you the same person that you are as a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> baby if all of the cells that you had as </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a baby are now non-existent in your body </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because they've been replaced with newer </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> cells you're not the same person as </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> Hostess right huh it's all mitosis what </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> what's mitosis cells duplicate okay oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> okay yeah but they're duplicating </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> okay but it's my [ __ ] fault but I'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> introducing McDonald's to the mix that </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> would have been fine if I gave them what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they wanted but no I had to bring a Big </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Mac and many milk shakes and then the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> cells started [ __ ] duplicating like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> crazy so [ __ ] dying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> do you know I'll find [ __ ] shitty and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> dumb what like you know this argument if </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> you tell me something dumb I'm gonna </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> kill you no it's just like it's just </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like cool like McDonald's all this fast </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> food [ __ ] pizza bad for you why is your </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> body making them taste good why no no I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> think that's how it is </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> the argument of all the healthy [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> tastes gross and all the bad [ __ ] for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you tastes good yes that's that is if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that isn't the biggest troll your brain </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> has played on you bro like I don't know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what it is I thought Evolution was meant </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to like help you you know why why have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> we not evolved to a point where at least </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> healthy foods had like tasted a bit </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> better because humans are privilege this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> isn't even be a question right yeah if </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> we were to evolve as say a species and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> you know how we're like oh yeah [ __ ] </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> rats they love [ __ ] peanut butter </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> they love it they love it right why do </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> we not all like the same things </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> what do you mean why do we not all enjoy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> the same Foods </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> it's blunt </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm just saying I'm just I'm just saying </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> what you're asking is for us to be </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> programmed the same where we just think </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that every like oh carrots are top 10 </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> delicious uh food everyone on Earth </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> agrees okay but here's the question </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right why is it that humans turned out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> that way but animals you know you know </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> God didn't like this whatever mystical </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> [ __ ] made the Earth didn't make pizza we </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> did that yeah we came up with that [ __ ] </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> right if you were like uh this weed [ __ ] </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> this uh cheese stuff that we figured out </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> how to make we should start combining </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> [ __ ] we did that that's not that they </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> didn't well I think when Evolution </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> happened they didn't know that the Big </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> Mac super Royale was gonna exist </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they weren't prepared that's on us the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> one we threw that into them one thing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> that can be Darwin a [ __ ] big mac oh </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> my God </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> also another question another [ __ ] up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Evolution has led us to the Big Mac </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> sauce we you we keep saying this </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> Evolution thing like every evolution is </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> good not every evolution is good what's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a bad Evolution trait that we got think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> of like half the [ __ ] birds that died </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> how do you die out as a bird you gotta </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> be really [ __ ] trolling to die out as </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> a bird that's the whole point of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> evolution Connor so it's a vital of the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> finish what are you talking about so the </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> point is you're implying that every </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> single evolution is a good Evolution not </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> true not every evolution it turns out to </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> be as beneficial as others that's why </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> only the best one keeps going right </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> maybe we are the humans that are not </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> doing good but we just feel how to </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> survive anyway but we're evolving into </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> shitty traits but we're just really good </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> at [ __ ] slapping a massive Band-Aid </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> on it think about it right yeah I mean </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> that's that's a genuine argument yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> implying that every evolution is good </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> not every single level </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> the way you're using the word no no no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> evolution is the whole point of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> evolution is survival of the fittest if </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> if we we broke the game if we evolved </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> we [ __ ] it up what I'm trying to say </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is every evolution should be a good </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Evolution because if it isn't then we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> would die off but yes I believe we have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gotten too smart and we have broken the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Evolution game okay what if for example </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> what if we are just we're probably just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> another like Pawn in this game right </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> like the next evolution of humanity is </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> might be the newer version and this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> version of us might be the ones that die </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> out in a couple thousand years who the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> [ __ ] no here's the thing right yeah if </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> we truly lived in a [ __ ] Evolution </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> let's do it right yeah people who had </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> like incurable diseases would would die </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> out yes right but we don't let that </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> happen because we're not [ __ ] </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> monsters we're trying to help people </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> exactly we have evolved I guess empathy </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> what's the most powerful trait a heart </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> a soul Evolution doesn't care about </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> about your feelings well then we we </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> evolved evolution is just the epitome of </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> get good so [ __ ] your feelings the first </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> humans yeah yeah whatever the [ __ ] they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> were yeah false yeah we even cared about </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> other weaker members of the the group in </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> evolution we don't know why why did we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> evolve to be like this I don't [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> know it's not like and realistically </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> it's not a a trait that helps us to </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> survive in any way but but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> imagine that humans don't you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> suggesting then that only humans are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> creatures that are able to feel empathy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> no that's not true why do any creatures </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> develop it I mean it could be beneficial </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean because it's beneficial to the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> past if you have like a herd kind of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> like culture then if they didn't exist </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> in animals packs wouldn't exist but we </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like we've gotten to the point where </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> we're like we're not concerned about the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> next evolution of human beings we're </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> just trying to [ __ ] get everyone to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> get alive well the thing is we don't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we're not concerned about it because we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> haven't been around long enough to feel </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that change yeah right like like birds </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_09> for example have been around for </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_02> literally millions of years so obviously </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> they felt that change humans have only </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> been around for like what a couple </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> thousands but we see we see uh changes </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> in every like generation of people you </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> know like of course like you know today </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] that we did yeah us today are </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> nothing like humans a thousand years ago </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> yeah no I I I I I that's Evolution </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> already and that there are some right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> taller yeah we're taller yes we're more </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> Alpha yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> John Wick to get our [ __ ] juice you </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> know what I mean like we had to make </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that [ __ ] up </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah I mean there are like there were </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like habits within us that you know that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we don't understand yeah and we still </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> have and I've you know people think it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> due to Evolution like I don't know why </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> people like you see someone yawning and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> you feel like the need to yawn </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> you're like talking Evolution like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> ayon you yawn no that's true </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> tell me tell me why that happens can we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> see someone yawns it sends from your </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> eyes it sends a signal to your brain </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> where your brain says you're next okay </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> oh this might be the most scientifically </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> inaccurate traffic of all time but [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it let's roll </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> this isn't science this is shower </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> thoughts yeah right so humans right </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> great great awesome so I like them our </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> priority is to make as many of us as </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> possible yeah if you think about the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah the survival Instinct of us right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Japan's sweating right now yeah but why </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> why why do like none of us give a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> about doing it what you </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> that doesn't even have to do with the </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> fact </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's not even about that it's like every </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> human I think most humans on planet </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Earth can agree that I think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> subconsciously we're all thinking right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> now [ __ ] planet's dying we have to save </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the planet you ask someone how do we do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it everyone's like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm [ __ ] know we know how to do it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> but the people in charge on [ __ ] </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> doing it yeah exactly see lack of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> empathy </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I mean it's it's lack of like it's it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> a bad trait of the human mind I guess if </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we're going into this place where we </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> can't really conceptualize a problem </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> this vast right we're only able to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> conceptualize literally either stories </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we hear about or most of us our </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> immediate problems and the immediate </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> issues that's the real shower thought </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> did we evolve to develop empathy or did </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we evolve further where we think we have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> empathy </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> no no that's [ __ ] </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> do we actually have empathy did we just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> build the knowledge where we think that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> empathy is a healthy social construct do </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you think because let's be real if like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> why do you think for example every </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> zombie apocalypse film that happens </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right immediately it's like oh the the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> monsters want the zombies the monsters </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> were within we're the real monsters all </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> because at the end of the day when it </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> comes to actual survival right like </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> think of every apocalyptic movie you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> don't see people being [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> empathetic they're the ones that die </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> first yeah that's a zombie movie though </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> okay yeah but say for example okay if </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> it's like okay here's where it's all </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> came from right yeah right is it you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> know human beings have have the natural </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> um want to be accepted in their like </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> group yeah that's what we've just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_09> evolved to do yes empathy is just a </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_02> branch of that it just came from that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah because it's just a social </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> construct yeah but and it just boils </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> down to the need that we want for the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> government we just want to fit in </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> do you think we've gone too smart maybe </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> because here's the thing you know we're </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> done look at what we're [ __ ] doing to </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> the planet we're clearly dumb as [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but the thing is the thing is we got </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> smart enough to [ __ ] it up but not smart </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> enough to figure out how to fix it yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> as a group right I think any creature </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that develops the science of thinking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about science we haven't gone too far of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> making stuff yeah and they're not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> thinking about how it's going to work </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> but also and then just implementing it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah but also like for example you you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> talked about you know the you know it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> should be </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um human nature to self-preserve you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> know to make more of us to preserve the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> human race but we've gotten so smart </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that in some places of the human race </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we've gone smart enough to just not make </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that decision yeah you know which which </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> completely we've gone to the idea now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> that it's not a natural instinct Joe </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> Rogan conversation </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I haven't even had any DMT I I wanna I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> wanna shoot some [ __ ] horse </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> tranquilizer or something is that what </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> you do is that what you're doing you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all holding imaginary blocks right now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> everyone will all be holding up everyone </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> must think we'd be like high as [ __ ] man </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> if I was like 90 years old and had </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> classes you guys would just think I'm </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> the expert like I'd be honest so you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> gotta talk well that's why he's got the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> glass I wouldn't even plan for this [ __ ] </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I just happened to bring glasses yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah [ __ ] it's I don't I don't know I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> feel like these are damaged [ __ ] we are </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> we are dumb no we are soda we've </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> developed really specific parts of our </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> brain to think that we're smarter but in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> reality we're still [ __ ] dumb in a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> lot of that actual like apes we're still </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> Apes we're just monkeys in shoes yeah we </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we're Apes floating on a rock like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> flying through space but we've been </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we've but we're smart enough to know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that we're smart we're smart enough to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> develop things that I could exactly like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] wipe us off the face of the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Earth We're smart enough we're not only </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> smart enough to know that but we're also </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> smart enough to not give a [ __ ] isn't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that [ __ ] up isn't that [ __ ] up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> we're fully aware that we are just a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> tiny think of dust in space and with but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and yet we are still smart enough to be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like yeah yeah but [ __ ] whatever you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> know I I I'm I want to go to work this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> is one of the weirdest [ __ ] episodes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of trash days I think we've ever [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> filmed yo trash taste philosophists </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Where You Are </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> isn't but that's another thing right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like I think the the first time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that we saw like actual human evolution </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> was when Aristotle was just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> philosophy is a thing now yeah right </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah because it's before because I wanna </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_06> because I always found that weird </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> that like I can't like has it did it </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> really take that long for Humanity for </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> someone to be like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm thinking about it okay so so why </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> okay okay okay okay </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like one day someone was like I'm </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> thinking about something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> no why no this is so short-sighted to </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> think that there's there's always been </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> people who have thought about [ __ ] </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> before that yeah we were really [ __ ] </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> bad we were like should we keep a record </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> of stuff no and then Who's Gonna Keep </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> the records </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> we were having too many wars we were </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> killing each other all the time and </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Woody when you take over a place are you </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> gonna keep their [ __ ] thoughts on a </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> piece of paper [ __ ] that [ __ ] I'm </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> burning that [ __ ] [ __ ] down he </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> was dumb as [ __ ] I killed him right I </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> don't want to know what he thought I </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> wanted these people thought so we were </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> just too busy trying to get by no and </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> this is not what we're doing today </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Aristotle we're just doing that's why no </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> one cares about climate chains because </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> we're like they're damn gas prices are </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> making my survival harder it's all a </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> full circle </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> we all keep [ __ ] ourselves and the </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> people in charge keep [ __ ] us that's </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> what I'm saying I just love how you make </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it sound like Aristotle invented </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> thinking </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> I did not he invented the he invented </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> the science of culture no he's the only </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> one that we remember and that we </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> bothered to keep his [ __ ] books </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> around everyone else we wiped from do </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> you know how many like civilizations </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that Britain probably [ __ ] raided and </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> just destroyed all their records well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then you're suggesting that before </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> Aristotle there was no writing no there </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> was but we just didn't keep it right we </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> burned it or got rid of it or let it go </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> to waste but then wouldn't you think </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that if someone before Aristotle had </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> come up with the idea of things </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> okay okay so make um let's make </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> something up I'm not sure let's do it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> let's do a little let's do a little </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> thing uh let's say you're the kingdom of </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> uh what's your kingdom called uh Deez </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> Nuts the kingdom of Deez Nuts right you </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> have uh what's your philosopher called </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> uh [ __ ] Tits McGee so Tits McGee is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> made basically like these amazing books </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> books that the Deez Nuts Empire just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> reveres yes well turns out they spent a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> little too much time thinking and not </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> raising their army and Chad gone over </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> here comes and destroys the kingdom of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> these nuts right and he thinks that your </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> race is just inferior because you </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> couldn't beat him in battle so let's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> destroy all your word stuff because we </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> don't care about what you say and we'll </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> take the fun little Bridges you built </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> and the little toys you built okay then </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> here's the thinking we don't want that </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> so we destroyed that because we're gonna </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> our own guys are smarter because we won </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> if you guys were smart they would have </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> thought about it okay then if that's the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> case then why did we keep the books from </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> the Greeks </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> well I mean it was it was closer to our </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> time period where preservation of </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> information mattered more right and </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> culture started mattering more right </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> stuff like that started to become more </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah but it's not like it's not like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> when the Greece popped off suddenly </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> we're all like don't burn the books </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> everyone no no no no but it's like it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> like it was a gradual thing I mean </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> there's a number of factors to why that </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> period and other periods like the Roman </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> stuff is so well documented right and </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> it's because a lot of the times as well </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> when and when these places would get </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> taken over other the other places taking </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> them over or whenever the empire fell or </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> whatever they might also have a respect </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> for what they've the stuff that they've </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> also shared or come up with right no I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> get that but like if I wasn't specific </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> people I feel like this is wrong oh no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> it's absolutely wrong I have no </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> information on this this is just like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> this is what I'm imagining for like a </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> thousand of years we were terrible at </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> keeping any documents about anything </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right no but I believe like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> I don't believe Aristotle I don't even </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> know if he was technically there's no </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> idea he was the first I don't believe he </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> was the first one I believe he might </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> have been the first one to actually put </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> a name to it he was the only one smart </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> enough to be like I'm thinking really </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> hard I should probably make I should </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> probably put this under a word so </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> everyone can know what I'm doing right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> now well they're just thinking yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> there's other you know other sects of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> life that are very closely tied he's </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just those he's the world's first five </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> what religion is just philosophy just in </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> a nice package in like a DLC like think </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> about it like the philosophy of like </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> it's like a religion and that whole </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> thing is it's like a it's like a whole </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> package I mean that's a whole lot okay </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> you know what I mean yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> it's just a way of life in a way of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> agreeing to how you think it is like so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> saying that he's the first one is just </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> completely wrong but but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> then right taking that taking that logic </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of like you know uh say for example when </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The Barbarians took over the Romans </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right why was it then that the all the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Roman stuff is so much more well </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> preserved than say all the stuff before </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it even though the barbarians probably </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> didn't give a [ __ ] about the one I'm not </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> a historian so I can't tell you that </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah historians please let us know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> because I always wondered that I'm sure </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> there's because you know what was the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> turning point where people were like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe we should start respecting other </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> cultures to the point where we preserve </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> their stuff I think I think it goes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> beyond that it's like you you get to a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> point in society where you realize oh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> being smart about sorry being powerful </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> having a powerful Army that maybe there </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> may be more to life than just taking </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> over people you know maybe there may be </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> more to life otherwise half the things </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in society wouldn't matter right exactly </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> but what was the Turning Point that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> what I want to know what was the Turning </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Point yeah what was the turning point </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> between let's burn everything and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> everyone that they've ever loved so that </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> we can pretend it never existed no no no </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> there's always been empathy right it </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> just you know at different times in the </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> Life in history people value different </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> things right at one point they valued </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> you know they maybe they realized oh we </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> could also sell this stuff oh we could </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> do stuff with this instead of just </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> destroying it all and pillaging and all </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> that stuff yes yes yes of course of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> course </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yes it's just yeah sure I mean like if </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> like I don't think we should </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> discredit not even discredit but play </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> Down how important philosophy very much </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> philosophy has come to like shape just </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> how we how we live and everything like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that because you're looking like you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> look at like the such different </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mentalities and way of thinking between </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> let's say like the west and like the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> East you know and you see a lot of a lot </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of people who are in Asia was very much </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um their mentality is very much based </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> from that Chinese philosopher who I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> forget the name of now each one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Confucius Confucius Confucius right that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is it's just like it's gone so far back </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that it's literally steeped in society </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> and like yeah the the mentality </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> that's also another problem is that yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> Socrates yeah sorry I got that </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> completely wrong place or every </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> Aristotle </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah sorry I'm not educated enough to </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_07> know who yes </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> none of us are educated by the way sorry </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's Socrates so also as well another </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> thing has to be taking into account is </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that our history and our understanding </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> of it is very English Central </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> centralized yes we don't know </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> um we're not we don't educate about like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Asian history or African history as much </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> as we should so our view of the world </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> inherently as well already is already </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> biased as [ __ ] well we're like yeah the </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> Greeks man there's [ __ ] guys it's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> another the dudes who they know what </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> they're talking that [ __ ] out oh there's </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_07> other people uh trying to [ __ ] them I </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_09> don't know what's going on you know what </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> I mean </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> yeah </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_01> but you know it's like a it's a very </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> close proximity and it's a history that </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> a lot of people have subscribed to for a </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> lot of time so we're biased as [ __ ] yes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> course this is hard as [ __ ] because just </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_09> this is like too much stuff it's just </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_02> too much for any one person to keep </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> track of everything and have a good </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> globally minded view on everything so </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah that's why we haven't evolved far </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> enough for that yes no we're never going </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> to we're not brain is already running in </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> like 110 we might you never know what do </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you mean again we might just be the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Neanderthal in the chain of humans we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> don't know that Japan has barely figured </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> out web design I'm not getting I am not </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> holding up any hopes for our [ __ ] </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> brain capacity to evolve I mean yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah it's gonna take millions of years </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> and I think we'll we're going to invent </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> something that I can think better than </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> nothing I mean that's computers we've </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> already invented something that can </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> think better than that that's all right </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> we're gonna be owned by Jeff Bezos uh </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> that's the point of this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Jeff Bezos is going to be like Angeles </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in the sky it's like a big face that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> just overlooks the Earth yeah exactly </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> yeah I mean it's complicated yeah yeah </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> of course that's the episode it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> complicated but that's why I like these </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> kinds of discussions because it's just </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> like a never-ending like list of what </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> ifs that let's be real it's like no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> one's ever gonna [ __ ] know the answer </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> it's like it's like it's like three guys </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> in an old person home trying to remember </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> what they all had for breakfast and none </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> of them actually no we're just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> theorizing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> four days ago so [ __ ] you it don't you </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> know like I feel like uh you didn't even </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> come into this all her focus on four </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> days ago what do you mean you missed out </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> you weren't even here four days ago </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> holy [ __ ] I have a lot of strong </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> opinions for being wrong </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> what do you mean </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> this many episodes to figure that out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> I'm just saying I'm fully aware of that </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> I I know his brain's developed enough to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> tell us at least at least you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> acknowledge that at least if you tell me </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> some facts I'll believe you yeah </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> if you give me some information you're </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like this is what some dude said online </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> who's very knowledgeable I'm like all </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right right I'll just trust the sauce </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> sometimes sometimes you just like this </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> is the problem though is that when when </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> you're like do you believe Socrates </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> invented velocity or no he didn't invent </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> philosophy it literally says he invented </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> philosophy before Socrates there was no </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> concept of philosophy that we believe </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> that we know of but like but like I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> don't I don't think that he invented </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like documented and organized it made it </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> appealing yes yes I agree I don't think </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Socrates was the first person to let's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> say think really hard he had tried a </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> shape don't [ __ ] come at me and tell </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> me that no nobody else thought about </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> some of the stuff was he like was he the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> first person to let's say make it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> marketable </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> yes make it fashionable </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> it did he kind of did well people people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> would come what a simple trick people </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> would come to listen to Socrates talk </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> yes right this is this is no different </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> than [ __ ] fortune tellers back in the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> day this is like another branch of just </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> talking talking [ __ ] and trying to make </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> people believe it but this one just </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> happened to be actually saying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> no no but like it's in my mind it's like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the same realm of stuff of where it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> began from right it's like the business </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> of trying to to talk to people and </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> preach stuff for money and and trying to </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> do that yes yes well like it's like I </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> guess what we do I guess we're getting </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> into it really philosophical discussion </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> of how do you even Define philosophy oh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> God we're doing it again </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_03> right now we have things how do you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> define we are thinking about this is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> like what we have we support so we talk </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> about sports this time we said that you </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> know who invented uh no you didn't </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> invent football you maybe made it like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> after like an official sport with rules </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> and and a league and stuff like yeah you </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> may be that country did that but like if </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> you've been [ __ ] kicking a ball </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> around you know what I mean you're the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> first person to kick something around </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah and play a game with it no but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's a little bit different because </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's more like instinctual right like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> philosophy is inherently we are </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> instinctively thinking like no yes </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> humans are but what I'm saying is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> animals aren't like a fish isn't saying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that well no but that's what I'm saying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like there has to be like a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> beginning right wait so you're okay </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> hello I think this is a giantly I'm </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> trying to make an account and I think </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> he's saying this as well other people </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> before him probably thought about things </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_06> I'm not I'm not arguing about lizards </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> thought about it dude </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm not saying that I'm not saying that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm saying like it's interesting how </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like inherently philosophy is a human </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> construct because we have free time yeah </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> right if lizards have no we're three </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> times </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we're just two no we are we are I mean </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> you look at dolphins not all of us not </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> all of you I've seen some of the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> comments </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> what I'm saying is that like you know a </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> shark isn't swimming around in the ocean </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> being like oh man that fish look </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> delicious but why but what about </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> dolphins though what about dolphins </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> because dolphins are [ __ ] obsession </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> with dolphins why why because they're </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> smart as [ __ ] they're smart as [ __ ] that </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> they do things on that aren't </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> unnecessary because they are [ __ ] </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> awful creatures no no like I believe </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> that please fact check this but I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> believe like dolphins are like one of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the only other creatures that kill </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> purely for pleasure no I know I know for </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> a fact </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oons are the only creatures on the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> planet who have sex purely for pleasure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> and why wouldn't they honestly right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] evolve man that was some good </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> Evolution hell yeah man </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I wanna I wanna imagine the first </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_07> dolphin that was just like I Wanna [ __ ] </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> so not for babies though I I wanted to </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_09> see if because I'm reading about one </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> time the Apparently like dolphins are </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> like very aggressive sexually gangs of </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> two or three male bottlenose dolphins </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> isolate a single female from the Pod and </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> forcibly mate with her sometimes for </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> weeks at a time </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> nice </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> to keep her in line they make aggressive </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> noises threatening movements and even </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> smack her around with their tails wow </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that sounds awful and if she tries to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> swim away they chase her down </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> maybe evolution is not a good thing it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> my favorite shindoell dojo man </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> like you know dolphins not every </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> [ __ ] yeah I agree why do we go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> dolphin watching uh because </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> again it's what we came back to with the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> animal survival thing it's all branding </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> yeah dolphins are branded himself as </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> cute and they're [ __ ] monsters </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but like how come no one goes like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> monkey watching because monkeys fight </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> back </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the Dolphins too </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> also no infectious monkeys because we </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> know they're one step away from us </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> they're gonna [ __ ] us out because like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> with with an eight you can see how </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [ __ ] built they are bro like you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> that thinking [ __ ] have you been close </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> to a dolphin before I know they can swim </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> with dogs I know it can [ __ ] you up </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right they can [ __ ] you up yeah oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> they're terrifying not as consistently </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> as monkeys </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but also you'd have to like like apes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> are like land mammals you know we have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> to like go in their Turf together </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> we should give them the pool yeah what </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> are they gonna do I'm gonna pull the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> plug out yeah well they're gonna do like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> come up here and like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> the moment Dolphins evolve where they </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> can just come up on land and start </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> smoking the [ __ ] out of you is when we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> stop [ __ ] with dolphins when when's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the dolphin boxing event when's that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> gonna be when we're gonna put dolphins </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> in the ring right we could do that with </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> other animals do that with other animals </SPEAKER_08>

<SPEAKER_05> episode get yourself a JoJo SI right let </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> me let me tell you how much humans have </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> broken the Evolution game right because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> animals now they're that's a legit </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> survival tactic is putting all of your </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> points into cuteness right that's like a </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> legit survival tactic now we're forcing </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> them to put their points in cute yeah </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_08> [ __ ] your son's dead yeah I can make </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> a cute version of you or you're not </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> breathing everything why are toy poodle </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> exists yeah could you imagine that thing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> in the heart between the Wilderness </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we're terrible but yeah because they </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> have to like they've got uh you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> Socrates came along and told us how to </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> think sovereign </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah it's just like you know we talked </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> about how [ __ ] dumbass [ __ ] koalas </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> are yeah you know [ __ ] pandas will do </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> everything they can to not [ __ ] make </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> babies they want to be extinct they </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> literally want to be extinct and humans </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> are like no you're not allowed to become </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> extinct we were too cute you know it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> like the Emos of the [ __ ] Animal </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> Kingdom I I think it's like I don't want </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> to be here I think there's a lot of it </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> does it's like our fault but they're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> they're going extinct right oh yeah it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because we just down all their [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> homes I think so I think if pandas tore </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> our homes down yeah I wanted to die I </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> think I think I'd I'd be I wouldn't want </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> to breed either they just they destroyed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> it I think a panda's gonna come with me </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like no it's okay don't worry about it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we'll take care of you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then we have the audacity to show </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_09> them Panda porn yeah what is this some </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> Black Mirror [ __ ] what we shout like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> we are Overlord and they started showing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> us porn and it's kind of [ __ ] up if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you think about it that's like if </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> someone like broke into your home and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like ransacked your [ __ ] and then you </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> lost everything and you're like well I </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> guess I I don't want to be here anymore </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and that same robber came back and was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> just like oh don't no it's fine </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> yeah we'll buy some new furniture don't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> worry </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I thought that's basically what we're </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> doing I guess the argument would be that </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> you know uh the Panda's capacity to </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> think isn't as good as ourselves </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> they haven't they haven't discovered </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> philosophy yeah yeah they don't have </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> there's no Panda Socrates yet so there's </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> no really like you know yeah bro this is </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> why we should never ever like run into </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> aliens like Humanity </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> oh yes [ __ ] you know and then we're </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> thinking the aliens are any better than </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> us maybe they're just as bad what do you </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> mean with like you know thinking and </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> everyone disagreeing to be honest I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't think it matters I don't think I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think I don't think it matters what we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> think yeah because like uh I think what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> was it it was it was I think it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> called the 99 problem that was like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> posed by some [ __ ] force or something </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_02> but it was this like yeah Socrates </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_06> he's the only ever person </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> well like I think it was something along </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the lines of like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um and please fact check me on this okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> um but like I think it's something along </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the lines of like the the DNA like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> genetic difference between uh or </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> disposition between in like apes like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> monkeys and chimpanzees and us is that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> uh I think there is like a 99 match when </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it comes to like DNA like basic </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> structural DNA and that one percent that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> chimps don't have is what makes us that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_07> that much smarter right ships I saw a I </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> saw her a [ __ ] thing uh someone </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> tweeted it was really dumb as [ __ ] they </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_00> were like oh well yeah we just have more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> DNA so like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then and then someone applied being </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_08> like you know there's more DNA in an </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> onion than a human yeah yeah it's got </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> nothing to do with it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's like I'm smarter than you I have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> more DNA well you know you we still have </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like lizard dna in us like when when why </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> do you think Lizardman exists </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> aside from [ __ ] Mark Zuckerberg you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> know the biggest proof that there is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yeah like I believe like when we're </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> embryos we still like form a lizard tail </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> that right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> no we gotta fact check this now please </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> fact check that but like </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> if you're right I I'll I'll give I'll </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> give you a crisp handshake if you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> right do we evolve with lizard Tails </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> when when we're babies have we grow I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> believe we grow a slight tailbone and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> then it disappears but going back to uh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> yeah um maybe that's [ __ ] weird if </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> that is swear to God's favorite toxics </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah oh I'm sure well isn't the Cox it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> just an after uh oh like you know it's </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> just the leftovers of the tales that we </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> used to have as you know when we're </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> rapes right isn't that what that is </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> it well isn't that why like the appendix </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as well is like just the uh The </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Leftovers of the like the second stomach </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that supposedly like we used to have bro </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> the appendix man well don't get me </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> started on the [ __ ] appendix why do </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> we have two lungs why not just one just </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_07> one big one just one big one why do we </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> not only have one nostril why do we have </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> two hearts yes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> [Music] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> correct yeah yeah I believe that I mean </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah the human tails think it says that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a half a billion years is </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> apparently sprouted Tails almost dead </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> balance yeah yeah so it's just like an </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> after like do we still evolved but what </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I think God is saying is that when we </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> reproduce now </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> okay okay </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> going back to the 99 problem right it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> called the 99 problem because </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hypothetically right if an alien species </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> came to Earth yeah right and they looked </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_07> exactly like us right or maybe not even </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> exactly like this but genetically they </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> were exactly like us but now it's the </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> opposite of what we had with the Apes </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> now we have a 99 disposition between us </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_01> the human race and these aliens but the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> extra one percent we don't have is what </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> makes the aliens that much smarter so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> much of a difference that is that it's </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the equivalent to US between chimps </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> right so it's like you know we look at a </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> chimp like playing around with some </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> blocks and you know the chimp puts the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> square block into the square hole and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we're like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> very good you know my my son just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> learned algebra two weeks ago right that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> could be the same thing for the aliens </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah the aliens would be like oh you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> learning quantum physics or my </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> five-year-old just learned that the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> other day yeah exactly like that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> terrible so like so the real question is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> why would aliens right </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> give a [ __ ] about what we think okay but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> like here's his one thing to them we're </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> probably just like The Chimps yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's that's that's an argument and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's why it's scary yeah that's why </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's [ __ ] terrified that's why I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't think we should ever like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> encounter aliens at all but like one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> thing I've kind of just realized during </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this one conversation is that we've </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> we've had we've had one like example of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> evolution yeah the example that's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> happened on earth right yeah and uh </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We've evolved you know intellect </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> smartness and we've seen that in animals </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> one thing I'm kind of noticing now is </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> um the smaller you are the more likely </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> you are to just be an [ __ ] what if </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that's just like what if that's what if </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> you know you know what I mean well </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> because you realize that you can [ __ ] </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> people over yeah also like how as a lion </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> do you [ __ ] someone over as an [ __ ] </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> what if that's just I don't know man </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like pushing your child off a cliff </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that's a pretty big [ __ ] move like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> what if what if that's just an earth </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> thing what if you can just evolve </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> intellect without being an ass soul what </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> if that's just something that's just </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> outside of our perception that's what </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm saying man we are still the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Neanderthals in this chain thousands of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> years from now we are going to be humans </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> that will </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> developers like you're just describing </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like plants </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> they just don't do anything they don't </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> mind their business we need them we [ __ ] </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> them up have you not seen that him like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Shyamalan film [ __ ] that's what I'm </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> saying man we got to start cutting the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> big dollars out I'm telling you like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> this </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe if we could stop feeling emotions </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> we wouldn't be enough we've decided that </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> you know a dolphin killing a child is an </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> [ __ ] move maybe to them they're like </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> what the [ __ ] is your normal Tuesday </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> we we decide we're putting our morals on </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> a [ __ ] dolphin like the dolphin gives </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> a [ __ ] so what you're saying is [ __ ] </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> are human construct yes what what we </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> just fight is decide as an [ __ ] </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> changes every [ __ ] generation that's </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> true that's true right like we had like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> uh I don't know like yeah you could </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> smoke indoors before if you did that now </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> I think you're an [ __ ] </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> you could do that like 50 years ago so </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> we've just gotten more sense here yeah </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> we've just changed like what we think is </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> acceptable and not yes of course yeah I </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> mean social norms are always changing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> yeah yeah you know it's no different </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> manner </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> evolving that's all that's up for </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> debates exactly I don't think it's fair </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> to say it's cut and dry yeah evolving is </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> not the term yeah it's like it's VR porn </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> Evolution or Devolution I don't know but </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> uh I don't know how it's like helping </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> the human race </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> technology it is definitely the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> evolution in every other aspect </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> oh my God is there a Survivor bias with </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> evolution </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> I don't know isn't that the whole point </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> of evolution it is literally </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> survivorship but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> see I don't know it I feel now it's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gotten to the point where that's not the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> thing that determines </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> the next step in evolution like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I like could you like Okay so let's say </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> like like dinosaurs just got [ __ ] over </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah like they couldn't have evolved </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> their way out of being struck by a </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_06> [ __ ] meteor yeah yeah at the same way </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_09> we couldn't right so like in some ways </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> it's like yeah survival to finish oh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> with a few asterisks well the thing is </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> of course the humans don't turn out yeah </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I've decided to destroy your home well </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_00> that's like that's like uh interesting </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> actually because I I think I saw like a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> let me know video about like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> apocalypse and I think like the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> conclusion he came up to is that it's </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_05> actually really really [ __ ] hard so </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> completely wipe oh yeah Wipe Out the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> human rights yes yes we know this </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> because we're we have like [ __ ] </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> bunkers and [ __ ] underground yeah yeah </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah stockpiling the only way is to </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> literally just blow up the Earth yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> exactly just wipe out all of it yeah for </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> every you know let's say there was a you </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> know a nuclear bomb went off you know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not everyone who gets striked by that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> dies yeah yeah exactly Will Survive it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> maybe it's not the healthiest but the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> people who make it through yeah no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_06> exactly it's it's really really hard to </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> completely wipe off the human race yes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> as it is right now we're like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> cockroaches but big yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> we're the [ __ ] virus where the virus </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> are we are the Cockroaches Next Level </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> next level of humanity is just like the </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Cockroach man and terraformers that's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what we can evolve into dude </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> oh my God that was Evolution the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> evolution dude it's like reverse Planet </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> of the Apes we were the Cockroaches all </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> along you know I think she's ahead of </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> point </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> something to think about what were we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> saying before about uh yeah obviously </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like and all it took was an asteroid to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> like wipe out all of the dinosaurs yes </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> but they weren't smart enough to like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> not survive out now you know they were </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> they once because they were too [ __ ] </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> big </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_05> you're literally yeah that's what that's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> what that's a lot so God what you're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> saying is if there's dinosaurs evolved </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> enough to the point where they're like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> you know what there might be this thing </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that falls from the sky one day and we </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just all get wiped out over it so let's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> build a bunker on the ground to save </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> ourselves I mean yeah then the dinosaurs </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> could have survived it's not like an </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> ideal Survivor you know survivorship </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah but the point is you can you know </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> there is certain sects of humanity that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> through millions of years can eventually </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> repopulate the world I'm glad there are </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> crazy bunker people out there yeah </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> because we need we need them yeah yeah I </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> don't want to be one I'm happy to die </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> when the when the asteroid comes out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah but aren't you then afraid that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> those are the people who are going to be </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> the next Humanity bro if you look back a </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> thousand and you see people we had we </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> didn't have much better I think we </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> turned out okay I think I think I think </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> we'll be all right well we'll pick </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> ourselves back up again I'm sure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_09> yeah did you see how World War One </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> started like I think uh yeah we haven't </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> we don't have a good track record of the </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> smartest people being in the best </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> position yeah yeah I mean uh we're doing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> all right </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> what I've learned is that like Evolution </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and survival of the Fitters doesn't get </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> rid of stupid people </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that's what I've learned it's because if </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> you think about it oh no stupid people </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> have always been around it's just the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> idea of what is considered stupid yeah </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> just because like let's say it's the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> whole thing with politics rights my </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> agenda is better than yours and and it's </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> for them that's Survival and the way </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> that they want to live and that's there </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> so that's you know you're getting into </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> that now so every single person on the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> internet just says like oh survival of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the food is we'll get rid of all the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> dumb people and be a smarter human race </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't think that's alpha males yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah alpha males I don't think that's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> ever gonna happen </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> no I mean because then because then once </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you get rid of all those people there's </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gonna be a new type or personality or </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> trait of some kind that will just fill </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> its place again I mean our strength as </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> humans is that we have like everything </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> stupidity is a social construct someone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> someone someone thought hey we should </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> just make something that [ __ ] flies </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and can carry me it's like no one ever </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that's the dumbest [ __ ] ever heard if I </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> was like Middle Ages I'm like [ __ ] off </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> oh yeah yeah we need we need crazy </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> people to come up with the coolest [ __ ] </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yes of course I mean it's a cross </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> stuffed insane yeah because that's the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> same they've actually made pizza cross </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> edible but like yeah the first person </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> who came up with that they were like oh </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> whoa whoa whoa why are the Italians not </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> figuring this out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> let's go completely off topic well like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> we need crazy people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I I like to think that stuff crossed was </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_06> invented when someone just took a pizza </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_01> and just rolled it up it was just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_06> it's like yeah </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_05> and it was like hang on a second I can </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> do that I remember I remember I had this </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> conversation with Joey Watts where it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just like who do you think like invented </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the first [ __ ] you know do you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> remember this conversation yeah we </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> talked about an afterdog I'm pretty sure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> did we actually I think so I think I had </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> the same response of like a [ __ ] sake </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I'm sure people were doing it they just </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> didn't put a name to it you know </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_08> you know what I mean like thinking like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_09> philosophy we didn't put a name to </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> philosophy I think we Googled it and it </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_05> was like the Greeks or the Romans the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> Romans it was popularized it again it's </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> a philosophy thing all over again they </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> just put a name on it PornHub okay </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Romans invented giving head </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> they were so fighthead that they decided </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to give heads </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're doing okay I'm losing my mind </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> you're doing okay I'm losing my mind </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah same here same here it's okay my </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> mind has expanded right yeah the galaxy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> galaxy we are the new philosophers of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> our time and that's how you know our </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_09> generation is [ __ ] if you guys are </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_09> listening oh damn it God damn it all the </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_03> hell all right well hey look at all </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> these patrons though they're they're </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Giga brain because they're supporting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the show and letting us talk about dumb </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> [ __ ] I'm so sorry to all people we've </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> treated with this I'm sure they're gonna </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> be so many angles just like to all the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> philosophers scientists historians </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_09> biologists yes uh scientists uh I feel </SPEAKER_09>
<SPEAKER_04> like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> geneticists literally any form of field </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_04> that has some kind of uh it takes life </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> my apologies psychologist my apologies </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> to Socrates uh I didn't mean uh I didn't </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> mean to butcher you like that bro uh </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_03> hope you enjoy this shower thoughts I </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> hope you're listening to this in the </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> show we are not high by the way we are </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_02> in Japan it is illegal to procure drugs </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> here yes </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> um this is uh I don't know why we're </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_08> talking about this </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_02> we started off with haughty and end up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_05> with dolphins and yeah I'm really glad I </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> brought my glasses today this was the </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> perfect episode for it yo thinking been </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> real quiet since philosophy dropped man </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> yeah been ripping real quiet man </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> everyone just stopped like they just </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> went they went from a door to like yeah </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> all right before actually before before </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we end the podcast yes genuine like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> math that's a weird thing to me off </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> right </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> math exists we just figured out how to </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> explain it as my physics teacher once </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> said </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> science makes maths its [ __ ] yeah but </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> like if without science think about that </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> would be pointing if you think about it </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> math is like the universal language it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> the only language there technically no </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_00> no no no no no no no no no isn't it </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> crazy that the Indians invented zero </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> okay okay </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> I'm actually gonna kill you guys okay </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_01> okay so </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> math is just like English but we just </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_05> use that to explain the things that are </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> happening and how they interact it's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> just a language that we chose right yeah </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> it's a it's a human culture </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_03> yeah we it's the way that we communicate </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> does math exist outside of humans of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> course it does yeah but like the concept </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> of explaining it doesn't but like the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> stuff interacting and all the the the </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> the formulas that are happening those </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> things are happening whether we don't </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_04> know but like do you do you not find it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> weird Okay this this is what blows my </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] mind right you know the you know </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> you know like a few years ago where they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> changed what a kilogram is right they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> mathematically change what a kilogram is </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because before they had this weight that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> was a kilogram it was like in a [ __ ] </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> bunker in France or some [ __ ] yeah and </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that was a kilogram yeah and then they </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> changed it to be more space scientists </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> on equations that used a universal </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> constant I believe it's like a consonant </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_08> constant the plan constant </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_06> why are there constants in our law of </SPEAKER_06>
<SPEAKER_04> the universe does that know that that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> [ __ ] me oh okay why is why is this why </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_08> did like the universe go yo speed of </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> light that's the thing now that's like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> that's as fast as you can go to give you </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> a very easy way of kind of explaining </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_05> this all right like the difference </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_07> between Celsius and Fahrenheit they're </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_07> both communicating the same thing right </SPEAKER_07>
<SPEAKER_03> but they both they're entirely different </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> numbers right but one is dumb yeah </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> exactly you can convert right yeah and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's the same thing if we rebuilt math </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> again from the ground up we could make </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> new constants that matched all the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> formulas that we'd already made right </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> yes it's just the the we have decided </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_08> that for our math we're going to use </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> this is the constant if we changed it </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> the other constant we chose would have </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> to change right it's just we have </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> decided that this is how we're going to </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> express these these numbers and these </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> interactions </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> sorry mathematicians uh that I'm gonna </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> leave it there how do you invent some </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> some Indian one day was just like </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> we need a number that means nothing and </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> before that there was no number four </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> isn't that crazy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_08> so think about it right because I'd say </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> numbers back then was purely for like </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> like trade or whatever you're using it </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> right so you would you would have one of </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> something you never had zero of </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> something so there's no need to have a </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_08> zero because your math wasn't using that </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> concept yeah but surely before okay </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> caveman all right you need to </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> communicate hey there are three X's </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> along there are three deers that we can </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> hunt surely surely that was a concept </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> that was needed before markets and </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> selling stuff existed surely yeah but </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_03> the Nintendo Falls once standing around </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_05> being like there are Zero D is to hunt </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_08> goodbye goodbye all right we're going to </SPEAKER_08>
<SPEAKER_05> continue this conversation off screen uh </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> we'll we'll see you guys later </SPEAKER_05>
<SPEAKER_05> [Music] </SPEAKER_05>
