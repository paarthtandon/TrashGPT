<SPEAKER_02> - Nice cock.
- Cum. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Cyberpunk music. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's just some memes
that just like transcend time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Harambee! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I still laugh at
Uganda knuckles meme man! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That will never not be funny to me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (upbeat music) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I showed Joey that I slammed my penis </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in the car door meme today. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't understand that one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's not about understanding. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Half of the meme is right, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that's how it always starts though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You don't understand the meme </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when you first get introduced. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But you understand it
through a weird repetition </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and kind of mutual respect of </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> not really understanding
what the fuck is going on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Right!
- But it's kind of funny. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - But like you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> most memes, it's like you
can change it up a bit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> You can make a derivative. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I dunno how much you can derive. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey chuckles) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You'll be surprised. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like the whole
steamed hams thing, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's true. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It can be pushed as much as it wants to. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> By the way, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> welcome to this episode
of the Trash Taste Show. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know app your own. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Not that we say that-
- But The Trash Taste Show! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - You Trash Taste Show.
- Trash Taste Show! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all chuckle) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I guess we just found
ourselves in a topic </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> before we even like started the show. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - But welcome, I'm your host Connor, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> with the boys, Joey and Garnt. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Call the segment, Nice Kong. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - In the time that-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, we don't do that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause like going back to the memes, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't understand why I
find things funny anymore. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Sometimes I don't know why
bass-boosted things are funny, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> but like, it just appears
in the meme sometimes, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so I just like laugh. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think we're slowly
breaking down the human psyche </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and the human consciousness, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and what is objectively funny. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And for some reason seeing an Orangutan, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and some men going, "Oh, oh, stinky!" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> seems to always make me laugh, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I can't tell you why. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's no deeper meaning, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just fucking stupid </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and I've been hacked by this system </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that somehow works against me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's just like perfect science </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of just like the right noises
and the right image you know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You know it's bad </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when I could show that to a five year old </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and they would be unamused, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I'm there just pissing myself, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> like crying, laughing, and it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "What has happened? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Have we been hacked in a way that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like allows our brain to
revert to like one years old </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and find things funny? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I don't know anymore. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know, I feel like the internet </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> just like broken our sense of humor. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like why is the peak of internet comedy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just perfectly cut screams? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That is just like-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That will never not be funny. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I know, but why is it so funny? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like I hear a scream, I sleep. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> If you cut it just once
like a millisecond in, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's fucking like comedy genius. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because imagining the
disaster is way funnier </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> than seeing a disaster. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, that's what it is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like it's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you've probably seen a
lot of the videos, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Where there's like a punchlines, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where people use like massive explosions. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt and Joey] Yeah.
- It's like the punchline. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> But you never think like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so like what was that explosion? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laugh) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Was that a-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - What was blowing up?
- Did people die? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, you know, you like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> "Ha ha, explosion go blow!" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know what I mean?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - True, true. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Stuff is way funnier </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> when you can imagine what happens almost </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> in some aspects, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - What do you think is a meme </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you'll find funny
again in five years? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Any Wiii sports meme for me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Like at the moment that
music starts playing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, before the joke even starts, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the moment I hear the music, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's already funny. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'd like to think when I'm 50 years old, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that there's somebody I can go to, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'll be like, what's 9 plus 10. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Connor chuckles) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then they'd be like 21. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'd be like, "Yeah!"
- Yeah, my man! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then we'll like, you know what I mean. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The same way that my parents </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> mentioned some weird
'60s BBC show that I-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt and Joey] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, I know
the spotted thing, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I'd like to think that's what
it's gonna be like, you know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - They'll be like, "So no head." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm like 60 and I'm
like pissing myself. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We're in this weird time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> where I think humor is gonna
be so fucked and liked! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean it's fucked month by month </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> let alone what is going to be like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> in like one or two years. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's gonna be like some
Morse code jokes or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah probably. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We're just gonna hear </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey mimics) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and just fucking piss ourselves off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's gonna be visual like a braille. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's gonna be like, "And then he said..." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's like just braille on the screen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And we're gonna be like pissing it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's gonna be like--
(Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That sounds like a hilarious meme. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That could be a meme. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This is why memes are going now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Base-boosted braille? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm laughing at the thought
of shitty memes, you know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Base-boosted braille! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Can you imagine that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And then he said, brrrh! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Connor] And this is the thing-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - The idea of that just
sound hilarious to me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Can we just go with the new meme? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I think it weird.
(Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it's weird </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because being friends with
someone like Chris, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Chris is just on the... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Chris in the weirdest spot I think. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because I've shown memes to Chris, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where Chris will break down laughing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - And they're absolutely stupid. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But I've also showed him memes where </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> his boomer side comes out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Right?
- [Garnt] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - And he's definitely like, "What is this? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What is this nonsense? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Why is there flashing
noises and deep fried? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> What is that, what is...?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like Chris is at that
really interesting spot </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where he's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Chris can be a boomer when
he wants to be a boomer, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but he also enjoys Gen Z
humor when he wants to. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, that's true. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I find that really interesting. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Because I'm totally like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> my humor is so fucked now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I can only laugh at stuff </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when it's like bass
boosted and farting noises. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know.
(Connor and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Cross-overs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel like I'm a child, I'm a child. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I feel that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because it's gotten to a point </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> where I don't know why I
find the things I do funny, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just know I find it funny. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And there's no like formula to it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> There's nothing I can
break down to be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> "Ha ha, that was why the
punchline was funny." You know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - You can't explain
half the memes any more. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - But the problem is this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if you have a favorite comedian, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you can be like, watch
their standup special. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - If I find like base-boosted,
(Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Daffy Duck slamming his
penis in the car door </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with prapid rapid there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> How the fuck do I begin
to explain what I'm into? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Just send a YouTube link. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But then-- </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Trust me, this is 10
million views, it's funny. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Here's the problem </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> with sending people weird
ass memes like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt and Joey] Yeah.
- It's like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I've had this, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause I've been on the
receiving end of memes-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think everyone has. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Where I'm like, what the fuck is this? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (Connor chuckles) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it's just as, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we've turned to comedy into
this weird kind of niche, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> where it's like the equivalent of </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> liking some weird German techno band now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that's what comedy is now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because to get like a lot of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the most funniest memes to me, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it takes like 10 layers of meme levels. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You gotta go deep. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's something that if you're
not invested in this one, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> in like one meme aspect, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then you're just not gonna get the meme, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause it's joke can be random. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - The joke of the meme </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> is like a reference to
another joke and another meme, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and so on and so forth. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> So it's like- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - What the fuck is this coffee, hold on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> What the... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Does your coffee tastes weird? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, what does it taste like? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Man] Like, what's wrong with it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It tastes like coffee. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What kind, is it instant coffee? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Man] No, it's not. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, it's very... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Whoa, what the fuck? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Man] It's coffee that
Meilyne usually makes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is it really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's some bass-boosted coffee. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
(all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - This is what of described
as a crunchy coffee. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- [Man] Let me see. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Have you had this coffee before? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Man] No but. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - What did I do? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Sorry, sorry, that threw me off. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt and Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Do you mind if I? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Sure, go ahead.
- Go ahead. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Coffee review with Nabi. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Huh, it's very stale. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - What the fuck?
- It tastes stale, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Did the Nespresso let us down? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What's going on? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Is it the milk? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just a betrayal-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'll go and check.
- Is it the milk? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Get the operations, send in the press, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> find out what happened here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It might be the milk.
- I'll go upstairs. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Whoa, that's funky. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like I just don't bother </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to try and keep up with memes anymore, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just because like... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, I already thought
the fun in Uganda knuckles meme </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> went by so goddamn fast! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And now I've realized
that Ugandan knuckles </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> sticking around for a month, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> was like a feed of accomplishment for me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, I still find the
Ugandan knuckles funny. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think five years ago, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's even quite different
from how memes are now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Mm!
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Now, I feel like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> okay, five years ago we had memes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and we had like three or
four that were pretty big, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you wouldn't really
hear about other memes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But now there's always like
10 memes going on at once, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> maybe one of them will kind
of get somewhat mainstream. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt and Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And even that I don't
even mean mainstream, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> like normal audiences, I mean like-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like on the internet? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The Twitter sphere-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because there are so many memes, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like if you ever watched </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Lessons in Meme Culture, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> do you watch that channel? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Guy discusses memes, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and there's like every
day there's a new meme. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But most of these memes
live and die in the week. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't consider them like memes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, no, no. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm like, if this is a niche thing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that gets used a little
bit in some communities </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> and it doesn't really take off. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, yeah, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you don't really keep up with this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah.
- [Joey] Mm! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because it's scarcely
anything to give a shit about. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Man] I found out why.
- Why? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because we're using almond, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Not soy milk.
(man chuckles) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - No! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, this doesn't taste like almond milk! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Man] No? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I use almond milk with
my coffee all the time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Man] That states says
almond, I bought almond. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's the coffee that tastes weird. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Man] Is it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think it's the combination
of the almond and the coffee. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Man] Probably. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I mean like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> there are some memes that
you see and you're like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is gonna die off within two days. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because I feel like if a
meme is too easily replicated </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that your mom could do it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then it's not a good meme. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Also, I feel with like
some memes it's like, okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Like a video with like
10 million views pops up, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's like, "Cool, that went viral." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But it's like, you can't
do anything else with it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - So it just ends up being this one video </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> that has a lot of views, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and then it gets forgotten over time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think a perfect meme, right, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> is one meme when you initially
watch or discover it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you think, "This is fucking stupid!" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then third time
you're like, "Yeah, okay." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Have you witnessed a perfect meme yet, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> as the meme master? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think vocabulary
does that quite a lot, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like the word like busing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I actually despised it
when I first heard it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Somehow it just grew on me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt and Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right now I find it hilarious. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I don't know why I
can't stop saying it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They're like "deez nuts" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like "deez nuts" is not funny. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Scientifically speaking
"deez nuts" is not funny. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Speaking of some, I find hilarious. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> But I'll fucking laugh.
(all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I will laugh every goddamn time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'll find every any opportunity
I can to say "deez nuts." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's one of those memes where you laugh </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and you like hate yourself over eternity. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like dabbing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's the modern equivalent
of whipping yourself, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but mentally, you're just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> "Fuck! Got to have to
schedule a better help call </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> after this, fuck!" </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel like a lot of memes now </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> are also like platform dependent. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like there are like so many
TikTok trends and TikTok memes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> that are massive on the platform, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but we don't like get
exposed to it at all. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And feel like it's only like a
super, super, super big meme, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if it like goes off of the TikTok platform </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you see it on Twitter
or on like YouTube as well. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is Japanese TikTok good? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No!
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because right and I know- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Is TikTok good? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yes, I think TikTok is good? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm gonna say this, right now, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> before people go accuse me of being like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> "Oh, let's see what the
content gives you, blah, blah." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I downloaded TikTok, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt and Joey] Yeah.
- Fresh account. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yep! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The first thing I opened it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> so it knows I'm in Japan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's automatically Japanese. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's automatically Japanese TikTok. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What do you think comes up? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And like I'm scrolling for a while, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What do you think comes up? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, my experience? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - From my experience
it's just a lot of like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Japanese girls dancing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Goddamn it, that's all it was! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, that's what it really is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - All these are literally
Japanese women, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And yeah, they're very beautiful, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> very attractive.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Not even dancing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just like moving their arms slightly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They're just like... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - They normally have assets </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that are bigger than normal. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt and Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And that was all it was. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I scrolled through like 50 TikToks </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and maybe out of the 50, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I didn't support any of
them, just scrolling, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> brand new account, nothing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> All it knew was that I was probably male, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm guessing knew that from the app store. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah, yeah.
- [Joey] Sure, sure. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - And that's all it was. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And like, you'll enjoy
this type of content, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> You're a Japanese male. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I was just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> don't get me wrong, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's a time and a place for this- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah.
- [Grant] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't want this!
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is not want. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - I wanna see the memes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm not a kind of person, all right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know if this is
like a sigma male grind set. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't wanna see this...
- I hate how you said that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't wanna see like women or... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Connor laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That sounds so bad. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Go on, say it, say it! </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't wanna see women! </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't wanna shit that's
trying to make me horny </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> when I'm not horny, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Right, right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - If I wanna watch stuff like that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm just gonna go and watch porn. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah of course. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's very obvious what audience that is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Am I allowed to say that, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> that's like women just
dancing and showing off boobs. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, it's been like that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> since the beginning of probably time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm fine with that content, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> but I don't want that most of the time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, I mean-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's so much of that kind
of content you can consume. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's the same reason why
everyone hated the old... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Remember when like YouTube </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> went through this epidemic
of the "Reply Girls?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Where it was just girls with-- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Scarcely kind clothes, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Obviously I have absolutely nothing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> against people who
wanna make that content. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I support all that
stuff and any sex workers, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you keep doing what you wanna do, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I wish there was more protection
around stuff like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Obviously this isn't, it's very different. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But it's just for me personally, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> most of the time when I see that stuff, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not the audience
they're trying to appeal to. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Because I don't want to... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't see that stuff </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and I'm not like, "Oh this
is the content I wanna see." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're also not a
horny teenager anymore. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right, right, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but to me it's like as someone who is 25, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm doing my own thing and whatnot, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> to me when I see a girl
dancing as a content creator, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just like, "Okay, what
am I following for here?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What am I... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If I wanna follow this creator </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what am I coming back for? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt and Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - To watch them dance? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Like when it's not dancing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's not dancing
- And not even, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's like your 50 year old adult dancing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - They do this fucking
same thing every time, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> they just go like this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah, it's like
you're 50 year old aunt </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> at a wedding. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's just the bare minimum of movement, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's like this is dancing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Kind of this conversation
makes me sound so sexist, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm not trying to be. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But it's not the content, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we personally want to see all right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - That's not even like
the worst kind of like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> How can I say? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know what the genre is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but like the sleazy bait or whatever. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't even know what the genre is? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I remember that-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's obviously sexual </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and it's trying to appeal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> And anyone who sees the video </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and says it's not sexual, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's complete bullshit. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] No, it is absolutely sexual. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - You know who you're appealing to. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean it's very obvious that like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> at least in Japan, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I assume with the
rest of the world too, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that like the main demographic of TikTok </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is like teenage boys and girls. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Right.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So obviously, what are
teenage boys gonna enjoy? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sorry, (indistinct). </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That kinda sleaze fest. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because I remember like the other trends </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that I saw in TikTok was, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it was like girls who are
obviously very confident </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you know, trying to... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No, what was I gonna say? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It was girls that had
this audio that played, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which was-
- It's like we're busing? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no, no, no, it was like... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That one's a good one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - If we had 24 hours of me alone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I couldn't say no, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> what would you do? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm just like-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The meme are good with one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I'm just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> most of the memes I've seen with that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> are like parodies of that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But that just means that
there are enough people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> doing this unironically- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - To parodies in the first place, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's why it's been parody so much. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause it is obvious saturated, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and it is such it's bay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's such sleaze bay, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - You know, and I... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Its this a new coffee? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Lets just give this a taste, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> coffee gate Trash Taste. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Coffee gate!
- Coffee gate! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Man] Trash Taste coffee. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Is it better? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Still tastes funny.
(man chuckles) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know what's happened. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There's something offensive. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I know I'm not offended, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but I'm like, "Come on, man! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Just because I log on the platform, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you've gotta show me this shit!" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - "At least give me
something else to look at, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> so you can kind of figure me out." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Give a little bit of
variance in the content. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm like, "Why are you gonna
assume what I'm into, man!" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Like yeah, "She's beautiful, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> good for her, I'm glad she's killing it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm glad she's got 20
million views every second, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> good for her. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Why did you assume I was into it?" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, but that's the thing, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, I wouldn't even be mad </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> if it was just popping up
every now and then, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, yeah, of course, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it has to appeal to that demographic, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but yeah, I had the exact same experience. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> When I opened it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it was like 49 out of 50, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> which just different girls. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm not mad, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause I don't want to be like headline, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Man gets mad, that woman is dancing..." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like that's not it, but also-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - No but like, a little of variance </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> doesn't hurt anyone, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It just means like the algorithm </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> hasn't been tailored for you yet. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Exactly, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] But that's--
- Just like-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's kind of sad
that that's what it was. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like if you were a new user in Japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I assume they know my
age and maybe my gender-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Or it just means like algorithmically- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's kinda content that works, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - So it's the best apparently. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm guessing it's because </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's a certain age
range and a demographic </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that the algorithm puts you in- </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor and Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And they're just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> "This person wants to see
this kind of content." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - You wanna see horny content, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> we got you, bro. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I mean, it's
everyone knows sex sells, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's always been that like that </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> since the beginning of man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I would very much like my
horny separate from my life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (all chuckling) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I like it, when I- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Tell that to the man who
likes Hentai on Twitter. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I can look at Hentai, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I can just be like," Nice!" </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> But I don't feel anything towards it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but when I'm like, "All right,
I'm now gonna jack off." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Then I'm like, "All right." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - What do you think I'm jacking off </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> to everything I like Twitter? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, no, no, no!
(Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But that's what I mean. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm just like, I'm
scrolling through like. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> No, I don't know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Yeah, no, but I'm the same, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, "I don't like
all these like Hentai pics </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> on Twitter because I'm feeling horny." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh, that's cool art work!" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think, I don't know really. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Why is it... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause when you see Hentai </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you're like you're unoffended by it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> But sometimes you can see
someone trying to be sexy </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and it could be annoying, I don't know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think it's the difference between </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> just someone trying to be sexy, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and someone who's done
put art into it, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because I think the same way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> except when I see like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a fucking amazing cosplayer
player, for example. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I love seeing cosplay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I love seeing great cosplay, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even if some of them are
like very suggestive. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It doesn't matter </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because someone put work into this, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> someone did a photo shoot, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's fucking great, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I feel like that is the difference </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> between just like seeing Hentai </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or like really sexy
cosplayers on your timeline, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> versus just seeing, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know what's it, like sleazebag. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just gonna call it that you know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, no, I get that, I get that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, cosplay is amazing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and there's plenty of lewd
stuff out there that I enjoyed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But that's why I like Twitter. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause you can get like 50 memes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and a bunch of lewd stuff
all in the same place. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right, it has variance, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Maybe if I used TikTok more </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it figured out that
I liked some other stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] I'm sure, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But I don't know why, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I was just kinda like, "Ah, ah." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I know on every ad in
Japan is like that as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know if it's Japan, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it might be just Japan that's like this, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but like every ad I get in Japan as well </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is like porn or like dating sites. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like dating sites, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It is literally like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the number one ad that I get on Twitter </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is this one website, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> where you can hire girls to speak to you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've seen that one.
(Joey chuckles) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I get it all the time! </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> this is sad that this is
like the number one thing! </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, that's a whole another thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about loneliness in Japan.
- [Garnt and Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Guys struggling like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I genuinely don't even think like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> even after it gets tailored, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that that will go away. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Because I feel it's just the
main demographic in Japan-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - How much have you used TikTok? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Well I guess you use TikTok
more than either of us? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, when I say I'm on TikTok, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not really like religiously on TikTok. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just go onto it every now and then </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when I'm like there's
nothing to see on Twitter. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But again, it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I haven't used it enough </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I see a variance
of all sorts of content. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm still at that early stage </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where I see 49 out of 50 girls dancing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, same here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Which is why I found myself
watching more YouTube Shorts </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it seems, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> most of them are just
recycled TikToks anyway, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I already have a YouTube profile. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And so a lot of the
content is already tailored </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to the stuff I've watched on YouTube. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And every time I log into TikTok, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't see a lot of these TikTok trends </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that have just become viral. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Even though everyone seems
to be talking about them, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> "Well, it's not appearing on my timeline." </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I dunno what my profile is set to-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I take TikTok trends very lightly-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Have you seen some of the latest ones. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, have you seen... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Were about to date
this episode, but like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I remember a month ago, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I just wanted to die inside </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because there was this trend </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> called like devious things or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Which was just okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So devious licks are just people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who just went to like bathrooms, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and kids would start stealing
like the soap dispensers. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then it started off as that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And then, you know how TikTok is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know the internet is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It starts escalating </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to the point where
people were just full on, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like, they're stealing like-
- [Connor] Sinks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Sinks, roadsigns, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> and there's like people that
stole whole vending machines. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh my God! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay, hold on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> How the fuck do you
steal a vending machine? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't know.
- How do you do that? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, you have to pray some
of the logistical abilities- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Pertaining stealing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But at the same time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you're just combating like
almost Grand Theft Auto </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and just putting out
on the internet to see. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It was obviously stupid. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It was a trend that was widely condemned </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> whenever YouTube under then someone-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Oh yeah, of course. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Made a video condemning it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, it's easy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> It's a slam dunk when your
YouTube would be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Hey guys, stealing, bad." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Applause now please. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I will take my applause, you know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I just can't get over that someone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> had the balls to steal a vending machine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't even think repo
men are allowed to do that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Alright man, all the
trees will still get stuck-- </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, that's true. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm just more surprised </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that just people were just stealing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> and then filming themselves stealing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, well people aren't so small. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> When clout is offered. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Clout is offered.
- Clout is value, yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - When clout is on the
table, anything goes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Function like a normal
human being or prison time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Did hear about a couch guy, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> or the couch guy? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - This one's very familiar. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That was the latest trend
as well I heard about. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm scared to ask what that is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So it was this girl </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who basically surprised visited
her boyfriend in college. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And she walks in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and the guy, her boyfriend
is sitting on a couch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and he doesn't seem as excited </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as maybe one would expect. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So he acts a little
bit awkward, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he then he eventually
gets up and hugs her, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And Twi... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was gonna say Twitter. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> TikTok takes us like 30 seconds clip </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and was like, "He's cheating on her." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - They literally went like
full Netflix documentary, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> true crime--
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Were internet detecting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Analyzing the frame by frame. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And like, it was insane. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> It was just like the worst
part of the internet. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So was he cheating on her? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, they said no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But they were like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> "Yoh! calm the down."
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Big, big facts. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Maybe he wasn't just excited. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> There could be so many ways </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you could spin this narrative, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And they're all like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> "Literally people just full on projecting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> their narrative towards
this 30 second clip." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I saw this one TikTok </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that was just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the girl release a
statement that was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and she said, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "There's nothing more to this clip. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm friends with all the girls. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You don't need to worry about it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I know the girls." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And this one woman posted
the TikTok being like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Girl, you don't need to worry. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You don't have friends </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because I've seen friends like them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They're not your friends. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Friends should be excited </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when their friends steps into the room. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We've all been in that position." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just like--
- Maybe she was just British. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm just like, I know right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - If there's anything worse
than an internet detective, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> it's an internet therapist. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Those are the worst. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Where it's like, "Let me tell
you why your wife's sucks." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You say it's great, but it doesn't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Let me tell you why. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, "Dude, leave me alone." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, it was just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> there is no way you can break
down this much of a narrative </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> through a 30 second interaction. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, God no! </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, it's the thing
about the internet where-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like some Zodiac killer shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It is, it literally was. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - They found him out though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was, have they found him? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, they found him recently. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - They found him, he died, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and he left a review for the movie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Did he?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He left a review for the Zodiac-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wait, is this confirmed? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - How did they find him? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Ah, there was, oh, I think-- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - He died in like 2017 or something. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- They quite awhile about. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I can't remember how they found him, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there was some scars. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I can't remember exactly,
it doesn't really matter. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> They found him basically. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then he left her... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't care how they found him, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I wanted to know what he
thought about the movie. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he left a review on the IMDB page. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Really?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Did he say it was good or? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think he didn't like it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't know, that's just right
kind of funny even though. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Makes murder reviews his own movie. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know why, I was just like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, wait, before we move on, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I forgot to give you
something last week Joey. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Me and Sade got a bunch
of omiyage for everyone. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I said to Sade, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I was gonna give this
to you on the podcast, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> but here's some tea. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've got some tea. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I gave him to me last week off camera. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt and Joey] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm tryna shield my friendship. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, that's perfect
'cause you gave me cookies. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Garnt gave me tea, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> sounds like a perfect combination. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Cookies biscuits. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Biscuits whatever. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, because do you
know what I've realized </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> after like buying omiyage for people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> from like English omiyage. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Oh very cute.
- Very cute. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - So tea set. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Nice, thanks man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, no worries. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because what I've realized-- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We're friends, we're friends. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Guys analyze that click, analyze it all. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Analyze that frame by frame. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Well, Jowey wasn't excited (indistinct) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Joey wasn't that excited. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause I mean, there's,
there's some going on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There's some going on. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - He's definitely cheating. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - You tell a lie, you choked. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I mean, there is some
kind of truth in that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> in some aspects I have
seen people on Reddit </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> or the comments, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> super analyzing our reactions
to things like what? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I can't remember. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This there's been a lot though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There's like, oh, wow. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It kind of seems really centered today. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah but Redit it's like a free </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> when it comes to that
kind of stuff, we just. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Say what they want. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's interesting though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Seeing how people perceive us sometimes </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and sometimes in a good way, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> sometimes in a bad way. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - That doesn't everyone always say </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you always look angry </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or likes Ty. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Everyone was like, oh, I am tired. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> A lot of the stuff that's. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause I have to, I wake up early, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but you know, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Some people like he's angry
and I'm like, no, I'm just, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I just tired. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - This is resting face. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You'll know if I'm angry. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Connor laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Will you, maybe you're there. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Connor laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I dunno. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'll storm off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just won't be here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (Connor laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I (laughs). </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> No, but like, yeah, read it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've seen some stuff on
Reddit where it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> wow, you got it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Ain't that deep, bro. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, you didn't have to go to that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's difficult because on one aspect, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I understand that all they have to go off </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> of ours is our episodes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Of course.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - And that's all they have to go off. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But I wouldn't, by any
stretch of the imagination, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> say that trash taste is reflective of, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> well, I just said is
reflective of who I am, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but you miss a lot of nuance. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like it's very easy to
generalize who we are, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> but also as a show. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So here we are. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We do, I won't lie. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> There's times where I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm going to keep this argument going. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause it's great content. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - A lot of the times I wouldn't, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> some of the arguments I get
into with Connor or Joey </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or not arguments I'd get
into with a random stranger. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I would just get, I don't, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> even though I do feel
strongly about a lot of things </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> as you guys know very well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I also, in general life
just don't give a to argue. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I like arguing in this
space with the boys. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I didn't even give a on the shot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - The judges, Joe, just like trash tastes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, with the guy in
the background with the bomb. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Just like I don't care. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Sometimes I do like to go to explore </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> other sides of opinions as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But it also is like, if it is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sometimes there are
controversial opinions. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But they are opinions. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then they are sometimes
commonly held opinions. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's one of those things </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where I would like to
play devil's advocate </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in some situations without
having to be like Connor, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is that kind of person he's like... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah just to get conversation. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know, we've always said </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we don't have to be a circle track. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, no. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I always want to be able </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to talk about topics and say things. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It just makes more far more interesting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And you know, if anything, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I would wish that sometimes people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> would like not assume exactly our thoughts </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and opinions on things based
off the things that we're. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Supposed to buy Harrys. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Does, are you heading
back to the office? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Anytime soon. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm in the office right now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Tell him to get back fresh, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> clean, and all shaven
looking business like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and let Harrys help you get. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - If you don't know
Harrys it's time you do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because Harrys was created </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> to be hitting different from
other shaving companies, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> little, little reference, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how always cross high quality, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> long lasting blades and
durable weighted handles </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that make a close,
comfortable shave quick. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And dare we say enjoy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Ooh, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> because Harrys insists </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you shouldn't have to choose </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> between a great shave and a fair price. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> They just give you both
refilling blade starts </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as low as two box. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Even easier. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> New Harrys customers
get their starter set, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which includes a five blade
razor weighted handle firming </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> gel with Allo and a travel cover. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's a $13 value all for just $3 43. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Is that a typo? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Typo, that is insane value. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And there are a bunch of other products. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And now I've actually used, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Harrys a bunch myself. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> When I went to the UK, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when I was getting on the plane, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I actually saw Harrys in the store </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and I wanted to buy more. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But there's no in Japan,
I've actually bought a bunch. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - You leach these stocks up on Harrys. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So there's never been
a better time to try. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Harrys going to Harrys.com/trash </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to get their starter set </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> for just three bucks. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's 100% satisfaction guarantee. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So you've got nothing to lose. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Go to harrys.com/trash right
now to get its special offer. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's H A R R Y S.com/trash links down </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in the description below. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Like (indistinct). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like one thing that I hate
about the internet, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And this is one thing
that I actually despise </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> about being an online creator </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is that if I want to
talk bad about something, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I always have to preface it before. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And we did the study with the thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with like me saying, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like, I don't want to see, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> girls dancing that isn't
trying to entice, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I have to then preface that
by saying I support sex work. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I think it should
just should be a given </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that that's what's. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - (indistinct) think so. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So that's the way I feel, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but it sucks the internet
that I have to always preface </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that, okay, I support
this, this, this, but, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I hate that fact
that I can't just talk. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I have to then be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> go through the checklist. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I want to talk about this stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> All right, cool. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've got to make sure that
everyone knows that I support </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this, this, this, this, this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's like, no, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You got a ride on
(indistinct) to fine prime. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just because someone
is always gonna assume </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the worst of you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They're always going to assume the, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what you're saying is the worst thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's kind of a bad </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> place that they don't agree. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You can't, say anything
bad about something </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that they agree with </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because they don't want to hear it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - And you know, it's and
it's over the internet, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> especially if it was in person, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> they put you in a different. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because that's the
biggest thing I've noticed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about speaking on line on the incident </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and speaking to someone person </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to person you like online, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you do have to preface a lot of things </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because it seems like in person to person, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> people are more willing to give you </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the benefit of the doubt. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - 100%.
- 100%. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Online people aren't willing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> to give you the benefit of the doubt. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> A lot of the times. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think the other problem </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as well is that on the internet, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's very much a one-way conversation. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - So you have to give your
entire spiel all in one, go. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Otherwise, if they do reply back to you, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> then it's not going to
be this conversation. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's just going to be like shooting </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the messenger kind of deal. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Right.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it's like, it sucks
that on the internet, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> common sense. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Isn't as common as people make it out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's like, when we say bad
things about Japan, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That comes from a place of loving Japan </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and being here for awhile, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we're here for a reason, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We like, we love this place
and we love living here, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it sucks that every time this </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and this has only happened
to Japan and the UK, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I never have to say, I love the UK. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Only with Japan. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Do you have to say, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I love Japan, but like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it has this weird stigma, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but there's a lot of topics </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that you have to do that in the internet. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If you want to say anything bad about it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you be like, I love this thing, but. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And if you don't say that
before, people are like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you come from a place of hating. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know and it's so frustrating </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that that's what it's become, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I feel that there
are so many discussions </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> it's so bloated because you have to go </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> through the checklist of
all this fucking nonsense. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That is the biggest difference </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> between us talking in a pub
and us talking on trash taste, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which we have the same
kind of conversations. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But it's like, you put your, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you putting yourself through a buffer. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like have more safety net </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> of the things you're about to say, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> whereas I wouldn't need
to do that if like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there were no cameras filming. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - (laughs) Like putting on
the seatbelt, like this 50, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the whole like way, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> way back with the gambling episode, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like I never, ever once
thought for a second. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And we were doing that episode, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - This is, probably like
a quite well-known episode </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> amongst the viewers </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you guys were addicted to gambling. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I know you guys, you're
not addicted to gambling, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> no point in your life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Would I say you? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> You know, and it was weird how, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> because we didn't that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'cause we didn't say because you, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even though you guys are
playing devil's advocate to me </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I was very much, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was very much arguing
in Gacha specifically, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but there should be more regulation </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and that it should be like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And you guys were just playing
devil's advocate with me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> right?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I know that you guys want
to take it to catch it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it was weird seeing
a lot of the comments, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just jump to conclusions and being like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they must be addicted to
catcher because they don't agree </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> with Connor's opinion. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it's like, all right,
you can, you can, you can be, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> you can not gamble and not be a gambler, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but also think that catcher
doesn't need any more. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - If you don't specify it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> then they think that you're on
the very end of the spectrum. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> You're not allowed to be. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It was just weird. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Seeing all the comments,
getting so aggressive about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like people get like angry
about it and it's happened on a </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> few other apps. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
I mean, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think like it kind of happened
quite recently with view </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> isn't it like the trip debates? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my gosh. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think, I think we, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I think the problem with that
was that we were arguing like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> two different things. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - And so it was, that was a weird one. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - And people, people took me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I was, 'cause I was trying
to argue that, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you can have driven the matter
how much you pay for it or </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how much is how much
the clothes are worth. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> And you are arguing that, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't support fast fashion and
you know, try to, you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you try to buy things or
buy clothes that are more </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> sustainable in different environments. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And you care more about quality nowadays. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And people took that as wow. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Connor and Joey have
just like lost their way. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> People like wow is so privilege. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And by most metrics I am privileged. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Never. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm never pretending to be like, I live, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like I come from like a really far off, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've never got tended. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And everyone's like, you
know, it was really weird. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That was because at no
point in that argument, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> did I ever argue that that drip
had to be expensive clothes? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> my main argument was that the
word drip initially came from, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you know, when, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> when you were like the rappers
who would wet grip and it was </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all branded, it had to be branded. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, that was my argument. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And at no point did I ever
argue that cheap clothes didn't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> look good? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> But for some reason the common
section took me arguing that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I prefer quality clothes,
not looks quality. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like I prefer stuff that lasts longer </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> than that damper support, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> fast fashion and all that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They were like, oh, well,
all these fast fashion, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> all the high-end ones
are using slave labor. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Anyway. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, well, you're
just generalizing it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You're putting them all in the bubble, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> but I never made that argument. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> It was, really bizarre. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Didn't you didn't, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I guess the issue was that </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you didn't put that safety net. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I never, and at no point </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> did I say drip has to equal money? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And that was the problem, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because I didn't say that people assumed </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I was thinking that
people have to assume, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it wasn't even funny. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I said at one point, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Joey, he'd you watched it back, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Joey joked say, yeah, drip is expensive. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You were joking. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> But Jerry, he was mainly me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Wow. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, what is happening? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And it was like, the
whole comment was like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Connor's privilege is really
showing I'm like what? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then like, man, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> they think with a first-world mindset. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I was thinking that like I was like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> from a first world country course, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm going to think I'm
trying my best to learn </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and to expand my horizons </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and learn more about other countries. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm obviously gonna think through
a first world perspective. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Like that's because that's my world. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is it wrong of me to
have that perspective? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm now because I. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Feel that's the only. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Perspective I'm trying to
learn about other things. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But I'm try to learn (indistinct) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - But in the case with that argument, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> it's very difficult to bring
in a different perspective. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Without a making no sense. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, I think the argument is that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> you know, yes. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Do you support sustainable fashion, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> but a lot of people from
third world countries </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> con you know, being able to sustain, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> being able to support sustainable fashion </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is in itself a privilege </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because other people can't do that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> some people will do at
the moment have no choice, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> but to buy cheap fashion
because they can hardly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well can never hold it against anyone. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know, when I was buying
those, I mentioned like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when I was buying the suit, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that was like 30 pounds. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Right?
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That was because that
was all I could afford. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I didn't get, there was no other option. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I couldn't even like entertain </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the idea of getting a suit that costs 100. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But obviously when you're doing better </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you have more income, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I do think it's more of a
responsible thing to do to try </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and buy things more ethically. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> In that episode, you'd
never once said, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I remember seeing this
other argument of like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> well, they just overpriced
the clothes, et cetera, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> et cetera. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Sometimes they do do that, but also, it's, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I've had this debate
coming from, you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> doing voice acting a lot, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is a job that takes
one hour most of the time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And you get, you can
get paid like $10,000. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Most people would
think that's, we'd argue, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's absurd. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You should never get paid that much </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for one hour of work. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But it's what goes into being
able to do it in one hour. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The reason why I could do that in one hour </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is because I'm trained </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I can do the job professionally. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I know how to use the equipment. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I know how to do everything in a way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> where you couldn't just take someone, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you get the quality of sound, right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You get, somebody who can do the quality </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that you want within </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> one hour in a professional way. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's the same way with close to me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, if I want a suit, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if I am in a good enough position </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to be able to afford a suit, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that is a nice suit and I can get it made </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for me specifically. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And get it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause I got it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I have the problem though, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I have short legs, massive. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So pants don't scale like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They scale wide and down I, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the pants I have to get like fitted </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because my, just </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so like that was always a challenge. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I always had jeans that were </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> either too short or too tight. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And I still have that problem </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because you can't get tailor, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> fit jeans, they probably can't, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's a real easy to get fitted. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So I think as well, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so if you were to get, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> let's say you go to a tailor, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You're paying a tailor
who knows how to do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Well, he's done this for like 20 years. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> He's experienced his whole life. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> He can promise you that
he'll do a good deal. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's worth the extra money. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If you have the money and you know, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you can support a local
business if it was one. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think if you, again, this is
only if you have the luxury, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> like it's, it's certainly a
privilege you want to do that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I would never, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> ever get anyone's case for not doing that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If you gotta, you gotta do
what you gotta do to survive. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Everyone else. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> what I don't understand is
the criticism towards like how </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> you spend your own hard earned money. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, it's like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I earned that money myself. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll do with that money. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> However, I please. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's a good point as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Taking care of my finances. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, why you care. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You can't listen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The only, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> the only questionable decision
I make is my Jojo collection. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Right? That's the, I'll
give you props for that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But everything. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm pretty. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I compare us to other YouTubers. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I think we're pretty normal. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Whereas you have a Lambo
garden when I rent a car, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know what, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know what car I rent a Toyota Yaris. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I love the Toyota guy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It is on my couch on
that car is fantastic. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's perfect size. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's not too big. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We don't. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We don't even own cars. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - I take the train everyday. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's I hate this thing
where people are like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they judge us for what we're
fucking doing with our lives. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's like, bro, just like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't come to your house </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and be like really hot
pockets cringe, bro. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah.
- [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - We got cheese puffs. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, no, what? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Like what is this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause, like you're going
back to what you were saying </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> about getting paid for like
doing an hour of voice. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It getting paid like a certain amount </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that voice actors do get paid. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I give this example to
like every artist, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Or every, anyone working
in that kind of field, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which is you go to you, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then you have to ask the client then. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So would you rather pay the same amount </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for me to do this work </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in five hours or in 10 hours </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to get the same amount of work? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And if they say yeah or no, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then you can say that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I'm being punished for, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> do my job well efficiently
in this time period. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So you'd rather pay someone
else to do the same work </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for more time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Even though you're paying them for like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're paying for the same amount of work, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but you're paying them to do
it less efficiently than you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But like the perception is that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because you're doing it this well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you're giving them the same amount of work </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for a shorter period of time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That you're charging that much. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And that's just how the industry is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, you're not just
paying for hours, worked in. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're paying for skill as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And skill is part of the
pricing that you pay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah absolutely. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And also, when it's these
big advertising companies, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> in what realm is it fair for your voice? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Be plastered over same. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> McDonald's all over the country. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Its a branding issue. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You got a brand like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's a using your voice. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> So you have a certain right to, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to sell that what it's worth. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There's a lot of jobs like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, you know, like the
art, like art design, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> graphic design, anything, it's, if it's, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> if it's although like
stuff like voice acting, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I 100% admit, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like it seems very easy from the outside, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> but to be able to do it consistently </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and perform what the person wants </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and be able to adjust </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and be able to do it all professionally, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it's very difficult. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And to be able to do it
over and over (indistinct). </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Build the reputation. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You've got a long way to go, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There's people who are much
better than me who can do it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> but you know, at the end of the day, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you want to make sure
everyone's getting the right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's, one of those tough decisions. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Money is always one of those topics </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that is so polarizing,
depending on what's going on, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> where you're from and your, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just your opinions on it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like, I've had people close to me </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> who have been like very critical </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of me earning money, doing what I do. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And they they've been
like, well, I do X thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I do X thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's more contributing to society. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I don't think it's right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> That, you would get paid more than me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And that whole argument. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I absolutely despise as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because it's like,
what can you say to that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That will get them to understand, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, if you work in like medicine </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> or something and you firmly believe </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you are doing
something more important, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I would argue, you want
to accept more important </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> than you are, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but that's just business. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's how it is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's how it was. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We don't make a virus. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey chuckles) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think there are jobs
that are far more important </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> than the jobs that we have now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Absolutely. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The fact that teachers get paid, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> what they do, I think is. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Fucking atrious. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Absolutely. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I think they should
like get much better pay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - But it's also like, you
got to do what you got to do, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> make your own bag. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like the world doesn't do
any favors (indistinct). </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's not something
we can do (indistinct). </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I will advocate for it for change. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I will do what I can from my position. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But also bro, this economy's right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You don't, it's bad, but it's like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what the that you trooper
can afford a house. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> where like now being wealthy
as you can afford a house. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like I'm trying to secure my future </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> because I don't know
how long this job last. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like I've tried to do well while I can, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I would never criticize anyone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> who is trying to do what they
need to do to succeed in life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - If you're not fucking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> over somebody do what you need to do. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like as long as you're
not actively hurting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> or ruining someone's life, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you do what you gotta do to get by </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you do what you need to do, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I firmly believe that
whatever you want to do, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> don't hurt anyone. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Go, for it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, it could be. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause I think one thing
that's one aspect of our job, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> which of the, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> which we wouldn't have as
like a normal office worker </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for example, is job security. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - If you want to get in this field </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and you want job security, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I think we have negative job security. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like how hard it is to like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you apply for like credit cards </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or anything long term financing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- [Joey] yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I want to know what your annual income </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that is literally impossible
to give a number as a YouTube. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like (indistinct). </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - All right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I'm not going to be honest with you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It could be like one K or
it could be 20 K or 100 K. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> So basically the whole spectrum of money. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's hard to go to a banker and go, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> well I think the next
video might do really well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm thinking maybe like this much. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - It must be like the banks
when they first met YouTubers, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> they must have thought they
were like horse gambling. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> There were definitely
like money laundering. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> This is like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> this is what we think like
NFTs are now you hunt. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You own. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> How much has YouTube? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> No, no. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (indistinct) touching that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Some money just comes in </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> when you don't buy or sell anything? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - So it's true? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - What do you, so Sue, who pays you? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember the first time, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like having to answer that question, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like when applying for like
our visas and stuff like that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I'm having to explain who pays us, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just like, well Google, so. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so like you set an appointment </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for Google you're employee of Google. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> You're like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [All] No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And then we have this
thing called patriarchy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where people pay us to exist. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So you are employed to patrons? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - [All] No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's like every, every like
red flag is being ticked. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like, when you're a doctor, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You, your job is secure. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Unless you got around killing people, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're pretty good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like you, it would be
rough not to be employed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I just realized how on paper? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Like how similar we must
look to like a drug dealer, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Michaelson laundering money. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If you, go to the checklist, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so you get money put into your account. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I swear. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> When I have to talk to
your accountants, man, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's the most stressful thing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because that just like I can </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> see on the zoom calls
the look on their face </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> while I'm telling them what I'm doing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Just like, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I find, it hilarious. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's the situation of a drug deal, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> going to a bank to get along. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, so do you, so you sell drugs. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Do you work for the pharmacy? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, I haven't got the drugs yet. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So this is kind of like collateral. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt and Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Drug dealers. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What'd you do? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm a YouTube. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I provide us (indistinct). </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I guess it's a timely topic. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Well, not timely. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I still be like three weeks late, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but that the whole Twitch
thing as well, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The earnings. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - People finding out
how much credit is make, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> what, was your number, Jerry? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't even. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was like probably 20,000 or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - So when you're in top
10,000 ducks, both league. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Hell yeah, let's go. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - This is why I'm a man of the color. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I am the man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I am the man of the people I recommend. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I represent the common folk. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - He's doing God's work right here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - This man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - I hope, all YouTubes is
get leaked before the next, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this age is poorly forgotten. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> God that was funny. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was seeing it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It was funny seeing the reaction. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause you know, as somebody
who's been doing this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I was not surprised
I've seen these numbers. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Absolutely not. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And also I try to tell, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I always try to explain to people, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the reason why let's say
X QC is earning 7 million </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and getting all this
absurd amounts of money. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What it seems like absurd is that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you know that if the
number one person in music </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> is making billions TV is
making millions, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - The number one at anything
is making tons of models. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Of course. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - If you're on the top, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a hundred of something in the world, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you're probably making a lot of money. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - If someone was bothered to leak it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> you have a suspicion </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that it might be a lot of money (laughs). </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And also... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - There's no point leaking something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> with the number one
sport is making like 15. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - If for this to exist, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> For the system to exist
where let's say that creator, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> you watch who is making 100 viewers. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Which is all of us at one time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - We were all at that one channel. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I distinctly remember
for a year or two, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I only got like 40 to 100 views on Twitch, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which I was very happy with. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Absolutely. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - For that person to go, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to make income and
somewhat support themselves </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> that has to be posted at the top. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Who's proportionally making a lot more, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> depending on the audience size, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Of course. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's a system that works. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Is it, super fair that
some people make fucking </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 100s of millions? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (laughs) It's up to you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, what I will say is that those, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> from what I saw, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> there is a lot more money on YouTube </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as opposed to Twitch what it seems. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - So the amount of work you do as well, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> especially. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I mean the YouTube, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like the top 100 YouTube </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> as a party making a lot more than </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the top 100 Twitch streamers. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] I think so. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - From what I understand. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- [Joey] yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - How it works. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I think so as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - (indistinct) Mr. Beach, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> there's no risk to beast on Twitch </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and all the ones that are </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on Twitch that involve money </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in gambling are extremely sketchy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Very, very sketchy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Definitely. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And that's a whole nother thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> The whole gambling side of Twitch is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That's a (indistinct). </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, you should have
inherently is a massive platform, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> much bigger than Twitter. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It is much bigger than Twitch. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like some of these channels
that are uploading, I, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> God knows how much Dom man's making. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm sure he makes
(indistinct) revenue in one day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (clears throat) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It was from sponsors, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like it's totally crazy and we, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I am still shocked that people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> are like top influencers earn </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how much, when there are some of them </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that are going around in private jets, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Lamborghinis, all this stuff. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's you know, I wish I
was I've wished that was me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean (indistinct). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'd love to buy my whole, all of Wales, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the GDP of Wales. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I'd love to reinvigorate the economy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I mean, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll be surprised how much
Hollywood movie actors make </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> or how much, some of the
top music artists make? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> And then like, and then like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is like a new entertainment platform. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Of course, top creators are
going to be making millions. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, we're not at
the billion stage yet </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because we're not as big </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as the other end statement industries, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but these are what the
top creators are making. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And that's just, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we are just like a baby mode
of the entertainment industry, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> of like the rest of the end establishing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the industry (indistinct). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm sure when like massive
Hollywood actors with posts, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> starting to make these
like massive loads of money </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> and that got found out, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm sure the general
public was like, wait, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> these actors make how much money. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Maybe, maybe. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel the exact same thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, it's such a new thing now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's also just so unprecedented </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it's so different to anything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> that you see on like TV or
radio or anything like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - This just three guys trying
to justify their income, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> the conversation. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I'm like, what? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> The Twitch thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like it's most of it's public anyway. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That, was what it was especially with, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which thing is that most content creators, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> sub account is public and this income </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> was somewhat known or close to now. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right.
- yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - You could easily have
like kind of guessed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> you would have been. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> So it's like quite odd. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Why is it a surprise? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think that people that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think a lot of content creditors </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> were like a couple of people
are still surprised about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think the people that were surprised </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about it were people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who weren't involved in Twitch </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or weren't touching it at all. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And so we were being like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm going to be a Twitch stream. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Good luck. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That, is harder than YouTube. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Twitch is hard. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it's, the search algorithms </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> aren't nearly as optimized </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as YouTube or TikTok or something. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, I mean, it's, it just shows that, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> there is, this is a
growing industry right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like this is, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's weird seeing how YouTube </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and Twitch have evolved </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> as time has gone on and seeing it go grow. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I think that's where the different lies </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and where they get their perspective from, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which was the difference
between say Twitch, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> streamers and YouTubers
versus Hollywood celebrities </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or big music artists is that, we, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a lot of us started off in
that exact same position </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> as everyone else, it is
an equal playing field. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So we don't get, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> we didn't have to go
through these auditions or, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> go get signed by this massive music label </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> or anything like that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> We grew organically buyers by ourselves. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- [Connor} Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I think it's just the shock that someone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> who went through that avenue
is able to earn that much. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - True. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - But it's, also like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I think what a lot of people
don't like to give credit </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to is that a lot of creators </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who are earning that much now, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> At some point or another, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> they were where they were
working full-time hours </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on top of whatever else </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> they were doing on something
that wasn't paying them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> But that's the things. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - For years. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like Twitch stream is again, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is like a lot like YouTube as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like the biggest difference is
that I think a lot of people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> see them more as like this person </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's on the same level </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where I was like a little more portable. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's just like the dude
across the road type of guy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Whereas like, no one views. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Bone, a billion dollars,
and people would be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> "Oh Connor." </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's just Connor being Connor. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Connor laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - With that, it'd be like, oh my God, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just different. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Then there's this
weird kind of dichotomy </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of how they expect </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the standards of traditional celebrities </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to influences and stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I've got, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> was going to say it was </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because something else got
you put up a second salary. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm fucking dumb. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Wait, what? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was going to say
something after Joey's point. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And I totally forgot it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What was Joey's point again. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - My point was that Twitch stream </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> is on YouTube as a scene
a lot more as like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just like a friend, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> one more possible, not
this person in the clouds, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> like a little like
Hollywood act as though. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - 'Cause you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> when you first start making
money on YouTube, it's exciting. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- [Joey] yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> YouTube is on my car. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I 100 bucks. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It crazy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's insane. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> And then you're really
proud because you're like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> "Oh my God, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can get paid for doing
this thing that I love." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then for the first two years </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was making enough </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to maybe buy myself a movie ticket $10,000 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> the first year, I think I
only made like $500 from it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Second year, probably like $5,000. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Still not enough to live off, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but I was like, whoa, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it looks like exciting. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> All right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then it goes off and it scales up </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and that's when I think
you start to feel bad </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> about how much money you're making. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do you ever get like
imposter syndrome about it? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Of course. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think most YouTubes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Get imposter syndrome. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The reason why a lot of
YouTubers don't want to talk about </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that money is because
a lot of them feel bad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Connor chuckles) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think, I don't
think they should write. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I wish we lived in a system </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where no one gave a about money </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and people could just
be more honest about it </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and that people could </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> 'cause then I think that would make us. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Which thing came out because now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - People like wearing the
earnings with, on their badge. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, 'cause I think that it makes </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> a better atmosphere for everyone </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> to be able to negotiate for
better like pay in their job. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know, there's
like in traditional jobs </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there's sometimes even </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> though they're not allowed
to ask you to do this, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that the bosses will be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't talk about how
much money you're making, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but you're allowed to, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but people don't </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> because they're scared
and they don't want... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - They don't wanna be judged. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But if you're doing the exact same thing </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> as your colleague, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> whether it be on Twitch
or on the same job, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you should be able to argue </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you should be valued
the same way they are. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it's one of those things where, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when I meet other content
creators in private, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'll ask them like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> how much did you get for
the sponsorship deal? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I'll be like, what'd you get? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause I want to make sure </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you didn't get over because I know </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> how much it should we get it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Because like speaking </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> from people in the people in industry, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> nobody teaches each other. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And one of the stupidest things </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that a lot of content creators, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> don't talk to each other about this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> even though the more content
creators you talk to, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> the more you realize, oh, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> a lot of people are getting fucked. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because they've never talked </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> to any other content
creator about this right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Tight taking deals
that like, for example, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> like I took a deal for
a sponsor on a video. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> This is when I was getting
around about an average 50,000 </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to 100,000 views. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I took a sponsorship for $100. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And the video got half a million views. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's not, worth it by
the way, something a video. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Let's say when you're about, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you have 50,000 to
100,000 average views, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you should probably be getting a ball </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> about maybe 2000 to $4,000. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's 20 to 50 times, 2000 (indistinct). </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Which sounds like a lot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I know that sounds like
a lot to a lot of people, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but this is advertising space, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - This is eyeballs that you're getting. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So you have to think of it like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So you can naturally. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I guess that's where our
knowledge comes in (indistinct). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Where it's, not like
that's not a set number </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because it all depends on the client. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It all depends on the
product you're promoting. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Some clients in certain spaces </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> are willing to sell you like
this spot for a higher price. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Some aren't it's. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's really comes down to experience. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> But if you're a content creator, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you should really be talking
to other content creators. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If you have no idea
what to charge a client. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - If you have no idea, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then I've I've liked. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 'Cause here's the thing I've searched up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've searched up like before, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like YouTube of like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how much you should be
charging certain clients. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And unlike all the YouTubers I've seen, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who have said how much you
should be charging have got the, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've got the number wrong. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And that's because a lot of them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> aren't big creators, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And like the numbers, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> really depend on where you are on YouTube </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and it really comes down to experience. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And what your other, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what other people are
doing in your fields, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which really depends on
how much you can charge. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - So I feel like talking
to you guys about it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> before we are now able to charge more </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because we realized that we </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> all get charged different prices. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> For certain... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Mean, it's also not just about like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the sub count and like view
counts, stuff like that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> So I feel a lot of it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> especially nowadays that like
companies are looking for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> forwards, like branding Powell. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like you could have the two channels </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> could have the exact same
number of sobs and views, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but one could be a stronger brand </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and that in and of itself. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it depends on like the
audience and the demographics. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So there's so many
components that go into it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's not just like a bare bones. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like I get this many views on average, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> therefore I should be
getting this amount of money. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like it's completely
case-by-case and lunch. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Which is like, my
general advice to anyone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who is independent and not even </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> a YouTube, but an artist, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> We've had to learn what our value is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's the biggest thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - You have to, like, you have
to know what your value is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Not be ashamed to say it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And not be ashamed to say it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Whether they ask how much it costs. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Connor chuckles) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - - When it comes to
negotiations with a company </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or with a fellow client, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> you can't be ashamed to big up your value </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because you are bringing
something for them. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You are, bringing something to the table </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you need to articles about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Nothing hurts me more
than seeing an artist </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> on the selling themselves. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So much. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It hurts so much. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Like, I always make sure, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> if I'm working with an artist, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, you sure you want that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, I can give you more. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think you're worth a
little bit more than that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> You, gotta have a little bit
of confidence in yourself, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but you can't be scared to like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> obviously you can't like ask
for an egregious amount at, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at a small price, but you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there is a limit that you can go. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it's okay to step over </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that limit even slightly just
to get your name out there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - If you really believe in your work, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but yeah, just, oh my God, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've seen so many artists just be like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> yeah, I'll give you like this amount. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's like a 10th of what
I was envisioning is like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't know if you want to
do that (laughs) to like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> be a little more confident in yourself. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> You know. </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_03> - Joey. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I have a question (indistinct). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - As you know, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I've been reading recently
and I've just saved $20 </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> on new kitchen equipment. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Well, my new house honey </SPEAKER_04>

<SPEAKER_01> - The episode. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (clears throat) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And then I think another thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that a lot of people don't talk about </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> when it comes to like
the economics of YouTube </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> and like getting, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> getting paid for this as a job
is that is the amount of time </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> a lot of content creators will go </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> before they get big doing work </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and not getting paid and
not doing this for money. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, I did YouTube for like seven, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> eight years before I
saw my first paycheck. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And especially in, especially
nowadays, it's a super, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> super competitive industry in a super, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> super competitive field. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So my like whenever someone
comes to me and ask me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for advice about how to
make YouTube a job, I, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the first thing I ask them is, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> do you have the time to
take a year off in your </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> life without getting paid
and working at night, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like working harder
than a nine to five job </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because that's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that's the minimum sacrifice </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you will have to do nowadays too, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> unless you're like super,
super lucky to do YouTube. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And even if you do that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you might not even get popular. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> You might, it might not
even come to fruition. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So are you willing attempt to
make that sacrifice in your </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> life for a chance to have this as a job, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> which is why, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I feel very lucky to have this position. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Likewise. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But you know, I did. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I do, you know, I do know that I, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> there was some portion of
luck within my career path, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but also everyone I've met, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> including all three of us
worked super hard as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> We went through a point
where we were working harder </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> than the nine to five job </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> without getting paid or being paid like </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> less than minimum wage
to get where we are. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And we did that for about a year. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I feel like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like a lot of
people who are maybe older </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> who are more established to be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I got a nine to five job. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I can't really take a year out in my life. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's why a lot of YouTubers, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you see a start off in like
college or in high school </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when you do have that time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And all I can say to that is I'm, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you know, I'm sorry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's just the way it works. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You can't like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's not a company, YouTube. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Isn't like YouTube. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You're not a paid salary, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It's. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, like, as an example, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's like, you know, like Mr. Bass, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> like Jimmy was barely got
any views for like the first, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like six, seven years of his career. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then all of a sudden
he's he's at where he's at now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I think what a lot of people forget </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> is that he didn't just
come out of nowhere. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He didn't just make a
video and it immediately, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> get them 50 million solves. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like he worked for that shit. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It takes a very long time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And that's the thing that
everyone wants to gloss over. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And that's not me just trying
to justify why people should </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> make 50 million dollars a year, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it's just, you should, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you can't criticize it without
first understanding that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and appreciating that it does
sometimes take a ton of work. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And the one thing that people love </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to forget is that life is not fair. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right now. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Could, you could put just as many hours, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> if not more hours into
playing guitar or something </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and nothing could come of it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I always. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Think of the 100s and 1000s </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of guitars (indistinct). </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, you also have to, like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think one thing that is kind
of oversold in life is that </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> if you put X of hours into something, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> it'll just work out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - And it's not always that simple. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - And it's not always that simple. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You know if you're
getting into something </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that is extremely popular worldwide. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's going to be way
harder than if you're, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for example, making anime videos </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on a website called YouTube in 2015. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Connor chuckles) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] I mean... </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I it's differences in scale </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of what you're trying to compete. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, I'm sure everyone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> on will everyone in the world started </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> doing the type of content
that we were doing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I think we'd be out of a job pretty soon. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause no doubt. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There'll be other people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who are better than us that would </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> happen, but that's not, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> but not everybody's doing it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I feel that's why it's called
a dream job for or a reason. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean like I did take a massive risk </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> with my career choices, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> because back then when
I had a steady paid job, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I had a career path I
could pursue and I liked. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Where did you work a gain. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I worked at the BBC. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Did she know that? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - She. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - And to bring it back. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - And the timestamps
it'd be like justifying </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> or privileges (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> this a section of the. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - No, because yeah, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I did sacrifice that a proven career path </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for an industry </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that was not proven that an industry </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that didn't exist back then, that I, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that wasn't proven where I could do this </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> more than a year or two. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I took a risk that it was going </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to turn out to something. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was lucky enough
that it did turn out. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know, nowadays it's
a different ball game. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know, I took that
risk with my career path. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If you want to be a
YouTube or Twitch streamer, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you have to take a different risk. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's a different risk, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but the risk to reward is like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the rewards are there to be seen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And that's why people will
take risks to get that reward. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - The one lucky thing
about YouTube and twitches </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> that you can do in your downtime, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> you can put a little bit
of effort here and there, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> see some results, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> see that there's a demand for it </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and then dedicate more time to it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That is one good thing about it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, you know, yes, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're going to be at a disadvantage. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If you are working like God
said, and you are 30 plus, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> and you've got a life
that you need to maintain. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But it's not impossible. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like there is, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there are some ways there are cases </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> where it has worked out again. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's just harder and the
playing field isn't level, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> but it never is. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - You know, I'm sure that </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if you let's say you just had a friend </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who was a big YouTube, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're already at a massive advantage </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because they can help you out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Oh yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Or you have a family history </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of using cameras or editing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like there's all kinds of
variations of advantages, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but that's life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I feel that can apply with any job, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> anything in life (laughs). </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I think I can play with any job right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - (indistinct), but I guess </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> because we're somewhat public figures, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> so it's a lot more. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I would say every career
path has their own obstacles. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Of course. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Especially like, for example, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> if I will take engineering, for example, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's actually not advantageous
to you to do like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to do a good job in your company </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and stay in that company. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because like the raises
you get are better. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If you move companies </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you're constantly moving companies. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - True. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And that, I don't think
that should be right, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I think you should be. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think every employee should be rewarded </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> for doing a good job at that company. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But the sad reality of it is, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> is that a lot of the times
in a lot of career paths, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> you can get a much better
raised by changing companies. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then moving back to
the original company. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And you're thinking
like, why can't I just, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> why can't the original company just see me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> for my worth to begin with? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like Twitch stream
is moving to YouTube. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - That's true. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> All right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's free privileged individuals, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the fiber, you know what? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> The one thing, the one
comment that I actually, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I know I'm just, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm inviting this comment
now you've changed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I like the old blank better. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - And it's like, are you
saying that I should, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I would be the same person
I am at 20 years old </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that I am now because you're insane. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> How about if you think that
I should be the same post </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I post, I'm gonna change. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> If I didn't do YouTube, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I would still change. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It would change regardless. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm becoming more miserable. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> (indistinct), you change. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - And when people comment saying like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> oh, they've changed. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know, they're different from them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, yes, of course, as you should, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you should become more
confident as you get older. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I wouldn't be worried. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I wouldn't be worried
if you didn't change. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You should mature. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You should change your opinion. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You should act differently. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> That's called life. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> If you're not doing that, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what are you doing? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - What are you, why aren't you changing? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Why aren't you improving yourself? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I, but then I guess that's. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's the thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's proving. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Becoming more gluttonous, more wealthy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - He's changed since he
got his Audi Ben he's got. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Spending money on drip now
instead of going to primer, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> how dare he. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - It all changed when Connor
got this pumpkin spice latte, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Starbucks for the first time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> you have change. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - That one trip to Los
Angeles changed everything. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I changed my mind. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm not going to be broke anymore. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughinga) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - No, but I mean, I agree you should, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or you should always be changing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, I think there is a difference </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> between changing and, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> becoming a bit snobby a bit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because you know, like
I still can't stand. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> What can I say? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I still can't stand flex culture. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Well, it's weird, isn't it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because you want to be able to celebrate </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and support the people who
have really worked hard </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and have done great stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I've made some good
content and, and you know, I, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I want to see them do well, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but then I guess there's a very fine line, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> especially for audiences. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - What is considered
flexing and then what is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm not going to go
around and be like, oh, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> this is what I bought and I'm killing it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know, all my
investments are doing well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, he's just like
full on a video being like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> so here's how my stocks doing this month. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's a doge coin. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> As you can see. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I got into stocks when
everyone got into stocks </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> in the red for a very long time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So there's no flexing for me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - But it is a fine line between like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> what is flexing </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> and what is just being proud
of your accomplishments. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> All right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like, what is the,
how, when does it change. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Ah, it's hard, isn't it? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Because you don't want to
be like, yeah, I'm doing well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But you also, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'cause some people perceive
that as you've changed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So it's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> what do you do not want me to like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> show you my achievements or. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> So people will, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> people support small craters </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then they also turn on them </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when they're, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> when they find out they're
doing well sometimes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's the underground
band going three years. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just in a different field, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they've changed everything </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> ever since they were successfully </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> signed by the music label, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> don't like their music anymore </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> talking about different things. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I liked them before they
became an animator of mini. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I don't get annoyed </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> if someone prefers all the content </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of mine or they prefer
because the style has changed. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I understand that when
you change your style, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> not every style is for everyone. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I don't get annoyed
and people are like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I prefer the old videos. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, all right, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's fair enough. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I get it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like, it's your taste. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> All right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - But I'm not going to change it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause that's not what I want to do. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, I still get comments
that are still like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I miss the anime zone. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Well, when are you going to bring back </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the anime zone reviews? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm just like, dude, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I killed off reviews for like a reason. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Yes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I have changed in that sense. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm not doing enemies. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm not doing enemies
zone reviews anymore. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And people still ask
me for my let's play. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But then I also get
annoyed at content creators </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that like wine at that audience, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> all the time, they're like, oh, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> why are you complaining? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You don't let the new videos. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's like, well, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you need to go out your way </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> and make something it's different. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You can't expect your
audience to just follow suit. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And like, it's up to you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - Sometimes you just have to be like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> just screw up the audience things. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If this is what makes you happy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You do that content? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I hate YouTube. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Is that sit there and make videos, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> whining that they're not doing well. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like, go over it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's you, if you change
something or you're doing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you're not making like
stuff that is keeping up </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> with the times that's on you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I believe. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That, is part of the job
that you signed up for. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You should know this, you know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - And if you're a doctor, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> you have to keep learning
the new medical practices. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You can't, go doing shit (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like the 1960s. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - Oh you a COVID here's some leeches. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You can't do that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There's differences. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> There's regulations and you're
forced to do it, but God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Imagine if there wasn't </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> people would never update their thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - And then a reason why they do it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is because it's to the detriment
of anyone else around us. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - The problem is with YouTube, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> it's not to the detriment of anyone else. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If a content creator falls off, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there are tons more, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah I know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It is up to you to make sure
that you are making stuff. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You are up to date. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - When my channel falls off, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> there can be plenty of curb, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> your enthusiasm memes </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of this section of the podcast, you know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I'll, you know, it's, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> if I stop trying to change, that's on me. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> If I don't want to do that anymore. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I understand that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Favorite comments I get though, is like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's not even the you've changed all the, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I liked the old content better. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's the youthful and off. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You're irrelevant </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - You're irrelevant now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, what? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> Because you Postly, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> don't like myself now
I'm suddenly irrelevant </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> in the grand scheme of things. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There's people who are not
going to like what (indistinct). </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And that's fine. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm going to try to appeal to everybody. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Like if you don't like
it, that's cool, dude. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There are literally
thousands of content crazy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You could go and watch. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's not strange. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's strange. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't really know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What's your opinion gone. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Tell me your opinion. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - My opinion on changing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You want to opinion on trash tastes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean like for me, like changing </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is part of our job. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And life, I think you
should change as a push it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Joey] Yeah, absolutely. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - When I go back and see
my friends from school, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if they're exactly the same
as they were in school, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's a red flag. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But some people don't change. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Did you notice that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I did. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And I don't give a if they
haven't that's on them. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's I think it's like, oh, that's odd. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like nothing has changed
your point of view </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in life in five years. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like nothing has made you think different. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Not none of your experiences
have changed who you are. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Fair enough. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But then I don't want them to be like, oh, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you've changed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yes, I have. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Get over it (chuckles). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, you, of course I've changed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I moved to a foreign country </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> and I have no idea what's
going on off the time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I barely know how to
communicate with my taxi driver. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I've changed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm fighting for my life, man (laughs). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No, because I feel like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> that just says a lot of
us about us as people, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> because I'm constantly looking for change. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Same. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm like uncomfortable </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> when things stay the same for too long. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I think that's why I. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Get scared when start to get not right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Which is kind of makes
YouTube my perfect job, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> because I never want to stay still. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm constantly wanting to change. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I like my boss. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Not just like being in Korea, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but in like my own life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I, that's why I've moved
countries so many times. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I still don't know why I
want to settle down yet </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because I'm like scared </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to like stay in one place for too long. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just like, do you know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's just me as a person. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I constantly like changing my life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm not saying </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you are the type of person </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who doesn't change and stays
comfortable in one place, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> there's nothing inherently
wrong with them. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But all I ask is you don't
judge us for changing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - For changing (laughs). </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Changing as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And you know, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there are some people in some people </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who I was mates with back in the day </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I have less than common with now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And that's just part
of me having to accept </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I have changed and we
have less in common with. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We're going to push
our values on you guys. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, you know, just don't (indistinct). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Sure. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Except for drip by drip. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You should buy drip. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But I'll give my opinion. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> You don't have to take it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Absolutely. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm on very Brashard lipid. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I know that, yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm not going to cry over you. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Not agreeing with me. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I could get annoyed at people. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> Completely misinterpret what I'm saying. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That doesn't sound like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> how did the did you get that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're standing in a completely
different argument that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I need a toilet quickly
go pitch yourself. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Speaking of going to your hometown </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and see if people have changed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I do have a funny story about someone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> who I met in my university town </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that has definitely changed in a way </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I didn't imagine. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So what happened is I
went to see someone mates </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who are living in Bristol right now, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> which was by my city where
I went to university. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I went to university of Bristol. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And so we were at this club, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And we meet, a guy there and this guy who </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I wasn't very close to him in university, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but a word on the street was
he was the type of guy who, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if you needed certain substances, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that was the guy to call. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And so, I'm just having a casual chat </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and he asked me what I'm doing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like, oh, I
start talking about Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I saw it, start talking
about being a YouTuber, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> living in Japan and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And he goes, "Oh, I do
something about Japan now." </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, what the do you do now? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What, is this person? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So like to, to preface, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this is a guy who applied
to love islands once. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> He's not the kind of guy </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> who I would expect has any interest </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in a male in Japan at all. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And he goes, oh yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, I deal in ideal Pokemon cards. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, off. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What, is this? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And he's like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm like, how are you
getting Pokemon cards? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I was like, oh, I love Pokemon. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've always loved it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> how are we getting Pokemon cards? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, God, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've got contacts. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> why did you have to
make it sound like that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, and so he takes me, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> he takes me over to one side. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> He's just like, "Yo, gone,
gone, come here, come here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Look, I've got a good deal. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> If you're interested in Pokemon go." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was just like, whoa. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, you're
taking the (indistinct). </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You're taking the. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just sent off. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I just sent off a shiny MuTu. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He got graded nine grade nine, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> shiny new to make first edition. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> You can be yours. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm sending it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I'll give you a good deal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'll give you a good deal. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I'm just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> this is the weirdest offshoot </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of breaking bad I've ever seen. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - We've got great. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - And so, yeah, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> so this guy went through </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a complete career change apparently. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And is now as in, is
now dealing poker one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Got contacts and came free </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> to pause out a bunch of businesses. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's the whole weirdest aspect </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> of this whole Pokemon card </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> was it was that people were sending cards, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> they're cards for Logan Paul to open. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Why? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So that they could be in the video. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Some kind of like modern
cooking that I'm not aware of, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where like you don't get in trouble </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> without opening your own things now. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Or you have to send them to someone </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> else who can open them, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but better. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Connor chuckles) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like a politician. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like a full of, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> oh, he's opening that Pokemon cup. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like, what is this? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> We can walk we're gear. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Are we in where we don't get enjoyment? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's like, it's like, well, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've gone buy a bunch of Gacha </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and I make Joey login
my account and do it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause he does it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean that also is a thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Man] Garnt always pulls
for me and I kinda get it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Modern. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> Cocking is this like,
this is, what is this one? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> When did this begin? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm pretty sure. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> There's like a bunch of
like ginching YouTubers </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who gave they get like take
like poles for other players. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like it's just
like living vicariously. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So then just one person. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Because- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I guess. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - With Pokemon cards, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it feels like a weird extra step </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> where you would send these
like extremely valuable cards </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> to be open to that. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> Do they ever come back to the post? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They come back to the person. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I think it's, I think I kind of get it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause it's kinda like
sharing your, like, like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like this it's all about
the experience, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Because you're, sharing the experience </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> with say your favorite content creator </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because you know, there's a difference, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you know, there is a
difference doing it yourself. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Unlike having to freak out by yourself </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and like doing it as like a group. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I was like, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Kind of makes sense. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I guess it just feels like
this weird kind of year. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Are we in a bit of an extra, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> some people just don't
want to open up their own </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> things anymore. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm going to invite gone over </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to open up my Dyson vacuum </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> just so I can get the true experience </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> of how a dog should take off appeals. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> A Dyson should be on box. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> God will do it better than me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Isn't it weird? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like, okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I understand. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There's a shared
experience, but it's weird. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's strange. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's strange. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's a bit strange. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I don't think it's strange. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I would you. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Do it? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Would you send off your
cards for someone else? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, but I would, if I'm like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> say opening, like a rare pack, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> I'd want my boys in there. I'd be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I wouldn't want to do it by myself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I want to like share the experience. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Boys. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> 5:00 PM. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm opening up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The fresh pack right here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Non crinkled cards. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Look it's, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's just like part of the fun </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> is the shared experience of </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> just doing this exciting thing, you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - But when does it not become your thing? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's not your thing anymore. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's someone else's. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What'd you mean. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - If you send your cards off to load </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and Paul to open up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Do they, does he send them back? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - No, no. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> But it was a massive difference. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's like you being cut out, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There's a massive difference </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> between like you gathering
your friends to do </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it in front of your friends </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and then sending your cards to </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> someone that you don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Who maybe (indistinct). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - And they don't know you. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Thanks (indistinct), thanks
for giving me the call. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I mean, it's that with extra steps, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but like you're sharing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that with like say one
of the biggest content </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> creators on the platform. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So it's like, Joey chose
to do this role for me, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> Joey is that like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The problem is like majority of like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if they're like streaming on Twitch, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the majority of the chat
isn't going to be like, oh, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this is the card that
was sent by this person. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Holy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I guess I kind of get it
now that you say it like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I do kind of understand that
you could get more enjoyment. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've seen other people
react to your thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But it is your strange, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> what level of consumerism
are we on right now? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> We buy things for ourselves, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> for someone else to open. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> For what level is this of Capitalism? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Is this is what they're going to use. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Unlike other communist, look at it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> They don't even buy
their own stuff anymore. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They buy it for someone else to open it. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> It's like, okay, I kind of get it now, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it is strange. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It's a bit weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - You have to admit objectively. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It sounds bizarre. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, you can make
anything sound weird </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> if you like put it in the- </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Try it, try it, do it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'll give you an example. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - But like, I mean like that's kinda like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> the same kind of argument when let's play </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> as thoughts to be, get popular, right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like it's a bit weird, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, you kind of just
watching someone play </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> a video game and not
even good at the video. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I would argue with that one though. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's not like I'm buying a
physical copy of the game. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah is sending it to (indistinct) plan. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm not, I don't have a copy anymore. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then I'll watch you play it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm sending it again to the left lane. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then they're like,
just after you finish it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> just give me back the game. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Again, people do buy games, streamers, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but then they normally do
that because they want to get, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> they want to see them have
the experience that they had. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's, all about the shared experience. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I guess I do understand the feeling. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it does seem strange to me </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that this even was a thought </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that someone was like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm going to send my cards to Logan Paul. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like, is the way
you've seen the sentence. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's a kin to like
being cocked in my mind. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's like I say, my girlfriend </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I won't get as much
satisfaction out of doing this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I would watching someone else do this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It is kind of more satisfied. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean, I take </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - (indistinct) That's cool, dude. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, I mean, like for example, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> with Gacha it is like a lot
more fun to pull on street. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Comes back to Gacha. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - It does always come
back to catch a ride, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> but I mean. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's kind of peak entertainment, 2021. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, that's what
Pokemon cards are, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Just physical. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Gacha right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> So it's a lot funner
to do with your mates. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like every time I remember </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> when we were like addicted
to art legs, every time, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> every time Joey was in
the office, he was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm going to do a pool. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And we're like, oh, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> let's see what he gets. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's a lot more fun to do with mates </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> because if you don't get it, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then your mates will be
like, ha you're a idiot. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> But it's like your buying
packs for Joey to Paul because. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - He got the cards back. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Let's say, yeah, yeah, I guess you do. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I guess like the
equivalent of that is like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm gonna give you 100 bucks
to pull on dark nights. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But once you finished the polls, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I need you to send me the 100 bucks back. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey chuckles) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I like, that's a little weird. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, it's more like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you're just giving the
phone to another person, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Joey, you do the pool
for me trust (indistinct) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Giving your significant others </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or someone else for one evening. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> Magical love, nature that you can view. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - While you sit back and enjoy the show. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm not crazy right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> With this comparison I. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Get where you're coming from. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> But it's just, now that I think about it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it is not as weird (laughs)
as I initially thought. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's weird. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Is that weird that we
don't find that weird? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Let me, you let me
sell you another idea. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So, like you watch movies </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and enemies and stuff like that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So, that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like imagine instead of
watching a two hour movie, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> you could watch three
blokes sitting on a set, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> arguing about chicken
breasts and chicken thighs. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> How's that sound? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I was like quality context. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> I have one question. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Why subscribe? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I sign up. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I suppose. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What would you categorize? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Why'd you think? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Why do you think trash
taste is successful? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - (indistinct) is a sucking our own Dick. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (indistinct). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - So good. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Can you explain? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Why do you think, what is, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> why would someone go and watch us </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> instead of watching a movie, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> which objectively better entertainment. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I could give, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like a really deep answer
now that is just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like... </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I'm ready for the truth bond. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I feel like we've, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the whole shared experience
thing we've talking about. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> A lot of people would
now crave kind of like </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that feeling of like a relationship </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or like a closeness of someone and people. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> A lot of people can feel
that parasocial eat by, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for example, sending their, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> their cards to their favorite streamers </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or sending some money </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for their favorite
Gacha streamers to pool, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> or just watching three blokes, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> three friends talk for two hours. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, you get that feeling </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that you're connected with someone, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you, they, you have that
feeling of connection, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> even though that connection
isn't technically real. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, and I feel like
a lot of content nowadays, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> especially with the younger generation </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> is gut like a lot of the most, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> successful streamers and a lot of the most </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> successful content creators are people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who can accurately represent </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that feeling of a close connection, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> a parasocial relationship I'd say, see it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That was, my deep answer. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm 14. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And this is deep, bro. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt chuckles) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - My, meme answer is just, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's just three blocks shine ship. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I guess. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause we died, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we didn't strive to have that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Right. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> We just make, we just talk, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Connor laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but it's always much deeper. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - (indistinct) self satisfaction. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We just wanted to make it
show we just chat shakes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, we didn't try for that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> It just happened by (indistinct). </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Complete luck. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So like, I guess the whole, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> I watched a video by what's his name? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Glinka is it whose name
did it be about only fans </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and the more, not the sexual side, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but more so the power of social side </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> where a lot of guys are on there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because they that's like
the closest they feel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that they can get to your girlfriend. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And that was really
sad watching that video </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because you had interviews with people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who are only fans subscribers know, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and as much as we meme on only fans. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then to know that, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> that whole thing about, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> earlier we mentioned the whole density, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> we're going to take jokes. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I do feel very sorry for these guys. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like a lot of them that feel </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that they have no other choice </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or there is no other choice for them. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just life circumstances or
maybe what I was going on now, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's, you're busy, it's, and it is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it isn't just the sheriff </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> or guys you think here at doing </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> stuff like that, who consume that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You know, sometimes it's
people just have no time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They're very successful and
they have too much money. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But the one thing that you
don't have is time, which is, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and the ability to go and make friends. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Especially if it's. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah, it is hard. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like a lot of people are lonely it's, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> especially during the times
of the pandemic as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's like only kind of just
extrapolate extrapolated. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> That's only kind of exaggerated. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Exacerbates. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I feel sorry for a lot of guys, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> obviously as a male myself, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's one of those things </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> where you can't really openly talk </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> about being lonely. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's quite difficult to do it, you know? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's often hard to
just reach out to friends </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> and be like, Hey man, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm not gonna lie. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm just lonely, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You want to hang out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like, it's really hard to do that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And that whole stigma of
like macho insecurity, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I always want to try and
dispel that and be honest and try </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and be open with my are my
emotions and what I'm feeling, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> just so that hopefully other people </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> can be more open with it as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like I feel like when
you're a public figure, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it's kind of your responsibility
to try and improve the </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> understanding of topics like that I think. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Generally. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> You're allowed to feel emotions. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, bro. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> So, 'cause you know, more often than not, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> there is a lot of toxic masculinity </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and pride that men have </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and especially to be
successful and provide </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and you know, basically not be a up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Garnt and Connor laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But this pressure
pressures a difficult man. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I feel like a lot of
guys end up pushing up, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> pushing a lot of friends away. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause they're so focused on
trying to not be a failure. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel like, especially with guys, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> it's hard to talk about. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's hard to talk about
something negative. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Like I remember. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I remember like I
remember when we went back </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to see all our mates
and we had that Airbnb </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> where we all caught up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember like going
into like a conversation, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like a deep conversation that </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> some of our guy mates
were having at the time, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I remember sitting down
on the table and like one </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of our mates was talking about, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> going through therapy for </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> one of the things that they went through. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And you know, more, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> more and more people started
sitting like sitting in </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and then started sharing their stories </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> about how they also were
going through something rough, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> especially during COVID. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And they had to like
seek therapy about it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then eventually we just
had these CR this whole table, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> this group of guys, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I was just like, wait a minute. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Has anyone here not been to therapy? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> We look around and nobody
puts their hands up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was like, so wait. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So everyone here has been to therapy. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And I was just like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> how have we never talked about this before </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for like four years? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's a shame thing, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, people got a lot of
guys feel shame admitting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that they have any of those problems. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> if something should be
normalized and not being ashamed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> of frowned upon, it's just, it's this, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it's admitting that you have a problem </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and you're seeking help for it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's like, I feel like, especially, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> especially in England and
especially in Asian culture, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it is very much frowned
upon to like say, Hey, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I went to therapy or I talked to someone </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and I was just like,
'cause like the mentality </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is that if you go to therapy, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> then you're inherently trying </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to fix something about yourself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You're in here. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> There's something inherently
wrong about yourself. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - But I think people don't want to admit </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> that there's something wrong. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Just avoid it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> And I think that's absolutely. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> You know, just speak it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> like try and trying to
keep like a healthy, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like a good mental health is not, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> it's not something that should
be frowned upon, you know? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I feel like America in this, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> I like leagues ahead of other
cultures and just accepting </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> this and... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Gender doesn't stop you from being sad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Like if you're sad, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> it doesn't matter what you
identify as if you're sad. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And if you need to talk about it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you need to talk about. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The, male suicide rate
is so high man, like, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I should have sort of sat
thinking about (indistinct) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well male depression
rate is so high as well. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like no one talks about it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Books about thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> What I'm saying in my first
year of living in London, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> looking back, I could easily
tell you I was depressed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But at the time, I didn't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't know why I was miserable. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't think I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I have no reason to be sad. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> So I'm not sad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Just because he had
no one to talk about it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - (indistinct) a bad mood. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But I also didn't even because
I hadn't been educated on it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> no one even told me that that was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> who tells you what depression feels like? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- [Joey] yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - How do you learn that? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't know what it was. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I didn't understand what it was. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And only now when I look
back and I think, oh, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'd like all the, the
trademarks, if depression, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I like didn't want to
hang out with anyone. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I also was lonely and (indistinct) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - Let us catch 22. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, it's normally it's
being your own worst enemy, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I didn't understand that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And, I'm very, very lucky </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> that I managed to just
get out of it on my own. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And that now I'm much better. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I think it was a whole slew of reasons </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> of why I don't feel that way anymore. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Mainly like just life reasons changing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - But I wish that I'd had more
education on it in school. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Like in Wales, it was never brought up. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Depression was for people who were crazy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> That was not what healthy people </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> have with normal jobs and wives. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know, you can't be sad
if you have a job in a wife. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Connor laughs) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - You've got a 50 inch plasma screen TV. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> You can't be depressed, (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Depression is people who killed people. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's what it was like,
obviously exaggerating. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> But yeah, that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I feel at school as well, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like it's hard to take seriously </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> because of the environment that you're in. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Well, I was just
miserable in school anyway. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I, yeah, it's really difficult. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's a really uncomfortable
thing to think about. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - There are times in
my life where I'm like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> oh yeah, I'm there. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So that I was like miserable </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and very, very unhealthily. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So very self-destructive. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I just didn't recognize it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I didn't know why. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I guess the main reason is
like why yeah, no one, nothing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Most of the time, nothing
makes you depressed. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It just happens. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I feel like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> it's go going back to what
you're taught in school. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> It's just like, oh, the,
seeking help therapy. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Those are for the crazy people. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - It's just like, you know what? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You don't want to be associated </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> with the crazies with
some something, you know? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's just like, that's just
not how real life is at all. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> A lot of people will have a lot of issues </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and like some on varying scales, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but there's nothing
wrong with just talking </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to someone professional about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - There's nothing wrong with seeking help. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, you know, when you've had it </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> for an extended period of time, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I didn't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, well, this is just normal. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This is how I've always felt. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know anything else. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This is what do you mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's when it starts to get scary. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> because that's all I like for awhile. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That was like how I
just felt all the time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So I was like, oh no, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was nothing to complain about </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because this is how it's always. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause, your memory is very
good at letting you forget </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> things over a year. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> So you very much forget how it was. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - You'll be sued. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You could be, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you'd be surprised how
easy it is for your mind </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> to just accept things the way they are. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - 100%. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Now you can get used to a lot of things </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's scary how you can just get used </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to like a lot of like a toxic period </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in your life or like a really
bad period in your life. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> And your mind just like
accepts that as the norm. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And if you forget that life
could be better, that's you? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That not everyone should feel this way. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - And unfortunately our mind </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is a terrible way of
coping with situations. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> We don't like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I'll brain is amazing at that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like hiding from us. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So for a long time, I
didn't know why we're sad, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> but I couldn't figure it out. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> Like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And he's very good at just like putting </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> on the emergency handbrake. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Sometimes it'd be like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's really good at like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> that little brain is really
good at that (indistinct). </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You really that boy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh year. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I employ you to think about it more. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> And if you want to get
help, don't be ashamed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Don't don't be, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> and don't be ashamed to
talk to it about your, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> to talk with your classmates about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - 'Cause that's the biggest thing. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - You're very blessed
to have a good friends. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - And if you mates don't
take it seriously then, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's something that's
telling all your mates. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> Probably not your mates. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's telling. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> That is telling because I've, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I realized then that I was
lucky enough to have mates, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> including you guys who I can
talk to anything about this, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's not just here,
it's back home as well. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And I'm just like, I got a
pretty good group of friends. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I feel pretty blessed right now know. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm obviously not gonna
bring it up every conversation. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You can, bring it up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was a bro moment when I'm just like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm glad we're talking
about this now, man. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I want all my friends to feel like </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> they can come to me in trust
and be like, listen, man, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'm really struggling. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like, let's do so let's sit down. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Let's talk about whatever you need, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Whatever you need man, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Let's figure it out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like let's, do it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I want you to be happy (chuckles). </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Mates don't wanna see mates being sad. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh man. </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> as I getting older golf
a bit I'm twenty-five </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and I'm saying that it is. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I noticed it is harder to make friends. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It gets, more difficult
to make good friends </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> because everyone's doing, you know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I feel at that point as well, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> everyone already has their
establishment for France. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And groups and stuff. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And you know, and it's time, man. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I remember when I was growing
up, everyone was just like, </SPEAKER_03>

<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, it is very weird. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's like, time management is a thing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> that you have to learn as
you're growing older as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And like also, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you just don't have as much
energy as you did before. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like it's like your energy
levels do like go down </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> because your patience for. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> Just like just, it dwindles, you know. </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_02> that time is your most precious values. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I know right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - I finally understood after
all the I went to like, oh, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> this is what this means. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - And it's not even like, oh, </SPEAKER_02>

<SPEAKER_01> with my homie to play some games, like... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Anything like but this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like if there's something
that makes me angry nowadays, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it's something that wasted my time. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm literally like, literally, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't have many pet peeves, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but if I feel, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> if I do something and I
feel like I could have been, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I could have used that
hour doing something else. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I that's the biggest
thing that makes me angry. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>

<SPEAKER_01> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Japanese government and
building (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> 20,000 hours of waiting. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I've had a question in my mind. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> That's been haunting me. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - This guy came out of the toilet. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - In the public toilet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And he flushed the toilet as he left. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> When do you flush the toilet? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Because I do you like, because... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, it depends on what you're doing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - You've done it number two. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay.
Number two. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yu have your, you stand up, right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You now have two options. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You can start buckling your belt, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> putting it back up, putting it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> getting metal ready or
you can flush the toilet. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Which one do you do first. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - While standing up? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Because there are some people </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> who flush while they sit. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - That ain't right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, you just typhoon in your, water. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like that's terrible. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Well, the circumstance
upon which you are allowed, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I will give the past to be
able to flush the toilet while </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> still sitting on it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You know, that smell is so bad that you, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> your cheeks are the only thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> Keeping it in. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I Personally stand up first when I flush. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Obviously you can 'cause
you're human beings. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - I'm not (indistinct). </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Do you then, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So let's say you've unbuckled, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Your pets. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> 'Cause you obviously
you've unbuckled them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Why? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> This has been burning on my
mind because this man did it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> He clearly right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He clearly got up, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> did his pants and then
flushed the toilet and left. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - But which one do you do first? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause sometimes I immediately, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I just close the thing, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> flush and then something up my pants. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I buckle up my pants first. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I buckle up my pants first. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Then flush that leak. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Why am I the weird one? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> What happened in my childhood? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like, it's weird. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Like the way you do it is weird </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> because it's that means
you're literally standing </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there flushing the toilet with the pants. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So like this right pants here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll simulate it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I'll simulate it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Say it's like this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, okay, close the lid, flush. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then I do this while it's flushing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - But your pants down, right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - No. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well then that's exact thing. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right when I'm like this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I come up and then as I'm getting up, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I kind of like pull it
up to the point of light. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like, it's that? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But I just gotta zip
it up and do the belt. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You don't have you understand what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You want to send what I mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - No (laughs). </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I fail to see the difference. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> What's the difference? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - What'd you mean? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like what's the difference </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> between the way you do it and the </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> way I do it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So, when I stand up... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I like to have a
conversation has gone to or. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I just sold the cafe. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - We just, had like the
deepest therapy session. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - How do you flush (indistinct). </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - This has been on my
mind for like three days. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> I just saw someone did it... </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I need a therapy
session off this conversation. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - All right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So, I stand up right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And I picture it right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Anyone with any pants doing this? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> You pull it up right now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's a moment where you can now decide </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to wear your pants up. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> You're standing up your hands on, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> are free for a moment </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you can choose to then move your hands </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> to the zipper and the belt
to fully close your pants. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Or you can flush the toilet. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - I choose to choose to flush. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Oh, I choose to do my
pants and then flush. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like how do we develop these behaviors? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> That's what I want to know. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What makes us, why do we do this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - (laughs) It's deep. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's because I would like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> before I flush the flush, right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> Is the, signal that I
have finished everything. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Like, 'cause here's the thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Here's the thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Sometimes, you're in a public toilet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I hate the people who like flush. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like sometimes you're desperate. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You're just like, God, I need to go now. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And you're waiting for something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to come out of the toilets </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and here the flush right here, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> the flush, or you're just like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> all right, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> they're coming out and let's stay in there </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> for another five minutes
doing God knows what. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> - The flushes, like a Pavlovian. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like, you hear the flush. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> It's all ready to, it just doesn't happen. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - It's just like, if you flush, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> you better be coming out of that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> If you flush, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> there must be a ten second window </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> where you have to get out the toilet. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You're signaling the end of your. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> That's why I want to be fully
ready to get out the moment </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I flushed. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I saw a sprint, man, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I don't want to keep you guys waiting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm just wondering, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> is there something in my brain </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> that makes me decide to do that first? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're just trolling. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Aren't you? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - I do wonder this like psychoanalyze. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You're like, I want to take my time. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Like little things I do. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I wonder like, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> why do I do like that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Why do I do those things? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Maybe it's a habit you
had since you were a kid. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Maybe. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like maybe when. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - You, did you notice
this in the first place. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I noticed that this guy immediately left </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> after he flush. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And I thought to myself, I hold on. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I do like to flush and then
take a moment and just kind of. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, you're the one
person I would hate to be. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - You're that awesome
like, give me five minutes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - The total giant social time. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Doesn't change. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But the perception of time changes. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - So you it's 10 seconds </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> after you flush to us
it's 10 minutes (laughs). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Overall. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It's the same time I'm spending in there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So it doesn't matter. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> You're going to get into this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - So to me, if you don't leave the toilet, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> by the time the flush is finished, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> then you are taking too long. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> That is the ESCO, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> That is, the. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> - Because you will sorry </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> if we covered this on channel before. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know if we have, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> how do you prove in public bathrooms? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Do you care about that? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We haven't. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I remember in school, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I was always the weird one </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> because I didn't mind
pooping in the toilets, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> but I also was like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> what am I going to do? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like to me, it is like a
last resort ruby toilet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yes, yes. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I've seen crime. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It seems less messy
than that (indistinct). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - One thing I do remember now
that we're talking about this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> When I was back in London, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> I went to, I needed the toilet </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> before I got my train and Euston station. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Now one thing about Euston
station in London is that it's </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> probably one of the dirtier train station. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> They'd say. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - It's definitely one of the
rougher looking stations. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It doesn't look as nice. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - As this train stations
aren't already dirty. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Well, I've been King's
cross is pretty nice. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - It looks pretty fancy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I'd say. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - One thing, I noticed
after going back was like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> compared to Japan, everything's
doing train stations. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (Joey and Garnt laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's true. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Train stations. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Suck in the UK. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Then you don't find out
what platform your train </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> is on in Houston until
like five minutes before. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So everyone's just standing there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then when the thing
comes up, everyone's rushing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's like, why don't
you just tell me it before? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And then I guess there's
some system on their end </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> where they don't know it's stupid. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They should know. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They should figure this out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Come on, figure it out. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> But, so I went to the
toilet in Houston station </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and this was absolute war crimes. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm sure some Geneva
conventions are broken. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Then this toilet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - There was no toilet seat in this toilet. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - This was just the bowl. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - It was just the bowl. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've seen that before. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - And I thought it must be a mistake. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I went to, I refuse to go in this one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was very busy. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I might... </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - (indistinct) someone steal
the lid or something devious. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like you notice I go to the next one. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's the same thing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I go to the next world. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> And then now there is now
there is a toilet seat, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but there is like, it is, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it is like something has happened in here. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Not only is the smell apparent, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but like there is like four
pieces of toilet tissue left. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And it's that horrible, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> horrible system of like one tissue </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that they ration out
that you have to, like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> you have to pull out 50 to
get one wipe with anyway. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like, what's wrong with you people? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I get it that you don't want
me to take a out of the role. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I understand that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> But why do you have to make
it such a small amount? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like I, and it's always like half apply. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's like, if I held this up, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I could see through it </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> and navigate perfectly in a car and a car. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - So there's this toilet seat. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Oh, it's terrible. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And then not only that, when you leave it, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> I hate when Polly bathrooms do this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> They don't have any soap anywhere. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No soap, no way to dry your hands. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it's like, are you, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> you're just telling me not to dry. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You're not telling, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> you're just asking me
not to wash my hands. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah.
- yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like, so I go there, I do the obligatory, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> put water on my hands and
leave and I feel dirty stuff. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> My hands are wet. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I can't dry that I'm depressed. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> Not only was there stains
all over this thing, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> that stunk is terrible. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Shocking. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> How do they not keep these toilets clean? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I don't understand. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - And it's just not getting paid enough. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - You have one job and it just
literally to keep them clean. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't think there's
anything else you need to do </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> in the toilets. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, the thing is that's
why I don't in public, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I mean, it's, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> there is a big difference
between the toilets, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> the toilets in Japan versus
the toilets in the UK. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> - Right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I mean, as you mentioned last week, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> the first thing you noticed </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is things are a lot dirtier in the UK. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Well, after you've been living in Japan </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> for like this long, right? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Oh, I remembered another story. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - Go for it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Go for it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Sorry. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I went to this toilet in a coven garden. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So I went to a coffee shop. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Coffee shop was too small. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> They didn't have their own toilet. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> They used a toilet in coven garden </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> that was connected to the church. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And it was 30 Penn center. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> It's about 50 cents maybe. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - And- </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - How much were you guys
charged for toilets. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> This toilet was, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> it was like, entering some sewer level </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and a video game going down these stairs. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So it was in the stairs down. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You just go on the street level, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you have to go down this
really looking 1800s </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> at architecture. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You get to this like this I'm
kind of Cove looking thing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It's, this Archway. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And again, it looks like from something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> out of the 1800s that was never replaced. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- [Joey] yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Which is amazing, great architecture. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Whoops. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - But this is then this is turnstile </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and it is the most disgusting color </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> of orange green wall
that you've ever seen. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And the lights are flickering and yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - It sounds like you're about
to enter a Doxil the level. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - And I'm near certain, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm the only person on earth </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> who actually pay to get in </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because the moment I got it, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I got in two guys just jumped after me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - So I go in here. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And only one of the stalls is open. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I go in there and I
to do my business now, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> unfortunately that was only </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> like two sheets of toilet roll life. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So I was already, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> it was already a bad time by the time. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And there was no bad day, obviously. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Tragedy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So my never quite felt clean. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So I was constantly, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was also struggling with
that every single day. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I definitely felt my was not
clean that January you joked. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But I walked in on many
days thinking like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> holy and need you to
bring a portable today. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- [Joey] yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - So I'm in this thing, right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm hearing noises from the
two stalls and I'm like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's not a big deal. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's not a big deal. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And then this guy drops a can. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> They're kind of ominously
rolls into my store </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> and it's a kind of Guinness </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I kind of like kick it back
and I'm like, there you go. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> He's like, "Cheers." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, hello? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm like, okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he's like, it's a
nice day to day in it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I'm like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you talking to me while
I'm in the middle of this. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Like, I me he's like, "Who
else would I be talking to?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm like, "I don't know." </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm like what? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And I'm just confused. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I'm like, yeah, it's nice. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So I go out and these two guys come out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> One of them is homeless. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And one of them just looks like, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know who this guy is. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> He doesn't look homeless. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But one of the other
guys is clearly homeless. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> 'Cause his stall was just
had his sleeping bag in it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - And I was like, "What
on earth is going on?" </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And the guy was like, "You
didn't actually pay for it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> Did you?" </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I was like, "Yeah, I did." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And he was like, "Oh, you're a ticket." </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then washed his hands and left. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then the other guy just stared at me. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> this is the most comfortable
toilet experience I've had. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was just happy. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Oh God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I thought I was gonna die. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And then I was like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> okay, I'm just going to go through. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> And I just worked the toured
sandwich of depressed, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> like some kind of emergency
meeting button X to get out. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It was horrible. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - The kicking back the Guinness </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> can just sounds like an event in a game. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was wait, this is how
you activate the store. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I heard something drop. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - And then it had that really
ominous noise of rolling came </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> over and I was like, kicking it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> like take it back. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't bunch with kidneys. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Man] It's a side quest in Yakuza. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because the side quest. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> - I, this short I'll take a. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> - Jesus. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - If there's one place, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I don't want to have a conversation. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's on the not, not, not, you know, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> maybe if we're in some kind of
Ritz, Carlton, toilet, wets, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> it's amazing hand towels. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Connor and Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You know, when you're in a fancy place, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that's their tissues. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's towels. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> There's a pile of towels
to wash your hands. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That's actually how my day is, how is it? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm just enjoying the fun
selection of towels, SERPs, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> and moisture. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> And it looks, you know, it's great. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That then talks to me (laughs). </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But when I'm in the
sketchiest toilet in London, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> no thank you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - (indistinct) next to you. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I didn't know. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> This guy had his whole set up in there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was like, oh my God. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I've been like, I don't know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know if that's okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> But I mean, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm glad you've got some accommodation </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> for now, but like, me. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Jesus Christ. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Scary. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> And I just didn't know
why they called me a. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I paid for it. I should
I be a good citizen? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Know someone has to stock the toilet paper </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> or else they're gonna afford it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - That's the only like
bad public toilet stories </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> that has happened to you because like... </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like when I went back. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, when you went back, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> that's why you just don't in public. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> In the UK, at least in Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Okay. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> No, no, it's not. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> No, it's not in Japan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There is a common phenomenon in Japan. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If you go to some places at night, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> there was a big thing where
dudes try and watch your PP. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> If you've had, have you
seen the videos on Twitter? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - No. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You've seen them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There's loads of videos, right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> In certain areas. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I think there are very, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> more likely to happen. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> There's videos of dudes
like jacking off in urinals, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> like right next to other guys. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You're just seeing this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - [Man] No. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I mean, I've heard stories about this. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've seen this on Twitter. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I'm not Surprised by this. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - I've never been a lot
of stories of like dudes, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> like, looking at it and
stopping, looking at it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And that's apparently
somewhat common in Japan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I mean, I'm not surprised at all. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> This is Japan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Common. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It is also, you know what I mean? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> When you, kind of treat your treat, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> gay people kind of harshly here. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Just stuff like that. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I guess they have no choice. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Joey] Exactly. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Don't feel comfortable, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> but it's still strange. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - I've had friends who
had happened to hear. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> - Really? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Well they've just started like pull it out </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and going at it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Sorry. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> In which, areas I want to know. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Okay, well I'm sketchy parts sheets. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> There are some sketchy parts in Shinjuku. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - I have seen, there has
been a couple of instances </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> where I have seen dudes
in public jacking it. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah, they do it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> It's not weird. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> It's not always, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> it's not unusual to see. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Unfortunately it's not unusual to see. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_02> And it's definitely scarring. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Having a Georgie Strausser Shinjuku. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> And then it's like, oh, just
jacking in the alleyway. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - We don't normally hang out </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> at those like kind of like establishment. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> So it doesn't really
surprise me that area. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> But like, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I mean most public toilets
in Japan are like cleaner </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> than like most people's private toilets. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's rediculars. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_00> Like the concept of clean
public toilets didn't exist </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> in my mind until I went to Japan. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I'm just like, wait. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've seen some really
dirty ones in Japan. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> Occasionally there is some way. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Occasionally it happens. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> But normally you never
see clean public toilets, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> especially in England and
especially in Thailand as well. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> My God Southeast Asia. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> I achieve. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Wait, wait, wait. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I actually realized going back why? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I don't like days. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Right? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And it's because I realized, oh, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I've grown up my entire
life with birthdays </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> because Southeast Asia
have their own days. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Man] What? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But okay. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Because, but in Southeast Asia, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> we have this thing that, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> which we call a bad day, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> but it's not a bad day. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's a hose. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> All right. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> So. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Now I'm civilised. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - (indistinct) in Japan,
you have (laughs). </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Toshiba's system, the measures, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> the moisture of your to
deliver the perfect blend. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So read the reason I
hate the feeling of bodies </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> is because my entire life </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I've had like Southeast Asian bodies, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> which is just like every
toilet has like this hose. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You know, how in the
buddies in Japan is like </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> this precision sniper. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I was being shot at your hole. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> It's not political down. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> (Garnt and Joey laughing) </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - In Southeast Asia, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you have this host put a shotgun. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> It's like a shotgun </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> that you shot gun your entire house. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - How did you use this? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> If you're like, you know, you're, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> are you on the toilet? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - You're on a toilet slow. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So you have to like put
the hose between your legs. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Which is still weird. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Man] It's like, what
the fuck is the wet? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> Why is it always wet? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't want to be
reminded of a theme park </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> when I'm going to the toilet. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't want that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - And so like a lot of public
toilets in Southeast Asia, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> you see the toilet seat and it's wet </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> and it's not wet from. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It's just wet from the day. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Right. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> And so that's why, that's what I, like. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> I think I've been grained
that into my mind to be like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> yeah, that feeling of water on your. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> That's bad feeling. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - I've tried to I've. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> I like how we've just managed to go </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> from deep to the again. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> I apologize. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I'm sure we'll run out of
topics to talk about with this. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Eventually I, in Japan, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> sometimes you do come
across the old style toilets </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_02> of Japanese starlets. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Have you ever used them? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> The waspy toilet? </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Well, I'll talk you about it. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> So it was you just AKA
a hole in the ground </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_00> and you squat over it and you just do it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Now I have used it one time </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> and I just could not get over the feeling </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that I was just kind of dropping something </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> that was just going to splash everywhere. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- [Joey] yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - And I could not get over that feeling. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was squatting real low, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> but I just, I couldn't, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I did not enjoy it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> It was not fun. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - What I hate about those. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> 'Cause I've had to use
that plenty of times </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> as well in Southeast Asia. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> Especially like, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> especially if you're on a long drive. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Connor] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Like if you, need to your business, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> every public toilet, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> is that holding on the ground. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - If, it came to it and the only option </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_01> I had is that a hole in the ground? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm sure I'm in a hole in the ground. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah.
- [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Can I have it? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I bought, if I can, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> I will obviously go for the premium wall </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> mass bid day blasting. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What temperature moistening experience </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> any day of the week I would choose. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - The thing that makes
me most uncomfortable </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> is like with a normal toilets. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> There's the seat. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And the seat is like a safety barrier, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> nothing penetrates this barrier. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Right? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - So I liked that. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> I couldn't miss. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> I've never missed the toilet. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Hey bro. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> You have to play like
mini-golf we're there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> But like if you miss the whole, </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> he got to clean that up. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> - Total paper and scoop it in. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> What happens. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Does anyone know? </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Is Eric, is there a courageous? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You don't miss. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - I have gone 25 years or
probably like 23 without missing. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> I'm very happy to keep my streak alive. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't want to even attempt to miss. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> And also I just like
sitting down I'm lazy. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Yeah.
- Yeah. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> - I don't like that. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_02> You know, you you're propping yourself up </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> with your own legs. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause if you don't
then, and you fall over. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I don't do exercise. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Supposedly it's supposed
to be better to squat. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Like just like, that's what I say. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> It's less likely you're
going to get hemorrhoids </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and (indistinct). </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - But if we just stop at McDonald's, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> but I still do a lot of things
that are better for me that. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - True, true. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Why did we get on this topic? </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> (all laughing) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - I'm so sorry. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> This is my fault. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> I was just, he was on my mind. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> Okay. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> And I thought, I didn't
bring it up (indistinct) </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_02> - Was it on your mind this entire time. </SPEAKER_02>
<SPEAKER_03> - Spent on mindful of three days, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I saw the men do it and I
woke up thinking about it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - I'm also very used to just like </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> in a hole in the ground </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_04> from like going camping in Australia </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> because (indistinct) we have long drops </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> and it's just like, it's literally. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, that's just, well,
she just do that anyway. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - But when you're camping,
you have no choice. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Because it's a hole in the ground. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But it's like, it's not like
a shallow hole in the ground. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> And it's like a real deep hole. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh, really should dig. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> When we used to go camping, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> we'd dig up tiny hole and fill it up. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> Those ones where it's like. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> - What are you doing? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - No, no, no, no, no. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It's like ones that have
built into the campsite. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - Like in a cabin. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Oh, they made an outhouse, </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - Yeah, like an outhouse space. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Outhouse. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> But it's like a wooden log cabin </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> and you walk in and
it's just a whole, it's. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - An outhouse. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> - And you like put your
torch in it and it's like, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> you can't see the bottom. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> (indistinct) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That's an outhouse. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_03> Yeah, exactly. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> And yeah, I had to do those. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - Okay. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> This is the worst experience of my life. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> All right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So picture it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You're skiing. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You have those ski boots home. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - All right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So have you ever have you want ski boots? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Actually. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - [Man] Oh, yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - It is impossible to
have precision movement </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> in the ski boots. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - You also like a roadblocks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So you do, you bought
like you're in roadblocks. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> (Connor chuckles) </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> So the only option at this
particular skiing place </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> for some reason was a port-a-potty. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Okay. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Can you imagine a
port-a-potty in ski boots? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It doesn't work, right? </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> - 'Cause you need to sit down. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You got to aim yourself. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> You gotta have room to close the door. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> Right. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> That was bad enough that it
was a port-a-potty I thought, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> oh my God, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I gotta get used a port-a-potty </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_03> and ski thing and ski boots. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh my God. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I get in this Porter potty. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I think it was in, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> might've been Bulgaria. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - [Joey] Yeah. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - I get in this Porter potty. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't know how this has happened. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There is, toilet roll with on it, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> on the roof, on the sides. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_00> On every, it looks like
some kind of someone </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> has tried to do you use </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> like ancient talismans
of on this port-a-potty </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> to get spirits away. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> It is. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I immediately threw up
when I got in there. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> - [Garnt] Yeah. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - Because I was still
needed to go somewhere. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I stuck with it. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> But right after I was done, I threw up, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> it was so disgusting. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I'd never seen anything like it, </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_00> I was, it was almost like a trap </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_04> that they put that for tourists. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Joey laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> There was like, you,
tourists coming to our place. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It was horrible, man. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> You go into this thing. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> It's tiny. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Right? </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - You can barely sit there. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> Your ski boots, belly fitted. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So your knees are touching the door. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> That also has on them. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I don't know how that
would happen to this day. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> I still don't know why. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> - They should apologize viewers. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> You have to listen to this. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - It's disgusting. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> It was, oh God. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_00> - That's what my thoughts were. </SPEAKER_00>
<SPEAKER_01> Like. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's why, I flushed the toilet down. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> - That's why, that's why I never shot. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> Like when I was in high school too. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> 'Cause like my high school, </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_04> because I went to an all boys school. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Yeah. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> - Right. </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> So obviously there's
going to be some afoot, </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> (Garnt laughs) </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_04> like in places where there's going to be </SPEAKER_04>
<SPEAKER_01> in places where they shouldn't be. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - That was always the pranks were there. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_01> - There was always the pranks. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_01> And I'm like guys like
where we're not animals. </SPEAKER_01>
<SPEAKER_03> - The people shooting in urinals. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> - Oh dude. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> I don't think there was ever a day </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> where I went to the urinal. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> There wasn't in it. </SPEAKER_03>
<SPEAKER_03> Like it was actually discussed. </SPEAKER_03>
